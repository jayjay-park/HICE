The second thing is what happens simply because thats how it was oriented when it was put up there.If you want the first thing to happen you have to impart a spin on the rocket.Meaning this in orbit Low Earth Orbit like where the ISS lives you go around once every  minutes.  If you had no spin you would move around like the nd picture you posted.  The ISS has a cupola which is awesome that looks down at Earth.  It always looks at Earth because the ISS is spinning once every  minutes.  Therefore it always points down.Rockets and satellites and suchlike do this because theyre artificially made to do this.

303642,0,t3_1xk86z,Looking at a computer screen all day can infact worsen your vision. Having the same visual posture day after day with little to no fluctuation will worsen your vision whether it is looking at a computer screen sewing tiny stitches or reading books. However the OD that I work for says that  hour on the computer screen is visually equivalent to  hours of reading so take that as you will.Here is why There is an accommodation system in your eyes that adjusts to clear images at the specific distance that you are looking at. The muscles in this system just like any other muscle in you body naturally lose flexibility as you age. They also lose flexibility if they are not flexed enough. So if you spend all day with your accommodation system flexed to clearly see the computer screen it becomes comfortable there but will eventually have a hard time flexing to other positions this is when your vision begins to worsen. Through this lack of flexing you have caused yourself to go nearsighted. To prevent this all you have to do is take breaks that allow your eyes to adjust to different distances. At my work we use the  rule. Every  minutes of near worklook  feet awayfor  seconds. This simple rule can not only keep your eyes flexible it allows your brain time to recharge.,NoStupidQuestions,cfc8m9x,3,t5_2w844

If for instance Nvidia wants to use it to show off the strength of their latest GPU itll set them back .

822871,0,t3_23jb1w,When I was shopping for a new pair of headphones recently this happened with almost all the sample sets. If I pressed the button it seemed to boost the bass and make everything sound much better. I asked the sales guy about it because it seemed weird. He had a look and it turned out that through such frequent use the wires in the headphones had become damaged and it just happened to help the wires connect properly when you put a little pressure on the cord. So basically your headphone cord is probably a bit damaged and when you press the button down it helps connect things again. ,NoStupidQuestions,cgxt95x,3,t5_2w844

Though once the body fights one it begins fighting them all so their debuffs or the symptoms of multiple strains would never be seen.

826108,0,t3_23kn1n,Im a history major so I might be able to bring a different perspective than most to this. What you need to understand is that history as a field is young really only being a properly defined field of study for little over  years now. However over the course of that weve seen  or  different schools of thought take hold all wildly different. Generations of historians with opinions wildly different from their peers just  years earlier or later. For the better part of history since Columbus he was seen really only as the discoverer of America. No one cared or really even knew about the genocides he was directly and indirectly responsible for. It wasnt until the s and s that a new left school took hold and encouraged the study of more nontraditional subjects. Womens studies African history black studies Latin American studies and Native America  studies. This school educated the next waves of historians and history teachers who then went on  to educate the next wave of American youths. However that only really began in the s and s and is still a long way from being completed. Most adults therefore are still really unaware of what Columbus truly did and thus havent felt the need to fix the offensive nature of the holiday. If it ever does happen which is tough to say for certain it wont be for at least  years when we finally see the results of new left educators begin to take power. ,NoStupidQuestions,cgy6hn7,4,t5_2w844

It doesnt fall down yet though because the force of the gravity on that droplet isnt as great as the adhesion force of the droplet to the dropper. When you keep squeezing the droplet grows in mass and gravity gets a stronger pull. At a certain point the gravity is going to surpass the adhesion force and the droplet will fall.

Then as uMistyK mentioned the fossilization process is pretty rare due to the requirements so you might then only find a few of the bones that fossilized even though the entire skeleton was at one time all in the same general area.More complete skeletons are usually found due to some sort of natural disaster such as a mudslide burying the creature all at once without a chance for it to be scavenged.

1201429,0,t3_27umzx,No buying a purebred dog is risky. Keep in mind that virtually any animal including people are more robust healthier and develop better with a more diverse genetic background. Ever wonder why you should not marry your sister? Wonder why marrying your cousin is frownedupon? Its to maintain genetic diversity. Purebred dogs often have genetic development and health problems. A purebred is by nature a dog with a relatively narrow amount of genetic diversity. This is a result of many generations of breeding animals for certain traits. Often those dogs with desirable traits are bred a lot and produce a lot of offspring. Other dogs that are considered less desirable are not bred at all. This means that many breeds are continuously reducing the genetic diversity and increasing health problems. Take the pug for example.There are about  purebred pugs around the world but they have been so inbred that they are genetically almost identical. Their genetic diversity is equal to about  individual dogs. This is not enough to keep a breed healthy. We may get to a point that a purebred pug will not be a viable animal. They all will have issues. Another example is the German Shepherd. Inbreeding shepherds for specific traits like big pointy ears long back and sloping hips means that almost all purebred shepherds suffer from hip displaysia problems and many suffer from neurological problems that prevent them from coordinating movement properly. Interestingly apparently policework German Shepherds actually look a bit different than the ordinary ones because they are bred to work and not bred for appearance. The police German shepherds are healthier than the regular ones. Some health problems of purebred dogs are frightening. Many King Charles spaniels have a horrible cranial development problem where the skull does not grow large enough for to accommodate the dogs brain. These dogs die a horrible painful death unless they are put down. So get  a mutt. All things considered equal they are healthier smarter and longerlived.

1267463,0,t3_28lly9,Malaria is caused by a few species of protozoa who start out their lives in the liver of most notably humans. They float around in blood cells of that infected human until one lucky mosquito comes along and takes a drink. Now that mosquito has a belly full of malaria protozoa. In the insect the male and female protozoa get it on and the resulting little ones get into the bugs saliva. Then the mosquito takes a bite of human  and congratulations! You now have malaria protozoa inside of you! Wikipedia has a good image representation of this cycle.Mosquitoes are a type of insect vector they can carry diseases between one source and the next but they have to get that disease somewhere first. This is why you wouldnt normally hear of cases in England there arent enough cases to allow for mosquitoesbased infections to be as rampant as in tropical areas. There have been cases of it in England before and in many first world countries but we are more capable of controlling mosquitoes and treating malaria than third world countries are both technologically and monetarily so it isnt usually something we need to worry about.As for why it specifically is in tropical areas such as central Africa South America and southern Asia it is a combination of two things the abundance of mosquito breeding grounds and the governments inability to control their population.Since there has not been a vaccine successfully created to combat malaria controlling the mosquito population through insecticides radiation and other means is really the only way to prevent its spread. A lot of the areas affected by malaria outbreaks are economically struggling and cant afford any efficient method or is so widespread and rural that none of todays current methods are even remotely possible.Mosquitoes breed in any standing water they can find and you can imagine that that in rain forests or opentopped wells or in watering holes that they just have a hay day and pop out larvae all over the place. So rural areas are absolutely infested with the things. And in urban areas its not much better. Developed countries can keep our water indoors and flowing and frequently emptyrefill bird feeders or other outdoor water sources but in third world countries where clean water is harder to come by they dont have that option. And mosquitoes love it.So TLDR version is there is not much malaria in England because of a lack of hosts more reliable mosquito control and fewer mosquitoes overall.Source Took a random elective last semester of university on the relationship between insects and human society.

1389465,0,t3_2a0911,This question is better suited to rAskSocialScience but Ill give a brief overview. Gross Domestic Product defined as Y is the sum of all consumer spending C all investment spending I all government spending G and the value of the net exports NX in an economy over a given period of time. As an identity    C  I  G  NX  Y     Y is taken as a measure of the health of an economy because as a general if not universal rule if any of the three terms on the left side of that identity increase thereby increasing Y there will be more demand for goods and services thereby increasing the demand for labour and decreasing unemployment which is for obvious reasons desirable. GDP is not intended to be a measure of the economic wellbeing of any one household but of the economy as a whole and even by that standard it is only marginally useful on its own which is distinct from standardofliving. GDP is not and had never been a measure of standardofliving but is often used as an indicator of standardofliving. This means that yes there are scenarios where GDP should not be used in such a context. Based only on the information in your examples and nothing else even though both families have the same takehome income and amount of leisure time assuming the housework is roughly equal in terms of time cost the moneywage job the economy of Family s country is healthier. In Family s economy more money is being spent by consumers C has increased which by definition grows GDP and usually creates a greater demand for labour. If one person in Family  wanted to quit their job fire the maid and become a homemaker they could. The same is true in reverse for Family . Because neither of them do so we can assume they are both be equally happy with the arrangement. Once we accept this it becomes clear that the only difference between the two worlds is the inclusion of the maid into Family s life. It is not perfectly clear that the maid could have found work elsewhere but it is clear that the maid wants to work for Family  so the safe assumption to make is that Family s increased spending has allowed at least one additional person become happier than they would have been otherwise. The maid will then because maids do not make much money and so are likely to spend most of it spend her earnings elsewhere prompting an even greater demand for labour and lowering unemployment even further by immeasurably small amounts of coursethis mechanism would be repeated hundreds of thousands of times over for a much greater aggregate effect. ,NoStupidQuestions,ciqg8uk,2,t5_2w844

Both respiration and circulation are under primary autonomic control with some voluntary modulation.In actuality you cannot stop your breathing indefinitely.

1474422,0,t3_2b27f9,I think its a pretty normal consequence of having empathy to feel bad for someone who lacks some of the virtues which are important to you.You should remember though  that not everyone who is unhealthy or fat is unhappy. Sure many of them are if they live in a culture which values being thin but there are peoplecultures all over the world who would prefer to be heavy than thin.  Feeling bad for someone who is overweight requires the underlying assumption that they share your same set of values as you do.  Im a very healthyactive person and when I see someone at the gym who is hyperfit I feel the same way you describe how you feel when you see an overweight person.  I feel that way because I imagine that they are exercising to overcome some deeprooted insecurity that wont really be addressed by changing how they look.  But in my case that is probably projecting  because Im kinda that way  and I know that I wouldnt be happy if the way I looked wasnt well above average.       In a lot of ways I envy people who can be generally happy people while also being overweight  I would probably be so so depressed that I wouldnt leave the house.  The underlying logic being that if someone who is overweight really valued being thin they would find a way to become thin  and because they arent thin they probably have other things in their life that they derive happiness from which make them happy enough that they dont worry too much about being overweight.I guess that was all a long way of saying that the way you feel when you view other people probably has more to do with you and your frame of reference than their actual life experience  and I thats OK as long as you arent a jerk about it. Sorry for using so many words  I hope that helps though.,NoStupidQuestions,cj13dpy,3,t5_2w844

1509943,0,t3_2bgsfx,There are some technical reasons which make it a bit hard to guarantee speeds.For many internet types especially the ones over telephone lines the maximum speed depends a lot on the quality of the connection and the distance from the next distribution point.Since this last mile can be quite old and expensive to replace the quality can vary greatly even between houses on the same street. The settings necessary for the best connection can also vary a lot. And even with optimal settings the speed can still change depending on the weather.Now the best way to handle this would be to measure the customers line before they sign a contract and tell them what maximum speeds they can expect. This would come with a lot of headaches Each additional type of contract brings up legal and administrative overhead If your line has a max speed of  Mbit but they only offer Mbit and Mbit speeds they cant sell you the  Mbit plan so will you be limited to  Mbit even though you could go faster? Many companies really dont like giving away something for free If your speed can change depending on the weather should they go with a worst case or a best case scenario? Often it is only possible to measure the line quality with the modem installed. They dont want to give out the equipment without a contract.With other connection types most notably cable the connection is actually shared among multiple customers. So if no one else is using the internet your connection will be faster.Since higher numbers sell better the companies usually take the best case result and advertise up to  Mbs. Which sounds a lot better than Anywhere between .Mbs and Mbs depending on line quality other users the weather and the mood of divine beings.,NoStupidQuestions,cj5jp9w,1,t5_2w844

1518346,0,t3_2blx1m,Yes.  While its not immoral it is illegal although you could probably get out of it if you showed that you were only downloading the music that you had bought physical copies of.  Thats up to the company prosecuting the copyright violation though and they arent known for their mercy.When you buy a copy of a piece of media you do not own the musicvideo itself.  What you buy is a licence to use it under certain circumstances which usually includes watchinglistening to it and often making a backup.  The licence you get does not allow you to download the musicvideo from somewhere else.  Even though this accomplishes the same ends as making a backup it is a different action and is not allowed under the licence.Torrenting is also a complicated case since torrenting usually involves both downloading from others and uploading.  Uploading is certainly not allowed and you cannot even pass it off as being similar to an allowed act under the license.  If you are uploading in addition to downloading then the company coming after you for copyright violation is well within their rights although the punishments here are quite ludicrous. ,NoStupidQuestions,cj6lnz8,6,t5_2w844

1536858,0,t1_cj8vdf7,Im going to have to disagreeexpound upon with a few things heregt What appears on screen in the final version of the film is their vision for it.This is actually not true for most directors which is why there is a such thing as directors cuts. Unless the director has it in their contract that they get final cut the final version of the film is honestly up to studio execs and the producers. The director obviously has a lot of say but their vision doesnt always get across the way they want it to.gt Producers are sort of like quality control.Not sure how specific an answer OP wanted but this entire paragraph is encompassing the duties of several different job titles. If you watch the end of movie credits you will notice that there are producers executive producers line producers coproducers and often associate producers.The people who get the produced by credit are actually creative producers and are usually the only people involved in a movie from start to finish. There are a million and a half ways to get a project off the ground but it usually starts with a producer either finding a project independently or getting assigned a project from a studio they then hire writers a director and deal with the agencies for packaging and development. From there theyre heavily involved with preproduction are often onset review every edit of the film and stay with the project through marketing distribution and release. They and the line producers are the ones responsible for keeping the movie on schedule and under budget. The exact logistics of preproduction and production is mainly the line producers job.The executive producers are the moneymen and the big name people who attach themselves to the project to get it some clout during packaging and marketing. A lot of what you said in the paragraph is referring to these people.Coproducers and associate producers can be anyone that somehow contributed to the film. I put that word in quotes because an acquaintance recently told me that one of the associate producers on a film he worked on a while back was the producers mistress. Usually these people tend to be highlyvalued producers assistants and production company execs though.Again not sure if OP wanted this level of detail but I often find that most people dont really know what we in my case amateur film producers do so I like to explain.,NoStupidQuestions,cj8x5ff,1,t5_2w844

1547640,0,t3_2byphf,The energy of the incident photons must be equal or greater to the band gap of the substrate in order for a photovoltaic cell to produce a useful output.The term natural light is meaningless since light may be produced naturally at any frequency from thermal photons all the way up into the realm of gamma radiation. The spectral composition of sunlight is different from that of an incandescent bulb however as we shall see that turns out to be insignificant.The substrate of a solar panel is doped silicon meaning silicon with something else added. Depending upon the doping it is possible to vary the band gap the amount of energy required to excite a photon to the nexthighest possible energy state to create a solar panel that responds optimally at a given frequency.Most commercial solar panels are covered in glass which tends to filter the shorter wavelengths of light down toward the UV. Infrared photons may not have enough energy to overcome the band gap of the substrate.Notwithstanding the spectral composition of both sunlight and incandescent light is adequate to overcome the band gap and produce electricity.The issue with an incandescent bulb is not so much the frequency of the light that it produces but the intensity. Solar irradiance above the atmosphere is about .kWm. Various factors like atmospheric absorption and sun angle reduce that down to around kWm under ideal circumstances by the time the light gets to the surface but the remaining light is still much greater than say a W incandescent bulb which would emit maybe Wm near its surface at a normal charging distance more if the bulb is closer according to the inverse square relationship between distance and irradiance.Since solar panels are at best less than about  efficient you can expect no more than about .Wm from your solar panel under ideal circumstances. Divide that by the fraction of a square meter that is the size of your solar panel to get the actual power output of your panel.The bottom line is that an incandescent bulb will produce a tiny fraction of the power produced by the sun. For a panel capturing the entire output from a w bulb which would be practically impossible and neglecting losses due to heat whose photons have insufficient energy to overcome the band gap the maximum theoretical power available would be about  of that for the same panel facing directly toward the sun on a clear day. The actual power output would be far less.Your device may charge under an incandescent bulb but it may easily take say a hundred times longer to achieve full charge.,NoStupidQuestions,cja9ql7,9,t5_2w844

1653675,0,t3_2da2zw,Had a look I guess youre referring to something like this article from .Note that what happened in that story is that scientists claimed to use bone marrow to create sperm. A woman cannot make herself pregnant  sperm is necessary to fertilize an ovum to create an embryo  this is the only way and no other way is possible. In the case given scientists used stem cells from male bone marrow to grow a sperm  which could then hypothetically be used to fertilize an ovum in a manner similar to IVF.They then hypothesize they could do something similar with a females bone marrow to produce female offspring but it appears thats largely speculation.There are a few issues  whether it really works as tests with animals in the past were not very successful and  whether its too close genetically which is the issue with incest as it can lead to abnormalities.A lot of things like this in science get a great headline but are often reported long before the science is ready for use and often these things dont pan out. I think if it had worked out and been given the ethical green light wed be hearing more about it.Tldr The simple answer to your question is no a woman cannot make herself pregnant. Some research suggested sperm could be created without the use of a man but this has not turned into a viable option yet and may never.,NoStupidQuestions,cjnlxww,8,t5_2w844

1678528,0,t3_2dlswo,If you mean could they get drunk from drinking the blood of a drunk person? No. Randall Munroe talked about this and the conclusion was that the alcohol in all  liters of blood in the human body would account for a shot glass of beer. So you wouldnt even get a buzz unless you perhaps had it with a grapefruit and were particularly sensitive to alcohol. But were talking about vampires. Since we cant exactly interview a vampire about it we dont know for sure. So we can only consult vampire lore. According to The Vampire Diaries yes they do get drunk from drinking alcohol. In True Blood the vampires experience an inebriated effect from fairy blood. I think the question involves vampires immortality and regenerative capabilities. They most certainly wont get cirrhosis because their livers can regenerate. According to at least Marvel with Wolverines healing factor he cant drink enough to actually get drunk because his cells heal any damage done by ethanol.

They would especially gather when my parents filled up the swimming pool during drought its insane how thirsty bees and wasps are bees because many have them but nobody knows to put a wet rag for them to drink without drowning. So I guess that might be a big reason for their aggressiveness. Another popular sport is making plum schnapps in the Autumn which means filling a huge bucket with plum mash and leaving it to ferment in the open. Wasps love that thats when I meet the mammoth wasps. Never got bit by one of those but caught a couple and dissected them and they do have a massive stinger.edit to answer the question I usually got stung while in the swimming pool. A wasp lands on me I get startled try to shake it off not hitting just shaking. They usually sting then.

Feminism isnt some kind of traumatic experience that can happen to people. Things like sexual assault going to war  being in a warzone  domestic violence being robbed.

1883669,0,t3_2g6olv,Its an interesting question which I spent way too much time onIn a sense anything is possible but the question is whether or not it is probable enough to be deemed reasonably possible. Its the orbital teapot idea. It is possible that there is a teapot orbiting between Mars and Saturn but its highly unlikely. The probability is close enough to zero that it may as well be impossible.First thing to note is that it would have to be a huge change to render us completely extinct. In the field of probable contenders are runaway climate change some kind of supervirus widespread nuclear war covering every square kilometre of earth or an asteroid. Note that all of these would not only eliminate humans it would radically and significantly alter the course of the planet. The question is whether or not the planet could return to homeostasis afterwards a climate that could reaccommodate humans or whether or not it would be tipped in to a new state one that is hostile to the evolution of humans.So heres the funny thing  this has already happened before. Remember I mentioned an asteroid as a potential antagonist? The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs literally incinerated the sky the Earth was like a tinderbox at that point. The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was like lighting a match during a global gas leak. I ask you rhetorically  do you see any dinosaurs reevolving?Weve had about five of these mass extinctions and each one has taken millions potentially tens of millions to recover from. When the recovery is over the planet is in a radically new paradigm with very different kinds of species that thrive. Before us mammals it was the dinosaurs before that it was archosaurs and before that it was mostly marine life.It is likely that any event that ended humans would likely cause a new species or class of species to emerge as dominant. This alone would take millions of years. For humans to reemerge if it did occur it would likely take hundreds of millions of years. Even then human on the species level we exist Homosapiens would be very unlikely... but a twolegged toolusing mammal with high intelligence and opposable thumbs? Its certainly not impossible Particularly if theres not much around to eat us!To end on a scary note there are people now arguing that were living through the sixth mass extinction now due to deforestation overpopulation and climate change. The great irony is that we may bring about our own extinction and so create a world that we ourselves cannot survive.,NoStupidQuestions,ckg6ab0,31,t5_2w844

Specifically singing cant as rhyming with Aunt rather than Ant is probably more technically correct. For that matter there are a lot of techniques that are widely employed in pop music which are literally modeled after incorrect technique. To the point that when most people go to vocal training for pop they do like  years of bel canto and only after theyve developed proper technique do they learn the correct way to purposefully emulate the sound of singing with bad technique in a way that wont do long term damage to your voice when youre singing  hours a day every day for a good example of this check out some articles on Belting. So in a weird way British pop singers seem to be emulating techniques developed by heavily trained American singers to sound like untrained American singers.Strange but true.To put it another way theres basically one technically perfect way to sing a piece that any heavily trained singer of any native language would sound like if they were to sing the song but Americans have developed a suite of techniques for purposefully modifying the piece to sound like modern pop music and theres no reason for other regions or Americans for that matter to adopt this. The second nonamericans start adding regional inflections though theyre now doing the same thing weve been doing.EDITModern pop song sung with legitimately poor technique from a technical level link mostly proper technique link and proper technique emulating poor technique linkFrom a subjective standpoint its hard to say which one is best but objectively thats how I understand them to break down.,NoStupidQuestions,ckn175v,0,t5_2w844

Unfortunately consoles have gotten better cheaper and easier to develop for so now we get fewer and fewer big titles and often when we get a port of an Xbox or Playstation game we get it sometimes years later. On top of that the game stores we used to buy them at no longer carry pc stuff and we feel like Mac users  Thats the argument anyway. Most of us also own at least one console Im one of those assholes that buys them all so I dont miss anything so its not as common as it once was. Also a large majority of us have also learned about things like Big Picture mode so we can play pc games like those damn casuals do on our tvs. I honestly find that the hard core complainers are the same people who see a new console game and then pout and cry about it not being ultra hd running at a million frames per second making our eyes bleed.

He calls me into the inner office the next night and blows my brains out before I can even hit the panic button and the swat team rolls in to clean my brains off the carpet.

2076512,0,t3_2in1gh,They dont gain charge they gain voltage which is a difference.A fully charged alkaline battery has a little over .V. As the battery gets emptier the voltage slowly decreases. A completely empty battery has a voltage of .V but most devices need a certain minimum voltage so they will stop working before that.In an idealized battery there is a strict correlation between remaining charge mAh and voltage. So in that case the remote would shut off at one point and never work again with the same set of batteries.But a real battery doesnt work like that. In addition to the slow continuous voltage decrease during discharge theres also an instant voltage drop as soon as theres a load on the battery meaning its in use and has to deliver current. Once the load is off again most of the voltage drop pretty much recovers instantly. But a part of it takes a little longer.So in your example the battery takes a little time to recover from that first button press.Just like a butler who brings you beer from the basement. When hes young he will just run up and down the stairs for you and get as much beer as you want. But then you both grow older hes  and you ask for a beer again. He goes down to the basement and uses all his strength to climb up the stairs with a beer in his hand. The moment he appears at the top of the stairs you ask for another beer but he wont be able to get it. Now you might think that your butler is too old for the job but if you let him rest for a couple of minutes he can bring you one more beer. He doesnt get any younger from his rest he just recovers from that first trip to the basement.,NoStupidQuestions,cl3rq3x,4,t5_2w844

2081382,0,t3_2ipqyq,It depends on the specific cards and the specific tournaments. MTG has a few basic types of tournaments which are mostly broken down by which sets of cards are legal.Vintage means pretty much anything is legit. However there are are many cards which are restricted  limited to one per deck as opposed to  per deck for most cards basic lands are unlimited. A few other cards are banned outright these are mostly ante cards which were an abandoned concept from early in the game.Legacy means the same as Vintage but everything thats restricted in Vintage is banned. Plus there may be a few other banned cards.Modern means everything that has been printed in the current style card frame  essentially everything from th Edition  to the present. There are some cards explicitly banned for game balance.Standard means everything from the most recent two blocks and core sets  a block is currently three sets with a big set and two little sets though theyre changing this in a couple years. It essentially means everything in the last two years and it changes regularly. Banning cards in Standard is rare but it does happen on occasion.So your AlphaBeta cards could be used in Vintage and Legacy but might not be legal in Modern or Standard. However  any card which has been reprinted in a legal set is legal even if you have an older version. So for example if you have a Betaedition Serra Angel and Serra Angel is Standard Legal which it is then you can play your Betaedition Serra Angel.Edit You can get more complete information here ,NoStupidQuestions,cl4e0x4,6,t5_2w844

What are ancient are their techniques. Tae Kwon Do contains a huge variety of strikes and kicks but the art itself wasnt invented until after World War II. Some forms of Kung Fu can trace their lineages much further back and although the art existed for much longer many of the techniques used in Tae Kwon Do were probably known at least as far back as the earliest known martial arts. I suspect that European fighting arts may have had a broad set of techniques like the Asian arts except that no styles were ever created to preserve them. ,NoStupidQuestions,clax2kl,1,t5_2w844

And the claim needs to be proven so for example I dont consider drunk sex they regret to be rape regardless of gender or age. But context only extends so far. Should every criminal be killed? Of course not. Im sure plenty of people that didnt deserve it have been executed or put in prison no system is perfect.But some people arent worth the trouble. Kill someone to protect yourself? Fine. Kill someone for their money? No. That makes you scum. I understand economic problems but murder for no real reason isnt condonable.

2157034,0,t3_2jpqqa,I checked out the article and my main concern based solely off the article is that therere no links or references to studies saying that drinking water helps prevent liver cancer.  There are all sorts of health fads that go around and this sounds like its just another one.  I generally dont start to pay attention to things until articles start appearing in research journals or the mainstream media.  Considering that the article is from  there should have been some media coverage if it truly looked like a promising line of research.Also instead of telling us exactly what drinking water is supposed to do liver prevention  what?  And what type of liver damage? or providing direct links to the material that supports hisher position OP simply says Hey google this phrase for a shocking medical discovery and youll find out what Im talking about.  Well hell I could tell you that if you google it youll find evidence that Obama was assassinated by purple Venusians and replaced by a shapeshifting elf from Atlantis.  Doesnt make it true.Finally the quality of the writing suggests that the writer is a nonnative English speaker.  When I take that in conjunction with the lack of supporting evidence for the claim Im of the belief that this is a local fad  folk remedy from wherever OP happens to live.That said I definitely think water assuming its clean water is certainly better for your liver than alcohol or some other drinks.  If youre having liver issues Id recommend talking with your doctor about what to drink and how much I suspect that certain problems would require limiting the type of liquid ingested while other problems might require limiting the amount of liquid ingested.

Space isnt expanding into anything space is simply expanding. Now we dont know whether the universe is infinite or not but for the purposes of this explanation lets just assume that it is.Imagine an infinite grid. Now begin zooming in. It appears as if the space between two points is increasing. Basically the universe or space is expanding consistently at every point. However if this were the case we wouldnt notice this as everything would increase according to scale. Due to gravity and other forces matter like planets and stars maintain their shapes while space in between them expands. At far enough distances the expansion of space overpowers gravity and this is why galaxies which are composed of stars lightyears apart are expanding.For example look at this image  Imagine the grid being magnified signifying the expansion of space. The dots which are stars retain their size due to gravity. So the distance between the stars increase causing this cluster of stars a galaxy to expand. However the plane extends infinitely beyond the edges of this image so the infinite plane is expanding without expanding into anything.,NoStupidQuestions,clhclh6,1,t5_2w844

Whatever people dedicate themselves to in early childhood receives the benefit of that early childhood brain plasticity.But heres the thing about music... People on the whole dont know a damn thing about it. If ones goal is to bring happiness to the world through music then one should do so. We need people of all levels of skill and talent pursuing their musical visions. Music is not a race to see who can pack the most notes into the least time although there IS a place for that.Basically I think we should COMPLETELY IGNORE concepts like talent. If a person of any age has an interest in music we should do our best to provide that person with the tools that he or she needs to maximize their talent. I love extremely hardworking and apparently gifted players like Jimi Hendrix John Coltrane Miles Davis Aaron Goldberg even Eddie Van Halen. But there are talentless hacks like say... Jeff Mangum Neutral Milk Hotel or Daniel Johnston or Wesley Willis who I love just as much. They all have their place.Dont even think about talent. Talent is a myth.

A lot of questions that I seem to answer are moral ones without obvious technical answers. Redditors in general have a very poor understanding of social issues. I had a really positive experience a few weeks ago explaining why sexual assault of a young male student by an attractive female teacher might be traumatising rather than cool that the OP seemed genuinely appreciative to have answered. That said this is the forum for asking those questions. The whole purpose of the forum is to have the opportunity to naively ask something without being judged. People are often unwilling to commit to answers on moral issues and I think as a society that has made certain things that I think are pretty obvious not so obvious to some people e.g. that women share the burden of disadvantage in a society where genders is not treated equally.Thats my experience here though other posters probably answer other sorts of questions.,NoStupidQuestions,cltf194,1,t5_2w844

But they call all their Modern touch interface software apps.  Visual Studio  still calls console DOS programs applications.

2297383,0,t1_clvn8ji,Interesting. You seem to be in the know so heres a little more detail on my specific situationI purchased a brand new  vehicle in July of . I put down  and that was just to secure the deal. I of course paid for tags title and licensing fees. However as my initial question states I have  interest for  months. The loan is through the dealership itself. Now I understand I have fairly good credit but still nothing in this world is done without profit. Even service companies that pay it forward by taking a slight profit loss on a job done now is because it incentivizes you to go back to that company when you want another similar service performed. In my personal scenario Im not dealing directly with the bank it was all done through the dealership. I have no commitment to the bank or really the dealership. And besides barring any unforeseen incident car accident death etc I dont plan on selling andor getting rid of the car prior to or after I have paid the amount in full.And really its not just the car. Any company that offers  interest I just do not get. I am currently paying on three separate bills for services that all have  interest. Aside from school and home loans I have never paid for interest. Ever. I assume I would get less credit card offers because Im not profitable but lo and behold every month I get a new credit card offer for  interest for longer and longer durations. Its very confusing to me unless Im just oversimplifying the whole system or that Im just an exception. ,NoStupidQuestions,clvo7d0,2,t5_2w844

Fleeing is considered a selfprotective strategy.I think the data on using a gun to defend oneself is affected by instances such as home invasions where fleeing might be very difficult or dangerous and where complying can turn a burglary into a hostage crisis.If one is just walking through the park and gets mugged it would probably be wisest to flee if you have the opportunity and the mugger doesnt have a gun.  If the mugger is threatening your life with a gun however it does seem that brandishing your own firearm is the safest recourse.  No one wants bullets flying through a public park.

This is me giving you a chance to tell me the truth. You say Yeah I have this small amount of weed you can search it if you want Ok if I only find a small amount of weed. Ill most likely turn you loose and tell you to have a nice night. If I find a fairly large amount youll probably get a citation. Maybe arrested if its enough to be selling or packaged in that manner.

The Brits flat out had leagues more planes and the capacity to build and field more than the Germans. ESPECIALLY if the Germans fail to seize Russian oil fields. Im sorry but no amount of what if changes this. After late  Germany had no chance of seriously threatening Britains defense outside if shipping raids and that was fucked in  by radar permanently. It wasnt some battle it was THE battle that proved Britain was not falling. It wasnt the battle if Britain in the sense it was a singular battle it was thousands over months for Britain. It was an enormous aerial offensive which was decisively and utterly crushed. Germany didnt have the navy and after  nor the air force to threaten them in any meaningful way.You act like Barbarossa came in the middle of some close struggle with Britain. No it was over. Planning and organization for the offensive happened AFTER the battle for Britain was lost. The war wasnt won but Germanys ability to threaten Britain was. At best it was a stalemate.

2595702,0,t3_2pjpsb,I think its just the nature of the mod system. It seems to get worse the bigger a sub gets. The initial creator of a sub generally doesnt worry about whats going on in the comments theyre focused on the content. Rules are lax. As the subscriber base grows the volume of crapspam posts grows as does the potential for seriously bad shit like doxing in the comments. The creator must bring in additional mods to help handle the load. As modding requires more and more time eventually the creator checks out or at least takes a backseat to the more dedicated mods.Who are these new mods? Sometimes they are people passionate about the subject of the sub but mostly they are people passionate about being mods. At first they got the job because they are willing to put the work in and modding a big sub is a lot of thankless work but eventually it became a feedback loop of sorts where the same mods keep getting chosen because theyre the most experienced thus adding to their prominence. What type of person is passionate about being a mod? The person who wants to reshape the community. They want everyone to be happy so no insults or offcolor comments. They think they know what a healthy community is supposed to look like so get ready for some new rules once the creator checks out and they have control. They have their own agendas or just likesdislikes so some topics will become verboten. Its all downhill from there.TLDR  Big subs end up being controlled by people who are more interested in being mods than the subs themselves and those people tend to be weird and controlling. ,NoStupidQuestions,cmxe8qv,2,t5_2w844

Plus you will then depending on country need to pay council rates or property taxes water rates maintain your property cover costs of repairs etc. You also have the risk of interest rates increasing and increasing your monthly payments.The lifetime cost of the mortgage being the original amount aka principal plus interest can be x the value of the property. This is just the loan from the bank. The other costs I mentioned arent included.To obtain a mortgage you need to have a deposit equivalent to  of the property value depending on country bank and circumstances I dont know what the minimum is in the UK. This could be anything from  in savings which most young people wont have. Then of you have less than  youll probably have to buy some mortgage insurance to cover the bank in case you fail to pay this could be another . Bear in mind the insurance doesnt protect you just the bank the insurer will pursue you for the bad debt. You also need a solid income to demonstrate your ability to repay at the current interest rates and if they increase.Because youll have such a huge chunk of your income tied to paying the bank for the privilege of living in their home it will shrink your disposable income and limit your mobility and ease of going in holidays or moving towns statescountiesprovinces or countries. If you have some disposable income then youre better off making extra repayments to reduce the interest over the lifetime of the mortgage.I have a mortgage now and would advise young people to wait until they have had some adventures travelled are settled into their career and want to know where they want to settle down.,NoStupidQuestions,cn67jrh,4,t5_2w844

Even if its flavored sugary water it is still largely water and so technically its nice theyre getting water. Flipside Theyre better off drinking nearly anything but soda and as nice as fluid intake is its not worth getting diabetes over. Technically The liquid simple sugars in coke are easily taken into the blood stream. This can be nice if you need to spike someones blood sugar ie if they are dangerously hypoglycemic and technically can be used to replenish muscle glycogen post workout. Flipside Because of the carbonation you cant drink nearly as much soda as youd be able to drink water you simply fill upbecome bloated too fast and so it is a terrible afterworkout drink. Technically Caffeine can super duper slightly boost metabolism and can also be used to treat headaches. Flipside However caffeine addiction then withdrawal is one of the major causes of sodarelated headache issues so not really useful.So technically there are nutritionrelated pros to Coke but they are completely overshadowed andor counteracted by the cons.  Other than transfats which have no benefit that I am aware of you could probably find some benefit to pretty much anything.

While it hasnt been completely debunked research in personality psychology using the Big Five has shown that there is way more overlap between men and women than previously thought and it isnt a simple highlow different situations produce different kind of scores. Most telling is that these differences become much smaller when people think they arent being observed or are presented with nonnatural situations and they are most pronounced when dependant on selfreport.

2764641,0,t1_cnibo12,Parliament gave the Lord Chancellor the power to use the Royal Seal to provide assent to a bill which made the Prince a Regent but some people opposed this as they said it was still fundamentally illegal.Eventually I think they didnt need to do it because the King recovered for long enough to rule again for a bit but he said Parliament had done the right thing.In the UK constitution Parliament is the sovereign institution not the Queen. Literally nothing can overrule Parliament which is why the EU is such a divisive and interesting issue and Parliament can even set the line of succession ignoring the Monarchs wishes entirely.So if Parliament ever wrote a law that said This law states the Lord Chancellor can provide Royal assent to bills but this bill does not require Royal Assent to become law technically it would become law. Then the Lord Chancellor can provide royal assent to a bill that says Bill no longer require royal assent.Technically the first bill was illegal but it was illegal according to another law also passed by Parliament. Parliament can already write laws that override other laws which is why the Human Rights Act is basically a joke because you could scrap it this afternoon so technically all this law is doing is overriding another law.The legal argument would be messy but like so many things in British politics the outcome would be the one that is generally seen as the right outcome.So if the UK still supports having a monarch and a parliament tries to abolish the monarchy they could refuse to sign however the only way to enforce the law and therefore subsequent laws would be to have the judiciary on side in order to make the ruling you want and youd need the police and the military on side in order to enforce the law. Even then the people of Britain could still treat the royal family as royals and ignore the law.On the other hand if the Queen wouldntcouldnt sign bills and it was interfering with the running of the country it would be much easier to get the judiciary the police and the people on side and you could basically change the constitution overnight. ,NoStupidQuestions,cnibuhr,5,t5_2w844

2770323,0,t3_2rqy88,Im not sure this counts as both stories are fairly old and one wasnt actually a hitchhiker. Story  When I was a child in the s my folks were driving us all to grandmas house for the holidays. Somewhere about northern Tennessee or southern Kentucky we saw a hitchhiker garbed in a naval dress uniform. My dad who did two tours in the Navy slammed on the brakes and actually started backing up on the breakdown burm at the side while ordering me to lock the back doors. Dad rolled a window down and had a discussion with the guy carefully guiding the conversation to satisfy himself the guy was really in the Navy. I dont recall exact details but he described some things incorrectly he thought only a real Navy man would know and waited to be corrected. The guy passed and he ended up riding with us to where he needed to take another highway to reach his home in the backhills of West Virginia. My dad actually walked the guy into a truck stop restaurant and after feeding him dinner with the family stood up. He asked loudly was anyone there military or exmilitary because he had a military man who needed help getting home to his family in ltname of town I dont recallgt. Some truck driver ended up offering to take him within five miles of it.Story  When I first moved where I live now I was surprised to see a lot of people walking. Especially a lot of older people walked to our nowrare neighborhood grocery. Or at least I dont know anywhere in the state where a really old grocery set in the middle of the older residential neighborhood is still operating. Anyways lots of older folk who didnt drive would be seen walking home carrying their groceries no matter how heavy. I used to stop especially for the women this is one of the rare instances where it is important I am a woman online and give them a lift home.

This is a spaghettilike line that stretches from the past to the future showing the spatial location of the particle at every instant in time. This worldline exists as a complete object which may be sliced here and there so that you can see where the particle is located in space at a particular instant. Once you determine the complete world line of a particle from the forces acting upon it you have solved for its complete history. This worldline does not change with time but simply exists as a timeless object. Similarly in general relativity when you solve equations for the shape of spacetime this shape does not change in time but exists as a complete timeless object. You can slice it here and there to examine what the geometry of space looks like at a particular instant.

Depending on what is happening in a persons life at any given time and depending on their maturity level they can develop an adversarial relationship with their phone. I was in a place at one point where I would dread the sound of my phone ringing or vibrating. I would never answer voice calls and rarely make texts. People can develop issues around this based on insecurity. Maybe something in her life leaves her feeling so weak or so uncomfortable in her skin that the thought of expressing herself in front if an unsafe person paralyzes her. Or perhaps there is some issue with you specifically.What Im saying is you are right to be concerned about your friendship but perhaps your focus could also be on what is happening in your friends life to produce such a change.Youre a good friend and an even better one if you dont let her succeed in cutting herself off like this she might need you.

For instance a Christian may want to ensure murder is illegal because the Bible forbids it but even if that were not the case most of society can agree that it is bad. Another more controversial example is the illegality of gay marriage. Although it has become an almost purely religious debate now there are a lot of other arguments people could bring to the table such as the fact that the reason benefits are given to married couplesfamilies is because the standard family unit is beneficial to a country having increased stability and ability to produce children which every country needs which a gay couple couldnt do. Hopefully this will provide some additional perspective. One last thing for someone who believes in God that faith is or should be the most important part of their life eternal consequences as opposed to temporary and thus to ignore their faith in favor of something else would be foolishness. This doesnt mean they should completely ignoredisregard science or other evidence however.TLDR Even if religion is the statedobvious reason to vote one way it is very rarely the only reason or they may have another hidden agenda.,NoStupidQuestions,co4finw,1,t5_2w844

3006699,0,t1_co9mq5i,American here. A credit card looks like a debit card and can be swiped like a debit card but the money on the credit card doesnt come from your personal bank account. Instead when you apply for a credit card the credit card company determines an appropriate line of credit depending on many factors and is ultimately summed up in your credit score. So say they approve your credit line to be . You can spend that money all you want but at the end or beginning of the month you need to pay the credit card company back either a portion of what you owe or all of it its up to you. Of course theres a minimum payment they require usually  and most often having a running balance carrying over every month instead of paying it all off adds interest you need to pay back as well. Not paying anything at all is not good. Paying everything that you owe is best. So you can deduce how Americans have problems with credit card debt. Some of us treat it as money we think we have but truly dont which leads people to spend more than they can actually afford. On the other hand credit cards can be good in improving your credit score if you dont have a remaining balance carry over from month to month which some people achieve by using their credit cards for minor things like groceries and gas and not for big purchases.Source college student in relatively minor credit card debtThis is my very basic understanding of credit cards anyway.

I mean its certainly unfair for the mother to have to deal with their rapist and possibly be around him after being raped and I think the child should be able to meet the father of they really want but the father is still a rapist.

It comes with a tracking number so you can easily figure out where the package is if something happens. Also USPS tends to handle priority mail quickly and relatively gently. DO NOT use Media Mail! Also do not use an envelope for a video game or a bluray or anything that comes in a fragile plastic case. It will get crushed and that opens the door for your customer to claim its damaged.

3319163,0,t3_2y66gc,From a notsupertechnicalandprobablynotaccurate perspective energy is really just motion or the potential for motion. There are a lot of different types of energymotion though and just about any type of energy can through the right process be converted into any other type of energy. So first off theres several different types of active energy which I may not have covered completely Kinetic energy is the motion of an object traveling from one place to another. A thrown baseball has a lot of kinetic energy. Thermal energy heat is the motion of atoms or molecules shaking or moving around around within an object or fluid. A pot of boiling water and the steam coming off of it have a lot of thermal energy. Electric energy is the motion of electrons through a medium. Your computer is using a lot of electrical energy. Radiant energy is the motion of photons light particles. The sun gives off a lot of radiant energy.Then theres potential energy. These are types of energy where there may not be any active motion but it can cause motion to occur again not necessarily a complete list Gravitational potential energy is caused by the force of gravity. You can increase an objects gravitational potential energy by lifting it off the ground. When you let go of it that potential energy gets converted to kinetic energy by the force of gravity. Mechanical potential energy is what is stored in things like a compressed or woundup spring. Chemical potential energy is the energy that holds the composite molecules of atoms together. When a chemical reaction happens either outside energy usually heat is transformed into potential energy or the potential energy of the chemical bonds is released as another form of energy again usually heat. Nuclear potential energy is the energy that holds together the parts of an atom. When you set off an atomic bomb or run a nuclear reactor nuclear potential energy is transformed into kinetic radiant and heat energy in the form of nuclear radiation.At this point scientists have a pretty good understanding of how all these kinds of energy behave. We can measure amounts of energy describe rates of energy transfer predict the flow of energy in a system and design and build complex machines that harness these laws of nature to do useful work. What is energy at a fundamental level though? Im not really sure and I dont know if anyone is. At some point most scientists tend to care more about theories that accurately describe what we can observe and make accurate predictions about the universe. Theres whole branches of philosophy and philosophical science though that are trying to figure this kind of stuff out.,NoStupidQuestions,cp6m2sd,4,t5_2w844

But nobody has really really explained why.The clock frequency GHz indicates how many cycles per second the processor does. . GHz means  cycles per second. During each of those cycles the processor executes an instruction doing a small amount of work like multiplying two numbers.But a cycle isnt necessarily equal to another cycle. Modern processors can often squeeze more than one instruction into one cycle to do several things at once. They can also have more advanced instructions that do more work at once imagine a program needs to multiply  numbers by another number. An old processor might have to do it by doing a normal multiply  times while a newer processor may have a special instruction for doing that in one step.

3593138,0,t3_31huur,No because there are only three ways to win it none of which make decent career options Win it by sheer dumb luck.  Possible but you cant really count on it with odds like  in  million or whatever. Cheat somehow.  Increases your odds greatly but requires rigging the lottery somehow and you stand a good chance of ending up in prison which is usually also a bad career move. Buy enough tickets to make winning very likely.  There are almost always restrictions built into the lottery to make this impossible or impractical.  Perhaps the prize is significantly lower than the number of tickets required to cover it or perhaps there are restrictions on how tickets are sold requiring you to physically buy  million tickets over a week.  On rare occasions people have actually won by doing this but then they tighten up the rules and it doesnt work any more.  Cant make a career of doing this either.,NoStupidQuestions,cq1uf9r,1,t5_2w844
3594855,0,t3_31j5p7,No? Calling the cops would get you charged with public disturbance public intoxication furnishing alcohol to a minor and anything else they could get you with. The police are not paid to help drunk kids throw good parties. They are there to enforce the law which is being broken.In general cops wont arrest everyone at an underage drinking party. Theyll close off the area take down the names of those present and tell everyone to leave. They only people who get seriously busted are the homeowner the people who brought booze and anyone stupid enough to run from the cops on foot. Running away is both incriminating what do you have that no one else has and probable cause for a search.Edit Although it isnt applicable for underage drinking several local AAA groups offer free towing for drunk people on holidays. At least in northern California Nevada and Utah you can get a free  mile tow on New Years the Superbowl St. Patricks Day Cinco de Mayo th of July and Halloween even if you arent a member. You just call them and they give you and your friends a ride home. Theres a few other groups that offer similar services although I cant find any sort of national index for them. You should never have drunk driving be part of you plan and you should never underestimate the favors a bartender will do for a good DD but theres a last resort if you need it.But seriously get a DD lined up for your party or have sleeping arrangements. Its as important as good beer and a clean home. Offer a DD a  pack for their troubles and to split the cost of gas with them but work it out before the party. You dont have to advertise it in advance but as people start leaving it helps to be able to keep them off the road without keeping them from getting home.,NoStupidQuestions,cq21gkg,40,t5_2w844
3597367,0,t3_31jjdd,As has already been said unhealthy food is often full of fat sugar and salt. These are all things that are totally necessary for our survival and historically have been hard to come by so our bodies make the psychological reward for consuming them great. The problem is that these days theyre not hard to get and our bodies havent had enough time to adjust to this so were inclined to eat lots of food that has these things even though we dont need to eat lots of it. Additionally unhealthy food is typically highlyprocessed which has two effects. First due to the desire to make it as cheap as possible the processing can destroy or strip out healthy micronutrients. Second due to the desire by companies making these foods for people to eat lots of them a lot of flavor engineering goes into making them taste awesome usually by using added flavors. ,NoStupidQuestions,cq2brbn,1,t5_2w844

3617965,0,t3_31sxyg,Likely because its viewed as a vastly inferior product in terms of player talent and justifiably so similar to how fans of the NFL view the CFL Canadian Football League. In the history of MLS there have been maybe one or two players who could hold their own against worldclass talent. But if youre good enough to play somewhere like the English Premier League or La Liga youre probably not giving MLS a second thought.Paradoxically the same soccer fans who dump all over MLS also decry the lack of interest in soccer from Americans in general. Part of the reason MLS still sucks is that there isnt enough money to attract toptier talent but teams would have more money if the league was more popular. If you like soccer but wish MLS was better then you should be supporting and promoting MLS so that revenue increases and teams could start attracting highquality players.,NoStupidQuestions,cq4o9yy,3,t5_2w844

3712723,0,t3_32voyt,You might be interested in the history of alchemical art. Alchemists such as George Ripley used art as a tool to communicate the subtleties of their work without exposing it to the authorities especially in the Church who might take action against them alchemy is thought of today as a pseudoscience version of chemistry that sought to turn lead into gold but it was really more of a mystical philosophy that involved chemical processes as symbolic tools of selftransformation.Anyway that sort of highly symbolic art influenced the many social societies including Freemasonry of the late th and th centuries in Europe and eventually the Americas. Thus well trained artists who do commercial work today are often aware of the rich history of these symbols and use them for much the same reasons to communicate or reference broad ideas.And sometimes theyre just recycling what they think are cool symbols... One point I want to make about your use of the term IlluminatiMasonic... The Illuminati were a brieflived social and philosophical society style as most in the th century were on Freemasonry but with more of a focus on political activism. Due to that activism and internal strife it lasted for about  years and then was actively disbanded by the Bavarian authorities.Freemasonry on the other hand is a social and philosophical organization which explicitly is nonpolitical and has existed around the world since the early th century actually well before that possibly centuries but thats when official recordkeeping began currently  million members strong.Conflating these two is a bit like saying AppleNetscape when you want to refer to technology generically. If you wanted to say fraternal symbolism generically then you could just say that and you would be including the linked chain of the Oddfellows the Masonic Square and Compasses the pentagram of Order of the Eastern Star the Waite Tarot of B.O.T.A. and so on.,NoStupidQuestions,cqfh4wt,2,t5_2w844

They have a wine that they are either having a special on or is their house wine. They bring it by the table and offer you a sample to see if you want a glass.

For example a trial by jury is required for criminal matters where the penalty if youre found guilty is more than  months in jail. The exact circumstances and laws are a bit complicated but the general idea is that for anything truly serious there should be a jury.Its also possible in some civil cases for the people involved to give up their right to a jury trial and accept a judge or other arbitrators decision.Finally some trials that you may think of as decided by a judge are actually cases where a judge called a mistrial or otherwise stopped a trial from happening before a jury was selected but that would have had a jury if things had kept going.,NoStupidQuestions,cr6y328,6,t5_2w844

3996229,0,t3_3689or,I imagine its a similar argument that people make against TASERs. Im not necessarily advocating this position just imagining a parallel to use. PreTASER Bullets are lethal. Police are trained to shoot only in extreme situations. Shooting someone is a lastresort ideally.High threshold before police can act. PostTASER TASERs are less lethal. Police are trained to use their TASER if possible instead of their gun. Lower threshold before police can act. Intended effect was to decrease the number people hurt or killed in confrontations. People argue that it has instead lowered the threshold for action too much where people now are TASERed in situations where you wouldnt shoot a gun. Since a TASER is lesslethal not nonlethal some of those people die.Similarly the threshold for the USAF to drop bombs on people was high. You dont just fly bombers into neutral or allied nations often without consent or notification and blow people up. But...a drone seems less hostile than a bomber. No American bodies are actually violating sovereign airspace just some drone. Instead of using drones to replace bombers or fighters in traditional wars weve instead increased the number of conflicts because we found scenarios where we previously wouldnt bomb someone but wanted to that we can now utilize. It didnt decrease the fatalities our pilots suffered it just increased the fatalities our enemies suffered. ,NoStupidQuestions,crbsx3u,14,t5_2w844

They get craptons of money from donors and can give it out how they see fit. If you apply for a private college you wont just fill out the FAFSA youll fill out the PROFILE which is how private colleges decide how much money to give you. Do not rest on the piece of paper alone. I distinctly remember calling up one of the private colleges and the person on the line going Ah you must be very proud of my name like I was the parent.

They also associated the sight of a mushroom flower or geometric shape with an electric shock. Then they tested people to see how long it took to form a conditioned fear response to either snakes spiders mushrooms flowers or geometric shapes. The fear response was almost instantaneous with snakes amp spiders whereas very slow to form with the other stimuli.

Your cats cover their waste to show they are submissive to you if they didnt it would be seen as either a challenge or they know you are not a threat to them sometimes older cats stop covering because they know you arent a threat. If you used the litter box there are two outcomes . you cover it . you dont cover it. If you cover it it may look like you are either being submissive to them or you are afraid of a larger predator in the area and are trying to hide from them. If you dont cover it you are just reasserting your dominance over the cats.,NoStupidQuestions,crnxkar,102,t5_2w844

This will decrease the blood flow back to the heart. The heart compensates for this by changing its regular heart beat momentarily to adjust.

4339569,0,t1_csepagd,Cant forget Kubrick!A lot of people dont really understand what a cinematographer does. I have a buddy that does it for a living and he explains it like this.Basically its the directors job to say I want the shot to look like this. I want this angle and this kind of lighting so that it produces such and such effect. Its the cinematographers job to know what cameras lenses lights light placement filters etc. to use in order to get that effect. This used to be of extreme importance back in the days when you couldnt see what you were shooting right away. You could shoot all day think you had some great stuff then review the dailies realize the cinematographer didnt know their shit and have to shoot the whole thing all over again.These days thanks to advances in technology you can see what youre shooting and whether or not its right immediately. So the cinematographer still has an important job but its less esoteric and iffy and more about directing the grips and managing hardware. The director is even more in control of the look and feel of a shot and more selfreliant.,NoStupidQuestions,csessfe,2,t5_2w844

4352155,0,t3_3auvgi,I was actually looking this up this morning. I feel like the Bell theory may be the most accurate just personal opinion though. The first theory deals with the telephones circuitry and tonerecognition hardware. When the touchtone telephone was being designed in the late s the calculator and addingmachine designers had already established a layout that had   and  across the top row. Dataentry professionals and others who used calculators fairly regularly were quite adept at navigating these keypads. They could hit the numbers extremely quickly which was great for data entry but not so great for dialing a touchtone phone. The tonerecognition technology could not operate effectively at the speeds at which these specialists could dial the numbers. The telephone designers figured that if they reversed the layout the dialing speeds would decrease and the tonerecognition would be able to do its job more reliably. This theory has little proof to substantiate it but it does make sense.A second theory refers to a study done by Bell Labs in . This study involved testing several different telephonekeypad layouts to find out which was easiest to master. After testing several layouts including one that used two rows with five numbers each and another that used a circular positioning it was determined that the threebythree matrix that had   and  across the top was the easiest for people to use.Another theory is based on the layout of a rotary telephone. On a rotary dial  is at the top right and zero is on the bottom. When designed the new touchtone keypad putting the  on the topright didnt make much sense because Western writing is read from left to right. But putting  on the topleft and the subsequent numbers to the right did make sense. Using that formula the resulting rows fell into place with zero getting its own row at the bottom.,NoStupidQuestions,csg7y3t,3,t5_2w844

4511566,0,t3_3cvca6,From what I can find with a quick Google bars tend to charge a minimum because they thrive on one customer buying a lot of their product over a long period of time. They want their customers to stay longer since theyll buy more. They dont want their customers to have one drink and leave. The minimum nudges the customer into staying longer and buying more since the bar wont process the credit card without the minimum. Coffee shops on the other hand thrive on volume and understand that their customers come in order coffee and leave. The more customers they can get in a day the more money they make. They want each customer in and out so more can come in. Bars want the opposite.Interestingly minimum purchases arent something credit card companies look upon fondly. According to this pagegtMinimumpurchase policies go against the rules of many credit card companies. Customers can report the bars minimumpurchase policy to their card company. The card company will contact the bank that reimburses the merchant for credit card charges to get the bar back into compliance with its policy of no minimum purchases.,NoStupidQuestions,cszbwrg,4,t5_2w844

A wall can come in many shapes and forms but if the goal of a wall is to support a roof then the simplest cheapest and best wall is a wall at .

4811786,0,t1_cu0ttn0,gt The kids need to be taught how math works before being taught simple strategies.This is what Common Core is for. The stuff we learned ages ago is an example of a streamlined algorithm that gives you the correct answer without any understanding of the relationships of the numbers and operations underlying them. The old way is these simple strategies. Common Core aims instead to work through the smallest steps of using and understanding numbers and how to do arithmetic with them using numerous different methods that emphasize number sense and relationships between concepts so that most children can end up doing most arithmetic in their head earlier. With this foundational understanding they can even understand and derive for themselves the quick strategies like the penandpaper methods you and I and others learned since the s though they will also be taught these methods a little further down the road anyway.Common core is like the onscreen hints when you first play Portal that tell you which buttons you use to move and jump and use objects whereas the old methods like the left half of OPs post are like being told dont use that gun it sux when you first start playing CounterStrike. Those methods leave too much genuine understanding of the system out in the rain in favor of memorization of a specific quicktrick method that gets in the way of later attempts at full understanding.NB I get that your post is saying that your sons experience worked in exactly the opposite direction of this and Im responding this way to show why thinking the old method imparts more or even much foundational understanding is backwards. Common Core is a partially bureaucratic invention and so its sure to have plenty of issues and Im not really surprised if it was applied incorrectly and therefore failed to help your son understand arithmetic. But while the old penandpaper methods can be easily memorized and successfully applied its a fact that they dont even touch the work that Common Core does to start with and build a students actual understanding of mathematics. They were not designed to do that. And the underwhelming ability of the average American to truly understand and do math is why Common Core was designed we need methods that address and foster actual understanding of the concepts and what we had before was not doing that.,NoStupidQuestions,cu12dfu,3,t5_2w844

And then you would have to have a method for thawing them out that unfroze the person in a fraction of a second.  So for the thaw youd need a heating method with enough warmth to get a frozen stiff corpse up to . degrees in a fraction of a second but also not so hot that it wouldnt kill the person with the heat.This idea is hypothetically possible but not currently possible with humanitys modern understanding of freezing and heating technologies.,NoStupidQuestions,cu7b6gx,13,t5_2w844

The inability to do much with it without a full crew. The camaraderie built between international team members who spend  of their time together millimeters from death. The need for ground crew to assist with operations. The fact that you cant really go anywhere on the ISS because it has minimal thrusting capability. Most astronauts are from a military background who feel a duty to complete and succeed in their mission a major component of which is international cooperation. Or the fact that the space station is made of parts from all over the world and youd be damned if the part that failed was from another country thats not so inclined to help you repair it since you made off with a space station they own a portion of. And most space agencies are in it for the science and research opportunities not galactic conquest that really has gone away with the end of the Cold War.

After they went through and cataloged everything they would use the Id on the bag to assign it to a family or next of kin. Then they bring the family into a private room sometimes with a psychologist and present the belongings. They then have as much time as they feel they need to look through or not or just talk or cry as they need. Remember these people just lost a loved one to a plane crash. It is very very complicated and difficult. The amount of effort to support the next of kin is amazing.

5008899,0,t1_cupizie,Ill try to answer your question with a few examples and explain things as best as I can.  Feel free to ask me to clarify anything.First of all if like you said you didnt get out of your car and you just sat there and watched or possibly recorded a traffic stop from a reasonable distance without interfering with anything there are a few different ways that could go.  Theres the possibility I wouldnt even approach you but if I did Id most likely make my initial approach of the vehicle I stopped and ensure the situation was safe and the occupants of that car werent a threat.  Id then probably walk over to your car and ask why you stopped.  If you were polite and just said something along the lines of Im just watching your traffic stop.  I dont mean to get in the way Id probably tell you that if youd like to sit and watch the stop Id like to see your ID to make sure youre both legally able to be driving and to make sure youre not a wanted criminal who is going to try and kill me and Id ask you to stay seated inside your car until I return to your car and gave you your ID back.  Id then go about my business and finish things up and then give you your stuff back answer any questions and then ask you to drive safely and enjoy the rest of your day.  If you were standoffish when I got up to your window and pulled the whole YOURE BEING RECORDED! AM I BEING DETAINED!?! Id probably get a little pissed off because Im going to have to assume youre not going to let me do my job without first having to explain myself to you.  If thats the case Im going to ask you to please remove yourself from my traffic stop and remind you it is illegal to park on a highway unless youre involved in an emergency.  Id tell you its fine to record me but only if youre not violating any other laws in doing so.  If you left and parked further down the road or off in a parking lot or something and recorded me from there cool.  If you refused to leave Id probably call for backup and arrest you for interference. Next I think the word intimidation is the wrong word to use in this case.  Im not intimidated by a civilian who approaches me unexpectedly.  Its not uncommon.  It happens all day every day.  I signed up to do a dangerous job.  I understand that.  What I did not sign up to do is to be unsafe and get hurt or die.  It is OK for a group of police officers to approach someone because in  of the instances where a group of cops is talking to one person its because that person committed a crime.  If youve committed a crime you dont get to whine and say you were intimidated by the mere presence of a group of cops.  People dont want to go to jail.  Thats natural.  But Im not going to get hurt trying to uphold the law because someone who just broke the law feels like theyre above the law.  There is the opinion that the cops are the bad guys nowadays and its very sad for society and frustrating for cops.  I took an oath to enforce the laws of the state I work in and the constitution of the United States of America.  I dont really give a shit what the law is.  I am tasked with enforcing the law not determining if its reasonable or not.  Society relies on me to do that every day.  Im not the bad guy.  Im the good guy.  Im who you call when youre too afraid to go into your house because you think someone is inside or when some drunk asshole crashes into you on your way home from the movie theater or when you cant find your  year old or youve been raped or stabbed or just because someone offended you and you dont know how to talk to someone like an adult and you dont understand that offending someone is not illegal.  Everything I do at work is me trying to make society a better place.  Im sorry but I dont care if that drunk who crashed into you is intimidated or if the dude in your house is intimidated.  I know  that Im doing the right thing every day and Im not going to unreasonably hurt someone or break the law.  I cant say the same thing for most people I deal with on a daily basis.  Thats why its not OK for you to mess with the police when theyre trying to do their job and its OK for the police to be a little in your face at times.  I deal with the people you dont want to deal with.  Im sorry you have to see it sometimes and Im sorry youre put off by some of the things you see.  My job doesnt change just because you dont like the police.  People still hurt one another.  People still try to hurt the police.  Not much has changed in terms of police work other than the public actually seeing what goes on now because everyone has a camera.  The public cant handle it and thats why there is an outcry for more police accountability.  What I dont think you realize is accountability doesnt mean constant babysitting or constantly having a camera in your face.  Accountability means I go do my job and you expect Im doing it correctly and you leave me to it.  If I fuck up thats on me.

5033045,0,t3_3jv006,Most of these answers are not really accurate.  This has nothing to do with ISP monitoring.  Contrary to popular belief ISPs do not monitor customer torrents or customer traffic in general in this manner.  However anyone with a copy of a .torrent file or Magnet link can connect to the tracker or view the DHT network to get a full list of IP addresses seeding copies of that file and copyright holders will sometimes pick  a handful of torrents to monitor and send notices to the relevant ISPs.First of all dont panic.  One copyright notice from your ISP is not a big deal.  As mentioned they did not turn over your information to the copyright holder and as mentioned in the email theres only a possibility of account termination after multiple notices have been received.The message you received was not an action initiated by your ISP it was a result of a copyright holder sending a notice to your ISP which in turn notified you.  The second thing you need to do the first being dont panic is follow the instructions to log in and view the actual notice that the copyright holder sent to your ISP in order to determine who filed the complaint and what content was associated with the notice.Bittorrent is a peertopeer protocol meaning everyone who downloads a file also uploads parts of a file known a seeding to other downloaders.  A tracker server andor DHT system is used to help peers find each other.Anyone with a copy of a .torrent file or Magnet link the two main ways of getting a torrent loaded in your torrent client can contact the tracker and get a full list of IP addresses seeding all or part of the file.  Basically you can get a list like ... and ... are offering the complete file ... is offering the first half of the file ... is offering the second half of the file etc.So as soon as youve downloaded any part of the file your torrent client will advertise back to the tracker that its willing to share those parts with others and the tracker will make the information publicly available.Its pretty trivial for copyright holders to go to a site like Pirate Bay do a search for the latest episode of their TV series grab the Magnet link and pull a full list of all IP addresses sharing copies of the file.  They might have their own torrent client download part of the file from you just to prove that you really are sharing it rather than just telling the tracker that you are.Theyll usually monitor only certain torrents and only target big uploaders.  Once they have a list of IP addresses theyll send copyright notices to the associated ISPs who can look and see what customer account was using that IP at the time of the alleged infringement.Things you can do to reduce the number of copyright notices you get. Use private trackers that copyright holders either cant get access to or dont bother wasting their time with.. Avoid torrenting brandnew episodes of TV series or avoid the most popular torrents for those episodes because those are the ones that copyright holders are most likely to be monitoring.. Limit the amount of seeding you do.  You can configure your torrent client to stop seeding when you reach  ratio I dont consider it ethical to set it any lower than that or after seeding the complete file for a certain length of time.  Theyll usually only send copyright notices to big uploaders who redistribute multiple copies of the file also theyll usually only monitor torrents for a limited period of time so the less time you spend seeding the less likely that it is that your seeding time will overlap with their monitoring.  Dont avoid seeding altogether though because that makes you a selfish asshole..  Use alternatives to torrents such as direct download sites or streaming sites that cant be monitored by copyright holders..  Use a seedbox or VPN to hide your IP being sure to check its policies to make sure they wont turn your real IP over.. Use Tor if you enjoy downloading at  kilobit per second.. If you do get a copyright notice and it was for a TV series be more cautious with that particular TV series than you otherwise would  dont seed it for as long as you otherwise would dont torrent it immediately after the new episode goes up or dont torrent future episodes at all.. Deleting the trackers from the torrent and using only DHT and PEX might be safer.  Theres software like PeerBlock that will prevent you from seeding to IPs known to be associated with copyright enforcement.  I dont think its hugely effective though.  Even if the blacklist is accurate and it prevents you from actually sending parts of the file to them theyll still be able to see that youre offering the file which is enough to justify a copyright notice to your ISP.  It might protect you somewhat in the event of an actual lawsuit or if your ISP tried to terminate your account and you had to dispute the notices since they wouldnt have hard proof that your computer was REALLY sharing the file..  Dont pirate.,NoStupidQuestions,cuso8rx,29,t5_2w844

5040271,0,t3_3jzhfy,Government employees absolutely retire.  TYpically the age of retirement is around .  Now if you are talking about elected officials there have been a few yes.  Most positions are elected every few years  years for some  for others so retirement is simply not running for another term. Strom Thurmond is one who stayed in office until   He reached  years old while in office. He passed away a few months after leaving office.  Supreme court justices though are a life appointment so it is up to them when to retire.  The oldest was  when he retired in .While this seems like a system perfect for old age remember that unlike supreme court justices senators congressmen and all other elected representatives both at a federal and state level would have to have a successful campaign every election year and be reelected. SO while they might not want to retire the people voting could certainly decide it is time for them to no longer be in office. ,NoStupidQuestions,cutjl1f,2,t5_2w844
5048198,0,t1_cuuhjgq,Hm this makes me want to do the math from scratch just to be certain without relying on thirdparty approximations with matchbooks how much is a matchbook? and sugar cubes.Wiki gives the mass of a n.s. as between  solar masses theoretically but between  as observed so lets take . as average  that is    kg. From the same source mean radius is about  km so the volume is .   m. From this the average density would be .   kgm. There was lots of averaging here of course but we shouldnt be off by more than one order of magnitude.Now  cm  a sugar cube? with this density is .   kg or  mln metric tons. This is in fact very much comparable with your original source especially keeping in mind that once again with all this averaging we could be off by about  times Id say.In any case your original math was correct no matter what the true numbers are. And a density of  is surely not unrealistic although certainly very exotic for Earth.gt That would be  orders of magnitude heavier than what they were saying. It isnt really important to quibble about the relative volume of a matchbook vs. a sugar cube they are still within an order of magnitude of each other. When linear size grows one order of magnitude volume grows three so it does matter. Honestly though without specifying how much exactly is a matchbox and how much exactly is a sugar cube its a matter of guessing anyway. If anything that remark about the matchbox has a citation needed on it.,NoStupidQuestions,cuuhz17,3,t5_2w844

Force is based on velocity and mass so it would be significantly lower for the ant any way though of course the ants skeleton also is a lot weaker than yours.Terminal velocity is the velocity at which gravity and air resistance balance out. It depends on the friction of the body and the weight of the body. Its basically the fastest speed you can fall. Now I dont know any exact numbers and that example may be bullshit but you would have the exact same speed if you fall from km as you would have if you fall from km. Because that velocity is constant the force is also constant.

Go to an urgent care.If you have an amputated limb diabetic coma or anything else that is basically lifethreatening immediately?  Go to an Emergency room.Basically WalkinFamily Physician lt Urgent Care lt ER in terms of seriousness of the situation.That being said  if you are not sure go to whatever facility is the closest.  As the worse case would be you have to wait a long long time to be seen.  In fact I even recommend just asking the triage person the individual you will first see who will judge how critical your situation is if it is better for you to go to a different facility due to the seriousness of your condition.

5299242,0,t3_3nkgdb,I think that mirozi somewhat misunderstood your question.  The part of your question that is interesting to me is your WHY. It certainly has not always been like this in Europe but it is a rather recent Historically speaking development.  Its also part of a massive social battle within European society and its constituent culture. Many people seem to have forgotten that the current European Union and peace within Europe are a very recent thing.  Up until the end of the second world war Europe was always at war with itself. For thousands of years a history of war between the peoples that it is as old as written records  of the area. What we have now is the exception.  Europe was bloodied terribly by the last  World Wars. Hundreds of Millions dead. So much so that  it has now been reshaped into ONE Political body.  On a foundation of Human rights because look at what happens when Human rights are ignored and we have machines that make killing easier.The idea that as you put it other nationalities tend to want to keep their country ethnically homogenous.Is not allowed to be spoken of openly in Europe.  In those other countries you pointed at. Its allowed without shame to say these things. Do you know that there are a lot of social elements that will VERY quickly call a german a nazi if he was to speak of  wanting to keep their country ethnically homogenous.Political correctness keeps the population from saying we want to keep to our own.  My own opinion on this might already be hinted at here but just to make sure I would agree with people who say that taking on more refugees in Europe. Without very clear and strict return policies.

Youd probably end up with diarrhoea from all of the salt content though.  If it went in the other end ie anal  not of course vaginal  it would have come in after the places where it could be best digested.  The high concentration of it would set up an osmotic gradient drawing fluid into the lower intestine and so you would end up with epic diarrhoea and most likely dehydrate pretty quickly.Overall in the intestines the bacterial populations wouldnt be as much of a worry as the osmotic pressure of semen.  However many upsets of one sort or another can cause an overgrowth of clostridia  opportunist little buggers that they are  those can cause all sorts from chronic diarrhoea to kidney failure and death.As for the bicyclepump method ie through the navel that wouldnt reach the intestines at all  instead that would sit in the abdominal cavity and set up a massive potentially fatal peritonitis.,NoStupidQuestions,cvp4l7p,3,t5_2w844

They tell themselves Im in control Im not stupid Ill just do it this one time. We all think we are the exception we think be things only happen to everyone else we think we are smarter and more in control when we are really just average and the same. There is a term for this Ill try remembering it and linking to its wiki but its basically that someone thinks theyre smarter and their thoughts are all better than everyone elses.  Nobody wants to become a crack head nobody says shit I just really wish I could be a fucking crack head and be addicted to meth until my body gives up.  They try it and because they are some of the most addicting drugs they can become physically addicted in one or two uses. There was a documentary where some guy was interviewed and he said the rush from meth was so intense the first time he did it that he even had an orgasm and he couldnt stop having the urge to do it so he became addicted. Krokodil is another story. Most people know about how fucked that shit is even a Russian or some eastern European meth user in the Vice documentary of Krokodil said that he doesnt fuck with Krokodil and stays with meth only. Usually people use it because theyre already addicted to meth and cant afford it anymore or switch to Krokodil because its cheaper and gives the same effects. So they basically switch from meth to Krokodil save some money and kill themselves quicker and in a more gruesome manner as their flesh becomes gangrenous. Doesnt make sense to us but I would assume meth heads throwing all their money at the drug arent thinking exactly straight. ,NoStupidQuestions,cvu6x7q,2,t5_2w844

There is a difference between someone keeping their own traditions and taking yours away.  Them keeping their own traditions among their small community of people they have a kinship with is one thing.  Enforcing their rules and cultures on you is another and there is no proof that is what is happening.  Im sorry there just isnt.  Your first points were reasonable about the costs and hardships related to taking in refugees.  Your argument that your countrys history and culture is threatened because of refugees simply isnt.  The only way you can argue that they are taking away your culture and traditions is if you are basing your culture and traditions on being all white which AFAIK isnt true with any European country at least not for a very very long time long before even your grandparents were born cultures have been trading and immigrating among each other from all over the world. ,NoStupidQuestions,cw38yhp,2,t5_2w844

Its an exception to the rule of a landmass constituting a continent because our perspective of the region was defined before we could step back and look at a globe although the caucus mountains are a major boundary even though there is contiguous land. North and South America are very defined landmasses separated by distinct physical boundaries with no real regard to culture. I have to assume you arent familiar with or dont understand the terms Central America or Latin America. These are regions defined by cultural similarities colonized by the Latin Countries Spain and Portugal and mostly Spanish speaking. Central America is all the Spanish speaking  except Belize again Im  generalizing  countries in North America INCLUDING MEXICO  basically all the countries in North America except the US and Canada. Latin America is all of South America as well as Central America and just a more broad term for the areas with Latin people within the Americas who contrast with the traditionally WASPy people of Canada and the US WASP stands for White AngloSaxon Protestant if you didnt know .TLDR Europe is its own continent just because.

5470113,0,t1_cwajrft,Sure! Im not sure if its a franchise policy or corporate but Ive only ever seen two people fired from the store I work at in the almost four years Ive worked there. General managers have no power to fire employees though they can hire and the most they can do is write them up and let upper management know about a problem.  Generally the best they can do is slash their hours as they set the weekly schedule until they take the hint and quit.One was a driver who was constantly making unwanted advances toward a female manager but even then there wasnt much our general manager could do but carefully note when these happened. Lets call him Jackass. He would write up Jackass for every tiny infraction because we all wanted him gone. At the time I and several other employees were angry enough with him to take him around back to the alley and kick his ass. I might have done it too but the GM said he was working as quickly as he could to get rid Jackass. Eventually he was cut down to one rush shift a week and even then he was late. The GM called him one day he was supposed to work and asked him where he was. Jackass said he was at least  minutes away and the GM told him not to bother. This was apparently the last straw and he was officially fired not long afterward.Another was a guy who was actually arrested for DWI I shit you not on a delivery. Lets call him Tipsy. I wasnt there the day this happened and only learned most of the details afterward.  Apparently Tipsy had been driving through a certain fancy neighborhood late one night running stop signs and swerving and a witness called the police.  A while later the store got a call from an officer asked if Tipsy worked there.  The manager in charge said yes he did and the officer said he was taking him to jail for suspected drunk driving. The weird thing was Tipsy was a very friendly person though he hadnt been there long only a month or so.  Nobody had ever seen him acting even sort of drunk or anything not even the day he was arrested.  We learned later that he had been fired from another pizza place for a similar reason.  As far as I know Tipsy is still in jail.  Even then upper management had him on the books for around three months afterward and had apparently had classified him as under a leave of absence until he had been found guilty.,NoStupidQuestions,cwaux30,1,t5_2w844

5475503,0,t3_3q2rvd,It sounds like something happened during that trip you really need to deal with and understand.  Have you considered talking to a professional about it?  Sometimes when we take drugs or otherwise change our thoughts things like memories weve long let go fears or worries come up and frighten us even more than they would on a normal day.  If this is the result of an unresolved issue a profession might help offer tools to cope more effectively than your boyfriend can.  The only other advise I can offer is to take time to deal with this issue. Trying to force yourself to be better is only going to add to your anxiety about getting better from this experience.  Understand that you got really freaked out and thats ok.  Its ok to still be scared its ok to have nightmares.  Dont hold yourself responsible for being scared right now just be understanding and know that it is ok.  Be gentle with yourself so you can heal and let this turn into a memory that fades in its ability to screw with your thoughts.  Do you do anything creative? Drawing writing painting sewing singing.. anything?  Have you tried incorporating the memories of that bad trip into something creative so you can see it in a way that you can deal with it?  For example for me I might embroider something that represents my fears.  Then when Ive finished the project I give myself some time to acknowledge those fears and that pain theyve caused and then I put it away physically.  Sometimes its important for me to have it hanging over my desk so I can acknowledge I am still working on that particular fear and its ok.  Other times it goes into a special box I have so I can physically put the fear away from my mind as a kind of ritual.  That ritual gives me a bit of control over deciding that its ok to heal.  It seems like such an obvious for healing to be ok but sometimes we have to give ourselves permission for it and that little ritual works for me.  Maybe there is a ritual like that that can be effective for you.In the mean timeHUG,NoStupidQuestions,cwbjowj,4,t5_2w844

5511008,0,t3_3qjll9,The comments here get to the core but I want to addclarify that while we often think of anime as a genre here in the west it is a medium  and in Japan anime just means animation.  Even Tom amp Jerry cartoons are anime in the Japanese language.   However  we tend to use anime to refer to anything with the manga style of cartooning so asking your question in this sense is rather broad.  It is akin to asking do you like Cartoon Style meaning everything from newspaper comics Disney Films to super heroes.  You see things in manga style from weekly comics films television Internet cartoons video games corporate logos and mascots.Keeping in mind that anime is a series of artistic conventions that is extremely prevalent in Japanese popculture remember that popularity is subject to trends.   Works can be popular because they are avant garde or nostalgic or any other reason that causes trendiness.  So if you asked an average Japanese Person if they liked anime you might get a firm disgusted no with them thinking of otaku fawning over Moe televisionshow waifus while they might also tell you of their respect for Miyazakis films. Even as a genre which it is not  within anime fandom youre bound to get different reactions like sci fi fans who love Star Trek but hate Star Wars or vice versa  or who like novels but dont watch shows or films. ,NoStupidQuestions,cwg2xub,6,t5_2w844

So things like under nourishment or even dehydration can lead to frail skin brittle nails and unhealthy hair.  However if someone is getting plenty of resources to fuel their bodies there is a lot that can be allocated for those less necessary processes.  So once the energy and nutrients are used throughout the body the rest gets stored away or disposed of as waste products.People who are often under weight or habitually dieting to stay at weight often are running at a deficit for calories and nutrients to avoid putting on weight.

5584997,0,t3_3rlxh1,I havent read any but its possible. The advertising term for it is advertorial where an editorial is written with the explicit purpose of advertising something on the sly.Suppose you have a new product. You hire a marketing firm to promote it. One of the ways that they may do that is to write up a bunch of editorial pieces that casually mentions your product as an example of whatever the editorial is supposed to be about. This allows them to create public awareness of the product without the public being aware that theyre reading advertising for that particular product. The marketing company then submits these editorials to various media outlets newspapers magazines websites or they may have contacts at such places that will run the editorial for them. When it appears in the media outlet it looks to the casual reader as if its just someones opinion on something and it just happens to mention Product X. Most people will take no notice but when a dozen of these show up over a month in different articles people will slowly become aware that the product exits and its benefits price etc. if the article does its job.,NoStupidQuestions,cwpdcrd,1,t5_2w844

5639281,0,t3_3sbtzp,I place skilled trades people in Canada in nearly every province. Historically the most dependably in demand jobs are Industrial Electricians and Millwrights. There will never not be openings for those two somewhere in the country  there are a lot of plants  facilities up here and the Millwrights  Electricians keep them running as necessarily as the power engineers do. With that said there is a lot of competition for roles like that if the location and pay are even near decent. Employers typically only have trouble filling these roles when the locations are less desirable or the pay is below market rate and thats where I come in. Some of the less common but highly sought after guys are dualticketed millwright  electricians and Instrumentation Technicians. Also those that are industrial electricians but also know how to program PLC modules are very rare and highly sought after  most of these guys know how to troubleshoot and repair PLCs but not program them. Companies pay a premium for ones that can. Other roles I fill that are super rare and sought after are Red Seal Sawfilers in the Pulp amp Paper industry and some of your more exotic welding types like ERW welders. All of these guys in trades start at K minimum in Canada and depending on your skills and whether your shop is unionized it only goes up from there. ,NoStupidQuestions,cww3uvw,2,t5_2w844

Likewise fully automatic assault rifles have been banned for civilian sale in ... but if you own one that was made before the law was written then you are good to go and can legally fire it and do whatever safe activity you want with it.Following the several thousand year history of ex post facto if Congress banned firearms sales in  people who already own guns could still do whatever they wanted with them.

It packs and holds together really well when youre rolling it. Weed youd roll into a joint is tiny little hardish chunks that dont usually hold together well at all so when youre rolling a joint its a lot harder to get it packed tightly and evenly like a cigarette. Then once you light it a cigarette stays more or less the same from beginning to end. You can move it around knock it against stuff etc. and its fine. But weed puts out a lot more tar and on top of not usually being as structurally sound as a cigarette to begin with the whole thing can get real soft and gooey and it doesnt always hold together very well even if it was rolled by someone who knew what they were doing. Holding a joint with the thumb and forefinger is often just the best way to handle it without it falling apart where it just really isnt an issue with cigarettes. ,NoStupidQuestions,cyi3fjf,3,t5_2w844

6143210,0,t1_cynvnvb,Yes for some time people used to think that its just a matter of defeating all the diseases thats where the rule that old age isnt an acceptable cause of death comes from. But most today accept it was a mistake.The thing is you arent just more likely to have a serious disease when you are older you are more likely to get one as well. The risk that you get cancer this year is much higher if you are  than if you are . If it was just because of disease you would expect people have a sort of half life  if half of all people live to   roughly one quarter should live to  and one eight to  but thats obviously not the case. People dont live longer than  or so no matter how healthy they are.Treatment also rarely makes old people healthy again. Your  years old athlete may live a healthy life if his heart is fixed but an old person not so much you can at best make them die slower. They wont get better and live to  they will get more and more ill anyway. Of course their heart stops beating or whatever but thats an equally futile pursuit as trying to cure AIDS by preventing all the infections.

6177739,0,t3_405sou,There are a few poor confused souls who have convinced themselves that the earth really is flat.With conspiracy theories like this its important to realize that theyve taken the scientific method and thrown it out the window. They dont gather all the evidence and then settle on the explanation that fits best. They pick an explanation that they want to be true and then try to find the way to make every piece of evidence fit with that explanation. To abandon their belief they require indisputable proof which is impossible because you can always imagine deeper levels of conspiracy to dismiss even the most damning of evidence. For example they would claim that pilots actually fly in a horizontal circle or just dismiss this claim as nonsense youve been told and never verified unless youve actually seen it for yourself. They tend to wind up investing so much of their self identity in their belief that the cognitive dissonance is blinding when theyre presented with evidence that would suggest their world view is wrong. They cant help but reject this its human nature.I had the experience of trying to convince a flat earther of the shape of the earth. His argument was that there ought to be video of earth spinning in space. I provided a thorough explanation of why such a video is hard to obtain and gave three separate videos that each show the sphericity of earth in their own ways. His response was to first claim that the videos were somehow fake and then to tell me that I was just noise and that Im just regurgitating the lies Ive been fed.

Jewish Israeli are made up of multiple races  there are Ashkenanim Jews of European descent Sephardim Jews of Spanish  Arabland descent Mizrahim Italian not to mention other smaller ethnic groups like Ethiopians. While there is surely some racism in these groups as there are in all most Jewish Israelis wouldnt have a problem with an Ashkenazic Jew marrying a Sephardic Jew for example.What they are more against  and I think is more in line with your question  is marrying someone who isnt Jewish. There are a number of reasons for this Judaism is a religion but there is a tribal component as well  Judaism is passed down through the mother but the tribal lineage goes through the father. With both parents fully Jewish the child has a sense of community  something very important to Jewish individuals.  There is a lot of antisemitism in world history which stokes the fear of marrying outsiders to those more insular.  Jews are a minority everywhere in the world except Israel. Most Israelis arent more than rd generation Israelis so the feeling of being an outsider is still very prevalent in the culture. How do outsider communities stay alive everywhere else in the world? They marry only each other. It can be complicated to raise children when the parents are of two different faiths? Mommy is one of the Chosen People  and Daddy believes that Jesus is magic. Very few people around the world would say its racist to want to marry someone who shares your beliefs or values  Jews are no different. ,NoStupidQuestions,cyul32p,3,t5_2w844

Picking numbers writing them down on a ticket and oh giving  over to a cashier. That is essentially all it is. Go buy a soda for that  get the receipt write the numbers you wouldve picked on the back of it. Baddabing You just accomplished more than most anyone playing the lottery and you also have one more soda than they do. And youve also avoided that unofficial tax on stupidity. Because lets face it About billion of the lotto winnings are gonna go to pay income taxes. Saying that the lotto as a whole isnt a tax of some sort I think is disingenuous. The lotto is effectively a tax on people who dont grasp basic mathematics. I get that it may be fun to do certain things but that doesnt really mean its not also stupid. An action can be both fun and stupid many actions are. Playing the lotto might be fun for some but its stupid regardless. ,NoStupidQuestions,cyvnn1r,-1,t5_2w844

Go to a shop if it goes down faster.Bent rim IE metal part hit a curb or object hard enough to flatten tire and dent it. A shop can bang it back with a hammer in most cases.Leaking valve. You may hear an air hiss from the stem where the air is put into the tire. Replace the stem is cheap for a shop.Puncture. You ran over a nail screw other sharp object. Air escapes from hole.

6321315,0,t3_42744h,Obviously it depends on who the capturing force is and how resistant the city people are as well as things like why and how the city was captured. But in your example of WWII I can think of two examples that were a bit different. Paris was captured by the Germans early in the war you may have seen Hitler on the Eiffel Tower. He was pretty impressed with himself. For the vast majority of the French life went on as normal the Florist opened in the morning and sold flowers the money they used for a short time was still the Franc. The Germans needed Paris to carry on it is a huge city and to upset its inhabitants would just cause hassle. So for the Germans and the French for it to carry on as normal suited everyone. Over time they used the Reich Mark and had to concede buildings to the Germans as well as getting ID cards and other documents and licences that the German occupiers demanded. But the baker baked the street cleaner cleaned. Obviously some were less enthusiastic and set up resistance cells but in the general area of Paris very little was done by them. At the end of the war everything just went back to normal apart from the courts prosecuting the collaborators. But all through that the sewers were fixed and the water stayed on. On the other hand some cities do not fair well. Warsaw would be an example of where life did not go on as normal. The Germans invaded Poland at the start of the war it was that action that caused Britain and France to declare war Warsaw had a large Jewish population and they were moved to a part of the city which was then effectively kept seperate from the rest of Warsaw. For the people who lived in the Warsaw Ghetto life was not normal there was little food and no money and no way to get either. It was pretty desperate. There was a rebellion but that was put down with extreme force. The sewers were not fixed and the water did not run here. Warsaw was devastated by the invasion and took a long time to recover. ,NoStupidQuestions,cz85wzm,3,t5_2w844

The presence of a factual statement does not make something not logic and your subjective interpretation of a set of arguments andor evidence aka assertion which is what it is is most certainly not a fact and at the very least even if it was a fact it should be easily defensible with either a resource pointing to a scientific study that claims a higher possibility of an afterlife existing than of nothing happening after death to be the case or a strongly coherent set of logical arguments. You have provided none of these and your original premise is logically false by both philosophically technical and lamen usages of the term so Im asking you to provide them. PS.

I have serious reservations how him being elected would be perceived by the world not to mention he really has no platform to speak of. Edit I will give Trump some credit in this regard It is nice to see a Republican get on stage and not constantly pander to the religious elements of their party. I wish more Republicans would follow his lead on this.Ultimately I do not feel that the vast majority of EITHER party really cares about the people of America. There are a few individuals here and there that really seem to care and while you may not agree with all of their positions you can tell they are only trying to advocate what they truly feel would be best for this county.

This is the means by which a growing population sustains itself.  Through specialization and technology more people are able to do more with the same amount of resources.  For example  years ago humanity could not have possibly created the amount of food it does now.

6520953,0,t3_44yg97,gtDo I need to have a job or some sort of income or what?Typically youll need an income. No financial institution will loan you money if they arent certain that theyll be repaid. You might get a private loan like from a friend or relative even if you dont have a job but I would assume thats not what youre talking about.As uuser mentioned you can have a cosigner on the loan which may get you a loan without having a job. That depends on the institution making the loan and your cosigners credit rating and possibly collateral i.e. you or your cosigner provides some physical item of value to secure the loan. Usually the car that you want the loan for will itself be the collateral. The bank will hold the title until you pay the loan in full. If you default they will repossess the car.In general though assume that you need not only a job but a minimum income threshold after expenses. For example just because you make year doesnt mean that youd get a loan if you spend year.gtPlus how will it effect my financial future??Assuming that you pay the loan payment on time and in full each month then it will positively affect your financial future as you will build credit by showing that youre a good credit risk. Fail to make payments or make partial payments and your credit score takes a hit which can make future loans renting apartments and even getting a job more difficult.Basically dont take out a loan if you dont have to. Dont take out a loan for more than you can actually and easily afford the monthly payments. Dont miss payments.Id also suggest that you head over to rpersonalfinance. Ask them about any questions you have about loans. If you find someone who will give you a loan ask for advice on that sub before you sign anything. Theyre sharp people when it comes to this sort of thing. Also get advice from them on general finances like budgeting credit cards savings retirement planning no youre not too young to start thinking about it etc. If you have student loans ask about those as well. It seems like every week someone is posting about how the sub helped them plan for and pay off tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt in just a few years. However keep in mind that all of the financial advice theyll offer you requires discipline. If youre an impulsive spender then youll need to reign that in budget and save for things you want rather than buying something on a whim because its new and shiny.As a side note negotiate on the car. Dont accept the sticker price and if you actually pay the sticker price then make sure theyre throwing in all sorts of options perks and bonuses for free. They need you more than you need them. Dont be afraid to walk away. There are tons of car dealers you can go to but how many customers does that particular dealer see in a day? Youre the one with all the power particularly if youre preapproved for the loan. Remember that.,NoStupidQuestions,czttg8u,3,t5_2w844

6544875,0,t3_45a191,I am not a theoretical physicist by any means but I have a strong science background. In order for a hoverboard to work in the manner depicted in Back to the Future we need to counteract the force applied toward the ground with a person standing on top of a board. No easy task. In terms of theoreticalquantum physics we want to be looking at either the graviton the theoretical particle that accounts for gravity or the HiggsBosen the particle that accounts for mass. If we can manipulate one of these two particles hoverboards could be in our future. A more practical although not quite as cleancut way of counteracting the force of gravity would be to use repelling magnetic forces. Why havent we done this? The amount of magnetic force needed to not only lift a platform with a human on it but to fully stabilize it is immense. The hoverboard would also only work on ferromagnetic surfaces so no cruising down your sidewalk. We can create this immense magnetic force but it requires a high amount of energy and heat is a byproduct. The reason I bring this up is because superconductors could allow this. There is a lot of research going into superconductors at the moment and we have a few but none of them are at room temperature and pressure. Electricity creates a magnetic field as it travels. A superconductor is a way for electricity to travel with no resistance. With enough current the electricity creates a noticeable magnetic field this is the basics of how MRI machines work. Hope this helps a bit. ,NoStupidQuestions,czwakde,1,t5_2w844

6594460,0,t3_45zy7f,Probably depends on how much there is to still talk about when theres no new material to discuss  whether the finished body of the series is complex enough to keep revisiting for new interpretations and insights that keep the fandom ticking over. Also whether theres a continued inflow of new fans arriving late to the finished series  even if they end up having the same sorts of discussions repeatedly.As a case study I have in mind an online serial novel Ive read subject matter superheroes but finding ways to rationalise some of the inherent silliness of the genre and with a large stable of unique characterspowers a lot of grey morality and antagonists with genuine motives rather than evil for the sake of evil. It was published a chapter at a time and came to an end in November of  but still has an active subredditrParahumans going over all the intricacies of the unknowns in the plot and of the characters and their motives and abilities and whatnot.Some of that discussion is repetitive but occasionally some new theory comes along with something thats not been spotted before. Theres also fanfiction in the same universe and new people drawn in by word of mouth to keep things turning over and older fans are also kept coming back for discussion of the authors subsequent works in very different genres but similar in tone and quality which seems to improve retention... although perhaps that makes it an ongoing fandom around the author rather than strictly for the completed work.,NoStupidQuestions,d01f6ee,1,t5_2w844

6646965,0,t3_46ozpa,Really our light system on cars isnt efficient in any way. It made sense back when cars werent as popular but now our roads are so crowded that I think some modifications would be nice. I think front brake lights may be nice although not necessary. It may have problems though. It could provide too much distraction behind you and you may end up not paying attention to whats ahead. Another very similar one that was pointed out to me was how brake lights are either on or off when they should be a spectrum. If youre behind a car and they slam on their brake you may not immediately realize. Other times a slight tap of the break may be confusing to other drivers.

Choosing a nominee for the Democrat and Republican party is done state by state so many polls are looking at likely voters for each state.

6659181,0,t3_46v0r3,A good component was artificial scarcity.  Each store was deliberately restricted to a specific quantity of product making the item a rare find in a specific geography.  The manufacturer Ty would then retire particular toys and introduce new editions.  Same restrictions were imposed of limited production and availability and that drove up sales and speculation.  Also the retirements became a public event and people anxiously waited to hear what the latest retirement list would include.  Consumers would frantically anticipate what these public retirement announcements included and speculation also prospered with predictions of which toy might be retired next.Rinse and repeat.  Each new Beanie Baby that was released would follow a similar pattern with the scarcity being several hundred thousand.  Keep in mind this started in the mids where the Internet was still in its infancy.  There werent many online retailers at that time.  If you couldnt find something at your neighborhood store it wasnt an easy click online to get it from a virtual store.  The auction site ebay was relatively new in the late s amazon wasnt a household name and brickandmortar retailers were not monetizing with much effort.  Despite the fact the toys were mass produced this lack of commonplace availability created tremendous buzz because of the implied rarity concocted by Ty.  The toys were meant for children but the adults would have nothing of this and were hoarding them because of the perceived market value.  The market became overwhelmingly saturated with mint condition MWMT  mint with mint tags items and the socalled scarcity was deemed a mere illusion.  Ty knew exactly what was transpiring and direct product sales could be exploited because the consumer would still purchase the item even if the target audience children wouldnt be able to play with it.  Throw in the selling ice to the Eskimos analogy since people were buying something they wouldnt use.Therefore the secondary market became hot through speculation because of the popularity.  That secondary market could earn a windfall through auctions based on the artificial demand.  As products were intentionally retired consumers would grab new releases and maintain them in mint condition. The secondary market just sat on the sidelines licking their chops and waited for a buyer.There was the situation of the haves secondary market and the have nots prospective collectors.  The have nots were seeking the rarest ones with the intention of a longterm price gain because the lack of availability in their area made that a must have collectors item.  However the secondary market was looking to turn a quick buck with shortterm gains.  If xseller was advertising a price of  then yseller could market the item for  and still make an  profit.  So xseller could reduce the price to  just to unload the item with the knowledge that there were many other mint items on the market.  However yseller also wants to unload the item and may also reduce it to .Eventually the buzz eventually died down because there were far too many products on the market.  The bubble burst but Ty still made a fortune through artificial scarcity.,NoStupidQuestions,d0847j9,41,t5_2w844

Its likely that you have a leak coming through a wall and running across the floor or coming from a pipe underneath. Is the wet spot near a wall? Is it near a bathroom kitchen or laundry room? Does the carpet get more squishy when it rains or when you run water showers toilets kitchen sinks washing machines etc.? Do pipes run under the floor?First I would try to look under the floor. If you have a basement or crawlspace look to see if there are pipes that are running under the floor that might have a seal or gasket that needs replacing. It could also be from uninsulated pipes that are gathering condensation. Thats an easy fix just wrap the pipes in insulation you can get from the hardware store.If that doesnt work climb on the roof and take a look at your roofing. Look for any lose shingles or missing flashing. Also check your gutters and downspouts. Make sure they are cleaned out and not overflowing and causing rot.If you still havent found the problem you can check by monitoring your water usage. Your carpet is probably going to have to be replaced anyway mold etc. so rip the carpet out and then turn on each appliance or faucet one by one and watch which triggers the leak.If all of this seems too daunting for you to do on your own you can call a general contractor.

6705617,0,t3_47gxzz,At the very lowest level CPUs are mostly made from gates which are made from several MOSFET transistors which are actually diodes with a rd junction which is silicon layered with more silicon.A little bit higher than gates are multiplexers encoders decoders flipflops registers etc. Those units which are made from gates really begin creating data paths and control units.To understand better understand the x you can look at its ancestors   and the . The circuitry and data path is rather simple and easy to follow. A more modern CPU design is the MIPS CPU. A quick image search for mips alu will bring up images of the simplified data path but to really understand what is going from a programming aspect you will need to dive into ASM which assembly language. MIPS assembly is a good start as there are tons of resources and even a free code simulator you can being to create programs out of assembly!Backing up the C code you write gets compiled to assembly and the assembly code get compiled into machine code and the machine code is uploaded to the flash memory that is connected through a bus to the CPU. Machine code is raw binary data which is then decoded by a complicated array of gates that control more gates and those gates tells the CPU where to grab data how to process the data and where to store the data. When the system boots up it begins reading instructions from the first memory address of the flash memory and begins the program. This is from the MIPS perspective and likely the x is very similar considering they are both Harvard architecture. Source Jr. in Computer Engineering.,NoStupidQuestions,d0cx31z,6,t5_2w844

6732124,0,t3_47u6pq,There are a couple of sides to this question. First of all we dont know for sure that life formed here. It may be that life formed elsewhere and microbes hitched a lift on comets. Basically the same process that NASA try to avoid in reverse when they sterilise rovers.If it did form here then maybe yes life had a few shots at happening but fizzled a few times before taking hold. If it did we may never know because it would be really hard to find the traces. If we are life . and we found a specimen from life . wed probably just consider it our ancestor unless there was evidence to say otherwise.Different mechanics would be a sure smoking gun. There are other hypothetical types of biochemistry and they may even exist on earth. It seems more reasonable to me though that different biochemistry would be more likely in a different environment such as another planet.These days its pretty unlikely that life is continuing to pop up. The Oxygen Catastrophe was when photo synthesising bacteria finally overwhelmed the environments ability to absorb the terrible corrosive oxygen that they produced as waste and it started poisoning the air and killing all the anaerobic life on earth. Its possible that new life tries to pop up from time to time but gets bleached to death almost immediately by all the oxygen in the environment.,NoStupidQuestions,d0fnsi8,3,t5_2w844

6803050,0,t3_48xssa,Social justice warriors is a term used for anyone who is thought to stand up for things like social inequities its often used in an insulting manner as a way to discredit or dismiss what the person has to say.  There is no one  party line of SJWs to follow and they can be standing up for any number of causes some locally and some globally.  it is possible to care about multiple issues so just because you see someone who makes a remark associated with SJWs doesnt mean they dont also care about another issue.  For instance people who are standing up for rape victims rights in the US arent necessarily ignoring that rape also happens elsewhere or that there are people who are at risk of not surviving until the next day.  They are simply speaking out about a topic they can change in their community. What that topic is depends on the individual.  Some will focus on things you find trivial which is find you find it trivial it doesnt mean they do while others will focus on larger issues i.e. rape as mentioned above. ,NoStupidQuestions,d0nf3fz,11,t5_2w844

6805037,0,t3_48kpss,This is an unanswerable question.Terminal velocity is a function  of the shape mass surface roughness density of it etc. Lethality is not a defined concept either as it would depend on where it hit the person the path it took through the body and the behavior of the object inside the body.So you could try to optimize the object with increased density low surface area perpendicular to the direction of travel making it very smooth and having the person stand at a higher elevation.Examples gold is better than aluminum due to density. Shape it like a bullet with a pointy tip and fat back so that it travels through the air easier. Gave the person in Denver as opposed to new Orleans. Surface roughness is a tricky one because aluminum is better than gold here but is less dense. One possibility would be to plate the outside of a gold bullet with aluminum. You would sacrifice mass but get less drag.The lethality is harder. If the bullet struck the skull it would take a lot speed to generate the force needed to penetrate. If it hit soft flesh it could piece easier but is less likely to kill. While there is not an answer to your question as stated looking into ballistics theory and the terminal velocity section of a physics textbook could give you a general understanding of how and why a certain object could be fatal at its terminal velocity.,NoStupidQuestions,d0nn8us,1,t5_2w844

Then tomorrow morning youll go to sleep and hopefully sleep through the day. Bam night schedule. This way is far less healthy and youll probably fall asleep at least a couple times on your night shifts at first. A few pro tips get some heavy black curtains for your bedroom and earplugs. These make sleeping during the day infinitely easier especially if your room is normally bright and your neighborhood is loud. Turn your phone to silent so friends and family dont call you during the day everyone you know is going to forget that you work nights so theyll call you when youre sleeping all the time. And dont be on your phone browsing reddit before going to sleep. Also once you get into the night time sleep schedule try to keep it as much as you can. Switching back and forth will make everything awful. If you dont already start taking a vitamin D supplement. Youre going to get less sunlight and that can lead to some depression.

I have had some professors who absolutely hate this my class is special and you should treat it as such and some who think that its a smart idea to minimize the workload. In many cases it wont be too big of an issue. However if you were to do this and I did many a time its a twostep process. First you write the base paper that could apply to both classes. Then you edit it twice once for each class. In these edits you add specific details that relate to each course. For instance this could involve adding commentary that relates to things the professors have said sources that have been either used or recommended in class or a few paragraphs making sure to specialize your paper for that specific class. Then you go through that process again for the second class. This way youre writing pretty much the same paper using many of the same sources and ideas and thus that much less work but without just copypasting it. The resulting paper often ends up with source material and ideas from both classes too which may lead to a stronger product overall. ,NoStupidQuestions,d179h6h,3,t5_2w844

Some cities are known as sanctuary cities which prohibit public funds and resources from being used to enforce federal immigration laws usually by not allowing police or municipal employees to inquire about an individuals immigration status. Sometimes this is an actual law thats on the books and sometimes its just the way the city operates on an unofficial level. So yes in such cities illegal immigrants would have no fear of going to the police to report a crime if say they were robbed or assaulted. They could also go to a lawyer and enter into a lawsuit either as a plaintiff or defendant without fear of being deported. The idea behind it is that by allowing illegal immigrants to make use of police and the legal system without fear of being deported the city as a whole will benefit with reduced crime since illegal immigrants can come forward as witnesses or file police reports etc.,NoStupidQuestions,d1edyvv,1,t5_2w844

Your problem is going to be that because people tend to hold guns roughly level with their eyes you are going to start slowly spinning head over heels unless youve had the foresight to be holding on to something much more massive than you are. ,NoStupidQuestions,d1g89av,2,t5_2w844

The outer layers of the earth have to move farther to keep up with the inner layers so as you move inward youll be moving sideways faster than the walls of the tunnel and will collide. With particularly deep mine shafts you can drop bowling balls into them and theyll never hit the bottom.Heres a copy pasta from another comment I made on the subjectSort of... The problem isnt so much that its just a long way down Its also very hot. Like incredibly hot. The temperature at the center of the earth is around  degrees Celsius. In perspective the melting point of tungsten the metal with the high melting point is  degrees Celsius. Note that those temperatures are only applicable at normal pressures in the center of the earth the pressure is . Million times the pressure at the surface. So in order to make a tube going through the center of the earth it would have to be . strong enough to support a pressure difference of . million atmospheres in order to keep the interior nondeadly.. Insulative enough to keep the interior  degrees cooler..  km across larger than any manmade structure.Making a structure that can do all of those things is just beyond our current understanding of materials. Anyways assume we make the tunnel. Itd have to be more complicated than just jumping in and falling all the way through due to angular momentum. since the earth is spinning youre actually moving east really fast all the time. As you get closer to the center that part of the earth doesnt have to move as far to spin the same amount so it has less eastward velocity. heres a picture demonstrating the idea the arrows are the velocity of rocks at a given distance from the core Now imagine taking a rock from the surface and moving it towards the center. Suddenly the rock is moving way faster than the rocks around it and it crashes into the side of the hole. The rock is you if you tried to jump into the hole. And this actually doesnt take very long to come into effect bowling balls dropped down mine shafts never hit the bottom because they hit the side first.So all in all youve got a lot of problems but I guess theoretically you could make the whole thing out of layers of graphene which conduct heat terrifically along the mesh but terribly between layers of mesh and maybe itd work. If you made it go from the North pole to the South pole the rotation issue wouldnt be a problem and you could freefall all the way through the earth in  minutes though if you made a straight tunnel through the earth between any two points and freefell through it itd still take  minutes no matter how far.,NoStupidQuestions,d1ope3n,6,t5_2w844

7296847,0,t3_4fc8o0,The two main ones you need to know about are drip coffee and espresso.Drip brew also known as filtered or pour over is made from hot water poured over ground coffee beans on top of a filter. The water is allowed to naturally pass through the beans and filter via gravity and drips down into the cup. This is the most common thing people mean when they just say a cup of coffee. At starbucks drip brew coffee is often offered in several different blends. A blend refers to a set of coffee beans from a particular source or group of sources and roasted a particular way which subtly changes the flavor. If you dont know the difference just ask for the house blend or blend of the day.Espresso is made by taking similar ground coffee beans and hot water but instead of just letting the water flow through the beans high pressure is used to force the water through the beans. This creates a much more dense concentrated drink. A shot of espresso is much smaller than a cup of coffee and stronger tasting but has about the same or even more caffeine.Many of the drinks you see listed at Starbucks are actually made from espresso mixed with other things. Americano latte mocha cappuccino and so on are all just one or more shots of espresso depending on the size you order or if you order extra shots mixed or topped with foam water hot milk flavor syrups and other such things.Once youve got those two general ideas down the barista can help you figure out the rest of the details. For example you can order almost any starbucks drink iced which means they brew it hot or cold for certain drinks then pour it over a whole bunch of ice for a drink that tastes similar but is more refreshing on a hot day.,NoStupidQuestions,d27loep,2,t5_2w844

7335753,0,t3_4fu42p,SJWSocial Justice Warrior as I understand it started out describing a very specific sort of overenthusiastic activist.Specifically the sort who thrives on conflict and outrage who takes every cause so deeply to heart that anyone who disagrees or even agrees less enthusiastically is an evil enemy who sees no room for compromise or diplomacy and who tends to take up fights on behalf of others where if they asked the people in question theyd be told there were bigger priorities.But as with any convenient insult the definition got stretched and loosened and misapplied and used so repetitively that it lost all real meaning and now its mostly a derogatory term for anyone at all who expresses the slightest bit of care for equality between genders races sexualities... or any other demographic trait you care to name.If Im honest I think at this point it tells you more about the person calling someone an SJW than it does about the one being called it. Edit for etymology it occurs to me that it sort of overlaps with keyboard warrior  meaning someone who tries to set the worlds ills to rights exclusively through the medium of posting on the internet.

Advertisers never shut up about them but their positive benefits are unproven.The epidemiology is generally considered to be flawed too. The issue is that when you compare moderate drinkers with total abstainers you are not comparing like with like.

7434493,0,t3_4h3x54,Well LiPo batteries generally can catch fire if they are charged over their maximum cell voltage around  .V or if they get punctured. So you should definitely invest in a quality charger and charge them somewhere fireproof A metal box or a plant pot for example. To be extra safe you can put a sandbag over it so that in case of a fire the sand pours out and extinguishes the flames. This is just a fundamental property of LiPo batteries though so it doesnt really matter if you have cheap or expensive ones in this regard.But there will be of course differences in the build quality. Cheaper ones could fall apart sooner for example.Cheap batteries also often have over exaggerated too high ratings on them. The capacity in mAh basically says how long the battery will last before you have to charge them again. The Cnumber gives the maximum discharge rate how much current the battery can supply. If this number is too low your motors wont be able to work with full power.The batteries also have a limited number of charge cycles cheaper ones might start losing capacity sooner than more expensive ones.A popular and cheap store is hobbyking Their stuff is usually good and you can read reviews before you buy.Edit Solid beginner packs are for example the Turnigy or Zippy ones.The rmulticopter also has a nice section on batteries ,NoStupidQuestions,d2n9659,2,t5_2w844

That might just mean that they wont help you get it working again if there are problems.  That might mean that theyll cut off your signal when they realize its an old modem.I cant speak for ATampT but the complaint about Comcast around here is that even if the modem is on the supported list Tier  customer service cantwont activate it unless its the exact same model theyre currently renting out to new subscribers.  So you end up jumping through hoops to get the modem activated and then every time after that when theres a problem.  The other complaint is that Comcast modems just up and stop working every year or so requiring you to take them in to the local Comcast office and swap them out.

Overall accumulation of data can also contribute to longer seek times Im not sure if this applies with solid state drives or not. Second this can happen if you pick up a virus or spyware or some other piece of malware that runs in the background. But the main reason is usually just feature creep on the software you use.

So the bridge would not only need to be flexible enough to cope with storms hurricans not only high enough not to hinder ships but movable enough to grow a few mm  year.And A bridge by itself would be worthless as most cars would run out of gas on the way. So youd need to build a lot of infrastructure as well  gas stations garages towing police  firefighters. Moreover such a bridge would be over international waters  so youd need to find an agreement in whose jurisdiction the bridge would be. And as such a thing has never been tried before youd not only waste a lot of money workforce and material but youd have to invent a lot of new technology.And further thinking about this...

Honestly I cant tell you the eye color of some of my friends Ive known for more than a decade!  But I could of my exgirlfriends so you know.As for hair color a bit more unique. Are you absolutely lost as in you dont remember if someone has blonde or brown hair? If so that may be a specific problem and do let me know if thats it. If its more subtle such as not remembering if someone has lightbrown or darkbrown hair then this is also somewhat normal. The memorization process is much more fragmented then people believe and even relatively large changes can go unnoticed. For example I wear contacts I always do. I wore glasses to a volunteering position once and half of the people only said You look different today..

7645065,0,t1_d3b6ney,Restructuring the education system does not seem to be uncommon. The curriculum changes all the time. Not everyone needs to learn it only the newer people need to learn it probably in addition to the traditional language. People learn second languages all the time in school so it doesnt seem too far fetched.I kind of understand your point on people not being able to clearly formulate thoughts but I believe that is a byproduct of using the traditional language for too long rather than anything else. Languages like Chinese or Japanese do not use grammar like articles and those people got by perfectly fine. If we take the most efficient parts of every language and combine them it would be efficient and still possible to speak given that it came from natural languages.  I think the biggest problem with languages such is Loglan Lojiban and Esperanto is that I had to clue until recently about those languages. I already been through school and heard nothing about it. Had I learned an efficient language from the day I was born this wouldnt have been a problem. The fact is many other people have also never heard of these constructed languages as in the school systems there are mainly major languages being teached.

And that customers wanting to eat at your place can call ahead and be guaranteed a table. I eat regularly at a fairly expensive ChopHouse. It has  tables is open for  hours a day  days a week. Meals take about  hours if you order all the courses. Thats  tables per week.

7723424,0,t1_d3ixj56,Dear Christ there are a lot of men in these comments making wildly inaccurate claims. Ive been all over the comments but I think this is the first time I responded directly to you OP so hopefully I can clarify some of the bullshit as a vagina owner and operator of  years. obligatory As a woman...  To give you an idea of just how much bullshit has been spread around and how many people actually believe said bullshitdown further in the comments someone tried to delegitimize my argument against this having anything to do with the Gspot by calling me a virgin with the assumption that Im also a man.What the woman is rubbing in the gif is the mons pubis which is the fatty cushion that wraps around the pubic bone . Note the Pubic Arch and Pubic Symphysis compare to  as a protective layer.While a lot of people think of the clitoris as just being that nubbin there up in the folds its actual form is much larger and spread out than previously assumed and what shes doing in this gif is indirect clitoral stimulation and using the fatty tissue of the mons pubis to dull the sensation and spread it over a larger surface area for a deeper sense of pleasure. . Note the illustration on the bottom right how the clitoral gland wraps around the Pubic Arch and Symphysis Putting pressure on the tissue above dulls the sensation because just like the penis the clitoris can become shockingly sensitive and you dont always want to touch the exposed nub directly. Thats why when telling others how to digitally masturbate a woman they say change it up try different thingsbecause the nerves can become hypersensitive or the sensory overload could cause your brain to choose to ignore it in which case she would become desensitized. And thats no fun at all.When you talk about massaging closer to the navel theres not much related to the genitalia up therethats pretty much all intestines. However the pressure feels really good sometimes because sex can cause women to experience cramps like menstrual cramps but unrelated to menstruation and its... hard to describe how the massage feels but it can be pretty nice. Its like a deep ache and when youre still sensitive down there with all the pleasure centers excited its a very different feeling. Youre actually just rubbing the pubic muscles not the reproductive organs but its all connected by fascia and the nervous system. It spreads the sensation further through the body and disperses so it doesnt feel nearly as strong and I dont think many women could orgasm by doing that by itself but I could imagine it being a relaxing way to come down from an orgasm.Someone suggested this was massaging the Gspot but thats pretty much physically impossible from the outside and its nowhere near the navel. There was another person that suggested she was massaging the cum out which is definitely physically impossible as shes pushing on her pubic bone not the outside of her vaginal wall. It isnt maleable you cant squeeze the cum out like a tube of toothpaste.Also if it helps you to understand the clit betterthe clit is a penis. Your penis literally was a clit and the labia are the testes also literally so please be gentle with them and please for the love of God stop biting at them! In reference to a conversation I had on rTrollXChromosomes the other dayapparently a lot of ladies partners think it feels good to use their teeth and will ignore them when they say to stop doing that particular action.

7784425,0,t1_d3r0hr0,No I am Canadian and my parents were both Canadian. Italy is a young country and it has changed citizenship laws a lot so there are numerous permutations and combinations of how you may qualify. I am pretty sure Canada has no restrictions on how many citizenships you can hold my wife has  working on .In my case my grandfather arrived in Canada married by grandmother here and had their kids here. My grandfather became a naturalized Canadian citizen about a year after my father was born. Therefore from the perspective of Italian law my father and all his descendants are Italian unless they renounce Italian citizenship. So if I would have renounce Italian citizenship all my offspring would no longer be eligible. My fathers siblings were born after my grandfather became a naturalized Canadian and therefore neither they nor their descendants would be eligible unless there is another twist I am unaware of.I had to document all of this which took about a year and presto we all became Italian citizens. I now am documenting my wifes citizenship which is complicated by missing birth documents. Because of when we were married once I document her history she will automatically become Italian by marriage. If we would have married a few years later after the law was changed she would only be entitled if she emigrated there.I learned a lot about my heritage where my grandparents were from etc through this process.

Rabies risk aside and there is always a risk when youre talking about raccoons there is also raccoon roundworm to consider. Its a GI parasite that many raccoons carry. Wont make them sick but can be transmitted to the dogs or to you. Transmission is not super common and often symptoms are mild but the parasite likes to migrate to inappropriate locations since its in the wrong host so your dogs or you could end up with larval migrans somewhere very unfortunate like eyes or brain. In some instances can be fatal to people am not actually sure about dogs. If you have any small children on the property theyre going to be even more susceptible.Heres a good link   I was taught in vet school that you literally have to blowtorch the raccoon poop to kill the parasite eggs because they are so hardy.

Its a fun but really complicated subject.There are doctors and biologists in this forum so I hope they explain it better than me...Simple sugar metabolism is your first source of energy. You crash when you use it up too quickly and catnt get into your other energy stashes fast enough. You have sugar stored in your liver in the form of a polymer called glycogen. You can tap into a maximum  hour supply of the stuff when youre fasting.Then theres protein metabolism called gluconeogenesis. It steals your gains. Takes proteins in your body converts them to sugars then brekas down the sugars for energy. It makes ketones as a byproduct. People who eat keto diets are trying to trigger this kind of metabolism deliberately.Then theres fatty acid oxidation which is a great way to get energy unfortunately its the last one to get tapped into.

7861416,0,t3_4mznxm,The most confusing part of economic analysis for me is nailing down the time frame and the counterfactual.Timeframe means when you expect to see something change. Lots of demand might raise price over the short term but economies of scale come into play and we see that popular goods become cheaper over time. So its really hard predict anything but the immediate reaction with this sort of simple cause and effect analysis.In the case of wages increasing for a given business freeze time and examine at what has just happened. Without anything else changing the costs for our business have just gone up. The goal of a business firm is to maximize profit and all the decisions up to this point have been based around the previous costs. The way in which the business responds to this increase in cost depends entirely on the individual situation  there are many things that can possibly happen and raising prices is one of them. You are correct that there are also many other options. Most people agree about the above few ideas in the case of a single business but the debate is about what manymost businesses would do if this change happened to the whole market.Usually raising prices would reduce sales because there is less demand for normal goods at higher prices but when consumers have more money to spend they might be willing to pay higher prices. Maybe people wont pay higher prices and some businesses will have to reduce costs in order to maximize profit  by firing workers or changing production. Ultimately many different things will happen but the combination of all of these consumers and businesses making individual decisions  the economy. Depending on which school of thought you subscribe to this increase in both demand for products and cost of production can have very different long term effects.edit  heres some further reading I referenced ,NoStupidQuestions,d3zozzo,1,t5_2w844

The average person I encounter with a Mac doesnt give a shit about any of the history between Windows and Apple and probably isnt even aware of it.

7916935,0,t1_d45xlis,Any time someone takes information from somewhere else it is a secondary source.  Think about it this way.  You witness an event and write it down. That is a primary source.  However if I take your statement and reference it it is a secondary source.THe distinction is important.  Because if I am looking to find a reaction to the event or specific details I need to go as closely to original account as possible.  Anything that uses those primary sources is interpreting the information and leaves room for  details to be altered or interpreted differently than originally intended.  Now if you were writing about the historians view point on the tax documents then his records would be primary sources because you arent looking for the information of the records themselves rather how the historian read and interpreted them. ,NoStupidQuestions,d45xsgb,2,t5_2w844

They did convict him for failing to show up in court on the shotgun related charge.Short story is this Weaver was a survivalist and white separatist nonviolent racist nut in Idaho.  Idahos panhandle area near Hayden Lake attracted a lot of that sort because its between two northsouth mountain ranges and the main winds running across the continent tend to miss it so survivalists looked at it as a natural bomb shelter of sorts.  Weaver was doing some informal gunsmithing on the side for minor money  nothing illegal or at least not drastically so.Weaver had attended at least one meeting of the Aryan Nations but decided overt racial violence wasnt his thing.  The feds wanted him to infiltrate them as an informant.  He told the feds to fuck off.  The feds BATF in particular sent an informant to have him chop a long  barrel shotgun down to a minimum legal configuration   barrel and  overall.  Weaver did so.  The feds chopped it some more and filed charges of making a sawedoff federal majorgrade yearsinprison felony and were going to bust him.  Weaver held up in his mountain home feds did a badly botched raid killed his wife and son.Around the same time there were a rash of what we called the  and three quarters cases involving shotguns and federal charges.  We knew they were bullshit.  See...when you set up a shotgun properly you mount the front sight about  back so that as you raise it through a duck blind the front sight doesnt get hung up.  Like soSo when the feds wanted to shorten these to be illegal to nail somebody they didnt want to bother remounting the front sight so theyd chop the part out front of the sight and get something barely illegal that they could still put somebody away for  years on.  Theres no other good explanation as to why thered be a rash of people all of a sudden that stupid as to barely create a felony...fuck if youre going to make an illegal shotgun do this or so barrel on that bad boy....legal only with massive annoying federal paperwork and a tax paid ahead of time and flat banned in a lot of states.Late in Bills administration when the GOP had taken over congress they held hearings on defunding BATF over fraudulent bullshit like this.  Once Dubya took office one of the good things he did was to tell them to KNOCK IT THE FUCK OFF and they obeyed.  To his credit Obama didnt rescind that order.  There was only one major case of attempted false charges against a gun dealer by the BATFE they added e for explosives at some point and it was connected to the FastnFurious case.Short form Arizona gun dealer Andre Howard owner of Lone Wolf Trading Company did a lot of the FastnFurious gun transfers at the direction of federal agents.  The whole thing looked sketchy as hell and unknown to the feds Andre made extensive audio and video recordings of those fucks telling him to do specific illegal gun deals.  When the whole thing went south they tried to pin massive felonies on Andre  he escaped life in prison only because he had stashed copies of those recordings with his lawyer.Andre can be linked to FampF here...but the fact that they tried to frame him in the aftermath isnt easy to find.  He entered into a quiet settlement and the news on that part of the fiasco didnt get broadly reported.  When it first happened however Andre reported it to an Arizona gunrights discussion board which is now defunct.  Ill see if I can find another source.This is the only case of false charges by the BATFE against a gun owner or dealer that I know of from after the Clinton administration.  There were a shitload during Bills reign.  Gun owners fear a return of those bad old days if the two Clinton sickos get back in the White House...and if she tries to bring back the bullshit that she helped manage during Bills tenure theres liable to be serious serious trouble.The bastards DID however try to do false charges against one of their own agents not long ago...accusing him of burning his own house down and deliberately failed to protect him from severe threats from some Hells Angels he busted.So theres no question the fuckers still have the potential to do all kinds of chaos.,NoStupidQuestions,d4k86cy,4,t5_2w844

This may cause some of them to consider moving to Paris or elsewhere. This would change employment for many.. Visa requirements. EU membership previously guaranteed open borders on the UK. Many Brits worklive in other EU countries and they may need to apply for visas or leave those countries. Simultaneously many EU nation people live and work in the UK will also face similar issues.

You can take the Standard Deduction which for  was  or you can forego this to itemize your deductions which means listing out every deductible expense one by one.  In practice the only way this would be worth it is if you own a house theres a big mortgage deduction for homeowners or if you spend huge amounts of money every year on business expenses.Most people end up getting a lot more from the Standard Deduction which means theres no reason for you to save receipts for tax purposes.,NoStupidQuestions,d4ouvse,1,t5_2w844

The most significant armed conflicts post WWII in Europe were Yugoslavia and recently Eastern Ukraine neither of which arewere EUmembers.

Its an automated system though so the results arent always accurate.Many times it will occur subconsciously. A musician will play some chords they like write a song around them and then later realize they subconsciously stole those chords from a song they heard a long time ago.This happened to George Harrison with his s Hit My Sweet Lord which happened to share a chord progression amp melody with a song from  pop song by The Chiffons.Another thing musicians will do to ensure their composition is original would be to play it for other musicians.

If you transported your mind into her body you wouldnt have that experience so youd probably like the tacos.However if she doesnt like tacos because her tongue or some other part of her digestive tract doesnt agree with it then transporting your mind into her body wont make you enjoy the taco.  Youd have a bad experience with it just like she would whether its being sensitive to how it tastes or not being able to digest it properly.and ending up on the toilet for night.Hows that sound?  ,NoStupidQuestions,d4w4p5e,10,t5_2w844

8206587,0,t3_4rleal,Hey man I went to school at a gifted program many years ago. The minimum IQ to get in was  IIRC. I also had really really bad untreated ADHD and couldnt focus on things longer than  minutes. Seriously it was like having a brain injury. My peers were great students made As in everything all of them except for me won the National Merit Scholarship. One girl went off to a prestigious college at age . I felt like the dumbest most mathchallenged guy who ever graced the halls of that place. So I know how you feel.As years went on a large number of my classmates did well but not all of them. A few became very antisocial developed drinking problems and gave up on life. I kept plugging away at being the best me I could be. I didnt always succeed and even today I have problems with work etc.The one thing I did have going for me was a burning curiosity to know how things worked. I also learned how to use a library and find out how to find the information I needed. I now speak  languages read  I have two masters degrees one in Engineering and generally do well with being a programmer. Grit goes a lot further than knowledge. Keep on keeping on. Sometimes the slower thinkers think deeper.My suggestions Keep a readingknowledge journal. Find something that interests you and read it. Jot down the words you dont know and look them up index cards are great for this. Write down your feelings and thoughts about the subject. This will help you understand yourself as well as the subject matter. Wander through Wikipedia or even better a real encyclopedia in book form. Just let topics carry you along as you get interested in them. Dont worry if it is practical or not just enjoy. Do crossword puzzles or jigsaw puzzles or something and let your mind take as much time as it needs to to solve them. Every now and again try solving as much as you can in  minutes. Enjoy it and make it a game. Take up meditation and yoga or martial arts. You will find there are other kinds of intelligences that will help you far more than traditional IQ. Learning to clear your mind is a great skill. Your mind and your fear can get in your way more than anything else can. Finally find friends who like the stuff you like and share with them. You learn more from friends than anyone else in my opinion.Good luck! Be a good soul.,NoStupidQuestions,d53dm7k,3,t5_2w844

Viruses dont actually survive long outside of a host so cleaning your hands appropriately is usually enough to keep vaccinated healthy cats safe if you have cats with compromised immune systems you should consider taking more precautions.I typically always had a separate pair of shoes and clothes working at a shelter just because of the smells of different animals can be distressing to many cats when you come home.

8339448,0,t3_4tsxps,Tangible means perceptible by touch. I think you were going for achievable here.And the answer to your question is that world peace is a fundamentally naive and shallow idea. It doesnt mean anything by itself. It just describes a negative proposition some kind of unspecified absence of conflict. But what kind of conflict are we excluding exactly? Are we just ruling out organized lawful war but leaving behind everything else like guerrilla warfare and terrorism? That wouldnt fit many peoples notions of world peace. So okay we rule out guerrilla warfare and terrorism but we leave crime. We can consider the world to be at peace even though people are still committing crimes right? Well wheres the line between a crime and an act of terrorism? It turns out to be a difference in motivation. Whether a particular act was a crime or terrorism depends on why it was carried out. So were really splitting hairs here.Then theres the question of how such a peace would be imposed. With an iron fist by some notionally benevolent dictator? Were better off living free in an imperfect world than being enslaved in somebody elses idea of utopia. The question of peace at what price is always vital.So the short answer to your question is that when people throw around the phrase world peace its always a sign that they havent really thought very hard about what theyre talking about. It only takes a minute to think through the idea and come up with a bunch of unanswered questions some of which are in fact unanswerable in any moral way.,NoStupidQuestions,d5jzh73,2,t5_2w844

This is the most surefire way to disable a target.Additionally the decision to use a firearm isnt one to be taken lightly as it will more than likely kill or at the very least seriously injure the target. Officers are taught to use firearms only as a last resort and to aim to kill. Shooting someone without intending to kill them is just too risky which is why lesslethal weapons like TASERs pepper spray and batons are often employed. Of course there is a difference between how police are trained and how they actually act.

8351270,0,t3_4tyqc0,As little as a couple decades ago homosexuality was considered alternately a mental illness or a voluntary choice even among medical professionals. Weve evolved our line of thinking on this the more we realize that brain chemistry and genetics are the likely cause of samesex attraction not because theyre broken or choosing it but because thats how theyre wired.Since them being wired that way is uncontrollable and since homosexuals provided they violate no laws just like would be expected of heterosexuals and consensual homosexual relationships function in society the same as heterosexuals and heterosexual relationships increasingly the decision of legislatures and courts has been that homosexuals are deserving of the same rights privileges and protections that heterosexuals have enjoyed. This most recently includes marriage aka theres no valid justification for not letting two men or two women marry.Were not there yet on transgender individuals. The science on it seems to be leaning toward the same  brain chemistry and genetics. Something they cant control made their physical construction be male but their mental construction be female.As a general rule transgender individuals when treated as the gender with which they identify function no differently in society. Provided they violate no laws like homosexuals before them and like heterosexuals before them there is no valid justification for treating them differently.Now the reaction to them as evidenced by North Carolina et al is quite different but perhaps no more so than gays decades ago just in a different fashion. It was a scandal for someone famous to come out in the th century now nobody could give a rip. It may be a few years or a few decades but the more transmen and transwomen can come out of the closet the more it will normalize.Some of the societal integration bits will probably have to be court mandated but thats happened before. Black people would have had to wait quite a bit longer to use the same water fountains had the courts not stepped in. The marriage equality trendline was moving in a positive direction more states every year but the conservative holdouts would have caused tangible harm until market forces or public sentiment dictated a change.For trans individuals its going to be a combination of public representation evolving sentiment advancements in the science and antidiscrimination court action.,NoStupidQuestions,d5lgmwt,5,t5_2w844

8361283,0,t3_4u48ar,Cognitive dissonance isnt something that you have. Its something that you do. Its a sort of false rationalization that people use so that they can excuse their own faulty thoughts or behavior.For example lets say you thoroughly believe that cheating on ones spouse is inexcusably wrong. But then you wind up cheating on your wife. Afterward you think We are going through a really rough spot in our marriage so this is kind of an exception. Cheating is wrong but what I did in this specific circumstance is understandable. Or This doesnt really apply because I still love my wife and want to be with her so it wasnt like cheating cheating. Or I made a small mistake in putting myself in a situation where I might give in to temptation thats just a small mistake its not horrible like people who go out and cheat on purpose.All of these are shitty excuses. All of them logically contradict the belief that cheating on ones spouse is inexcusably wrong. But through cognitive dissonance you can  believe that its inexcusable and  believe that your actions were justified even though theres no possible way both statements could be true. This is a natural thing for human beings to do we desperately want to believe that we are good and our actions are rational.So Im not sure what you were reading about cognitive dissonance that made you think it was something you could be diagnosed with. Your behavior doesnt even sound abnormal youre someone who is stressed about socializing because youre still figuring out who you are. If youre actually suffering because of this stress you should go ahead and continue to see a therapist but please dont selfdiagnose. And whats a sortof therapist?

It really doesnt matter what your mother thinks. It matters what you think. Dont beat yourself up for this but DO learn from it.Your comment about the Oreo sounds illjudged and insensitive to me. If it got back to the directors then someone was upset or offended. If for example  kids laughed and only  got upset but likely hid it because everyone else was laughing then thats a good enough reason to feel contrite for the comment. Instead youre making excuses.You need to accept that you said the wrong thing no excuses so that you can learn from it and make sure you dont make the same mistake again.In short your question instead of how do I tell my mother should have been how can I do better next time?.

Before deciding on a specific subject or declaring a major students can try out different introductory courses.gtIve heard that you can take Jazz Classes to Political Science? How does that work? Is American College more like High School where you study a range of topics?

Even if your major is biology you still have to take a class about things likegtInterpreting Arts and Media IM codeOne course required  credits  gtOne fivecredit course or equivalent is required that focuses on the practice analysis interpretation andor history of one or more artistic or mass media media in which nontextual materials play primary roles.The bulk of your classes will still be about your major though.From a blog post comparing British and American education systemsgtAt the end of high school American students do not take allencompassing subject examinations like Alevel.

These are pretty safe for the lender because if you fail to pay they can take the land and house and youre not just going to walk away with the house.  There are fees and associated costs with it plus interest.You can also look into a traditional loan against which you put the land as collateral.  Same as above but without the mortgage stuff.  It is pretty safe so credit isnt as important.Lastly would be a home improvement loan.  A type of equity that can either be lump sum or as a line of credit with a maximum amount but then you only pay back what you take out like a credit card with a maximum balance.Id go to a bank and ask to meet with someone about loan options for a home repair.  If you need to set up a bank account it isnt really a problem.  A local bank rather than Bank of America or other giant institution may be a better choice for such things.

8412447,0,t1_d5t18vh,I think you are looking at it a little too pessimistically.The way I see it healthcare is going to cost roughly the same whether its individuals or employers or taxes paying for it or at least for the purposes of this discussion I am going to ignore any forces that may make people seek healthcare at different rates than current. So then the question becomes who do I think will run the system most efficiently?Thinking of the forces that act on corporations there are two things that must be balanced  first they want to turn a profit and second they want to retain and attract customers. Needing to be profitable the companies are pushed to make the process as lean as possible reducing their overhead and paying out as little as possible. This is obviously both good and bad  we dont want the corporations wasting money but we do want them to pay claims appropriately. So thats where the second major force comes in. They have competition. If I am unhappy with their product or service I can with certain limitations seek out another insurance company. The competition keeps everyone honest. Thinking about a federalized system now  what forces will be acting there? And would it be better? Looking at other governmental agencies how do they run in a landscape without competition or a need for profitability? The DMV doesnt seem to run very smoothly even as a vilified agency that politicians are always vowing to fix  and it is so much more simple than health insurance.,NoStupidQuestions,d5t3lp8,0,t5_2w844

8422651,0,t3_4uzrfi,I dont know about cats but according to this study from  dogs can learn up to around  words or about the size of a  year old humans vocabulary. So a dog will probably recognize the name you use if you say it but whether or not they associate it as an identifier of themselves is up in the air because we dont have a reliable way of knowing if a dog or cat is self aware.Scientists have used a kind of turing test for dogs in this study that suggests that dogs do not recognize a reflection in a mirror of themselves and perceive it as a different animal. Cats also apparently fail this test but the mirror test could just be flawed in and of itself because scientists are only guessing based on observations of external behavior by the animals. Unless we can read their minds its kind of a mystery because we cant really prove anything for certain.However I think it sounds plausible that if an animal can recognize the name it can form a sort of Pavlovian response as you mentioned in your description e.g. if you say the animals name it will recognize it and it might associate it with it being time to get some pets from the human.,NoStupidQuestions,d5udg8e,9,t5_2w844
8424553,0,t3_4uzrfi,In my personal experience most of my dogs have had a functional understanding of human language beyond just their names. Granted the last five have been livestock dogs that are known for intelligence.In high school my parents and I had a Pyrenees whose ability to communicate was only limited by his inability to make human sounds and trust me that frustrated him to no end. He knew his name was his just as our dachshunds name was hers and our horses names were theirs. On more than one occasion we would say something to Bear the Pyr and we would catch him turning to our Anatolian to relay the information.After Bear died when we trusted the Anatolian to behave when she was inside the house we discovered that she liked to watch NCIS with us I shit you not she would lay in the living room actually watching the television. It took us far longer than it should have to realize that it was because we had named her Ziva. When that character left the show two years ago she lost interest. There are also plenty of other words she understands. She knows my mom as Mom my dad as Dad and me as name. She has a clear grasp of the concept that cookies dog biscuits and chewies rawhide sticks are treats but not every treat is a cookie or chewwie. So if my mom tells her Go ask Dad for a chewwie she will turn to my dad and look at him in the manner that she has determined will get her a chewwie.Theres also the tale of the dachshund I had in elementary school who was a ridiculous creature of habit. I watched Star Trek with my parents growing up and it was the highlight of my week to get to stay up late to watch Voyager. When the show was over Id go to bed and my parents would stay up to watch Deep Space . Well one Sunday we were watching DS it at like  in the evening and when the title credits rolled Dolly the dachsie jumped off the couch trotted back to my bedroom and jumped in my bed. A few minutes later we heard the telltale thudtap tap tap of her jumping out of bed and coming back down the hall to peer confusedly into the den. Thats when it clicked for us she associated the DS music with bedtime so despite it still being daylight she couldnt figure out why I wasnt coming to bed. She then gave the canine equivalent of a shrug and came back to the couch.Of course Ive known other peoples dogs who only knew sit stay and maybe fetch. It depends on the dog but Ive found it more depends on the owner. If you treat your dogcathorseferretwhatever like a dumb animal then thats all theyll be.

8473718,0,t3_4vr7om,Personally I dont think itd be weird but at the same time. Ive got a friend in the USMC and hes also super eager to see action. I think seeing action is glorified a bit too much and that those who have seen it would recommend you stay in the Canadian military if it means you will see less action.However if youre joining a foreign military that shares your native language I cant see too many problems arising. If Scotland leaves I highly doubt England would try to eject Scottish citizens from their military. That would only serve tk make their army weaker and would make no sense politically either.So basically serve in HMs army if thats really what you want to do. Im sure it will work out and it may even hook you up with a UK citizenship if you dont already have that through your dad. ,NoStupidQuestions,d60r8a7,1,t5_2w844

8583422,0,t3_4xcwy8,Historically people used warded locks in which the key more or less directly moves the locking dog out of the way. The only thing preventing a wrong key from opening the lock is a series of protrusions called wards  that need to fit cutouts on the key. The problem with this design is that you take any key and file it down in all places where that lock model could have a protrusion creating a skeleton key that fits into every lock.Modern locks are typically pin tumbler locks which comprise a cylinderical core that can turn inside its housing with the right key inserted.  The key lifts a number of split pins that would normally block the core from rotating so that the place where they are split in two lines up with the shearline the place where the core contacts the housing so the core can freely turn leaving one half of the pin in the housing and the other half in the core.

8664747,0,t1_d6opcsu,gt I never said someone feels victimized is a good reason for someone to go to jail.The way you word your posts led me to that assumption in your posts I read bias in favor of victims being believed just because they say theyre victims which is a position I have a real problem with. There are tons of people especially in the US who call themselves victims for the most ridiculous of things. That in no way helps the actual victims of crimewhich are those the law can agree on. Thats what its there for.gt  I am saying that the only people who know if consent was given or if it was withdrawn are the people involved. Thats not up to a third party to decide.The first part of your statement is true. The second is definitely false and problematic when there are no witnesses or the witnesses have been bought. People lie... its a fact. A rape victim is a rape victim if she was forced against their will. Yet people are mentally able to make up all sorts of stories about being made to do things that never happened. We know this because even children know how to make up completely fabricated stories about their siblings or classmates just to get them in trouble. Adults are no different. This is why saying it merits attention and due consideration. It merits being taken seriously in court and it merits a team of people doing their utmost to gather all of the evidence and remain impartial. Because nobody but the potential victim and the potential assaulter know the truth.Then the vicious circle starts where presumed victims are blamed for being victims which is a horrible place to end up when no crime can be proven or theres disagreement about the situation that led to the crime. The fact is this is not a country in which you can trust most people so dont act as though you should be able to.I think its necessary to be skeptical of both parties statements and see what the evidence shows. Sometimes nothing noteworthy happened yet theres someone screaming that they were taken advantage of because to them its noteworthy.Is it noteworthy to the society and culture in which they live in? Can we reasonably agree as a group and according to law that something happened? If you think something happened but they didnt and the law says it didnt you need to adjust your perceptions or get an army to fight for changebe represented. If the laws mute then again... fight for change. If the laws on your side then obviously youre good to go. Thing is though the group decides whether the laws should change. They wont change overnight or on their own for no reason at all.You dont become a victim just because something happened. Otherwise hell who the heck do I sue for my mother and father conceiving me? I never asked for this Im a victim of having been brought to life without my consent! s Of course society would say shoo at that.Things need to be fair for both parties.

8666866,0,t3_4ymypg,Nuclear power is similar to a coal power plant in many ways. Both use a fuel source to heat water and create steam which then spins a turbine attached to a generator. The difference is in a coal power plant this heat comes from burning coal. In a nuclear power plant rods of radioactive material generate heat through the fission process atoms split which both gives off heat and causes a chain reaction which splits more atoms and repeats. If this chain reaction happens super fast you have a nuclear explosion. Using a neutral control rod dampens the reaction and keeps the chain from getting too out of control. Thats the power plant bit. The pros of nuclear power Cleaner than fossil fuels. Coal power plants actually give off more radiation than nuclear plants. Radioactive rods last a lot longer than a piece of coal and are renewable. Overall nuclear is generally more environmentally friendly. Its also efficient and effective at providing large quantities of power which makes it a better choice than even solar or wind. Now the cons. There is essentially no chance of a mushroomcloud nuclear explosion from a power plant but its still a common enough fear that many people are against nuclear power. But the big concern is what happens when something goes wrong. Even if a meltdown doesnt cause a nuclear explosion it can still release radiation in unhealthy amounts  just look at Fukushima or Chernobyl. People also tend to fear that nuclear plants are constantly releasing radiation but this simply isnt true. Even the steam that comes from the giant towers never comes in contact with radiation  its just steam. The debate isnt necessarily grounded on anything real but fear is a big motivator when it comes to adopting new technology. Major events combined with misconceptions have made many people afraid of nuclear energy. But on the other hand it does seem like a good option. ,NoStupidQuestions,d6oz7o3,5,t5_2w844

8682625,0,t3_4ywqhc,You have to be careful with the word noise here as it has specific meanings in different contexts.From the perspective of having a clean image noise is deviation from the ideal crisp image.  The compressed image has noise in this sense.From an information theory perspective noise is random data it is maximum disorder.  It takes more information to losslessly store or transmit noise than ordered data.  From this perspective a compressed image is less noisy as the image has been made to be artificially ordered to allow less information to give an approximate representation of the original.If you were to take another equally visually noisy image with the noise patterns different and then went to save that image with no loss then it would require a larger file size than another lossless compression algorithm working on the original image with no noise.  ,NoStupidQuestions,d6qybpl,3,t5_2w844

In particular the ones I had in your equivalent of grad school would just write stuff in cursive! from one end of the blackboard to the other like  meters worth of stuff in small writing  drawings and would go back to the beginning and start erasing it immediately to make some new writing space as soon as they reach the far end.And there was no asking to wait for you in a class of about  youd be laughed at.It wasnt exactly unusual to have written  pages in about  hours and cursive is about the only option to achieve that kind of speed plus we learn it consistently from a very young age here.My SO is American and its always quite bizarre to see most grownups I meet in the US write in print but the main shocking thing is that in average and whether it is cursive or print it looks like how a kid would write. And I say that being painfully aware of how hard it is to make yourself legible Im a leftie but my handwriting cursive is a million times better than what I see when I go to America.

Heres the rules.One of the doors contains a car each with  probability. The other two each contain a goat.You pick a door.If your door has a car behind it Monty opens one of the other two doors at random. Each with a  possibility.If your door has a goat he opens the other door with a goat.Finally he gives you the opportunity to switch to one of the other doors.Now suppose you pick door number one. Given that it contains a car he has a  chance of opening either of the other doors. Given that it does not contain a car he has a  chance of opening either of the other doors. As such his choice is not taken as evidence about what is behind door number one.Or you could look at it another way. Doors two and three are equivalent. Clearly whatever the probability is of there being a car behind door number one given that he opens door number two must be the same as given that he opens door number three. If it made it more likely for there to be a car behind door number one then hes not just revealing evidence of where the car is hes actually moving the car. Thats impossible. If B is evidence of A then not B must be evidence against A.But consider instead the probability of a car being behind door number three. If theres a car behind door number one he has a  chance of opening door two. If theres a car behind door two he has a  chance of opening door two. If theres a car behind door three he has a  chance of opening door two. The symmetry is broken. Opening door two is proof that the car is not behind it and evidence that the car is behind door three.,NoStupidQuestions,d70wnc6,1,t5_2w844

Trucks are culturally popular in a lot of places but full sized SUV sales are down quite a bit from their peak and smaller cars are significantly more popular than they used to be.

To keep people from just waiting to watch new movies when they came out on television movie makers added extra features.  Some like color and wider screens caught on.  Others like thunderama and smellovision didnt.  But the point was to create an experience which couldnt be recreated at home.  When the new generation of televisions was developed they chose  because it was a decent compromise between the billions of existing hours of old  movies and TV and all the newer movies which are filmed in much wider formats.

Not that great Another commenter suggests listening to speech I find thats the easiest way. Different peoples of the world Asians and all others really are easiest to distinguish based on spoken language and you can learn to differentiate languages if you pay attention when people speak a certain languagedialect and know what it is. That wont always help if a person of a certain ethnicity speaks a foreign language but it tends to be reliable for me anyways I learned to tell when Africandescended people were actually of German nationality by accent and from that I learned to discern one languages accent in another most of the time so it works for me.Physically speaking though this might helpPersonally Im curious as to how much flak Ill get for saying this? I find Koreans look the most Western to me. Im not sure I can explain why but ... it just works. I think part of it is in the eye shape.

Is it a first person shooter a real time strategy etc.Programmer You write the computer code that tells the game console or computer how to display the graphics how the characters actions interact with other objects in the world and the physics of the objects the scoring and the logic to tie everything together. There are different levels of programmers too. There are engine programmers they write the low level code that the computergame console uses to display graphics play sounds etc scripters they write utilities that other people in the game development company use to create levels import characters etc artist programmers they write code that assists with art assets importing texturing etc. Artists You create the art assets. You can be a d artist you would create textures background art etc or a d artist you would create character and other models.QA Quality Assurance. These are the guys and girls that sit at a desk and play games all day. Now before you assume this is fun I can assure you it is not. Pick your favorite game. Now play the same  second part of it  times to try to find a bug that happens only very rarely. Once you make the bug happen remember EXACTLY what happened and report it to the designers and programmers so they can fix it.Producer You manage teams of designers programmers artists or a combination of all of them to ensure the game you are working on is released on time is stable and playable and meets the expectation of the gamers who will play it.IT Personnel This is closer to your computer science question. These are the guys and girls that keep all of the computer systems working. I personally worked as the last one as a systems administrator. It was a really fun job. The problem with the video game industry is that it is very unstable. Game companies go bust quite often.Now if you are talking about making a game yourself you get to be all of the above yourself!

Of course none of us are perfectly symmetrical. However we also get used to asymmetry we see frequently. Because we look in the mirror more often than at pictures of ourselves the asymmetry we become used to is actually a flippedmirror image. When we see ourself in pictures when its not flipped we notice the asymmetry more and thus find ourselves less attractive. Sorry I have no source for this.

If someone has liver cancer for example the liver is like the filter organ of our bodies their bodies become filled with fluid toxins etc and that buildup starts to affect other organs like the heart and lungs which could lead to those organs failing. If someone has lets say breast cancer and that cancer has metastasized spread to the brain the brain begins to shut down due to lack of oxygen or blood supply. Any blood cancer anything that affects their immune system can kill themlike a cold flu or even an infected tooth.

Also it comes in Deodorant and antiperspirant forms I think.  Sweating is the bodys way of removing excess heat cleans out pores and its healthy. Stopping that process is done by clogging the pores with aluminum of some sort and some studies show it to be unhealthy. Whether it is or not idk. But if you dont get constant pit stains on your shirts from Sweating there isnt much reason to do more than simply mask the smell.  If youre wearing something nice or tight fitting you may want something that blocks the Sweating. Just be aware many deodorants smell awful. Find one thats pleasant but not overpowering.

The average lifespan for bills of all denominations is about  years so well assume that the bills Kanye touches will be in circulation that long. Lets also assume he touches the same number of bills per year. That means the number of bills touched by Kanye has reached a steady state at this point. Assume he touches  unique bills per day. Thats  per year.  years of bills still in circulation would be  Kanye bills currently in circulation. Assuming they are evenly distributed any random bill you pick up has a . chance of being a Kanye bill.Lets say you also touch  unique bills per day. If P is the probability that a bill was touched by Kanye then P is the probability that it wasnt. This number is E  . where here Im switching from  to fractional probability for ease of math. Touching N bills the probability that none of them were Kanye bills is PN . So if youve been handling money at a rate of  bills per day or  per year then the probability that youve never touched a Kanye bill is PY  .Y where Y is the number of years youve been handling money. And the probability that you HAVE touched a Kanye bill is just   probability you havent.Putting this all together if youve been handling money for a decade there is a nearly  chance youve handled money that Kanye has If you go up to  years then the odds become ..,NoStupidQuestions,d85h04k,1,t5_2w844

9171906,0,t3_55xkqw,Sort of.The President is the only person with the authority to call for a nuclear strike.  Nobody has the authority to deny that command.However the command passes through the Secretary of Defense.  He could refuse to relay it.  The Secretary of Defense is appointed by the President though with the advice and consent of the Senate so the President could fill the office with someone they believe would carry out the command.  Alternatively they could be dismissed and the Deputy Secretary of Defense would take over.  Dismissals could continue until someone willing was found.Similar situations exist down the chain of command culminating with the people turning keys in silos.  If the order made it past the first step or two then its very likely that at least some nuclear weapons would be launched.Additionally there is a duty to notify a number of important officials.  This includes the VP and cabinet which is enough that the President can be relieved of duty under the th amendment.  However the th amendment provides a fairly lengthy process while the nuclear arsenal is designed to be usable in an instant.  The th amendment is no guarantee.If a president declared a nuclear strike out of the blue with no provocation then its likely that after much pants shitting nothing would be launched.  If there was provocation then its quite possible that the President could mobilize the nuclear arsenal especially if they had thought ahead and put a pronukes friend as the Secretary of Defense. ,NoStupidQuestions,d8elv7e,3,t5_2w844

But no fucking or something like that involved.Think warning read ahead before clicking this wikipedia but was actually blocked in the UK on child pornography grounds before  but maybe even less severe.

Dont necessarily think  year olds depending on definition children can be  or even . Not sure what definition was used. Usual cutoffs are   or more rarely    films of category B means sexual acts that are not penetrative.

Im not sure that Not seeking healthcare due to the social stigma is really a complete sentence unto itself.

Actually the emdash could be a nice option it would set out the separation more clearly than a comma while not relegating the not wanting to look weak or broken part down to the status of a mere aside.I would also add a comma to separate can lead to self medication and substance abuse from compounding their struggle  it feels like a bit of a runon without some kind of break there.Also is healthcare usually capitalised?So in sumgtNot seeking healthcare due to the social stigmanot wanting to look weak or brokencan lead to self medication and substance abuse compounding their struggle with work school and social life. ,NoStupidQuestions,d8v22pg,1,t5_2w844

However if such a law was passed in the future the State could force you to hand over all your pennies at that time in exchange for fair recompense as defined by the Act or face whatever penalties the Act stipulated that werent struck down as either disproportionate or cruel and unusual. Your remedies would be trying to either elect new representatives who promise to repeal the law rally enough public support to convince the executive branch to not put much effort into enforcing it convince the judiciary to overturn the seizure on constitutional grounds precedents not really in your favour but SC opinions on what precedents to uphold changes every now and then dont challenge the seizure but argue that the level of compensation was unfair and seek damages to make up the difference. bury all your pennies in Death Valley before the law comes aknocking and hope nobody finds them,NoStupidQuestions,d8y4lf5,16,t5_2w844

9326429,0,t3_587p55,The odds are zero.The Constitution is explicit that Obama is forbidden from serving another term.The closest that could happen is he could continue serving for some period of time after the election if there is no candidate elected.  This is from the th amendment.  Section  of the amendment states that if no candidate has qualified through the electoral college or subsequent House of Representatives election then Congress gets to declare who acts as president or how we choose who will act as president until a president has been chosen.  They could by my reading declare that Obama continues to serve even though he is disqualified from running or from serving another term.This will not happen though.  Despite what you may read on Reddit Hillary Clinton has a strong enough following and perhaps more importantly Donald Trump is hated enough that she will likely win the general election.

There are several reasons.First large tobacco companies see vaping as an unregulated therefore cheaper alternative to cigarettes.  They figure if they have to abide by the ATF restrictions then vaping companies should as well.  So they got the ATF to classify ecigarettes as a tobacco product.Second there is a push in large metropolitan areas to limit the ability of people to smoke.  It has little to do with public health but rather is about stopping cigarette smoking as a perceived public nuisance.  Vaping doesnt have any secondhand effects but it has the same appearance as smoking a cigarette so it needed to be restricted.,NoStupidQuestions,d96il4j,3,t5_2w844

9456828,0,t3_5a8jvl,Mostly creative reasons allowing different options for the listener.A normal recording will be a full sound with many layers of audio and lots of extra auditory details to make the recording interesting and unique. An acoustic version usually strips that back and allows you to focus on the bare bones of the song  youll hear the lyrics and lead part more clearly. If the singer is alright the main songwriter and a guitarist then youll find that they often wrote the song alone with an acoustic this applies to heavier music too  most RATM riffs were written on an acoustic. When theres only two instruments the acoustic is so commonly used because it fits best with the vocals  electric and vocals occupy the same frequency range a bad thing because it can sound muddy without the full range behind it and an electric can sound thin without a bassdrumkit backing it. Its easier to write a song alone and most singers would play guitar as an accompaniment rather than piano.Some songs gain a different feel to them between a full band and an acoustic mix  they lend themselves to different interpretations. Sometimes its just because the full mix is too difficult for the band to play live. Sometimes I suppose its just to make more money out of old material  youll often see acoustic versions on a greatest hits album as a way to add extra content without doing too much work. ,NoStupidQuestions,d9epxtd,2,t5_2w844

9489697,0,t3_5arv7d,gtWhy are the fees so expensive?Part of it I believe is because banks and the government got into giving out student loans. Because both institutions are able to give out vast sums for loans the schools were then able to increase their tuition since the students and their families were no longer directly paying for it. Essentially more money was available so rates went up.There are also legitimate costs like administration fees and faculty salaries and so forth the reputation of the school Harvard can obviously charge more than a relatively unknown university and if the university is involved in highlevel research then tuition fees are probably applied to help fund that as well.gtDo they not have a grant system in place?Yes. There are many grants available. The problem is they often pay out a paltry sum of a few thousand dollars which doesnt do much if your tuition is  per year. Grants are also difficult to get simply because there are so many students and so little grant money available comparatively.Scholarships are another route but again those tend to be extremely difficult to earn for most students.gtIm in my nd year of uni and I can pay off my fees each year working minimum wage during the summer and have a healthy amount left for a holiday.It used to be that way here as well. Even just  years ago you could get a Harvard education for about  which was roughly half of the average familys annual family income. Now a Harvard education will run you about  per year for tuition room board and fees combined though you may be able to get away with paying anything from nothing to year depending on your familys financial situation. To put that in perspective the average family earns roughly year. However to be fair at this level of income if Harvard accepts you then according to the Harvard link above they likely wont actually charge you anything.,NoStupidQuestions,d9it3na,3,t5_2w844

9542061,0,t3_5bki86,Like most nursery rhymes it has a surprisingly dark origin maybegt  This traditional rhyme was first published in  but almost certainly originates from earlier possibly from the time of the Irish potato famine.gt The biggest clue to the meaning lies in the lyrics most particularly paddywhack and to a lesser extent knickknack.gt A Paddy is still used by the English to refer to the Irish. Whack means to hit once hard and forcefully. A knickknack is a trinket or other trivial object. Knickknack may also refer to the practice of tapping out a rhythm using spoons.gt Historically there was a great deal of resentment by the Irish people towards the English who conquered Ireland and began to settle in the sixteenth century. The English owned much of the best land and rented houses and land to the native Irish. The staple food of the Irish was the potato. However in  the potato crop failed and the resulting famine led to a  fall in the Irish population from deaths and emigration. English landowners did nothing to help their tenants and often turned them out of their houses. Animosity between the Irish and English rose and in Ireland the Irish Republican Army was formed to drive the English out.gt Many Irish men became tinkers selling pots pans cutlery and other knickknacks door to door in England. Most of them were told to go away and may have been given a whack as they were sent on their way. The old man may also have played knickknack using spoons or other objects hoping for his audience to throw him a few pennies. The people that would see the Irish starve would happily give a bone to a dog. Irish tinkers traditionally lived in a caravan on wheels that was pulled by a horse  hence rolling home.

9583416,0,t3_5c8206,Many animals are born blind and deaf its not just cats.  They are born early in their development cycle because if they fully developed prior to birth the risks to mom would be greatly increased more likely to die during pregnancy or suffer complications during birth. It tends to only be herbivores when talking about mammals that are able to get up and move quickly and that is because it is more of a detriment to have a baby in one place with predators around.  With carnivores though they are more likely to be equipped to protect their babies for longer periods of time in one place so there is less risk of having the offspring before it is fully developed. This type of development is less about an individual and more about what works for the whole of the species.  As long as the numbers of survival  are high there is no advantage to a change.  However if a change is made that proves to be more successful then it will get passed on to future generations.  That hasnt happened so things remain as they are in terms of childbirth in animals. ,NoStupidQuestions,d9ucnvq,10,t5_2w844

9610407,0,t3_5cll04,This is just speculation on my part I majored in Computer amp Information Science but my focus was in programming not circuitry but I suspect it was to keep costs down. If you look at a USB TypeC plug it has a lot of redundancy built into it. The pins are the same if you rotate it  degrees and would have to be in order to have it be reversible. Older USB types did not have this redundancy  they had only the pins they needed and therefore it was important to keep them in a particular orientation so as not to have the wrong pin in the plug connect to the wrong pin in the socket. This was pretty much standard for all connector types back then  its just that most other connectors were very easy to tell up from down on for example a standard VGA monitor cable is wider on top than on the bottom. USB of course is infamous for the fact that its nearlyidentical shape on top and on bottom makes it difficult to tell by feel which side is up.

But you are lumping a whole continent of many diverse civilizations and throwing all their achievements and legacy by calling them simpler folk. There is nothing simple about Africans. Also the view that different cilizations would follow some tech tree or there is linear technological progression that is inevitable is flawed and not really accepted by historians for any decades.gt Last I checked none of those were in Africa. And I didnt say there were no domesticated animals in Africa but that Africans didnt domesticate any.On the same wikipedia page if you go down a little you would see this  or so lines below what you wrote.gt A study on  breeds showed that modern taurine cattle originated from Africa Asia North and South America Australia and Europe. Some researchers have suggested that African taurine cattle are derived from a third independent domestication from North African aurochsen.Also gtI mean everyone knows cat were venerated in ancient Egypt but that was still not Africans doing it but Middle Easterners from the Fertile Crescent which then brought them to Egypt. Egyptians were not middle eastern they were africans. Cats were not domesticated in fertile crescent instead in egypt. We are talking about a timeline of s of years during which people moved around a lot. A lot of things were invented independently all over the world again and again.I am not trying to diss you or anything just trying to refute what seems to me as misinformation at best. Africans have domesticated wide variety of animals from Cattle Pigs Sheep Goats Dogsprobably independently of the main dog domestication in eurasia.

9658497,0,t3_5dbw19,My copy of the Bible contains a segment by the compiler its the Criswell Study Bible if anybodys curious about numbers and symbolism used in the Bible. Heres what it has to say in the section before Revelationgt In Revelation as throughout the Bible numbers often contain symbolic as well as literal connotations. Thus the symbolic associations provide added dimensions to the literal understanding. In Scripture the numbers which most commonly contain symbolic value follow below with representative referencesgt   Unity primacy independent existence Deuteronomy gt   An addition hence strength help confirmation Ecclesiastes gt   The simplest compound unity the number for God Matthew gt   The world with its four seasons and directions Revelation gt   Man as portrayed by the various fivemembered parts of the body Leviticus gt   consummate evil failure Rev.  because it falls short of perfection which is represented by the number sevengt   a number representing earth crowned with heaven the latter lending perfection or completeness to the former Rev. gt   five doubled hence human completeness Rev. gt   Gods perfect manifestation of Himself to the created order Rev. So if youre looking for numeric symbolism based on the Bible which is after all where the the number of the Beast bit comes from then I would say the universe depending on your interpretation of universe would be derivative of either  the world or  earth and heaven combined. Given the emphasis of the number of the beast six hundred threescore and six    three sixes for evil evil evil we could posit that perhaps if the Bible referenced the mortal universe as a whole and not just Earth it might use the number  to emphasize its status as a larger scope of the world. But thats just a guess to my knowledge there is no widelyaccepted numeric symbol for the universe and any symbol you use would be unrecognized without you providing an explanation as with most of these.,NoStupidQuestions,da3m19b,2,t5_2w844

Mainly because hair has a base color that determines the color your hair will take.  Im not a hair stylist but from years of dyeing my hair Ive learned you just cant dump color onto whiteblonde hair or else it will turn purple maroon a muddy brown or other weird colors. You need to have a base color like a red in order to create a natural mix.  Also blonde or white hair does not hold color for long.

Do not let any group of friends or social club try to convince you otherwise and make you drink more than you are comfortable drinking.That being said. Shots are really something that it just takes getting used to doing. Breathe in before taking the shot tip the glass back swallow then breathe out. Follow the shot with a chaser usually something like a coke.The breathing pattern works to keep you from gagging on the fumes left in your mouth from the alcohol so the shot will go down more easily than if you breathe in after swallowing. The chaser will help get rid of the burning sensation in your throat.Some shots are easier to take than others. For instance fancy shots like lemon drops or little beers are ridiculously easy to drink and shouldnt require a chaser or special breathing at all. However if you are drinking a shot of whiskey or tequila you will want to take the extra steps especially if you arent accustomed to it. ,NoStupidQuestions,daf9c6a,10,t5_2w844

What kind of landscape urban or rural did you grow up in?  How did his stances on abortion climate change racial or gender discrimination weigh into your decision of voting from Trump. Do you regret voting for him? mostly too early to tell yet just asking what is your opinion on the relations of the altright to Trump? Do you believe in accusations of them being st century neonazis? Did you hate Hillary with every fiber of our being and now that the situation has settled down do you think she was unfairly demonized? Do you think mainstream media was unfair to Trump? Thank you for replying. The fact that you voted in itself puts you above  of eligible voters. The TPP concern might be among the few valid reasons some one would actually vote for Trump. I am not American but have been avidly following the your elections. You seem like a level headed person who voted from Trump and I am merely interested in knowing a side I might have ignored due to being part of an echo chamber. ,NoStupidQuestions,dahai1g,4,t5_2w844

9833176,0,t3_5g42yw,Ive not done wrestling so I cant say this is exactly the case but I have choreographed fights before and acted out choreographed fights. Generally each move sequence is scripted to happen but small changes in performance are bound to happen. Especially between sequences the way someone moves or plays their lines can change dramatically between performances. Also if something goes wrong both actors need to be able to react to it in a realistic fashion. Say one wrestler is supposed to flip the other but in the process just drops him. The one on the ground needs to make the decision to play it like either a hard hit or make some sort of unscripted counter so that the action keeps moving smoothly. After a move or two the actors work their way back to the choreography and pick up from there. Other than the cases Ive listed here everything is pretty much played how its rehearsed. Also these moments are smaller and shorter than I may have made them seem.

Pressure does.The hydrogen atoms eventually started clumping together because of gravity. As more and more atoms clump together the pressure on them increases and it becomes more massive. Eventually the mass becomes so great that it starts squeezing the hydrogen atoms together to make helium atoms. The moment that happens is what we call fusion. Then there is a huge release of radiation that we mostly see as light and heat among other things. The Earths atmosphere filters out a lot of the bad radiation.,NoStupidQuestions,dawxjnr,1,t5_2w844

Heres a summary of what a Strawman isA straw man is logical fallacy that occurs when a debater intentionally misrepresents their opponents argument as a weaker version and rebuts that weak amp fake version rather than their opponents genuine argument. Intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of  avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or  making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders.Unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance.

10021835,0,t1_dbduz3c,In the pillow aisle of an average store you will have lots of options.  Likely there are four price point categories cheap moderate expensive and store brand.  Then youll have the various levels of firmness soft medium firm extra firm and material down not down synthetic down.  That is a whole lot of combinations and will cover a wide price range.Latex pillows dont have many manufacturers.  They are certainly not going to have a budget version and they arent popular enough for a store version.  Since they dont sell many anyway they probably only have latex pillows if one of the other manufacturers happens to sell some.For example Walmart sells Simmons latex pillows because they already have an agreement to sell other Simmons stuff.  It may not be in every store though.  Is it worth putting  pillows for sale in a store that only sees say  of its pillow sales going for the high end cost?  So they offer it online and probably stock it in stores located in higher end markets.There are the possibilities for different firmness levels of latex pillows but it is a manufacturing process change rather than simply how many feathers are stuffed into the bag.  That drives up cost and drives down production rate.  You also have the option of going with organic latex which makes it more expensive yet again.  Lastly it is a largely unknown use of the material and people mostly go with what they know and thats fiber for cheap and down for fancy.We have a latex mattress and pillows and I will agree that they are pretty much the best things ever.  Of course for the price they damn well better be.,NoStupidQuestions,dbdvfpv,1,t5_2w844

My stoner resume if you will includes experience with  rolling up with all levels of the food industry from delivery boys and frycooks to NYC restaurateurs  regularly hotboxing a shed with my friend and his veteran dad  passing to the left with performing artists practicing economists and PhD scientists and even  vaping with professors of constitutional law at legalization meetups God bless America.In all these circles pun intended there often seems to be a dude whose coherency devolves into repeating dumb shit thats only funnyinterestingmakes sense to them like you all blasted off into space together but they somehow wound up on a different planet. Sometimes especially before I smoked more regularly that dude has been me. Its a disconnect between your ideas and the ability to communicate them effectively. Someone who isnt me could also observe this problem with people in other altered states such as drunk coked out tripping balls or even just sleep deprived. Theyre seeing things in a really interesting way but their message just gets lost in the translation to language I guess. Sometimes shit is funny but its very hard to explain WHY its funny so its easier to try and show you what I see if Im even trying to clue you in at all.I dont know if intelligence has much to do with it either as I have both smart and dumb friends with this problem. Hell sometimes its the PhD who keeps spewing unintelligible gobbledygook about Rick and Mortys portal gun... not actual science technobabble either just like hurr durr Gazorpazorpfield space lasagna. Weed is great for many reasons but like anything that helps you see things differently the creative thoughts inspired by an altered state of mind sometimes dont make it over the everpresent barriers that make communication difficult even for sober people.,NoStupidQuestions,dbksyf6,5,t5_2w844

10093361,0,t3_5kdltt,The other answers in this thread are correct but Id like to elaborate on them.Consider the movement of a car. Most of the time you either go forwards or backwards. You could go left or right but even then youre going forwards and left or backwards and right or something similar. If your car crashes you are either stopping really fast because your car hits a wall or a hard object or you are going to suddenly move really fast because something hits your car. Changing your speed TOO quickly isnt really good for your body. You might hit something else in your car or you might keep moving and shoot through your windscreen and into a wall or onto the road. A car seatbelt hopefully stops this from happening.Now imagine an airplane. There arent too many obstacles in the air. Sure there might be a building if the plane is flying really low but that sort of stuff hasnt happened since . Really the only reason that you would suddenly change speed is if the plane suddenly fell out of the sky or hit the water. If youre not falling too fast then you enter a state of free fall and you might bump into other people or things. If you ARE falling too fast then you hit the ceiling of the cabin and uh... not very pleasant things happen. And when you hit water theres more changing speed. Your seatbelt hopefully prevents your up down movement.Also people sit in airplanes for a hella long time so they get uncomfortable with car seatbelts.,NoStupidQuestions,dbn6inf,12,t5_2w844

10100096,0,t3_5kh9c3,Let me start by saying there are videos on the internet of whole cows being dropping into an industrial shredder.   Those are cows that died before the slaughtering process disease other causes and are not going into the supply chain.  The internet being what it is has pass around this video trying to claim the fast food industry is grinding up whole cows.    That being said there are a number of other reason why grinding up a whole cow makes no sense..  There are rules and laws in place that define what beef actually is and the USDA tries to do its job of ensuring those laws are met.   Your friend is going to simply dismiss this idea due to a corrupt system..  Less than  of a cow is actually beef.  The rest is made up of other stuff with most of it being inedible.  There is simply no process on the planet that can overcome the taste and texture of the bones skin teeth and hooves and turn it into anything resembling beef.   It just could not happen..  There are certain parts of the animal that if not handled properly will spoil the meat of the entire animal.  The stomach intestines and most notably the bladder are all filled with nasty stuff.  Much like point  there is simply no amount of processing that will overcome the damage done by spilling the bladder into meat intended for consumption. .  Even if they did have some sort of process to overcome  and  they would never pass the USDA test regardless of corrupt we may think they are and the cost of that processing would dramatically increase the cost of final product.   .  The fast food industry uses the front half of the animal.   Why is that important?  Because the back of the animal is where all the expensive cuts come from.   Filets TBones roasts tenderloins are all far more valuable than the front of the animal.  It simply does not make financial sense for the fast food industry to use expensive cuts.  Usually the only difference between a fast food burger and their slightly more upscale cousins is which cuts are ground down to make their burgers.   .  As uMrIvysaur pointed out other parts of the animal are used in thousands of different products.  In many cases the byproducts of the fast food industry are more valuable than the meat.   Think of all the leather going into the shoe industry that would not be possible if they were grinding up the whole animal.I could go one but I believe I have made my point.  There is simply no advantage to grinding up the entire animal.   ,NoStupidQuestions,dbo216a,15,t5_2w844

You do realize the market affects nonprofit and government job salaries in a similar way as it does with forprofit companies right?The government decides the wages for teachers. They determine that salary based on supply and demand. Since almost anybody can be a teacher the supply of teachers is always high which drives down salaries. If teachers were hard to find then salaries would start to increase to incentivize more people with higher skills into the field. Thats microecon .gtengaging and bringing out the potential of your students is a lot harder than teaching to the test. For sure. Thats why I said most people could be adequate teachers. But its still true that the skill set required to be a good teacher is much more common than the skill set to be a good engineer and that gets automatically reflected in the salaries of each.Im curious where you think STEM majors have influence on the salaries or methods of teachers though...

10170094,0,t3_5lmoof,Well we can only make it as efficient as the laws of nature dictates.When transmitting electromagnetic signals through the air there is always gonna be a loss of energy which will limit both efficiency and range.This is why wireless charging requires your phone to be very close to the charging pad in order to actually harvest energy. As you move your phone away from the pad you are making the charging less and less efficient.You could make the range bigger by increasing the windings of the coil inside your phone  but this will increase both weight and thickness of your phone and manufactorers arent interested in doing that.You could also extend the range by making the engerytransmitter transmit more energy. However you just end up with a very big device which is wasting a lot of energy by heating up your room. This device could also be very dangerous for every other piece of electronic in its vicinity.So transmitting energy wirelessly is essentially very inefficient and will continue to be so. However transmitting smaller communication signals like digital signals can be improved.There are plenty of protocols for wireless communication  and we continue to invent better ones. The main concern in this field is range and reliability. As you increase the range the reliability is bound to decrease  and vica versa.One of the main parameters we can change in order to make the protocols better is to increase the transmitting frequency. This is because energyloss decreases as frequency increases. This means that as we invent new technology with higher frequencies we can actually increase both range and speed.,NoStupidQuestions,dbwu3w9,2,t5_2w844

EDITSearching for Can you get an erection in Zero Gravity? on GoogleFirst Result on Google Buzzfeedgt Gravity helps our blood flow to the lower parts of our body so in space blood rises to your head and chest Anderson University physicist and astronomer John Millis Ph.D. told BuzzFeed over email. In microgravity it would be difficult for enough blood to flow to the penis during an erection he explains. Second Result on Google Red Orbitgt its either not possible or very difficult to achieve an erection in space due to zero gravity conditions. Astronauts experience a decrease in blood pressure as a result of this which means less blood flowing through the body and seeing that an erection relies heavily upon blood flow its safe to assume that male sexual function may be hindered in space.Third Result on Google About Education Spacegt Low gravity means that it doesnt flow throughout the body the way as on Earth so it will be much more difficult perhaps impossible for a male to achieve an erection. Fourth Result on Google Reddit Eligt Mixed AnswersFifth Result on Google Crackedgt First of all being in space lowers your blood pressure and slows down the flow of blood overall. That means you almost certainly cant get a boner.Sixth Result on Google Yahoo! Answersgt Mixed AnswersSeventh Result on Google Outer Placesgt a microgravity erection is achievable it would just be much trickier than it is down here on Earth.

So things were somewhat distorted due to rating competitions and tabloid gods were at it on the internet. I will say that I understand the skeptics to this. I even thought for awhile that there had to be something more than a few pissed off middle easterners.

SRS are acting like that to mock to create awareness to laugh about their inside jokes and to see others freak out on their content. It is not to be taken seriously and it in no way should upset anyone. If some subs are angry about them then it just proves their point people taking reddit and their opinions too seriously.The sub is actually harmless even though many comments are insulting it is nothing compared to subs which were shut down and whose exdenizens now express their thoughts on shutting down rshitredditsays because they want some kind of fairness as many put it. Take rniggers rcoontown rfatpeoplehate  those were extremely hateful and their subscribers overtly threatened brigaded and doxxed all the time they ignored admin reprehensions and ultimately migrated to voat because in their opinion reddit and its staff support censorship leftist thoughts and the like.There were and are issues with free speech on any forum  reddit outgrew many of its competitors and there have to be taken measures if peoples wellbeing is endangered or the reputation of their website is at stake. SRS is no such danger but racist and hatemongering subs are.

A night in the lab here and there doing sleep studies will find out the root cause of the problem and there are a lot of different therapies that can be implemented to restore you to a more normal sleep. Theyll hook you up to monitoring equipment and record whats happening. The worst part about it is cleaning the gunk out of your hair. Then when theyve diagnosed the issue they can use drugs or other strategies to fix it.,NoStupidQuestions,dcuqp3b,1,t5_2w844

Its involuntary vaccination versus involuntary mutilation. One is enhancing by design the other is detrimental by design.gthas possible side effectsThe side effects of vaccines pale in comparison to the permanent effects of mutilation.gtis irreversibleDepends on the vaccine. Many vaccines at early age are not because they give lifelong protection but because they give protection to a vulnerable class of people who can in turn become excretion sources for other vulnerable adults whereas most adults have adequate immunity to deal with the problems without severe clinical symptoms.And vaccines dedicated to protecting against pathogens occurring at most ages often require repeat vaccinations to give a boost to the immune system restoring antibody counts primed lymphocytes and increasing antibody affinity. gtand reduces already very low chances of getting a disease?Circle reasoning. The chances are low because of the vaccination at population level herd immunity. Not vaccinating would severely increase the prevalence of the respective pathogens. And ultimately vaccines are enhancing the immune system. Mutilation is... removing a functioning part of the body. Theyre more opposite to each other than alike.That was a nice warmup.

However the most common one achondroplasia is genetic so lets look at that.According to wikipedia the disorder is a dominant genetic trait but having both of the alleles for it is fatal. That means that every single person with achondroplasia who survives its unclear whether the fatal is in utero or in infancy has one dwarf gene and one average gene. So the two people in your example have a  chance of having an averagesized child a  chance of having a child also with achondroplasia and a  chance of having a child who dies from having two copies of the achondroplasia gene.TLDR No  of the living children will be and  will be averagesized.EDIT Also further reading indicates the preferred plural is dwarfs not dwarves.,NoStupidQuestions,dcxpmc9,1,t5_2w844

If this would at least get the keep the terrorists out part right... but it doesnt even do that.Some easy ways to improve this EO  Give  day advance warning. Any terrorist who specifically wanted to get to the USA would have done that before the inauguration anyway because they might actually fear tightening security. Anyone who is a law abiding citizen not so much.Instead of picking  largely unrelated countries pick countries that actually sent terrorists to the USA.

Had he not done so or used some other word we wouldnt refer to the walking dead as zombies in real life.In a lot of newer zombie stories part of the back story is that Romero never made The Night of the Living Dead. Because of this people in the stories universe are completely unfamiliar with the idea of undead walking eating machines and have never heard the word zombie used to refer to them so they make up their own words.

10601161,0,t1_dd9cb4f,Because the President doesnt have magic powers to do things. All that the President is is a person who we have decided gets to make his words on certain subjects the law when certain procedures are followed. But we have also decided that a separate group of people gets to think about the words that the special person has said and determine if they match with what a bunch of notspecial people did a long time ago. Thats it.For another take on it youre arguing that the President can by virtue of the office he has under the Constitution suspend the Constitution. But if hes acting under those powers presumably the rest of the relevant players are still acting under their powers and can do their thing. Change happens either within a system following the rules or without breaking the system. We have done both in this country. In  there was a coup. That coup was successful and led to the Constitution we have now.  times since then we have worked within the system to change the words of the document. But it makes no sense to think that a President could have the power to suspend the Constitution by virtue of the office he holds under the Constitution.Bottom line the President only has the powers people believe him to have.

Prior to the Bush administration it was a militarywide command of special forces troops. Then Cheney and Rummy pulled JSOC out of the normal Pentagon chain of command and essentially rebranded them as The Presidents Own Death Squad. They answer to a very short command chain that pretty much begins and ends in the Oval Office.Since then they have been slinking all over the world killing people who kindasorta look like terrorists maybe which means they kill lots and lots of innocent people in the process which is why the number of radical jihadists who want to kill us has sharply increased over the last  years. In some theaters it has been estimated by BOTH the military and independent agencies that as many as  of kills are innocent civilians.The raid that nailed Osama bin Laden was a JSOC operation.So was the little adventure President Pussygrabber authorized last week which resulted in the killing of an eightyearold American girl among others.

10832055,0,t3_5uvp1o,Depends on how big the bust is suspected to be how busy the police department is and how big of a threat the bust is suspected to be. If its just one dealer its likely two police officers go round their house and attempt to convince the occupant to permit entry. If they receive no answer or are refused entry they likely try to find another way in or kick the door down perhaps opting for a ram to knock the door locks in with if available. If its a riskier bust or there are more suspects involved youll probably have a team of  to  officers in either standard uniform or SWATesque protective gear preparing to breach the doors into the house. First announcing their presence and requesting access to search the property may or may not be carried out depending on if they wish to retain the element of surprise amongst other factors. After battering the doors in with a ram or fire axe in some instances they sweep the house and identity and or restrain depending on hostility suspects and key evidence relying on forensics to thoroughly investigate the crime scene.But an even bigger location or threat? Like a warehouse full of cocaine smugglers? Probably dealing with a team of SWATesque armed units anywhere between  to  people depending on the size and risk of the operation at hand with other police officers cordoning off the area and monitoring the exterior of the warehouse while the armed officers sweep the warehouse for suspects hostiles hostages and threats before allowing others onto the crime scene. ,NoStupidQuestions,ddx90le,1,t5_2w844

10840717,0,t3_5uyypk,Some other thoughtsTurbulence has never ever brought a plane out of the sky. Dont worry about a bumpy ride. Major airports are kind of like malls. Of youre there early you can bum around a bit. I love watching planes land and take off too. If your flight is delayed which is super common in winter there is little the gate agent can do. Pay attention and go with the flow.Your seat is going to be tight. If you have the middle seat jockey for arm rests before you even take off. Also be strategic when you get on board and out anything you want easy access to in the seat pocket before sitting down. Once you are seated you cant do anything for about  minutes after take off. Once you get airborne you have to climb above  feet before you can use a laptop. And typically you have to be on course to your destination before you can get up. If you have a window seat you can look out the window great for a first timer!! or lean your head against the bulkhead for sleep but you have to ask two people to get up if you want to use the bathroom. Aisle seat can get up whenever but its harder to rest and people in the aisle El bump into you as they walk past. Middle just sucks. Avoid if you can. Make sure you grab everything when you get off  youll have a hard time getting it back afterward.  In general be patient. There is no reward for getting on the plane first or last. And the airlines have been doing this for a long time and mostly know what they are doing.  ,NoStupidQuestions,ddy563e,6,t5_2w844

If there is no way to falsify an assertion it is in itself unscientific.So your question about reality cannot be scientifically answered beyond what we can observe. If we live in a computer simulation that runs undetectably then it is a possibility that cannot be supported or refuted by science.

10921312,0,t3_5w0yuf,For two reasons...First is that in most states its illegal to have someone walk outside of a store with a bottle of alcohol that isnt bagged.Second is that it dates all the way back to prohibition.  For a while there it was illegal to drink.  But people drank anyway of course.  Cops didnt really care if you drank they drank too.  But if they saw  you OPENLY drinking they had to bust ya.  Otherwise they just looked lazy or corrupt.  So the compromise people came up with was they drank out of brown paper bags.  That way they could still drink but cops could at least pretend not to know they were drinking booze.  I mean it could be soda right?Obviously prohibition was a very long time ago and alcohol in general doesnt have the same social stigma it did back then.  But alot of the laws still on the books were passed in the immediate aftermath of prohibition.,NoStupidQuestions,de6ggq3,2,t5_2w844

If your argument for something is its obvious your position probably isnt very strong. gtCounterpoint what other reasons does the constitution state for allowing the people to bear arms? None.Which is relevant because???? gtYes. Which means it is up to the courts to decide and the courts decided.Ok. Please explain what is ambiguous about the statement. gtBecause nuclear arms are not protected by the nd amendment despite being simply and concretely defined as armsRight nukes are clearly and simply defined as arms. We agree. So I guess we have taken care of the ambiguous part of your argument. The fact that they arent protected is the whole point of the discussion. SCOTUS has ruled that the right to bear arms can be limited. I argued that they were mistaken in doing this mostly because of the part of the constitution that explicitly says the right to bear arms cant be limited. Now you are disagreeing with me by providing a counter argument. But you cant do that by assuming what is being argued in the first place.

10940343,0,t3_5w87cd,No its not illegal to say you did drugs or that you are going to do drugs.  In fact most places using the drug is not the crime posessing it is.  Both statements would be evidence of intent though which together with other evidence would be useful.  It is almost impossible to get a conviction based on a confession alone.  For example even if I said i have a brck of cocaine the state would still need to prove my statement was true.  I could be lying or I could be wrong.  Conspiracy requires at least two people planning on doing an illegal act and one or more doing sometning to further the act.

I knew it would take a week or two but you cant tell people upfront that youre only planning on working for a few weeks till youve raised a certain amount and then quitting.  You have to pretend youre going to be there for the long haul.I applied to a bunch of fast food places.  One day I was feeling cheeky and had a hunch they werent reading the applications. So under other skills I wrote down that I gave bomb head and could roll the fattest kindest blunts of anyone in da land.I was hired by that place lol.  So yeah I know for a fact sometimes they dont read the applications.As a rule theyll scan over it and see if you have any fast food experience.  But other than that some of them will read the application and some wont.  But its still always best to just fill it out more or less honestly and completely just on the chance theyll read it.Those jobs are throwaway jobs.  They know no one wants to work at a fast food place.  Its the kind of job you take because you need money and its close by etc.  Theyre used to people quitting and whatnot at very random times so most of them are hiring and firing all the time.

HalfLife Source is a remake of that one in the Source engine the original was in GoldSrc so as far as I know theyre the same game but Source has slightly better graphics and possibly physics. HalfLife Blue Shift and Opposing Force were both expansion packs for the original HalfLife game and also take place during the events of the first game though you play with different characters and from another perspective. Id recommend playing them only after playing the first one.Then comes HalfLife . And then Episode  and Episode . Lost Coast is an unreleased chapter from the original HL that was later released as a showcase of some technical capabilities of the Source Engine so its not very important but you should play it after playing  if you want to.

11085704,0,t3_5ya928,Im an Orthodox Christian and Im speaking from an Orthodox view I wanted to preface this with that.Killing yourself is murder youre taking life away from one of Gods creations. A murderer can be forgiven but forgiveness and reconciliation with God means that you have to confess your sins and repentatone for them. If youre dead you obviously cant do that therefore you havent died in a state of grace and by our doctrine wouldnt be able to enjoy the fruits of salvation.However our God is a merciful God and hell do what he wants when it comes down to it. With that in mind I cant definitively say that anyone will or will not attain salvation because that isnt up to me all I can say is this is what help you towards salvation and this is what is will keep you from salvation according to Gods revelation.If youre a believer and you know youre about to die a painful death would it not be better to experience a few minutes of agony for eternity in paradise rather than get it over quick just to be denied salvation and have to deal with the eternal agony of that?Do note we dont believe that hell looks like how Dante described it in the Divine Comedy thats a book from the Middle Ages and not canonical in any way.

11094839,0,t3_5yfa5r,Well its not Trumps plan he doesnt actually have any plans he just spouts whatever blather comes to his mind at the moment. Congressional Republicans put together this nightmare. Trump supports it now because it isnt the ACA.From what I can make out so far they took the things that were wrong with the ACA and dialed them up to . This thing is going to crash and burn so bad youll be able to see the crater from space. If it actually passes the damage to the economy will be staggering.The main thing they did that shows they dont understand the problem is that theyre going to eliminate the fine for not buying insurance. This was the single biggest flaw in the ACA because they made the fine lower than the cost of insurance which shortcircuited the individual mandate.Heres how this works. Both Obamacare and Romneycare which it was copied from although THAT inconvenient truth has been written out of history started off by banning most the little evil tricks the health insurance companies used to pull refusing to sell you insurance if you have preexisting conditions kicking you to the curb if you get too sick lifetime limits that kinda thing. Of course the insurance companies werent doing that JUST to be evil soulless bastards they were doing it because the business model of all insurance requires a large pool of insured people paying premiums with a relatively small pool of people making claims. Insurance simply cant stay in business otherwise. The evil soulless part was just for laughs...So enter the individual mandate the requirement in both Romneycare and Obamacare that you must buy insurance right away you cant wait until you are sick. And this is where Obamacare screwed up they made the fine for not buying insurance lower than the cost of insurance so lots of people opted for the cheaper alternative and the insurance companies took a shot to the profits which made them squeal like a pig and raise their rates.What I can make out from this proposed plan is that they KEPT the first clause but are eliminating the fine for not buying insurance. They mumble something about raising your rates if you let your insurance lapse but it isnt gonna work like that. If people dont HAVE to buy insurance they wont. And then theyll get sick and become bankrupted by medical bills.So basically this is gonna make the cost of insurance go WAYYY up. Employers who provide insurance for employees are gonna take a major hit so theyll increase the amount of employee contribution and your takehome pay will drop. With less money in their pockets consumers will spend less so all companies that depend on consumer spending will take a hit as well. People will be laid off and the effect will ripple throughout the economy.Meanwhile they also appear to be eliminating the third clause of Obamacare state subsidies for poor people to buy insurance. They say theyre replacing that with agebased tax credits but I cant even figure out what that is supposed to mean. It certainly doesnt sound like its going to help poor people buy insurance.So the net effect of this thing if it passes which is kinda up in the air now will be to devastate the economy and well go back to the practice of letting poor people die in the gutter and go back to the  cause of personal bankruptcies being medical bills so the erosion of the middle class will be accelerated. I cant even figure out who this bill is supposed to be GOOD for. The rich will get a temporary very minor tax cut surprise! but as the economy tanks theyre eventually gonna get burned same as the rest of us.,NoStupidQuestions,depl9cj,6,t5_2w844

At the end of each month you need to pay what youve borrowed or you will incur interest. That interest rate is much much higher than a car mortgage or student loan generally has.If you pay the balance off each month youll never pay a penny in interest. If you dont you could wind up paying a staggering sum. Credit cards arent as awful as they once were a federal law changed things. Once they would suggest a minimum payment that was below what youd incur from interest so that if you only made the minimum payments youd never get out of debt. Now the law requires that your monthly statement include how long it would take to pay the balance if you only made the minimum payments and how much youd pay in the long run.People still get screwed up easily by deferring payments and getting on the wrong end of compounded interest where you pay interest on a balance that already increased from interest.

They took a larger precentage from the music and arts programs than others to pay to begin the program.The leaders of the community college system believed they would get more students with a football program because the school was mostly ignored as the students were mostly focused on music arts and academics. These students were not interested in attracting those who would turn it into some sort of party school but the district wanted to attract out of state students with sports.It came to the point where they needed a school mascot and to choose school colors for the school and the sports teams.Since a majority of the students were quite upset with the cuts to their programs to focus on sports when it came to voting the school ended up having the colors Pink and White and their mascot was the ArtichokeThey overrode the student vote and went with Red and Blue and Bears.the student government overrode that saying a new election was required to change it.they eventually agreed to change the colors to green and gold but the Artichoke had to stayROCK ON ARTIE THE ARTICHOKE,NoStupidQuestions,dewg4j7,1,t5_2w844

Thats a far cry from why someone cant learn to like clubbing and stating they are too lame.Really it comes down to cultural differences.  Lack of public transportation making the need to get home more difficult to plan for when you have been out drinking and taking drugs do not drive! there being less of a club scene when growing up than there is Europe where clubs are everywhere.  Closest equivalent I would think for kids and young adults would be rave parties.  However by the time an adult in the US is legally able to drink there are often other things in life more important than clubbing and not enough time for it to really become culturally relevant instead of starting at a younger age with no legal backlash.  Being more social in more environments meaning you dont need to go to a club to meet new people.    There are lots of reasons why in general the American culture isnt a big club scene.  It works in Europe and thats fine.  HOwever people arent lame because they prefer other ways of spending their time and interacting with people.,NoStupidQuestions,df2gu5o,2,t5_2w844

11266722,0,t1_df926j1,My stance predictably is that you are not diseased and that through personal choices and circumstances that help contribute to poor personal choices you are where you are. I do not think you are a bad person or irredeemable or so different from me or anyone else. Maybe had I been born in your shoes I would be where you are. But they are choices you make and continue to make and just stopping probably isnt easy. I think this notion of it being a disease has probably left you feeling helpless like no matter what you do you have some sort of affliction that defines you. Society is fucked up. Look at the responses from people on here  arguing with a complete stranger about a word and hating on him. This is your one shot at life and you shouldnt live it under some cloud named disease. Start replacing bad habits with good ones and surrounding yourself with good people. Get new friends. My honest to god suggestion would be to find a local jiu jitsu place and start training. Good people something physical a goal to work toward and easy to dump time into it so you arent bored at home eating and doing whatever else.

11324706,0,t3_61m9zs,For most of history the average person would have products made within a tens of miles of their home but in the industrial revolution we see international goods becoming affordable for the average person.An early example of this is wheat. The open plains of North America are very good for growing lots of wheat which made it cheap and even after shipping it to the UK it was cheaper than growing it domestically. At this point in history your daily loaf of bread was your main source of calories so cheaper wheat is really good for the average person. Secondly having another source of wheat means poor harvests wont lead to famine. However it would put a lot of British wheat farmers out of work. Originally the government sided with the local farmers and put tariffs on importing grain Eventually though the increasing size of the cities needed the cheaper grain too much and the tariffs were repealed. Farmers lost their jobs and went to work in the factories and the reliance on imported grain put Britain at risk of blockade during the second world war.These are the kind of decisions society has to make. Your trade decisions will hurt part of your society. It sucked for the farmers to lose their jobs but the public and the farmers children got the benefit of cheaper food. If you didnt however people literally starved to death. Some places are simply better at making a certain type of product and so can do it more cheaply which means we can get more of it.It is also worth looking at the clothing industry. Like everything clothing used to be a local affair. Women would spin wool into thread and then the thread would be woven into cloth which would then be cut into shape and turned into clothing. This was called a cottage industry because it would be done in someones cottage. People then invented machines to do this instead. All the actions were quite repetitive and so could be automated and one machine operator could do the work of dozens of craftsman and even though we have negative opinions of mass produced goods today these goods would often be of a higher quality because of the regularity and precision of machines. People got cheaper clothes but spinners and weavers lost their jobs. In this case it wasnt goods being made by foreigners but goods being made by machines. There was group called the Luddites who were put out of work by this automation and smashed the machines but history has labelled them as primitives. Here is a documentary about the clothing industry I like hosted by the actor who played Ron Weasleys dad in Harry Potter.After the second world war the US found itself as the biggest producer in the world as everywhere else had been damaged by war. The US manufacturing industry was doing very well and youll hear people alive at the time talk about how good the jobs were. Eventually though other countries recovered and work went to the places with cheaper wages but more importantly manufacturing jobs were lost to better machines Globalization refers to the increasing interconnection of economies. Goods are made all over the world at a cheaper price point than otherwise. This is good in the long run but the people who lose their jobs arent happy about it of course. The trouble with it politically comes from people not really understanding it. I mentioned most job losses have been to machines rather than foreigners but that doesnt rile people up as much. I also notice many people use Globalism to describe Capitalisms flaws Wealth Inequality and the destruction of communities for example. The problem isnt so much with Globalism but Capitalism and thats a place most people dont want to go. Im not advocating Communism  an individuals ability to show initiative is vital to economic success but if youre unhappy about how the economy is changing society then changes will have to be made to capitalism.,NoStupidQuestions,dffmxjf,5,t5_2w844

11406657,0,t1_dfosq5a,Ive seen MANY a chemistry student tripped up by copper being Cu. Usually they want it to be Co cobalt or just C carbon or sometimes Cp nothing so these are closer to being right but Cp could be confused with Csubp which is isobaric heat capacity. They all get hung up on the letters in the symbol being parts of the modern English spelling of the element and because the first letter of copper still matches the first letter of its chemical symbol its probably the most frequentlywrong answer on introductory chemistry tests.As a side note copper also is subject to so much weirdness from a chemical perspective that it remains the subject of the most frequentlywrong answers through several more chemistry courses.,NoStupidQuestions,dfoxibo,1,t5_2w844

A working holiday visa might be one option though Im not too familiar with them. I do know that Australia offers working holiday visas for certain nationalities up to a certain age and Ive heard of Koreans and IIRC Canadians taking advantage of that. Similarly some countries have minimal requirements for becoming an English teacher  in some cases its just having a university degree and no criminal record  which allows folks to experience living abroad while also earning money to pay back student loans. Here in South Korea its not uncommon to hear of people paying off their student loans in a couple of years while also taking trips to Vietnam Thailand the Philippines etc. I knew a Canadian woman who in her s worked several parttime jobs at once and lived in cheap housing for a year so that she could then take  months to go traveling.

Orthostatic shock  the body tries to maintain all the fluids and pressures at a reasonably static level.    Removing that much of the body at one time is dangerous because you cant just calculate how much fluid that persons system needs to maintain normal levels.    hormones.   Fat produces hormones.   Changing the volume of fat that drastically will change the amount of hormones in that persons system.   It can be a shock when a huge source of hormones is suddenly removed.     anesthesia.   Fat people often have heart and breathing trouble.  Trying to remove all that body mass with all those arteries and veins and trying to cap off or redirect all that blood around the wound is very time consuming.    Having someone under anesthesia is dangerous.   The longer they stay under the more likely something bad is going to happen.   That kind of surgery could take many hours.   Im not a doctor.

11504022,0,t3_646nwe,The other answers are all good about it being an important part of our justice system and because obviously guilty can be very deceptive but Ill add one more reasonBecause guilt is about more than whether they did it.Trials arent just to establish whether you pulled the trigger theyre also to establish WHY. Was this a coldblooded murder or selfdefense? Was the terrorist just one asshole acting alone or were they a professional spy for a foreign nation or were they a crazy person trying to blow up Congress because its been taken over by space lizards? Trials are about presenting evidence to establish a complete picture of the event including motivations and determine the best response.Ok so lets say you shot a guy and he died. Obviously murder right? Except it turns out he was in the middle of breaking into your home with a gun at the time. Obviously selfdefense right? Except hed already surrendered after you fought him and took his gun and you shot him when he was defenseless. Obviously a revenge killing right? Except theres evidence he had an accomplice coming in through the back window so you feared for your life. Obviously selfdefense again right? Except it turns out this guy was someone youd known previously and been harassing for years. Obviously murder again right? Except......and so on. Its very dangerous to think of crimes as black and white guilty and innocent. EVERY crime has shades of grey based on intention circumstance damage done etc. One more note trying to streamline justice with obvious rules is how we get things like mandatory minimums for drug crimes where a mother of two with no prior convictions can get  years in prison for possession when even the judge and prosecutor agree the drugs were left in her car by her boyfriend. No one thinks she did anything wrong but she obviously had drugs in her car so shes going to jail because theres a mandatory minimum sentence in this area for drug possession. There have literally been judges who sentenced people to prison while arguing that they dont deserve to go to prison because the judge recognizes that the reality of this particular situation is more complex than the rules established in the law. But those rules were passed to make sure that obviously guilty people get punished and the judge cant do anything about it.TLDR Trials get a bad rep but theyre really amazing and wonderful things. Theyre how we as a society determine not just guilt but justice. The distinction between those two concepts is for me the mark of a civilized society. ,NoStupidQuestions,dfzzc35,4,t5_2w844

It was enough that it prevented sunlight from warming the earth probably for several years.  Plants died off along with the food sources of the dinosaurs.  The strike didnt kill the dinosaurs instantly it probably took many years for the initial dieoff to occur and perhaps thousands of years for species that survived the initial impact to die off because they were no longer efficient enough to continue to survive in the new climate gradually finding it more and more difficult over the generations to survive.The survivors were basically smaller creatures and mammals.

We have no idea what intelligence even IS so claiming you can test for it and then quantify it with a single number is just beyond ludicrous.The concept of IQ was invented in the late th century by French psychologist Alfred Binet who used it to identify schoolchildren who needed a little more help in coming up to speed with their peers a noble goal. Binet specifically warned that this number should by no means be mistaken for a true indicator of intelligence and should not be considered a fixed thing IQ can change over time.Well THAT barely lasted past Binets death and pretty soon IQ was coopted by the eugenicists who used it to prove that white people were the master race. Eugenics was wildly popular in both the US and Europe in the late th and early th century. The goal of eugenics is NOT to bring the inferior people up to the level of the master race but to remove them from the gene pool.Early IQ tests were LUDICROUSLY culturally biased they were little more than pop culture trivia quizzes. Today proponents claim they no longer are biased but have not produced any actual science to back up that claim.Genetically the evidence is BEYOND conclusive the amount of genetic variation in humans is so teensy as to be something you can safely ignore.

When driving a car you are actively trying to avoid hitting each other so when an accident happen e.g. someone else is driving drunk and hits you it helps your safety when you have airbags and cars designed to crumble in particular ways so to spare passengers. In American Football however the object for most players is to hit you you cannot avoid it people are going to smash into one another its how the game works. So adding helmets and protective gear has the effect that the people tacking the ones actively trying to hit you can hit you as hard as they possibly can since they wont get hurt too bad themselves because of the gear. The protective gear end up acting more like an incentive to hit harder its more battering ram no a car less airbag.,NoStupidQuestions,dgn1m7z,8,t5_2w844

11708914,0,t1_dgn81rm,Yes and no. In modern plumbing systems it is mostly. Im not particularly familiar with older U.K. systems but my understanding is that they have separate hot and cold supplies with the hot water not potable. But even in a modern system there can be differences. Many people dont drink hot tap water nor use it for cooking. But the hot water tank will collect sediment etc.  If an amateur replaced the shower head they may have used something they shouldnt have perhaps a bad glue for sealing things. Or maybe theres a water filter at the sinks to remove impurities but not for the shower. Ordinarily a water test is done as close to the supply line as possible in the sense of before devices that could affect things even an aerator. But if you have an inexplicable sensitivity at one supply line testing it makes sense. ,NoStupidQuestions,dgn8h7q,1,t5_2w844

It would still give you experience of putting up and sleeping in a tent cooking food etc.Remember to bring extra clothes and while this is more for hiking avoid cotton if possible If you have any specific questions you can PM me.
