42523,0,t3_1ul7fj,On the Valley View bridge my iPod froze for the first time ever while sitting in the center console of my car while I was driving even though I had the heater running on full blast. The music stopped and the screen looked like it would if you break it or drop it. I held it in front of the vent for a while and it turned back on and worked fine but the battery was super low. This thing got run over by a car in  and it still works perfectly but I had thought now that this time it had actually met its demise. When I got home my iPhone wouldnt charge at first because it was chilled even though it had been protected in a wallet case and sitting on the passenger seat. I guess my car never fully warmed up...Also since the new year Ive had the following things happen for the first time ever had to melt the ice on my car using warm water carefully wiped it on as though I were washing it had my locks almost freeze shut had frost on the inside of my car and had the car not stay started to the point where I legitimately thought Id be stranded at a friends house.

829373,0,t1_cgy8t6n,In a vaccum I would agree but this project is fine. It certainly does not suck as ufeboh put it.The only part that bothers me the enormous parking lot inbetween Phase I and II was originally supposed to be developed over with townhouses and the sort.First they were planned as being part of Phase II but then later as future developments and Phase III. I am sure it will be done at some point but clearly the project has evolved cut into different steps and changed to make it more affordable to do. Lets not forget new construction and apartments in Cleveland havent been feasible for years.Most of the single use one story buildings are near the river where you could argue you dont really want a wall of tall multiuse buildings anyway.I dont think its perfect but its still going to be one of the densest places in the city when finished with much room to expand upon. Plus this wont just be a catalyst for the flats it will be for the whole city. Showing people want to move into and develop new space in Cleveland will raise rents which in turn will allow developers to justify higher construction costs everywhere tall buildings lets say. ,Cleveland,cgyjv3j,4,t5_2qkh0

Im not trying to address that issue right now. I agree that if the parents want to do this and spend their money this way then its up to them.  Im not even arguing that the school doesnt have legal basis to do this.  What i AM saying is that its wrong.  Its wrong to treat a population as suspect of a crime and then proceed to enforce a policy that presupposes guilt in order to prove innocence.  I would also argue that it is a violation of rights and I dont care how awesome you are as a father im guessing youre a guy here your children have rights.  Its one of the reasons you cant kill them o  If you want to argue about how many and which rights they have then we could be here for a while.

1115707,0,t3_26uaof,Ah the auto auction.. sigh. Youre not gonna like my advice which comes from experts  folks who are there constantly. Get there early. AM early. Pick your car or cars LONG before they start. You cannot start the car. So yes you may be bidding on a nonrunning vehicle. If its public auction its got at least K on the odometer  at least with GCAA. Do NOT expect to get a bargain. IT WILL NEED WORK. Anticipate LOTS of work. Have your money sorted IN ADVANCE. They WILL ban you if you dont. You arent driving it home. Public is immediately followed by Dealer. GCAA holds all the not junk cars for Dealer auction. Dont expect to find anything above scrap value. Just dont go to public if you can avoid it. Make friends with someone who has a Dealer license and go with them to the Dealer auction. Money you will need  and it must be CASH on Friday. No checks no money orders no credit cards. The remainder of your bid is due the following Monday  days later by PM and can be cash or bank certified funds such as cashiers check  no personal checks no credit cards. I believe bank issued money orders are acceptable but check with them.But really GCAA Public is basically the dumping ground for cars that the dealers wont waste their time and money on. Most of the cars are at least  years old and pretty much all of them are over K miles or have significant problems. Honestly if you dont have a lot of experience fixing cars  both bodywork and mechanical  its a bad idea buying anything from any auction with rare exceptions. And those cars always go fairly close to what youd pay private sale. Theyll usually warn you if youll have to tow it away since they want it out of their lot but thats it.

I had assumed those terms were synonymous so I didnt feel as though I was defining it at all merely elaborating on a term that sort of defines itself.  And of course its overly broad.  Thats why nearly any use of the term lawabiding is stupid because nobody is entirely lawabiding.  Thats my whole point dividing the population into lawabiding and criminal is worthless.  Lawabiding citizen is just one of those terms that to me makes whatever follows sort of a joke sort of like taxpayer dollars.  Everyone is a lawabiding citizen until theyre not.  Just like everyone who owns a gun is a responsible gun owner until theyre not.  I just feel like we should be focused more on the until theyre not part.,Cleveland,cixby5f,0,t5_2qkh0

1977627,0,t3_2hc7iz,Sorry to hear you arent feeling well.  It is a very positive sign that you are actively seeking help though.The initial search for a professional to talk to can be frustrating if not disheartening.Its something I have struggled with numerous times in the past.  Ive had some pretty miserable experiences with both psychologists and psychiatrists when going through the same process. This has been in Cleveland and other locations...Its so important to find someone you not only feel comfortable discussing your problems with but also someone whose opinions you respect and trust.Dont give up.If you have concerns about going straight to medication I would recommend that you initially see a psychologist.I have seen someone located in Kamms Corner for two years and I have been very happy with them.I also see a psychiatrist because of the medications that I take.If the Western side of Cuyahoga county isnt too far for you to try feel free to DM me and Ill give you their names.Speaking of medication... I recently went back on an antidepressant Zoloft for the first time in almost three years.  I have taken other types of antidepressants in the past.I dont find that it hinders my personality or creativity in any way.  That being said everyone responds differently to medication.  I had reached such a low point in recent months that the positives of going on the medication greatly outweighed the negatives. The depression and anxiety was affecting my character more than anything else.Keep pushing forward.   It can be very hard to see the end of the tunnel when youre in the midst of it but things will begin to improve if you continue to seek out support.,Cleveland,ckri5pu,2,t5_2qkh0

2132613,0,t1_clafoj9,ebola in its fullblown hemorrhagic stages probably tends to get a bit messy. moreso my guess is that if its at a stage where hemorrhaging is actively occurring the patients viral load is probably great enough to pose a legitimate risk to someone who would potentially get infected droplets in their mucous membranes. which is why it poses a much greater risk to a nurse dealing with the patient than some person who came in contact with the person a week earlier right at the onset of their symptoms. my guess is that it was just a failure from the standpoint of not taking enough precautions. that said im sure that dallas hospital was not expecting to have an ebola patient admitted to their emergency room anytime soon. it sucks but it really had to happen eventually because not all cases were going to end up being introduced at worldclass institutions like emory. ,Cleveland,clawhc3,2,t5_2qkh0

2372755,0,t3_2mjndv,So according to newsnet this was the nd time that night they went to her. She has a history of mental illness and was getting crazy enough the cops were called twice. They were taking her in for a forced psychological exam. When you have someone who is legit crazy resisting and fighting back you have to take them down and cuff them. This really just seems like a horrible accident not a cops are out to get us situation. I mean have you seen a schizophrenic person during a break down? They violently twist and turn and yank there body around in sudden jerky movement. She very well could have just suddenly twisted her head while going down and just  freak timing thing led to a neck issue. Or we know she already wasnt healthy maybe the fact that she was about to die of natural causes is what made her body react and go crazy in the first place leading the cops to be called. Obviously that seems unlikely but this seems more like a freak accident still horrible thing than blatant police beating or something. ,Cleveland,cm4zaun,23,t5_2qkh0

Its really really beautiful and only about a  hour drive south.My only warning is you will  need a  wheel drive vehicle or at least one with decent tirestraction control to get around down there because of the snow.

Even if they did it would not be official. It is technically against the rules to communicate this type of thing outside of the NRMP system. Theres really no way of knowing  for sure until the match day.EDIT if a candidate does not match at ANY residency they are notified a few days before the match day. This allows them to avoid th embarrassment of finding out they didnt match in front of all their classmates and gives them time to prepare to scramble into an unfilled residency program.,Cleveland,cnp51pw,1,t5_2qkh0

I buy a Hoppin Frog knowing that Im gonna be experiencing something great I set my calender to the seasonals that Fathead GLBC and Thirsty Dog run at various times.  Yeah other breweries have really good fucking beer but Ive been let down by other beers from breweries that are viewed as titans.  Bells Christmas Ale was OK at best in my opinion my buddy had me try a Rogue I forget which at this point which is telling that left me very underwhelmed.One of my friends was never a beer person.  He could tolerate it and there were a few that he liked but he wasnt a beer guy.  Then I went on a crazy fucking binge and bought a ton of various Christmas Ales.  GLBC Hoppin Frog Thirsty Dog and on and on.  My fridge was packed to the rafters with the stuff.  I gave him a Hoppin Frog Frosted Frog and it was like a light bulb went on for the first time in his life.  The following week he went beer exploring he discovered that he loves stouts and most of his favorites are from Ohio.TLDR Ohio beers will literally change your life.,Cleveland,cny04j4,1,t5_2qkh0

2935940,0,t3_2td7km,Ohio City amp Shaker square both have some good things about them OP  good luck with your search.FWIW my husband lived there for a few years moved out in  and he lived right near the rapid station. I took the green  blue line to visit him from CSU  or on the west side where I lived and I never felt unsafe. I dont know th street but the Square itself is a nice place. RE the rapid. It depends on the time of day or event. During morning rush  evening rush there are people going to work and there are kids going to school. Sometimes those kids like to be loud and curse etc. There are poor people who ride it. But Ive always kept to myself and never had an issue.  There are lots of suburban people going to Indians Cavs Browns games etc. And during the later hours theres some ...odd people at times. I would use tower city and it always had other people and security close by. People have been robbed at some of the less populated stations and I think sadly there was a robberymurder last year.

Cleveland he says got greedy. Hillenmeyer and former Indianapolis Colts center Jeff Saturday are suing the city in the Supreme Court of Ohio for refunds of  and  respectively. They say its not the sum that matters but the principle Cleveland taxes all the athletes on a visiting team for every game even players who are hurt or dont attend. Nobody likes paying taxesthats obviousbut they should be fair says Hillenmeyer who retired in  after eight years in the National Football League.

3792397,0,t3_33urxa,As uDROTH pointed out the Beachland Ballroom is a GREAT venue. The band in the ballroom is actually from Kent Ohio though according to the website. There is a girl playing in the tavern but she is from Boston. MusicBox Supper Club has an Allman Brothers tribute band from Cleveland tonight. Mahalls  lanes has a band in from nearby Canton Ohio. If you like the blues the Parkview Nite Club has a local blues band every Saturday night but its a bit of a restaurant atmosphere. The Happy Dog westside has a couple of local bands as well. I would check out the websites and look into the bands to see what type of music interests you most. Roc Bar has a rock band usually heavier stuff from Cleveland tonight but cant speak to the venue because Ive never been. As uDROTH stated the headliner at the Grog Shop cancelled but a local band will still be playing there. Good luck and have fun!

They give everyone a donation sheet and it just makes you feel like shit because you dont want to be the only one not donating and look like an ahole when everyone in fact feels the same way you do.

If you are going to say that the scales are the determining factor that allow for correctness then  you need to source through science and math that and explain what scales are and what disjoints them. Otherwise it is just soft science nonsense. That which can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed  so in this case your objective point of view happens to be very close to an opinion.

4905800,0,t3_3i39q6,Ill just tell you my experiences getting haircuts in Cleveland Im a guy.Lots of my guy friends go to Crazy Mullets Coventry or another cheap place Great Clips for a ish haircut. I go to Abstract Hair Salon. Just like every place else its cheaper there if youre a guy getting a haircut. Seriously everywhere gives men a discount. My cut is  while my wifes cut from the same stylist is .At Abstract the place I go they typically do a better job than those cheap places. They wash my hair give me coffee and give me a better cut that grows out the way I like it. But the stylist is not the master stylist at the salon. If I had my hair cut from the master stylist the price for a cut would be  for men and  for women. Its  for a cutstyle for women. If youre a top stylist in Seattle then I think that price range would be reasonable.Ive never lived outside the Midwest and Ive never seen gender equal prices. Youre more of an expert than me but it seems to me that it takes a less effort to cut mens hair than womens hair. On average women have longer hair I guess so more hair  more time. Then again you dont have to go that route if you open a salon here. If you have gender equal pricing and still attract clients then it doesnt really matter.One last thing. You mentioned that Cleveland is cheaper than Seattle. If rent is cheaper the cost of living is cheaper too typically. Salon prices be cheaper here too but that goes both ways. A dollar in CLE buys a lot more than a dollar in Seattle.,Cleveland,cucwvoz,2,t5_2qkh0

Create a responsive design website that looks great online and on mobile then just wrap the website around a webview inside an app. The user would launch the app and it would look like an app but its really just a mobile version of the website. I believe Facebook used this same method back in the day. Its the fake it till you make it thought process. As for getting the users its defiantly possible but you cant really compare yourself to any of the giants. Twitter was embraced by celebrities almost from day one. Facebook owes a lot of its success to the failure of MySpace which was falling and millions and millions of people were looking to jump ship. Tinder I have no idea their back story but I know thru are heavily funded not to mention that their company fills the needs of most people in the world your app would only fill the need of bored people essentially.

6843369,0,t3_49bifv,Lakewood is probably the most correct answer here. There is no busing in LW nor has there ever been. Every single weekday morning youll see children of all ages safely traversing the city on foot. Lakewood has myriad housing options from gourmet singlefamily chateaus to simply updown doubles rowhouses townhouses condos luxury apartments efficiencies and funky quirky spaces to live above many businesses on Detroit and Madison. Ridiculously bikecentric for a stodgy midwestern city and easily navigable on foot from east end to west end. Moved my daughter to Lakewood High School two years ago. She has excelled and found an individual path in a comfortable and supportive environment. Awesome teachers counselors and admins throughout the district and a hugely diverse student population.If you want a sense of security child safety educational quality community and good times all wrapped in to one package Lakewood should be on your hit list!,Cleveland,d0s02av,3,t5_2qkh0

So had I eaten before the game my cost would have been even cheaper. I paid  round trip to take the Rapid down to the game and back.So no your  per person at an Indians game is NOT realistic. You can spend that much if you try and are irresponsible with how youre spending your money.

Couple that with the fact that the tickets get more expensive on weekends and closer to game time and you see why going to a game isnt something many people choose to do spontaneously. Which is what you need if you want a large crowd.For reference the rubberducks have been drawing relatively large crowds lately mostly because its easy to decide last minute to go to game people know that tickets are and will remain cheap and its a more family friendly environment whereas in my impression Indians games have become more of a yuppie gathering in recent years. ,Cleveland,d75xvjn,0,t5_2qkh0

9178546,0,t3_55wmv4,I have never been before but Im super excited about participating this year. If you check out the website they have several events listed that you could check out. For the days that you mention they have Ales on Rails a train ride which I assume will also involve beer drinking. I have done the train ride and it is fairly nice this would definitely be a good time of year for it. They also have an event they call RARE which seems to be a big beer festival with lots of rarecools beers. It is pretty expensive according to their website but also looks like it would be a lot of fun.    From what I have seen and heard it also seems like many barsbreweries in the area are going to be releasing some new beers during the week so it seems like it would be worth it just to stop by some bars.    As for what bars specifically I have been to several places that are going to be participating and they are already advertising what beers they will have. Some might also have that info online so you could check out which places have stuff that you really want to try. A lot of the goto places seem to be participating so many of the places that would be recommended to you as just good beer places will probably be excellent choices. There are plenty of areas in Cleveland that have a bunch of bars clustered together like West thOhio city East th East Bank Flats West th and places in Lakewood. A good idea would be to pick an area with a couple places that you think sound cool and then bar hop around that area. It would also be very doable to hit up most of those areas in a single night since they are located near downtown. If you start at East th and then move west as you bar hop or start in Ohio City and move east you are gonna probably have a great time.    Edit There is also a huge list of events on the beer week website that includes stuff at individual bar and breweries. Would definitely check those out for the days that you will be in Cleveland.,Cleveland,d8fg4of,2,t5_2qkh0

9888704,0,t1_davxcp4,Ive thought a lot about this but never put it down in writing. Lets see how it looks in black and white.Lets set aside the moral implications of whether or not abortion is murder. Lets concentrate on what is actually helped by abortion society.Also setting aside the Freakonomics assumptiondetermination that abortion lowers crime lets agree that legal abortion prevents crime by not making women who seek abortions into criminals.In all societies people fight against powerful forces to be able to lead the lives they want. One of those forces is parenthood and pregnancy. If a woman wants to terminate a pregnancy bad enough she will do it. If shes rich a doctor will do it. If shes poor well there are other choices some of them horrific.Im not sure I want my society to force a woman to make that choice. Im not proabortion but I am pro choice. I am pro freedom.What about freedom of choice for the fetus? Well thats a rough question. But I think its okay to set it aside for now. Instead lets ask What are people going to do? Theyre going to get abortions. What should we do about it? We have a choice between punishing people who do it and creating a society where they wont feel the need.Ever the optimist Im more hopeful that we can create a society where unwanted pregnancies are super rare where care for expectant and new mothers is exceptional because we care for everyone and would like to give them a shot not just at being born but at living healthy and productive lives to further strengthen society. Its not where were at today but its something we could maybe concentrate on if we didnt spend so much fucking time arguing about morality and legality.What do you think?,Cleveland,dawirm7,8,t5_2qkh0

10034604,0,t1_dbfinnq,The problem isnt who gets paid what the problem is the rich taking more and more off the top each fiscal year. Many issues are with the stockholders and is a reason weve got a k Dow. The more profit a company is making the higher theyll trade at which makes the CEOs rich from their stock options. The solution isnt a black and white number to pay your employees because the rich companies with more cash to throw around would squeeze out the smaller companies and then it would be easier to buy up the competition. Try selling a business that isnt profitable. A solution would be a corporate windfall tax something that would force a publicly traded company to provide monies to their employees in addition to a set minimum wage. For instance if you work at Apple despite their decent hourly wage this is an example in addition to your hourly the company would also have to give you a credible stock option too. That helps tie the employee to the result of hisher own work. For a company that is not publicly traded a windfall tax basically an additional tax on only the profit dollar amount could be pushed to the employees. An example would be say a small maintenance shop. If the company is taxed  on their net profits and disbursed to the employees again both parties win. The employer pays their employees based on how well the business is doing and the employees are also tied to the success of the business in a small way.There is no onesizefitsall answer and by the time we come up with one we might be to the point of universal income anyway.,Cleveland,dbfjab3,6,t5_2qkh0

They like to buy a lot of cars that have been in accidents and wrecks.  They purchase them at a low cost fix them and sell them at a low cost as well.  So they may have a lot of salvage title or accident ridden cars.  They also specialize in people with bad credit.  urodionkjd may be able to answer more here too.EDIT  They are also like KDK auto brokers.

10670815,1,t1_ddgktcd,I have two problems with this. First is that this wont be all the money theyll be asking for. Its a pretty good bet that well before those loans are paid off theyll be asking for money beyond whats already been set aside. The second is that a good chunk seems to count on attendance at the arena to stay where it is. That may be doable for concerts and other nonCavs or Monsters events but if they start losing especially after LeBrons retired I can see attendance dropping pretty hard. Total attendance dropped  after LeBron went to Miami and the season before he was drafted it was less than half it was at the peak in . There is a nonzero chance of that happening again when he retires.Edit to add Before anyone points out your last bullet point I see it there. I just dont buy it. Not that they wont add a surcharge or a fee Im sure they wont. But they can also accomplish the same effect by just jacking up ticket prices regularly over the next few years and justify it as we need to pay for this work being done when all it really is is making sure they have to pay less.,Cleveland,ddgm3ru,4,t5_2qkh0
