1263491,0,t1_ci6huvh,Thanks man helps a lot with being nervous.I usually run about a  mile before school twice around my block so I think bumping it up more to about  to   miles a day would work just fine.I have been doing bullpen sessions about twice a day also right after classes and some time later in the evening each of them about  pitches. Ive been really working on command with my fastballseam. I feel comfortable throwing them more now. Really helps knowing one of the teams catchers lives on the same block as me.My pitch ratio is like you said more fastballs  seams and changeups. My curveball is growing into more of a roll even though its usually just a   pitch I throw about once or twice an inning mostly on counts like  or  to throw them off thinking its my put awaypitch but then coming right back at them with a fastball.As for the season it starts in about a week and a half. Im scheduled to start the rd game of the season a home game but until then Ill be in the bullpen or if needed playing left field.Wish me luck!,baseballplayers,cibrbje,1,t5_2uc7o
