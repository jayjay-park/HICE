3294321,0,t3_2xussh,Ive always felt the same way. I think they wanted to wrap up everyones stories with happy endings because they didnt have movie plans at that time. Now that the movie is coming out I cant see Vince still being a married man but I guess well see.,entourage,cp3s23v,10,t5_2r2bs

4265098,0,t3_38b3gt,I loved everything except for Turtles side story.  He shouldve at least got back with Jaime Lynn or something substantial.   Vinny  First time director with a smash hit.  Drama  got an Emmy.   Ari  Movie producerskys the limit.   E  a child and back with Sloan.  Turtle  got a girlfriend.,entourage,cs6e7s2,1,t5_2r2bs
4325621,0,t1_csbjkjo,My gf really enjoyed the movie without seeing any episodes but theres lots of inside or continuous jokes especially dramas little catchphrases and stuff that didnt make sense to her. Personally I watched all the show several times and loved it so would recommend that if possible,entourage,csd85qu,2,t5_2r2bs
4325654,0,t1_cs2c2k9,Its Entourage though. The whole premise of the show is outlandish guest appearances. They found time to put Billy Walsh in there and he was pretty pointless in the grand scheme of the movie. Nicky was an amazing character and absolutely hilarious. Would have been nice to have seen him in there.,entourage,csd8akf,2,t5_2r2bs

4467182,0,t3_3ca0gc,Its a hard scene to watch I dont know if its Adrien Grenier playing an actor who isnt very good or if it is because he is just not very good but regardless we are supposed to assume that it was in fact a well done scene because not only does Scorsese judge Vinnies ability on it but both Dana Gordon and John Ellis say that the scene was very good.  Also Gus Van Sant said that the scene was very good just not what he was looking for for his movie....,entourage,cstrj08,11,t5_2r2bs

5129455,0,t1_cv370m6,Well played bud! Totally get those points and agree on most. I learned to appreciate Drama while bingewatching for the third time eventually recognizing that his crass humor was a defense mechanism for his insecurity. I used to binge all the seasons ahead of the premiere of the next one and probably go through the series once a year since. If theres anything the movie did right it was put Drama in a position where audiences HAVE to see how strong he was throughout the series  even while Piven stole most of the laughs.My concern is that after the movie  which was kinda disappointing when I take my fanboy goggles off  is that interest is low and newcomers might struggle with Season  and up. I still cant shake the feeling that the movie was a mea culpa for the last four episodes of the series. Ellin literally undid everything. That was tough to accept because it made me feel like nothing matters in this Entourage universe. Except the friendship I guess. ,entourage,cv4ai8u,2,t5_2r2bs
