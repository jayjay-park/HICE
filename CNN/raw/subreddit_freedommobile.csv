9896465,0,t3_5gv167,If you ask Wind support they will just give you BS about not supporting iMessage and Apple will tell you its WINDs issue. The activation is fickle it sometimes works because WindFreedom likes to turn the support on or off when people complain enough. Its literally because they block the activation because they are not partnered with Apple and do not want to pay licensing to be supported as a main carrier listed by Apple. Depending on the situation is could be that its just not activating and its saying error. Or its texting you a sting of random numbers and letters which is a bigger problem that should have been resolved a month or two ago but is a WindFreedom issue that they are able to fix it has to do with silent texts not being able to pass through. ,freedommobile,daxj7bu,1,t5_3hlgr

10455642,0,t1_dct8ggy,Oh OK. I was gonna say if youre Ottawa or Kingston the Pixel would work on LTE in those cities. I believe theyll make you pay the difference if you get the V now and switch the plan. ,freedommobile,dct92hh,1,t5_3hlgr
10550301,0,t1_dd3wlv2,Im glad to hear its not just me having issues. Perhaps it was silly of me but I assumed that the network would be halfdecent in the most densely populated neighbourhoods around Vancouver. I live in the heart of Kits and spend most of my time around Yaletown  Gastown  Chinatown. I get spotty or no connection in all of these areas. That seems absolutely ridiculous.Any idea if it will start to improve with the recent purchase by Shaw? ,freedommobile,dd3ztxm,3,t5_3hlgr
10577758,0,t3_5oxdfg,Somehow I managed to get way over over because of the switch from  to that basically blew me out of the water for this months data cap.and my current speed is indeed .

11619596,0,t3_65qehd,I got the same reply from their facebook page. They said it will be there to purchase on the st. They told me the same thing in store. On a random note I had a missed called from Freedom mobile on Thursday. Im not currently a customer with them and they didnt leave a voicemail so I have no idea what the call was about.,freedommobile,dgd3bmq,2,t5_3hlgr

11745652,0,t1_dgrdtff,If you have  months left on your tab that means you still have warranty so why not warranty it while you still can? The X Play has Corning Gorilla Glass  so that glitch should never have occurred.Unfortunately just SnapDragon  alone isnt enough it needs to be paired to at least Qualcomms  X LTE modem or newer to have Band  LTE and soon Band  compliance.XiaoMi just announced their MI with the SnapDragon  but it lacks all usefulness because they are not utilizing the integrated X to its full potential making it mostly an Eurasian device. It may occur in the OnePlus Five as well again to keep the price point low.,freedommobile,dgredx4,2,t5_3hlgr
