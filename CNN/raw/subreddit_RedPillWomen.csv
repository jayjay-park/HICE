55428,0,t3_1uqceq,I commented on a facebook photo the other day that was posted over a breakup. She said something like I shouldnt have to change for you. You should love me for who I am. Plus some other stuff about fat being attractive.This girl was at least  which is ginormous for a  foot tall girl. I asked her Why should he change what he thinks about you if you shouldnt change how you treat yourself? Whats more important a healthy relationship or pizza? Love and happiness arent free. It takes work. I dont prance around expecting people to love me for who I am. I work for it. I hit the gym every day run a strict diet and now read books on masculinity. Because I work for it I will get what I want.She promptly unfriended me and I found out her boytoy already found someone new. Some are stuck on this idea that people never change or never should change but some of us know we have to and we do. I just dont understand how a lifetime of failure for some doesnt mean anything.I used to always have issues with oneitis and depression. It ruined all the relationships I really wanted to continue but Id be quite the loser to subscribe to the idea that someone should love me for who I am.,RedPillWomen,cekqnrf,4,t5_2xing

83254,0,t3_1v0two,My take of the little sister zone is that I think its a real thing but I dont think its quite the same as the friendzone. I think the sisterzone starts with a man who is genuinely attracted to a woman but he has some sort of mental block on why he shouldnt be with that woman. This mental block usually is due to thinking the relationship would be inappropriate for some reason. If she is too young then society deems it inappropriate. If hes known her for a long time then he can feel that its inappropriate. If hes already in a relationship then it would be inappropriate to leave his current situation for her. The reason I say I think it starts with attraction is because the instinct that you are triggering when you are in the little sister zone is a very powerful protection instinct which is only typically triggered by people who he loves. His wife his daughter and his little sister. If hes putting you in the little sister zone he is explicitly saying to you I love you and want to protect you as much as these people. He is putting you in the same category of other people he loves in his head and then he uses that to justify protecting you. ,RedPillWomen,cenwnux,3,t5_2xing
88642,0,t3_1uzuih,Hey i think we might have the same IRL name.... Anyway I wanted to add that my husband has a very challenging career like yours is about to have usually with long hours. Weve lived in  different cities in  different countries so far! during our marriage.The thing is even though I do try to let him lead there are certain things I have to handle or they dont happen. Im the details person. He knows he can absolutely depend on me and this past month I moved our household from the middle east to Europe while he flew back to the US to deal with some things there what he had to do was even worse than what I was doing!.I dont think that letting him lead entails you being less competent or making him responsible for small details like the vet visits which would probably just stress him out.That being said my husband used to be extremely irresponsible financially. I finally my stepmother convinced me completely backed off and refused to do anything financial for almost a year. Our lights went out every month and we were at least one month behind on everything all the time. But he has taken the lead on our finances since then and has been very responsible with it. I assist with this now but I dont take it back over because I dont want to go back to where we were.If you want him to lead in an area let him make the decisions. My husband wants amp depends on my opinions  he believes we make better decisions when we argue it out  but I only argue the point when its really important to me. ,RedPillWomen,ceoirbk,2,t5_2xing

117030,0,t1_ceqysnk,I agree. I think this is part of the we have to understand that men and women are at a fundamental conflict of interests. No man of high value is going to give his commitment before getting sex. The only man who would do that is one who doesnt have options and if he doesnt have options he isnt going to be desirable to anyone. Which is why the best female game is to compromise and meet the male halfway. Have sex be pleasant show that you are different that you are feminine. Make him feel unique show him you arent a psycho or a gold digger. Then you play your hand say you like him and you arent interested in being just a fuckbuddy   if he feels the same you two should start a relationship. Women tend to defer leadership to the male which is all fine and dandy but you have to remember he isnt invested in leading you to commitment land. You have to prompt that and do it at the right time. This strategy will catch the high quality guy almost every time. Why? Because  of the other girls massively screw it up. They have no game they typically act like they are cool with NSA then get massively clingy after  weeks. Or they disqualify themselves by demanding to be courted dinner dates gifts etc. By simply having your life together being feminine being sexual you stand out already  meaning if you have a solid gameplan for obtaining commitment and transitioning to a relationship you are almost guaranteed success. This is the benefit of modern society. As feminism and social media basically turn most otherwise attractive women into low value women... you basically get the job by having your shit together being feminine and asserting yourself when it comes to commitment when it is the optimal time. ,RedPillWomen,cerraav,2,t5_2xing

158721,0,t3_1vwl0x,I can definitely see that her partner count is wild and totally a red flag for an LTR. The difficult part about this is that he does actually like the woman hes with and feels conflicted because of the fact that although shes a wonderful person she had a crazy ride during college.If shes honestly reformed from the slut lifestyle great for her! If she hasnt which is always a tossup that leans towards the hasnt then hes in for a rough time. I think the best advice to be given would be to say he should honestly do what makes him happiest not what makes the woman hes with happiest. If hes too uncomfortable with it hes free to leave her.I really wish more women understood that partner count is important. Although there are some men who honestly dont care the majority do. A lot of women from the current generation are really screwing themselves over no pun intended without realizing what theyre doing wrong and some men  commonly the betas just dont have the balls to say Hey you rode the cock carousel a few too many times.And so the cycle continues.,RedPillWomen,cewievd,10,t5_2xing

Another idea if you simply must get a ring is to go for a ring that uses a stone other than a diamond. Diamonds are ridiculously over priced even though theres a huge supply of them because of the demand due to engagement rings. Get something with a sapphire instead and youll save a ton of money and youll have ring with a sapphire in it which is way cooler and unique than the diamond ring that everyone else is wearing. ,RedPillWomen,cez4m46,7,t5_2xing

309379,0,t1_cf962af,There are several things wrong with your statements.First your usage of alpha and beta. In TRP discussions those terms are used to indicate things that are attractive to the other gender. Alpha attributes being ones that are attractive to the other gender like physical appearance and etc. Beta ones would be abrasive personality and etc. Alpha and beta are described this way to head off the many No True Scotsman attacks like yours as well as other types shaming attempts. Additionally would your own profuse attempts to prove your own female alpha status sound like that very thing you are castigating the writer for. Your wolf pack style of alpha and beta fits more into a social dominance type analogy and dominance in women is NOT an attractive trait to alpha men. It is not necessarily a negative trait but it does not inspire attraction in men on its own merit. I can link you to multiple in depth discussions on these statements if you would like more information. Secondly you must not have read much from this author or RPWs sidebar or frequent sticky posts. No RPW is or condones being a doormat for men. Their man should earn their respect and that is why he is her captain and she is her first mate. Lastly your tone and writing style as stated by others is quite condescending and detracts from any points you are trying to make. Did you perhaps take a minute to think that the author is peaking to his intended audience which is mainly RP men and that PC language is not used at all. Locker room style talk by men is frequently offensive to women and thus the sidebar post about TRP being too raw for TRPW. Additionally the author is not defending or justifying his position he is trying to inform his intended audience of proper actions and rational. That is why he goes in depth and spells out the thinking behind everything. ,RedPillWomen,cfcu2j6,1,t5_2xing

I think neutral under the weather language is best for this.Appearance  Im a shower girl but on the first and last day of Lady Week ill have a bath or an extra long shower and pamper session making sure I look and smell as good as I can. Being discreet  I used to get annoyed with my mum when I lived at home that she would leave sanitary products clean ones btw out and around the bathroom. I keep mine in a little make up pouch next to other make up bags by the toilet during the week that I need them to hand and then they go back away in the cupboard. Even discreetly packaged sanitary products are obvious as to what they are. My BF doesnt need to be reminded of whats going on with my toilet trips everytime he goes for a wee.Health Problems I have endometriosis which means I have some health issue surrounding my Lady Week my BF is very caring and compassionate and will always drive me to the hospital and wait for me incase im upset or feel unwell never let me get myself there and back. However what I discuss with the doctor the ins and outs of my faulty uterus dont need to be discussed in the car on the way home in any depth a ladylike air of mystery needs to be maintained when it involves my sexual organs and my sexual partner.This is just me I dont know where I sit on the spectrum when it comes to Lady Week etiquette Im interested to know though.,RedPillWomen,cg1md82,4,t5_2xing

680931,1,t3_21yj24,From the lurking around TRP Ive done theres a couple reasons.The biggest alpha fucks beta bucks. A woman gets knocked up by an alpha when shes young and then goes looking for a beta provider when it doesnt work out with her alpha. This pisses men off because they are relegated to being a walking checkbook.Second the single moms children always come first. This is obviously how it should be but who WANTS to come second in a new relationship? You can also use this to understand why single moms are encouraged to date single dads they can relate to each other better than a single parent and childless person.Lastly from my observation guys in general have an aversion to raising another mans child even in nonAFBB situations. Maybe she is single because she is a widow but why be with her  a child when he could probably find a similar lady that doesnt already have one?,RedPillWomen,cgho7uf,1,t5_2xing
692812,0,t1_cgj0l4g,TRP guy here  TRP guys tend to oversimplify lessons in order to instruct other guys.  The underlying message we are trying to send is that a relationship should fulfill a guys sexual NEEDS.  If a guys needs arent getting met then no other factors matter because the relationship isnt sustainable.  Unfortunately a lot of guys have a problem voicing their needs and following through when their needs arent being met.  Therefore TRP spends a lot of time focusing on this point.  Unfortunately the message gets boiled down too much andor distorted andor taken out of context.  Really we love women.. or we wouldnt even be here.  We want them in our life.  Some of us just need to learn how to interact with them better because society does a piss poor job of teaching us this stuff when we are growing upLastly there will always be guys who find TRP and go through a bitter phase where their unrealistic expectations get shredded and they are angry at the world.  They will say some pretty nasty things but its just a phase.  Just my  cents.  ,RedPillWomen,cgj0wgg,3,t5_2xing
715091,0,t3_22cmqt,My guy is very aggressive sexually but he taught me a couple things that I never hear in a discussion like this his initiating doesnt mean I cant initiate and wild sex will earn you initiation points for a long time.    So my bf is very much a sex is what we do at night kind of guy and its really good so even if Im tired or stressed I think of it as an investment in future fun. although when Im stressed I always feel dumb because he unstresses me and I know that so why do I not just jump him when Im stressed? Ugh.    But he made it clear that my heading into the bedroom at night pulling my clothes off is not enough. Its like eating versus treats I guess? Nightly sex is kind of just the eating part if I initiate during the day or he does thats the real treat sex. So even if I know hes going to initiate at night if I pull him into the bedroom in the afternoon it really keeps him hungry and I can see it in his face.    The other thing is that if you do something sexually impressive  oral in a place away from home or saying the crazy stuff guys find hot and working so you mean it or whatever real fantasy sex  hell remember that and feel proud to have me and even brag but in a good way.    Im sure if I did it every time the expectation would rise beyond my reach but giving him one really unexpected sexual experience a week has really kept him all over me and makes him much more affectionate and private with me than he was before I started thinking of it this way.    So even if he initiates I still go for more. Even if he has to work or something and says no he does it with a kind of smile that tells me he feels lucky to have me.    With some guys I dont think you can initiate too much. You just have to throw in something special on a regular but not too regular basis.,RedPillWomen,cglk5di,4,t5_2xing

728947,0,t3_22i7qf,I was pretty sure my husband was who I would spend my life with on our first date. Not even in a romantic way at the time. It was just very obvious from the get go that we are very compatible in personality and life goals. We didnt hold anything back. We talked about our views on marriage kids religion all the stuff you arent supposed to talk about on a first date. I was  sure within the first few dates. I would be lying if I said I didnt freak out a little bit after we got married though. The few weeks on either side of our wedding was the darkest time in out relationship. I have never felt more distant from my husband than I did around our wedding and even on our wedding day. If I could offer any bit of advice it would be to make time for your relationship through the planning stages and stresses that may arise. If I could go back in time I would do everything differently.Luckily we found TRP shortly after marriage a and it completely saved our relationship. Youre already here so youre already on a better foot. Thinking of finding the one is a dangerous way of looking at it though. You find someone with whom you are compatible but whats important is that you both make it work. Enter prepared that things will not always go smoothly and be aware of the tendency toward hypergamy. Knowledge is power. Knowing and being prepared for your own shortcomings as a partner will help tremendously. He may not be the one as there isnt one single person for everyone but he is the one you chose to spend your life with. ,RedPillWomen,cgn4v5v,7,t5_2xing

It didnt say crazy sex it clearly states that if youve had a lesbian experience or have had a MFF thressome then your SO will expect a threesome and will feel like hes missing out because you have had sex with another girl.  Since even just having a lesbian experience will make a man think this I cant help but think that I would have to hide my bisexuality to him to avoid that type of mess.

In any case he might not be able to say why because it sounds like its just a bunch of things that have built up. On the bright side you do seem to be aware of your faults. Try committing to a real self improvement plan. Keep your place clean work on being absentminded maybe write yourself notes? and cut down on the amount you go out. At least be aware of how your actions affect your bf and appear to outsiders. If you want to dance go dance with your bf or maybe a girl friend. Or even better take up a hobby or class and find something better to do than wrecking yourself all night at a club. Late nights and hangovers dont make pretty models...

1187414,0,t1_ci31tpd,gt I also agree that the hierarchy of protection naturally flows downwards. Men at the top then women then children and the elderly. I think its more complex than that especially when you mention the elderly.  Young people are expected to look out for old people but only in instances where their youth can actually neutralize or greatly reduce a potential problem.  Examples    Holding a heavy door open problem  closed door sacrifice of young person is trivial  Picking up a dropped object problem  object on ground sacrifice of young person is trivial    Fending off a robber problem  mugger sacrifice of young person is substantialThe thing is there are other problem scenarios where the opposite is true.  When you have a problem that can only be neutralized by sacrificing lives and the agevirility of the person is not a factor the old people might be expected and may often volunteer to die first since theyve actualized the most of their potential life value.  Examples    Stuck on a deserted island someone has to be a guinea pig to make sure the gathered food isnt poisonous  Tsunami hits a nuclear power plant and cleaning up would mean incurring a significant dose of radiation for those involvedThe second principle applies to men and women as well.  Women are inherently more valuable than men just as the young are inherently more valuable than the old.  However the young are expected to help the old because they are more physically able.  Women are not more physically able than men so theres very little expectation for women from society.  ,RedPillWomen,ci37b9a,1,t5_2xing

1236192,0,t1_ci8h63f,T a little plus Im nervous that I myself am not being rpw enough and might be self sabotaging a bit. We had a conversation about gender roles where he confessed that while he felt capable taking charge he also felt uncomfortable doing it like it was arrogant. I told him I felt hed been very balanced thus far deciding things but checking that I was okay with it. Then I complained about an ex who was incapable of listening to my input and basically overrode anything I said. Looking back at that conversation I feel like it was a stupid thing to add not just because complaining about exes  ew even though Id meant it to be a reassurance that he wasnt like that I think retrospectively it came across as a warning which is counterproductive and means he might end up not wanting to go too far which is really not an issue here because well unlike the ex he doesnt have his head stuck up his. I think a smarter response would simply have been to say with confidence well I dont think youre arrogant at all and I find it attractive. But Im going through a transitiondenial period of fighting this a bit I know this is the most idiotic thing but I really do have to fight off guilt at betraying the good feminist model. I never even consciously bought into that damn thing but I still feel guilty like if he felt guilty about being arrogant I feel guilty because. BETRAYING WIMMENZKIND by not being or even wanting to be a highpowered CEOlawyerdoctor with a triple phd . its just such a relief being first mate instead of Captain that I feel like a jerk making someone else be captain and I say that even as someone committed to being a hardworking selfimproving supportive first mate.And... And Im still working on being softer. Work in progress. My first instincts of behavior are not my friends yet.

He has a very busy and demanding job and even on busy days he makes time to see me or for us to spend time together. He is the one that said we are in a serious relationship. Hes physically affectionate but verbally... not so much. He is into the idea of affirming through actions and not through words the nonverbal deep communication through physical touch. I have never been with a man who was so patient with me and who desperately wanted me to have my first orgasm with a man. Im in my mid s and this is my second real relationship.

The smell is alright not bad not great. They also have a dry conditioner as well in this line which is nice as its made for the midstrand versus scalp. Its a nice conbo. The second is called Oh Be Hive! and its a matte dry shampoo. No color I personally think it smells good BUT it is a bit over powering at first. It also adds volume to your hair so I really love it a lot because it actually does work so well.As far as preserving hair during my shower I usually clip it uploose bun then will wear a headband not the tight smaller ones but one of the bigger types thats comfortable and wont make a crease and a shower cap that is big enough to securely cover my head. Maybe look into a fan that can suck the steam from the shower out of the bathroom?

1565028,0,t3_2c58fv,I agree with you these tshirt dresses are very unflattering!Id look into reading more about developing your personal style I can PM you some links if youd like so youre not as dependent on trends. For example this summer was mostly boxy crop tops gaucho pants and ugly childrens sandals which kind of limits buying optionsWhen you cement a style of your own you can try incorporating a trend if you like it and just have more fun with fashion.Good choices for you right now is to stick with classic pieces until you figure out your own style. Stuff like simple solid blouses plain pants and solid cardigans.During the summer I mostly wear sundresses and flats or wedge sandals. For midseasons Ill wear jeans with button up shirts and also flats. For winter dark pants thin formfitting sweaters heeled booties scaves and peatcoats.You can try taking a super casual outfit jeans and a solid tshirt and making it better with feminine addons that keep it casual like cute earrings shoes or belts with details like bows or flowers or whatever you think looks dainty and feminine. Casual wear in lace can also be good I personally cant bear the thought of wearing lace its an underwear fabric to me but I hear others say its a nice way of dressing up without dressing up,RedPillWomen,cjcg6ns,2,t5_2xing

He had no idea what she was talking about. Im not sure if he didnt remember because he no feelings for her or he just didnt remember.

There are a few factors at play He wakes up for work  hours later than me he goes to bed  hours later than me and most importantly I am a toss amp turner. I tend to hog covers and pillows but never remember it. He talks in his sleep and sometimes yells at the people in his dreams. All in all we tend to disturb each others sleep when we sleep together!That said sometimes he still will come to bed with me after Ive gone to sleep. He did this last night its a sweet gesture and something we both enjoy once or twice a week. We also watch a movie or show every night in my bed to cuddle amp have time close to one another.It definitely isnt for everyone though and shouldnt be something that you let impede on intimacy or closeness.,RedPillWomen,cjtpiyv,3,t5_2xing

You are in a highly volatile highly competitive industry  trying to rein that in when it comes to matters of the heart is going to be as much of a challenge as being an aggressive businesswoman.  Part of you is always going to see yourself as weak for that vulnerability.The only way to get out of this rut is to accept and acknowlege the fact that in order for you to get the happiness you deserve you need a strong man in your life.  NEED.  Not want.  Husbands arent handbags.  If you dont need a man more than likely you wont get one.  It doesnt make you weak your complementary nature is what makes you both stronger together than either one alone.For one thing quit leading with your resume.  Men arent turned on by your accomplishments they are turned on by a combination of your sexual power Alpha and your ability to bee a good wife Beta.Yep.  I said it.  Good Wife.What makes you a good wife for a man?  Not your job.  Not even your debtfree credit rating.  If you want a LTR then resign yourself to the fact you want to be a wife . . . and figure out how to do it well.  Men especially in our industry have endless variety of women to chose from for sex.  In order to be noteworthy you have to combine the strength you bring to your job with an authentic vulnerability.  You have to discover and face your vulnerabilities and then find a man who has the complement to your need.  Yes thats the key.  Condescend to need a man.

You need to be a strong woman..satireoffyea we have heard this all before. This area is sad for you. Ive lived it with a woman that is a red pill woman for  years. For my wife and I you are wrong. You are wrong in a way that you dont have any idea. I used to tell my wife Be more assertive What do you want to do? I Dont care why dont you pick She actually meant this. Why dont you dress a little sluttier? Why dont you want to go out with your friends all the time instead of being here with me? Go!.. No  I tried to turn her into the people you describe for  years. I dont want to make the calls she said.. you do it. So yea this area is a sad place for you but it has been my life for the past  years and I never realized it. I started reading this material and was surprised. My wife Is a housewife. My kids ARE well behaved. My house is spotless. My wife is a sexual dynamo that is constantly pleasing me. What about you? I say to her I dont care about that What else do I havea  year marriage  kids that arent in daycare that are ALWAYS the good ones everywhere we go Great finances A wife who is super happy now and has been for years But I NEVER believed she could be happy because of people LIKE YOU I thought there was something wrong with her because of people like YOU. Women like YOU that says the things YOU do. I tried to change her into the vision of what you and those poisonous feminsts want. i told her about  weeks ago when I read the red pill and then came over here. I told herI am done trying to change you. I am sorry I now know exactly who you are and I am going to stop She came over and hugged me and criedIve been telling you that for  years. I am so happy you said that. This is who I am and who i have always been so you are wrong and wrong in a way that is damaging to people like me and my wife. Im glad I found this place. It is funny I would never work as a waiter or a maid or an assistant. I want to be the guy in charge and I AM in my job. That is the life I lead and I cant understand someone wanting to live to make someone happy but that is who I married and there isnt a DAMN thing wrong with her. Too bad you arent reading the material around here because you are probably going to enter into a beta relationship with one of these feminsts that have been forced into a role they dont want and they will secretly despise you for it.  You might have a life of divorce. abuse mental and maybe physical from the woman being ignored begging for sex and it being used as a reward catering to the whims of someone that doesnt want to be who you think you are. Good luck.. because guys like you have it a LOT rougher than I and my wife  do. ,RedPillWomen,ck2p69o,4,t5_2xing

Edit Im not upsetranting at you personally  this is just something that genuinely befuddles me. If this is a trend it may be happening because dating culture is far more nebulous today casual hookups open relationships FWB etc and theres no overarching structure community or family for example exerting a certain amount of order protocol and decorum. Courting and traditional dating ideals have been on the decline for years although there are exceptions. I think technology and availability has also undermined things to a certain extent although technology can also be a huge dating asset if used properly.  Its interesting to me that men and women tend to be more sexually experienced today but at the same time extremely naiveuninformed when it comes to A identifying a good potential match B knowing how to honestlyproductively communicate not just complaining or blaming and C understanding that relationships require continual workmaintenance in order to keep things running smoothly.,RedPillWomen,cmdv8i8,3,t5_2xing

2567771,0,t3_2p68hb, A lady doesnt air her grievances in public to anyone who will listen. She deals with it appropriately in the right space. If shes having issues with her friends or family she speaks with them privately and deals with it maturely. Same goes for her captain no man bashing with her girlfriends. You look trashy and immature bitching out in a bar or restaurant. These people are your family and loved ones and deserve respect.  A lady always dresses for the occasion. She takes pride in her appearance and reputation as she knows you can only make one first impression. Theres a time and a place for sexy but grandpas funeral isnt one.  Act and dress in a way that your man and family are proud to call you theirs. ,RedPillWomen,cmtqv0c,6,t5_2xing

2692932,0,t1_cna2ojv,dude Im a guy. I am an invader as well. I was saying I have known slutty ass girls with rough reputations that ended up marrying and having nice little kids and a great little family with dudes that seem pretty cool. Good looking jobs I dunno about their relationships really because I have hooked up with several of these girls and never met their husbands. I knew a girl known as titty slut who was well known as a drunken slut now married to a good looking guy who takes care of her and her kid. When youre like  guys see an attractive woman who doesnt seem slutty NOW and they dont demand to know about her past. I honestly dont want to know I can tell when girls have high sex drives and Im cool with that. Ive had much better relationships with girls Ive had sex with quickly and often than with girls who Id date who were bomb ass babes that had very very few partners and who made me wait and wait for sex as part of a longterm relationship judgment fest...

2705132,0,t1_cnbid9d,In all honesty I dont think it would bother me at any age. For example Id place a year old virgin who only recently gained confidence with women over a year old reformed player with a large number of women under his belt. Also I feel like most older virgin guys are virgins for a reason aside from lack of success with women for example religious reasons or other conscious choices to remain celibate and I applaud their selfcontrol.Now I might think its strange upon first hearing it because its so uncommon in todays world but ultimately I dont think it would impact their value in my eyes. I realize this is probably an uncommon view.,RedPillWomen,cnbkab1,6,t5_2xing
2709712,0,t1_cnauoni,My speculation is that men in college have zero ability to provide so they dont. Furthermore college is a fake temporary environment. Everybody knows that their lives will be reset at the end of this period. So the dating is not serious because everything including personal relationships will be upended soon. Women in college behave the same with guys which is often a topic on TRP.Single serving college friends single serving dates. They will be gone soon so why invest emotionally in them? . That one case where the guy had a high school girlfriend and they went to different colleges. She separated from him with the her expectation that they will date other people in college but they are reserving each other to marry after the college. Predictably they guy found himself a new fiancee for whom he was providing and they were even buying a house he either worked through college or didnt go to college. His ex was outraged that he did not keep the end of the bargain she did not leave him a choice. One thing that is certain is that men HATE to be the financial backup guy when the woman goes off to fuck other multiple men. This does more that negate emotional investment. It creates antiinvestment pure hate. What I am trying to say is that college being a temporary place suspends commitment on both sides. ,RedPillWomen,cnc307p,2,t5_2xing

Technology today has made it easier than ever to at least come off as a .In terms of men you can now be realistic. Nonhigh i.e.  SMV men have a crappier time of it than youd think due to the Pareto distribution of female interest so pull an Odysseus and shoot for an acceptablelevel SMV man who will appreciate your company and enjoy him. Not everyone can handle an alpha and thats totally fine.In terms of relationships you give what you get. Now you know what makes an average man happy and honestly its fairly simple. Food sex interesting and pleasant conversations perhaps... its certainly not rocket science!In short instead of dwelling on the high SMV you could have beenonce weremissed out on etc and the high SMV man youll never get use the information you now have to better your own life.

2843622,0,t3_2rtcmm,Im going to offer a counteropinion even though I agree with  of what hes saying  the stuff he brings up like Dont ever shittest dont ever challenge him dont try to dominate the interaction at all dont be bitchy etc. High value girls have two reasons they engage in these types of behaviors. First its the only real way to filter out the actual high value guys. Everyone can buy a car a suit groom themselves and learn to speak with a little confidence you will need to shittest a little to differentiate between the levels of guys. This is why girls shittest and try to lead or have a bitchshield by erecting those defenses they create an opportunity for a confident HV male to break through those barriers. Its the flirting dance  the woman puts up resistance and barriers and the men who get it they effortlessly and irreverently just move through the barriers. Thats how attraction gets created and if you never put up any of these resistances in the form of shit tests he doesnt get the chances to smash through the shit test. For example lets take the do you take a lot of girls here? shit test that he says not to do. If you ask that in a fun way and look him in the eyes you will instantly see where he falls on the alpha gt beta spectrum. If his pupils dont react and he calmly rattles off something unapologetic you will probably laugh and you guys will have a nice flirty rapport going. Being submissive is meaningful when a man earns it. Submitting to any man is a waste of your time if you want to KEEP high value males you have to present him with a fun exciting challenge. A resistance that arouses both of you as he breaks through.Of course the nagging aspect of shittesting is bad but women are designed to keep testing. When you test your man and he responds by either dismissing the test remaining completely rooted in who he is and so on you get to feel holy shit I cannot move this guy he cannot be deterred from being who is he is by anything I can do. That generates arousal and in every couple that has that honeymoon phase vibe going on  years in a LTR they tend to have that dynamic. Instead of having a no shit tests always be submissive never tease him policy I would say that these are real female behaviors that must be expressed. You just have to work on expressing them in a way that isnt a PITA  if hes truly HV  alpha  whatever word you want to use he will enjoy these opportunities to dominate lead and create arousal while engaging in a charged conversation. ,RedPillWomen,cnrbgox,2,t5_2xing

Other times hell try to get me hot and bothered only to quit and just smile cutely at me like hes done nothing. He toys with me and its fun even though at first I would just get frustrated with the fact I was reacting in a very typical way. Keeps our relationship interesting and thats just how his personality is now although Im sure it took him time to develop it.I think its all in how you view the mind games and the intent. For me it makes my so seem fun and playful. Its his way of being affectionate now. For others it may seem childish or even mean. Its very dependent on the situation and people involved.Also I want to note that keeping interest requires effort.

Theres nothing that you can do to help her other than to tell her to talk to her SO. Yeah she is overreacting because not answering texts is not a big deal but that doesnt make her feelings any less real.

I was once some guys plate in college when I was too dumb to know what was what and he gave my phone number to some guy I didnt even know! Then there was another guy who I had a sexually casual relationship with and then his friends started to hit on me too. So the best advice I can give you is to stay away from that guy and his friends. The guy thinks of you as a booty call so his friends probably do too. Try to find people outside of that circle you can hang out with and build a different kind of persona.People give you respect when you enforce boundaries.

3548231,0,t3_30xkrs,Hi there. Been married almost twenty years this May. My husband and I met while he was active duty. Hes retired now and travels a lot for work is gone for  mo at a time.First off these are my experiences. So mileage may vary for you.Daily contact is a no. I realize that this seem counterintuitive especially when you are missing someone but it actually makes things worse. Daily contact doesnt give either of you a chance to settle in and get into a routine. My husband needs his head in the game when gone so our communication rules are this I email as needed and at least one big state of the house email weekly detailing bills family and whats been going on. Secondly we video once a week usually Sunday nights. If he cant make it we then simply wait til next Sunday we dont juggle the week to talk again unless it is important. Give each other a bit of space to adjust to being apart.When my husband is bummed I do get a bit racy and send him panty of the week pictures or I forward a link to a video that includes acts I will enjoy fulfilling when he is home.Be aware that often times after a long absence there are unrealistic expectations about being home again.

Its definitely helped me figure out why Im attracted to certain people learn how to single out quality guys and finetune my priorities.However I would say that in practice its not as black and white as reddit makes it seem.  Most people out in the world are completely oblivious to the sidebar literature and discussions that take place in our little corner of the internet.  That all said Ive found that at my age  there are plenty of quality men usually older than me who want sex AND commitment.  Yes they are fewer than guys who just want sex or dont know what the hell they want but theyre around.  Much to my delight my SO was actually the one to tell me that he wants us to be exclusive.  gt If you were not able to perform sexual acts on a guy how would you get him to commit?At that point all Id done is have good girl game show some domestic skills and made out til we were dizzy.  It probably helped that our physical chemistry is freakishly strong and he well both of us wanted more.My SOs culture makes having a family a huge priority in his life.  Not all men are so clear in what they want. In my opinion a good approach is to seek out a mate who is at a place in his life where HE wants a singular quality woman.  Maybe hes tired of spinning plates maybe casual dating never interested him in the first place.  Reasons are reasons as long as the result is he wants a committed relationship.  Aint no way to trick an alpha in to exclusivity he needs to decide he wants it himself.Men are the gatekeepers of commitment women are the gatekeepers of sex... Someones gotta open the gate at some point.  Being more patient and cautious of opening our gate works better for us in the long run.,RedPillWomen,cqi15gi,4,t5_2xing

As a tutor I usually get up am sometimes  for early bird lessons but its hardly the norm and go to bed around pm. Neither of us can exactly adapt our work lives to suit when the other is home working or asleep.Ways of softening the issue. When you go to bed if he can ask him to spend some time cuddled up with you in bed as you drift off. That pillowtalk and closeness can help you both. I like it when Jons break and my bedtime align so he can give me a quick goodnight call. Makes all the difference some nights.. Viceversa when hes off to bed try and stay until he drifts off. Or at least call to say goodnight. Hell appreciate it. Both of these wont be possible but one of them normally will be.. If youre already awake when hes going to get up go and grab him a tea or coffee his favourite morning snack and start up his computer or the tv so you can just lie in bed as he gets charged for the daynight..

Which woman of earth wants to date an average  year old boy?  year old women arent legal and many  year old men wouldnt want to date them anyway. Other  year old women are either looking at older or more attractive men. Women older than  certainly arent looking at an average younger man. So whos left?Im not blaming  year old women for often dating older men. After all men are also happy to date younger women. On TRP a lot of of men are advising to only LTR women under say  even if youre over  yourself. However one way or the other an average man gets romantically neglected between  and maybe between . Even getting casual sex with unattractive partners which is really easy to get for women isnt that easy to come by.Now fastforward. The beta is  and has had very little dating success. However he is now financially successful and some postwall women are starting to realize that there are not enough  men to go around. So she settles for the beta bux. Now  year old women are typically very demanding sometimes delusionally so. After all theyve had incredible amounts of attention in their s when their SMV was a lot higher and theyre naturally hypergamous. However  year old men have had very little amounts of attention in their s when their SMV was a lot lower and are naturally hypogamous and selfsacrificing.

What would be ideal for us is me moving out with him as he has his own apartment and in  years will start building his own house but as you say taking the plunge without any kind of safety net revs up the anxiety and holds you back. All you can think about is what will go wrong what happens if the relationship fails what happens if I cant build a new social circle what happens if I loose my SO.What I will tell you is this it is a leap of faith you are already seriously considering this lifealtering move so jump and see where the current takes you. Would you rather be anxietyridden and away from your man or blissfully happy and building your new life with him? Yes terrible things can happen but if you lived your life in a constant state of What if? you would never get anything done or go anywhere.Ill add that Im speaking from a point of view with a few more luxuries than yourself SO can support both of us my job is needed everywhere hairdressernails and Id have family to go back to if something happened but I still get the same anxiety you do because it is such a huge decision to make to uproot your life and settle down so far away.,RedPillWomen,crezph9,2,t5_2xing

Ive been wondering for a while does RPW flat out define these differently? gtPure alpha is exciting has great drive and likelihood to be head of a company or otherwise distinguished is popular with women great genes but a greater likelihood of bailing on a relationship.Exciting popular with women and likely to bail on a relationship are all there but in actuality alphas are more likely to end up in prison than be a CEO.gtPure beta will have great nurturing skills be emotionally supportive great with kids but not have the drive and singleminded commitment to do well in society and bring in a lot of resources also boring after a while.I dont think a betas nurturing skills will be all that good but they will attempt to be emotionally supportive. Also likely great with kids and are heavily invested in them. Last part about resources is flat out wrong beta male work ethic and dedication are the backbone of every civilization in human history. There is a reason they are called beta bucks because their boring you are also correct here tendencies are what make them stable working providers. They arent likely to be CEOs but arent likely to be deadbeats or in prison either. They are most likely going to be in decently well paying but not rich middle management positions in companies or government bureaucracies or in trades.

After all I have been reliably informed that I am a misogynist If you browse the TRP sub you have to keep in mind the difference in demographics. Those are guys that are reacting to the changes wrought by feminism and have pretty much given up on the idea of getting married. Actually several of the ECs are married as is Ian Ironwood and Rollo eg but generally they got married before taking the pill.So on the whole those are not the droids you are looking for. There are still many men the majority who are still looking to get married. But the bit about looking outside the West for women that is not from an RP sub that discussion happened not long ago in the comments section of a national newspaper. A lot of men are really pissed off with feminists and entitled princesses. But this is good for you it makes it easier to stand out.

I have dropped all male orbiters but I constantly have to assure him that Im not talking to any guys. Ive had my own jealousy issues as well and he stopped talking to other girlsHow accurate is this description?

On one hand the two of you have been dating exclusively for just a couple of months it makes sense that he would want to make sure you are right for him before labeling it. You could be overreacting.

4942615,0,t3_3iloho,I think if you keep improving your SMV then most marriageoriented guys would kill to wait for a virgin and wouldnt screw up a good thing by cheating on her.That said I think you should be prepared for a high value man to seek out sex from other womenplates while hes in the waitingdating stage early on with you.  I know it sucks but just take it slow.  If hes getting his sexual needs met elsewhere that doesnt necessarily mean he needs to stop talking to youtaking you out.  Once he realizes youre worth being exclusive with and once he has verbally confirmed that you two are exclusive you should do what feels right in terms of sex.  Hopefully by then you will know him well enough to determine if having sex with him is worth the risk.  If anything feels off be honest and open about your fears by saying something like I really like you and believe I can trust you but I am hesitant because Im not used to this and if hes a good man he will reassure you and help you get there.If you got past freshman year of college without losing your virginity I think most guys you would be dealing with are mature enough to realize that losing your virginity at this point would be a big deal and wouldnt be so mean as to steal it from you and then drop you.  I think the thing you most need to worry about is getting into a placeholder relationship where the man will date you for a long time even years but will never propose.I will say some red flags Obviously pressing too hard for sex when youre not ready Not taking you out on actual on dates that are planned at least a couple days in advance and involve meeting up before PM really guys should not be asking you to meet up at a bar with their friends a guy who is truly interested will want to go together with you some times Overly romanticsweet talkey very early after meeting you he is probably either desperate or sweet talking youtrying to bribe you Flirts withleads many other girls on but then tells you they dont mean anything or worse that they are just friends Weird about labels,RedPillWomen,cuhk0yf,11,t5_2xing

5085342,0,t3_3kmrb8, as everyone has said DONT force a lifestyle change on your husband. Your marriage is more important than getting one person to eat vegan. Also you seem to be valuing the opinions of your new vegan community more than those of your husband which is a much deeper problem of priorities you need to consider.More specifically I also became vegan after watching Cowspiracy and also have a man who still loves meat. I assume because you cite Cowspiracy as your reason for change youre focusing on the environmental impact of eating meat. Here are some ways you can consume meat responsibly thus satisfying your ethics and his hunger purchase beef dairy and other animal products from farms that have sustainable practices so that youre voting with your money which is what makes the difference anyway talk to your husband about moving more towards chicken and fish instead of lamb and beef as these have a much lower ecological footprint and of course look carefully at those sources too remember that even buying half of the animal products you used to has a relatively large impact so if he keeps his diet the same and you go vegan you still ARE making the difference that you want to focus on sharing this with other people in your life who may be interested to change rather than forcing your husband into making the change with you  you could have a much more exponential impact this way control your anxietyanger towards food with meat through meditation techniques maybe internally thanking the animal for providing the food so that you are approaching it with more consciousness,RedPillWomen,cuyz67h,12,t5_2xing

People tend to think in totally politicized terms these days. That means everyone assumes men and women have roughly the same needs and ways of thinking about things and the womans perspective is more likely to be regarded as the standard. This intensifies our difficulties. Most men find the need to engage in constant light and cheery communication incredibly tiresome most of the time while women seem to thrive on it.AndgtIt has created an unrealistic expectation that the immediate drop everything and respond to the text reaction is the expected norm.

I still struggle with noticing the cleaning up cues since I am often involved in the conversations being held at the table.Only like three or four women are the kitchen group and the host usually refuses any help quite fervently but if you keep the initiative its just a matter of patience. Last year I told her it was one of my new year goals to be better at cooking and this year I am going to help her cook Christmas dinner. I remember youre Guatemalan so I dont know if the hosting customs are similar Mexican we fight the hostess here to help her clean up all while she keeps refusing lol.

Itd be considered a stigma and a sign that the man is likely to leave.Im also surprised at the idea that women have more sexual power than men. Id say about half my friends are single.

They are not necessarily soft and feminine and maybe thats why theyre single...but doesnt that just prove that MEN have the power to pick and choose which women they want?Anyway.

6243925,0,t1_cyzb0va,gt I want to believe in relationships where theres balance. With all the good traits This is absolutely possible.  The problem arises when women try to define what is abusive and what is sensitive and then men taking those definitions at face value.  Yes a man can be sensitive but when he lets a woman define it for him where attraction is simply assumed you end up with an overly sensitive wimp who cant see that he needs to decide for himself what this means womens definitions be damned.  Same with abusive.  Women today will call simply disagreeing with her abusive and a man will take this as truth.  Then she is disgusted by him.  So at the end of the day it is up to you to decide how to care for a womans heart and what you think is right and to never let women define that for you.  If you can do this you will find that balance a lot faster because you will weed out the women who cannot handle this.  Most of the women you will find that are able to handle this are going to be higher on the dominance threshold level. ,RedPillWomen,cyzd77p,3,t5_2xing

6311289,0,t1_cz6ysc1,gt I am just not sure that she is completely at fault here for being objectively offensive as much as taking offense can be objective.Being objectively offensive seems indeed like a strange concept to me considering that what offends someone is usually based on their values and upbringing which are definitely not universal. Being offensive would therefore be a subjective concept. I personally dont think OP was offensive at all.gt See I can understand him not liking her indirectness and thinking it was a poor way to approach the situation. But the word offensive here just doesnt fit.I entirely agree with you on that point hence why I used annoying rather than offensive in another comment I wrote to answer OP.gt If his goal is to try to get her to communicate like that he is going to have a hard time. That simply isnt her personality. In womanspeak this type of language is offensive while in manspeak it is how you address your friends. You would literally have to teach her to live in opposite land.Did OPs boyfriend mention that he wanted her to speak like that ? Or did he say something like this is what should be said ? If its the latter then as you said the problem is solved by OP STFUing and letting her boyfriend tell their friend about the smell but if its the former then yes he will indeed have a hard time.

6416482,0,t3_43kyw4,Just a warning   year old me was also using the pull out method rather than condoms and got pregnant and subsequently miscarried even though I was on the pill. You gotta at least use one method of contraception and even then its not  sound.Since then Ive had the injection and Im currently using the implant. I started having the injection because I was getting breakthrough bleeding on the pill and they were worried about it. It was alright I had to have it once every  months and I had the most sadistic nurse who I swear thoroughly enjoyed stabbing my bum as hard as she possibly could. I went for the implant because I only have to think about it once every three years. I dont have to worry about forgetting to take it cos its sat in my arm permanently  I did have to get local anaesthetic for it it bled a reasonable amount and I had the bruise for over a month afterwards so if youre squeamish I wouldnt advise it especially because what goes in must come out.... My little sister has been on the same pill progesterone vs estrogen that I was on for  years now with no problem. I think its just a case of discussing with your doctor and then trial and error to figure out whats best for you. But please please please please use at least something Im lucky in that I miscarried before I knew I was pregnant so I never had to make an abortion decision but  years later I still cry thinking about losing a baby.

6532355,0,t1_czu6ud3,gthmm i feel this thread is walking on eggshells a little since we dont want to sound entitledwhich is great of course. However we should be honest that there are some very important amp basic expectations which make up a good man. after all choosing a good man to begin with is the most important step in finding a life partner. RPW cant help you much if you keep going for the wrong fish.Yes.  Thank you so much for your detailed comment and its what I was looking for.  I also agree I feel some girls are a little scared to go into detail for fear of sounding entitled and I guess my point was that yes lets not deny that there are certain expecations we start to have as we adapt to a certain Captain and that if he were to all of sudden change his behavior it would concern us not because we feel entitled to how things were before but because it could be a sign of a deeper issue.And I definitely alluded to the most recent he doesnt commit post on another comment here I mean no you dont want to feel entitled to his time and you should be understanding if he bails but at the same time there is some expectation he is going to respect your time and so if he never follows through that may be an indicator that he doesnt expect your time so you might stretch that expectation to mostly follows through on plans unless he has a good reason.  But there is a fine line between that expectation and the idea that youre entitled to his time which I think might be deterring people from commenting here.,RedPillWomen,czuzx3s,2,t5_2xing

6592458,1,t3_45xyje,I understand your desire to reflect on the course your life has taken and make sense of everything but this guide is not RP and I hope people read it with a critical eye. You make it very clear that you do not have a full grasp of the theories and concepts that are the foundation of this subreddit and if you have specific questions about that I can respond with greater detail but I will choose to focus on just a few errors in this initial comment. First please read up on what we have to say about equality in relationships equality between the sexes team efforts and more. Your explanation is nonsense and does not represent RPW.Your list of things that RPW must do be nice sexually available etc and parenthetical remarks reflect some very real character flaws on your part and your portrayal of these thoughts as the universal struggle of all women new to RPW illustrates the extent of your solipsism. As an example your annoyance that you have to have sex with your SO and your preference for something battery powered. You stated in the first part that he had too high of a drive but clearly if you wanted pleasure from a different source the frequency is not an issue. Its a lack of attraction and a lack of respect for your man. It honestly may have felt like you were shouldering a burden to have sex with your man but that has nothing to do with accepting a new perspective on your relationship. Many women come to RPW because their men are naturally masculine and they need help learning how to get out of the way and let him be himself. They are not resentful or dismissive of their mans sexuality and in fact embrace opportunities for intimacy. Do you see how you took something that was unique to you and acted like all other women experienced or are experiencing the same thing? Instead of taking the time to reflect on your flaws before RPW and detail what you did to change you wrote a short list with a subext of am i right ladies? There wasnt even an attempt to go back and explain why those initial complaints were wrong. You shared that you were not a fan of having to clean and cook and felt that he did nothing but never clarify how you feel now about his contributions to the relationship. Now lets take a look at all of the benefits you outlined to being an RPWgtYou wash the dishes and he says baby let me get that and allows you to put your feet up. He tells you jokes and you laugh while appreciating the lines by his eyes when he smiles.So your reward for cleaning is not having to clean? Its him volunteering to do the task that he previously was forced to do while you sit with your feet up?gtHis work gets hard and now youre not just listening to him vent you realize youre his most trusted confidante and advisor and it would be a privilege to listen to him talk for the rest of your life.He comes to you with problems and the benefit you focus on is how elevated your role is in his life and how his actions benefit you. You dont think about the positive traits that he exhibits or talk about your compassion for his struggles or a deeper bond due to his trust in you. gtHes trying to load the car up and you see the tiniest amount of strain on his part and you dont even think about jumping to your feet and running to help him before he does more than he has toI fully admit that this comment is going to be a nit pick but either help from the start or ask if he needs help and if he says no let him do it. I also dont think this is a scenario unique to RPW and if this is a groundbreaking change for you then I am glad you are making changes because I cannot imagine what your relationship used to look like.gtHe feels unwell and you dont want anything more than to sit next to him and bring him any food or medicine he needs until hes better.Again were you not compassionate and nurturing before RPW? He would get sick and youd laugh in his face? gtHe stops by unannounced to say hi and you actively think about how much time it took out of his day to think about it drive over and then get on with his responsibilities.On its own this would be sweet but in combination with the rest of your post its just more of you being self centered.gt You clean because you cant stand the thought of him coming home to anything less than inviting and he tells you to sit down and chat and not dare lift a finger because youve done so much already.Again the benefit of cleaning is not having to clean? gtThese are the things we work toward.We do not encourage RPW to improve themselves or their relationships so that they can get more perks. We do not motivate struggling women with pictures of their men spoiling them for doing the bare minimum and yes everything you listed is the bare minimum. gtIts hard but when you falter you feed the suspicions he has that youre not so different after all youre shining up a pretty turd but in the end youll still be the same selfserving person youve always been. This is exactly what your post seems like to me maybe thats why you are plagued with that specific suspicion.  ,RedPillWomen,d017q3e,3,t5_2xing

If he really isnt listening to her or caring about how she feels ever then that is a problem she should bring up with him without being accusatory I find it hard to believe that hes suddenly become a dickhead just because she has developed a more pleasant personality now and easier to buy that shes realizing her issues are still there.She can also say i feel that you arent listening and it hurts if hes really being dismissive  in a rude way.But abandonment issues can really affect all your relationships and it needs to be addressed. I had an acquaintance who had awful abandonment issues. I would listen to her and she would accuse me of not actually listening or understanding and that i didnt care enough about how she felt even though i was clearly using my time to listen and comfort her.

This internalization that women are like  that I am like  depreciating assets kills me a little a lot.I will add that yes you are a depreciating asset.  Im not sure why that would kill you though.  Its just something you have to except its the feminine cross to bear and men have theirs as well.  I know many men that are fit hard working take care of their wives and are thriving in their careers.  Their wives are ugly fat and rude.  Guess who leaves who?  Yup she does?  Why is this?  Its because she cant mentally travel back in time to the day she felt the respect trust and happiness that you mentioned in your post.  Theres a post on redpill right now about a wife leaving her retired pro athlete husband for a convicted convict.  I guarantee you she had your same feelings and sentiment towards her husband and probably had countless discussion in her youth questioning why any women would leave a man she loved so deeply...

Failed at another diet your home is a mess you have no energy for your children the career you insisted upon is stagnating and your husband is unhappy?  LOL thats just life! lt according to pretty much every woman my age on my Facebook feed.  Women who DO maintain their figure home children and marriage well are seen as trying too hard out of conceit or arrogance... or as liars. Theoretically your respect for your partner and your desire to be seen as attractive and valuable to him should be driving your efforts.  He shouldnt need to TELL you to take care of your body or clean up after yourself. Realistically it is hard to change your ways overnight and I feel for you.  What really helped me years ago was to internalize that I was only hurting myself.  I was basically two versions of myself  the me who knew what I should be doing and the me who said screw you Ill do what I want.  But we dont have two selves we have one. I strongly recommend practicing yoga and meditation to get in touch with your true self the self that you are hurting by your lack of selfdiscipline.  Practice yoga six days a week even if it hurts or you dont want to because if we spend our lives forming attachments to things that bring us temporary pleasure drinking too much eating too much wasting time instead of getting things done having other people tell us what to do and forming aversions to things that bring us temporary pain moving to a new place improving our minds and bodies taking responsibility for our own choices there can never be any true happiness or true peace. ,RedPillWomen,d4styh8,5,t5_2xing

Efforts to make yourself look good dont matter that much in the end because ultimately its the final product people see.  The supremely ugly girl would have to put on a cakeface to begin to look as good as the naturally beautiful girl without makeup but the second the naturally beautiful girl puts on makeup its game over for the ugly girl. And makeupother cosmetics are actually quite expensive.  If you buy shit makeup it will generally show.  Good lipstick can run you between  a pop for example. ,RedPillWomen,d6br6m2,6,t5_2xing
8574278,0,t1_d6cmbbr,Yeah I heard about this. The police let this go on for  years because they were afraid of being racist. Can you believe this shit? Theyd rather let gangs of men brutalize young girls than get accused of being a racist. That is stupid and evil. Im not against immigrants but I think if countries let people do whatever they want without enforcing the law and Im talking about any group of people they will become brutes. That is the problem with many liberals. With quotes like love wins they just assume that the only evil in the world is white males and thus applying the law equally to someone who is not white is apparently some kind of evil racism. In reading those stories I was also wondering Where are these girls fathers? I think this is a case of how the increasing disposability of men in society is leaving young girls vulnerable to predators. My dad isnt perfect but if this shit had happened to me as a kid and the police didnt do anything hed be at the police station with a torch in his hand ready to burn down the place.  ,RedPillWomen,d6dd8ee,2,t5_2xing
8582821,0,t1_d6edwa8,gt Feminism has freed men from the burden of performanceNo the burden of performance is still there. There is no pussypass for men and men are still valued for what they do not for who they are. It has simply changed the costbenefit equation by increasing the costs and removing the most important benefits. When men shun committed relationships they do gain protection from divorcerape and the kind of toxicity that feminism brings into modern relationships with so many women. So they cut the costs but they dont get the benefits of a good relationship either. When they shun trying to achieve value in their lives they not only lose out financially but in a very important aspect of the male psyche respect especially selfrespect is more important than affection.Im talking about the ones that withdraw like the herbivores. Those that instead play the game actually benefit a lot from feminism driving the cost of sex down but they still lose out in other ways. And ultimately we all lose out since birth rates are below replacement levels and there is a toxic antimale atmosphere everywhere which sours relationships between the sexes.

8808408,0,t3_50srdw,Basically when youre a smarter person call it more educated if you want especially if youre a male you kind of have to drop that as a standard. Its kind of like being a tall girl. You have to decide on whether you want to limit your dating pool by that standard and that decision is largely mediated by your own SMV. Ultimately I think most above average intelligence men are going to decide that other qualities physical and emotional health are a lot more important to them. Im more attracted than most by intellectualism to the point of almost a fetish but even I have to admit that it only gets you so far in terms of attraction.To me intelligence is only one of the traits of a womans attractiveness. Her SMV to me is a composite of that emotional health and physical attractiveness. If I were to diagram this it would honestly looks a little bit like thisMy only gripe with this is that it combines emotional health amp intelligence into one axis instead of separating them.Now that I think sufficiently answers your question but what is more interesting to me is that that preference only applies for longterm partners but that it does not matter at all for shortterms ones. Being capable of listening to reason and making reasonably good decisions has no bearing on this kind of attraction. If you dont meet those depressingly high bars Id frankly just be pump amp dumping you.Now Im not really interested in that meaning shortterm relationships thats just me Im just giving you a peek into the male perspective so you know. Its important that you do because its easy for a woman to think that when she acts like a ditzslut she thinks it makes her look attractive to men because of the attention she gets for it. Im letting you know that shes not wrong. Its just the kind of attraction she doesnt want at least not all the time. Its short term appetitive attraction. Its the attraction of a predator to prey.You want to know what male sexual strategy boils down to? Thats essentially what it looks like. When you understand that it explains to you but not excuses a lot of things including to some extent rape culture. When you recognize this you can start to see it just about everywhere. For example when men are talking about other women and bragging about their exploits etc. Men who actually respect their partners in my experience would at least be uncomfortable talking about their sexual encounters with them but I think we both know what the conversation is like when the opposite is true. This kind of storytelling often starts out with listing out the perceived negative or slutty features of the woman i.e. Now she had purple hair and loads of tattoos so I knew this bitch was crazy...daddy issues insecure dumb as a box of rocks etc. All these things enhance the narrative. Its cruel but its the truth. That feeling you get when you find out that this maligning has happened to you its not always an overreaction its an ancestral fear that youre losing the respect in a relationship or that you never had it to begin with that youve been deceived essentially.Pondering this phenomenon really makes me understand something I didnt for a long time and that is why women bother with all their displaying and preening behaviors since they are the selective sex. In a lot of other species the females are rather drab and functional while the males are exuberant and competitive. This is just due to the biological fact that one gender has to invest more in reproduction and the other gender can therefore serve as a vector for variedgood genes this is one of the advantages of sexual dichotomy.So why in humans is there this odd dual competition with genders? Why do men show off their exploits and swagger about and women vex about beauty and propriety etc? But then it hit me Men despite their notoriously and overly exaggerated philandering and comparatively unselective sexual attraction are very selective in regards to those other traits which ultimately dictates which women they commit to and which ones they dont. This dichotomy in strategies allows a homo sapiens male to pursue his intrinsic interest to spread his genes as much as possible and at the least cost and investment to himself the pump amp dump. But this interest is modulated by the fact that his actions have consequences due to human specifically female intelligence and memory. Meaning that if a man pump amp dumps a woman hell basically have harmed that woman and his likelihood of having sex with her again is slim to none. So if a high quality mate is in question hes incentivized to treat her well because its in his genetic interest to have as many possible offspring with her as possible because a high quality mate means that hes more likely to have high quality offspring especially a pump n dumping alpha male to pass on his genes. Basically the old adage is true that sex is a womans weapon except for this applies more accurately to her SMV and its capacity to draw out commitment. The meaning of this is essentially that a womans SMV is directly correlated with the treatment shes likely to get from the opposite gender which is especially important evolutionary because that opposite gender has x her upper body strength and an unfortunate inclination towards rage and violence.One critique I have of the feminist mainstream is just that its become a little too entwined with the Left and enamored with the notion of tabula rasa and perfect equality. Basically they emphasize human rights and basic respect for all people and other such notions. Im divided as to how noble this endeavor is but I just have to say that this mentality tends to compromise womens ability to learn about how to build SMV and regulate her own behaviors. Mainstream Feminism therefore has the capacity to ironically harm women and compromise their power which this sub I think is concerned about regaining and it therefore helps explain why womens relative happiness has decreased even in societies with more sexual equality and opportunity for women. Anyway to get back on topic for an example of intelligence amp male attraction my last LTR was with a woman who was very smart for female standards sorry just my experience maybe? and she still could basically tell me nothing I didnt already know or offer me any advice or counsel that I hadnt already considered. Sounds pretty impossible or that Im a narcissist but honest to god it was true.She flattered me by asking me lots of questions though and being interested in what I had to say and she appreciated my qualities more I think because of her intelligence. We were close enough to each other intellectually that when we would discuss things I wasnt completely going over her head which is really all thats necessary I think.,RedPillWomen,d76nfjn,4,t5_2xing

8848022,0,t3_51db56,A couple things at the outsetgtOr is it true that any man will commit given the right circumstances?No so dont beat yourself up over this.gt Its discouraging and part of me has thought that maybe Im asking for too much or maybe its not possible but I know it is of course because plenty of women in college are in serious relationships.I know its trite but remember that not all relationships are good.  Some girls and guys you know will be in a relationship just to be in a relationship others will be having a good but ultimately temporary experience when they break up in a few years.I think you should take some time and think seriously about what you want.   Now I will break rhetorical rank and tell you what I think you should want ha.  Hopefully it will be helpful you can take it or leave it.In my view serious relationship is something of an oxymoron.  What exactly is there to be serious about?  Netflix and sex after one or two or ten months of cute milkshakes at cute diners is still...Netflix and sex.Not that sex isnt serious.  But it can certainly be meaningless if treated as such.If youre looking for a guy wwhom you can build a life over the long term realize that now and act like it.  It may seem like an outlandish idea that you could do that right now because you probably know few people who are doing it.  But youre an adult now so youre allowed to buck the trends.If you are looking for a longterm where longterm means fifty years not five dude then it will help your cause considerably to look for men also looking for someone long term rather than trying to change a chad.While youre looking Ill suggest a few things  dont sleep with anyone.  Its just not to your advantage and it screws with your emotions.  DO be clear about what you are looking for.  You are presumably not looking to get free dinners from a beta for five years and never have sex.  So often RPW advice is presented as dont sleep whim until...  The way you should be thinking about it is in the future after  lets fuck each others brains out as we life plan.    If you dont see a remote possibility of that happeningeither because youre not attracted to him or because you have different goalsthen do your best to break things off quickly and kindly.  franklyyou probably want to avoid making out wdudes as well.  I mean...if youre kissing right youre gonna want to have sex with him and vice versa.  If you enjoy being sexually frustrated and being called a tease then go to town.  Be willing to date a lot of men concurrently.  You have high standards for which you shouldnt apologizebut you should realize that youre looking for something rare and be willing to put commensurate effort into your search.  Corollary  be willing to go on dates with men who are themselves going on a lot of dates  Corollary  be willing to go on cheap dates.  Dont worry about driving away the right guy by dating a lot of men assuming youre not having sex with them or even making out with them.  Everything RPW says about being pleasant etc.  Without immediate sex on the table what do you offer?  The bar here is not superhumanly high but its important to clear it.  Make an effort to be the kindest and calmest version of you and you should be fine.,RedPillWomen,d7ben7e,3,t5_2xing

9477407,0,t3_5ak4gf,Lurker!  Wall of text below. I love these subs for the self improvement and fresh perspective.  Im kind of putoff by the political and all or nothing mentalities that seem to be a part of being RP.  Selfconfessed social justice warrior profamily and traditional values but very much NOT conservative.I really identify with the evolutionary bio aspects of rp theory and totally agree that the intense pushing of feminism in our culture really hurts and excludes traditional models which are very functional.   I have trouble taking that to the level of rejecting feminism or equality as ridiculous but I really enjoy a lot of the discussion around it.  My favorite thing about lurking here is how progressive and nonjudgental the advice tends to be really balanced between what our natures pull out of us and what we can DO to temper that nature.I feel like honestly dissecting my motives and my SOs helps me see things clearly and make better choices.Sometimes I think I dont really belong here because socially outside of my homelife the culture cropping up around these ideas is pretty antithetical to who I am.  I guess Im purple?  But Im always pleased with the reallife advice given here even if I cant get on board with being truly antifeminist.I just think this redpill works for most people and can be really helpful and healing for the world so its sad to see people using it to justify being angry or hateful instead of being motivated to take action and work on themselves and their families.  The anger at society makes sense to me in the manosphere but Im always sad to see it creep in over in the ladies subs which I feel generally do a great job of focusing on thoughtful debate and selfimprovement instead of angry ranting.

Kids do better with  parents than   thats not to knock single parent families who are simply heroic IMHO but a simple statement about work and hours in a day.As much as we all try to deny it me especially marriage has a sense of investment and I daresay ownership which is really appealing to men This is MY family MY wife MY children.

9518624,0,t1_d9likxa,gt She should be ashamed of herself. If the husband has done nothing wrong and everything right more or less and she says I love you to him I assume she does then looking for better shows me that she exemplifies the TRP doctrine of AWALT.... which is an insult to the women who arent.Im going to disagree with this. Theres a saying I like very much a Chinese proverb  The best time to plant a tree was  years ago the nd best time is today Yes it would have been infinitely better if the OP had come to terms with these feelings earlier before marriage andor kids and sharing finances etc all that. But sometimes people can only come to terms with things when they are ready in the time and place to deal with that specific situation. We all have our own paths and we all have to deal with things that we are capable of when we are capable of them. Does anyone man or woman in their early s really have a firm grasp of who they are and what they want yet? Most dont. If the OP comes to terms with the issue that if it ends up being the case that her husband is an attractive guy against a baseline instead of a guy shes actually attracted to then why prolong the inevitable? What do people want her to do? Stay in a marriage where shes not attracted to her mate for the sake of comparison to other horror stories out there or because this is as good as its going to get for her? Not being attracted to someone and marrying them is not fair. Its not. But if thats the case its not like you can go back in time. Not being attracted to someone REALIZING IT and then staying because its the path of least resistance I have to ask how is that fair to her partner? I see that as taking something thats unfair then heaping a ton of gravy and mashed potatoes on it and turning it into an Unfair Banquet. Ill share a story I dont usually share. I met a girl who was by all accounts awesome for me. I could talk to her. I was attracted to her. She was just great for me in every conceivable way I could think. I was happy. We talked ideas of marriage and we had the same kind of goals and we have plans for the future. One night she got drunk. No she didnt sleep with another guy. What she did do was admit that she was glad to be with a guy like me because I was stable and she felt I was less of a catch than other guys before me thus I would loyal not cheat and would have no choice but to treat her right. She said it was nice to not have to worry about what I was going to do when her back was turned not like the other guys. I was a checklist guy She didnt really love me. She loved that I was a safe option in a time of likely turmoil in her life. She didnt want to be alone. The next day she sobered up and she apologized. Said she didnt mean it she was sorry. I was devastated. I wished her well and left and never looked back. Im sure someone will say she manipulated it to find a way out of the relationship. Im sure folks will say  a lot of things that probably wont be pleasant. In the end she was not attracted to me. I could have stayed maybe it would have lasted until we both died of old age. Maybe we could have even found some light moments of joy. Maybe we could have treated each other better than many other people do. And if that had not happened what would have been fair to me? To stay when she wasnt really attracted to me just accepting she was getting older and she wasnt sure what the future could bring so she would settle for the next best option? Every moment she would stay would be a moment Id lose of my precious freedom and time to move on and find someone who would choose me because she wanted to be with me. I would rather be alone even for the rest of my life than to have someone try to negotiate attraction for me. To have to look through old photos or look at other horror stories or have to think back to the good days to rationalize that Im someone worth loving. Can you negotiate attraction for a little while? Im sure you can. Can you negotiate attraction for the rest of your life? I honestly doubt it. If the OP could leave today no custody battle no kids in play no rancor no anger just leave with no consequences would she do it? If she has to pause and think about it the marriage IMHO is over. A person who truly loves you all the way through right down to the bone will not hesitate. I love this person this person is my partner Im here until the world ends and I will never doubt this the person for me I loved her. I loved her in a way I could not imagine I could ever in my life love someone. To me there were no other girls in the entire world. They were all nameless and shapeless blobs to me. Some will say that is TRP  oneitis and that there are no unicorns People can call it whatever they want all I know is that my attraction for her was not negotiable. I didnt need someone to tell me to compare her to every other horror story to appreciate her. I appreciated her because I wanted to do it. I did not have to argue against myself to do it. I did not have to checklist her against every other woman Ive been with or out of my best options at the time and place. I left not because she did not love me but because I have to love myself more than accepting being settled for even if it means being alone. What did I get in return I gave myself a real chance even if its a small one to find someone who could be attracted to me without having to weigh out whether I was a safe and practical decision. Instead of living the rest of my life with someone committed to being polite and taking the path of least resistance over just being honest. I hold no anger with her now. She should only be ashamed if she stayed when she didnt love me or if she cheated because she didnt know what else to do. I dont wish her ill will I wish her happiness  though I never want to see or talk to her again in my life because even if she didnt love me I refuse to ever negotiate my love for her. You can love someone and not be with them. What you shouldnt do is be with someone you just dont love. ,RedPillWomen,d9mdfw1,8,t5_2xing
9523398,0,t1_d9mxq9b,Im not sure how nomenclature works over at TRP I see TRP people as those who accept the doctrine of TRP and do what they will with the knowledge. So they can be complete hopeless betas theyre still RP to me if they accept thats what they are and accept that they have to work and improve to be happy. If they know that and still reject happiness to follow their instincts that doesnt make them blue pill just not strong determined motivated what you will enough to pursue but their instincts.I see Purple Pill people as those who dont fully agree with TRP not those who disagree because they cant stand the truth or something. For instance they might not want to take the label because a lot of it is speculative and based on experiences of men rather than using some more objective method or measurement. Not saying TRP truths are not truths just that a lot of them have yet to be definitively confirmed and quantified. Or maybe they agree with most of it but dont think LTR strategies are bad just tougher or maybe they are monkmode MGTOW and want to separate themselves from PUA branch or viceversa.Also theres plenty of BP alphas theyre natural alphas who arent conscious of TRP or know what exactly theyre doing but theyre able to get through life as one would with a lot of effort put into practicing TRP.So yeah I think we should call those who have the knowledge of TRP and agree with it RP those who have it but dont necessarily agree with all of it PP and those who dont know about TRP consciously not necessarily the community but the truths it talks about are BP.,RedPillWomen,d9mylf0,2,t5_2xing

Now Im light enough to be active enough to eat whatever I want but I stick to paleo because it makes me feel good and look good. Stop spreading Eating Disorder propaganda.

10101504,0,t1_dbo7woo,gt I dont think neoteny is indistinguishable from actual youth. Its just an adult with flatter face less hair bigger eyes maybe behaving more playfully.It also results in a slower development cycle which means you end up looking younger.well anyway as to the rest of your post if we turn the idea that neoteny resulted in bigger brains and higher intelligence on its head and instead assume that perhaps selecting for intelligence resulted in bigger brains which needed longer to develop leading to neotany then we can argue more effectively for your idea that menopause was a reaction to bigger brains. consider the following scenariosay our early ancestors were looking for intelligent partners. this over successive generations results in more intelligent offspring which also require longer to develop as per the assumption I made above. This results in a much larger investment needed from the parents. Which in turn bestows a selective advantage on females who stop reproducing at a certain age so that they can live longer and help their offspring with the benefit of their experience I assume this is what you mean in your above post. this also pushed humans to pair bond as their offspring now require more of an investment to raise. and lastly pair bonding combined with menopause pushed men to select younger partners so that they could have more offspring. This further accelerates the development of neotenous features in humans and possibly gives the developing brain a further advantage. ,RedPillWomen,dbo8m3n,1,t5_2xing

Also try using a hand cream with shea butter and vitamin E in it. For the cuticlesnails I let them soak in vaseline for half an hour then wipe it off. My brother has the nastiest cuticles and cuticle oil was helpful for that too. What also helped with my nails was biotin supplements and using a base coat of nail hardener sometimes even when I wasnt wearing nail polish.

Sure it might be interesting to rename ourselves because there seems to be a lot of confusion eg. new users coming in posting about how to get an RP man or telling us they dont want to work because its unattractive. We cant really call ourselves traditional womens group or the like because theres too many different types of women  ones who work ones who dont ones who dont want children ones who are full time SAHM conservative liberal...but the most important thing to take away from RPW IMHO is to understand femalemale nature and also understand how you can change things. Theres too many stories about wives becoming fat and nagging and dont understand why their husbands arent loving anymore and continue to blame the husband when they dont realize the problem might be themselves. If we can all become better girlfriendswives longterm maybe men wont think theyre being tied down when they marry and instead see the benefits of marriage and having a wife.,RedPillWomen,dgige7f,7,t5_2xing
