No idea whats causing it as of yet.Will be fixing that RGB color value dragging thingautocaps.. yeah. Ill get to that very slowly major bugs first,jormy,cg0frsc,2,t5_2rxtj
530242,0,t1_cg0jlg5,Hmm the folder would be created again and it would cause problems again when you respring. It probably will crash it again. Id like you to try it if you have the time. This happens randomly on some people ,jormy,cg0jne9,1,t5_2rxtj
624027,0,t1_cgb6vvc,I just emailed the  most recent ones hopefully that helps but idk if the update you just sent out fixed it havent had a chance to try it out,jormy,cgb7axd,1,t5_2rxtj
647714,0,t3_21jeoq,If you get a lot of typo maybe youre not using the double word hinting correctly? As for swipe from caps key.. Ill think about adding that but I dont think its going to be simple to modify the current architecture for that particular mod.,jormy,cgdw8ps,2,t5_2rxtj

655029,0,t3_21mvqn,Yeah the enter button is a bit strange on youtube. Can you disable the youtube app from loading the nin keyboard proxy? Do it from the tweak settings on the spacebar menu.As for youtube video crashinbg constantly.. not sure about that. Havent heard of that one yet,jormy,cgeq690,1,t5_2rxtj
909359,0,t3_24h159,Yeah I tried but for some reason I cant get some apps to respect the keyboard height properly.The only solution is just to shrink the top bar. Ive got something that will make correcting words without the top bar much better  but with the algorithm kinda being worked at right now I dont think Im going to do a push. Still need to do additional algorithm fixes and some things are inconstruction right now.,jormy,ch7nefc,1,t5_2rxtj
