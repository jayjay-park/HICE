158891,1,t3_1vwrjz,The  is easier to ride. Uses less energy from the rider so you ride harder longer. Engine braking helps going into turns. Will mess you up on jumps. Always jump with throttle cracked. They have less engine braking these days but its still there. Additionally where you shift from second to third eight or ten times a lap a  uses third. Second gear starts put it in third and ring its neck. The torque is instantaneous and the power is a smooth curve. No more arm yanking just smooth power from the bottom to the top. You will go through more tires sprockets and chains but less clutches. Top ends cost more but you can get away with changing them less. Valve jobs are painful to your wallet unless you have a NASCAR shop. The bikes are jack knives. Trail Cross Country Dirt Track Super Moto Motocross Sand. Works great in all.

This might be what I saw.  Personally I ran a paddle for years but the last  or  times out I just ran my knobby and IMO its not so bad that it doesnt work and its easier than swapping a tire.  Drop your tire pressure down to around psi but watch out for rocks and curbs if youre crossing bridgesroads etc. Learned that the hard wayGet the flap that blots to the axle.  Then bend it about  degrees away from your bike.  Ive had them swap around and get tangled in the rear wheel.  No biggie except it breaks and you can get a ticket.Buttercup is ok its just a small area.  Steep smaller dunes than Glamis.

You just dont know where that helmet has been and what kind of impacts it may or may not have taken. Helmets at the dealers have become a lot less expensive and a good one can be had for less than . Like I was told when I was buying a street helmet Its all about how much your head is worth to you.Another idea for budget boots some will probably hate this is to go to a surplus store and pick up some combat boots.

A bigger berm will let you gear higher carry more speed and lean down further where as you might just blow through a smaller berm with the same speed. Try second and third feel the differences and which one you like better.

The argument is also to keep a level playing field since not all athletes are going to want to take PEDs regardless of health risks. You shouldnt force the hand of athletes who are against PEDs just so that they can stay competitive. In many sports people also dont want to see their use to prevent records from being broken by athletes using PEDs....records set by people who were not using them.

1448553,0,t3_2aqcvb,You only need to rebuild the engine if it needs it. A compression test is a good indicator as well as a leakdown test for condition of the main seals more of a pain in the ass though. Some of the big bore  strokes such as the CR can go for yonks without a top end.The way to get longevity with your engine is to jet it properly and mix oil properly. And use quality parts. Warming up the engine is also extremely important. Let it idle til the pipe is warm before you rev it. Blip the throttle if its gonna stall but keep the revs down to prevent scour of the cylinder walls. Doing unneccary top ends just wastes money.Compression tests for a cc should be around ish PSI and cc should be ish PSI. Depends how you test it and if you put oil in the cylinder.You probably get told to do a top end incase the previous owner didnt so your engine doesnt blow up doing a jump or out in the woods or something. Get a compression tester on eBay they cost .Also you might squeeze  hours out of a  but doubtful on a cc. s that get raced might get  hours per top end but the weekend warrior might get . Like I said a compression test will tell you everything. Plus once you do a top end you can feel the difference. A bike that is about to blow starts easy and has less of a snap on the powerband.,Motocross,cixuoel,2,t5_2qyb0

At  feet we switched up ramps to get a better feel for how a er kicks. So that was just a ramp pushed closer to the landing. Followed a guy over hit that for a couple of months started going long and itching for a bigger hit so I convinced the people around me I was ready for  took a few deep breaths took  speed runs right next to a guy hitting it and then I followed him over. After each injury I start over like this but not for as long a day on  a couple of days on  more deep breaths and follow someone over the . After breaking my arms this was absolutely terrifying I was as close to stunned by fear as ive ever been and probably ever will be. Had trouble breathing for hours before doing it and almost cramped up because i was so tense. But the only cure was just jumping it. So deep breaths and ignoring the fear I told my friend I was ready and went for it sailed over like nothing had happened and that was that. Of course it takes a while to regain that lost confidence and im still a little nervous before the first jump of the day. You learn to deal with it trust your instincts and what not. Riding afraid is not the way to go thats how you crash.Those are some extremely stylish tricks aiming high!Anything where you completely let go is seriously difficult especially if you wanna hit a grab first totally possible with some training tho. Some people just a knack for a certain type of trick my buddy did proper stylish double grabs within a month or so of hitting his first er I went for whips and Cordovas because it just felt right to me.

5800950,0,t1_cxfjomb,I want to agree but I am pretty sure Dungey will be considered the favorite. Eli has more sheer speed and is one of those riders who can find new lines that nobody else can hit while keeping the same speed Like at Glen Helen but being he is on new equipment working with new people and coming back from injury I dont think hes going to be racing the same way he was before injury for a while. That being said theres also something to say about Dungey finding speed over the past couple years. Im not much of a Dungey fan but he has stepped it up and those KTMs looks like they are the best working bikes on the track for the most part. As much as I am pulling for Tomac Dungey is still the guy to beat. If canard is  the factory Honda effort is looking good this year too. ,Motocross,cxg5vmm,3,t5_2qyb0

A decent flat spot to build a pond to get dirt and then build it around or close to the pond. I would say that would be a decent start for a good motocross track. If you had  acres of flat land like here in Indiana you could dig a pond and make jumps and a track around that too. Finding a hilly area is best though because jumps will be a lot easier to make  hills also make the track much more versatile and enjoyable.,Motocross,d0kmnzn,3,t5_2qyb0

10746497,0,t1_ddo4p2j,My only solution is that once you go down a lap your position is locked in. The problem being everyone is racing for a contract and ending the race  or  laps in of a  lap race is ridiculous. Then you get into the stay out of the race line but different rhythms mean different race lines for different riders so that doesnt cover it. Maybe give spotter radio contact like in NASCAR and help dictate the lappers line based upon the person doing the lapping but its still subject to spotter error. There is literally no good solution for everyone in this scenario other than smarter track design. I for one wouldnt race SX at that level. Its too big too crowded and too technical for the speed. We see a top rider go down every year and that is discounting the numerous privateer injuries that will literally ruin lives and careers. It either needs to be more selective based upon speed and ability or safer in general and I just dont see FIM or Feld signing off on the potential revenue loss. ,Motocross,ddof3yn,1,t5_2qyb0

11413551,0,t3_62wswa,If youre just riding a DRZ and Im assuming you dont have a huge budget spend most of your money on a helmet. A new helmet is almost required unless you really trust someone to have not crashed in one theyll sell you.Besides that you can pick up gear used as you see it online. Ive personally been racing  years without knee pads or elbow pads always found them uncomfortable. Your roost deflector is fine your next purchases need to be helmet boots and knee braces in that order. That is assuming you have gloves and goggles if youre going to ride with other people.Jeans are fine until you get your knee braces but you can pick up a full set of new moto gear really cheap on closeout at Iron Pony or from someone at a moto track.,Motocross,dfppr01,1,t5_2qyb0

11481644,0,t1_dfxfht9,Yup. I think I got used to stability down around  or so before I even got a setup to ride with. Its a ridiculously deep game if youre mechanically inclined but I only know the most extreme basics of engines and this game is highly suspension driven. Haha which Im utterly clueless about. ,Motocross,dfxfx1u,2,t5_2qyb0
