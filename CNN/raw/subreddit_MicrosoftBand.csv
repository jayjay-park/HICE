Humans are particularly sensitive to auditory tones between  and  hertz  and basic mobile phone ringers often fall within this range.

6307556,0,t3_41z52s,This came up before someone said they had gone  days without syncing before but I have never seen an official rated data capacity of the Band .  Id suspect its also going to depend quite a bit on usage,MicrosoftBand,cz6ljg9,2,t5_34a4d
6343330,0,t3_41cajq,Band checks heart rate whenever you have the screen on. It can take about  seconds for it to lock sometimes and says acquiring before this happens. If its still not working try making it a it tighter move it closer to your wrist in your arm and wear it with the screen facing inwards. I find this more comfortable to wear easier to read notifications and probably more accurate as the HR sensor is directly above the best area for pulse. When band screen isnt on it checks HR for  minute every  minutes and  for  when in sleep mode. Excercise is continuous. ,MicrosoftBand,czanzz4,1,t5_34a4d
6349249,0,t1_czahi0x,Thanks! Something seems weird about that thought doesnt it? The treadmill knows how much road its put under you. Why does it matter how many steps you took? It seems to me all that would matter is what length of road the treadmill cycled under you which should be a simple factor of revolutions  treadmill band length. Am I missing something?,MicrosoftBand,czbc7p7,1,t5_34a4d

6423572,0,t1_czg83ms,From what I can tell it is still not fixed. Some days it appears to work then others it is the same issue I posted in that MFP thread. Heck the last two days the adjustment hasnt even showed up. Lately Ive been using Lose It! as my main calorie tracker and checking in on the adjustment in MFP app on occasion to see if there has been any progress. The Lose It! integration is a bit different and kind of does its own thing with just the steps and activities from the Band but at least it works and is consistent.,MicrosoftBand,czjqfma,1,t5_34a4d

6488254,0,t3_44f0fj,I went with an ArmorSuit MilitaryShield which is really similar to the Zagg brand screen protector I installed on my phone a while ago. This type of screen protector is indeed painful to install  you have to set up a cleanroomlike environment to avoid getting any lint under the protector and theyre very fiddly to work with especially when theyre as small as the one for the Band . However once theyre on properly theyre extremely protective and durable so worth the effort.  ,MicrosoftBand,czqfmjc,2,t5_34a4d

6575226,0,t1_czz714s,I wasnt talking about Windows in general. I was specifically talking about the band. I also have no problem with Windows  since Ive been loving it since its release for PC and Xbox. The phone version is slowly catching up but even the devices released with WM were having a lot of problems and the  and xl arent that big of an update to make me leave my Lumia Icon. Also WMbeta has been out for about a year if I remember correctly. ,MicrosoftBand,czzfl33,1,t5_34a4d
6633574,0,t3_46ia87,Thanks so much for being available here! I have a few developer questions if you dont mind Is there any way to query the battery level from the phone? I dont see it in the SDK but Ive seen one app that does it in addition to MS Health. Any way to check whether the band is within an activity such as a workout? I ask because my app in development changes the me tile occasionally and I find that this action will pause a workout which seems undesirable. And in general it would be nice if there were a less obtrusive way to change the me tile and colors. Ive noticed that web tiles do not change their color when the color theme is changed. Is this by design or a bug? I notice similar behavior in the Twitter tile always blue but in that case I think it is a branding choice. Im referring to the contents shown after selecting the tile.Thanks for the software updates and new features!,MicrosoftBand,d05gw0f,3,t5_34a4d

7239785,0,t3_4ekm4g,Pimp My Band on Windows Phone lets you set any color you want so you can approximate your Windows theme color. Unfortunately it may take some trial amp error work because YMMV the Band sscreen color accuracy is way off a color you choose for your phone or computer screen may look quite different on the Band so youll have to try a few colors until you get it right. For example a medium green chosen for PC and phone became a very bright yellowish green on Band so I chose a darker slightly more blue green to get it right.,MicrosoftBand,d21400v,4,t5_34a4d

7446862,0,t1_d2ojm0w,Did you follow the same steps I did? Pairing a freshly reset Band made a huge difference. If you sync the Band before the reset you dont lose any data. Uninstalling the Health app is also important as many of the permissions are reset.,MicrosoftBand,d2ont0x,1,t5_34a4d
