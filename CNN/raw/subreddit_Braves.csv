746536,0,t1_cgp1z1y,After Medlen and Beachy both went down within  hours of each other both needing Tommy John surgery Wren got permission from Liberty Media to expand the budget in order to sign Santana a free agent in what was considered still considered? an act of desperation just to try to salvage the season.  At the time Hale and Wood were both unproven albeit good prospects for us and Minor was known to be out for the few weeks to start the season.  We really needed a strong toptier starter who could eat up some innings who wouldnt need tons of coaching.  Its very good to see Santana pitch as well as he did.  In fact the entire starting rotation has pitched brilliantly to start the season.  Hopefully they can keep it up!  Harang has pitched darn good as well which is a pleasant surprise surprise is too strong of a word but I cant think of what word should go there.  Hes decent I guess.But before Santana entered the rotation last night we were stuck on a man rotation and that included the two unproven young guys Wood and Hale Harang old decent guy and Teheran Please god stay healthy!Once Minor returns the thinking is Hale will go back to AAA and be our first replacement starter if anyone else goes down.  But there are also a few people suggesting Wood go to the bullpen as another good lefty reliever.

830638,0,t1_cgyp1e2,ampampamp Bear gay culture sfw gtgtIn male bisexual and gay culture a Bear is a large hairy man who projects an image of rugged masculinity Bears are one of many LGBT communities with events codes and a culturespecific identity.gtThe term Bear was popularized by Richard Bulger who along with his then partner Chris Nelson  founded Bear Magazine in . There is some contention surrounding whether Bulger originated the term and the subcultures conventions. George Mazzei wrote an article for The Advocate in  called Whos Who in the Zoo? that characterized homosexuals as seven types of animals including bears. gtSome Bears place importance on presenting a hypermasculine image and may shun interaction with and even disdain men who exhibit effeminacy  The Bear concept can function as an identity an affiliation and there is ongoing debate in Bear communities about what constitutes a Bear however a consensus exists that inclusion is an important part of the Bear community.   In particular many bear community organizations define inclusiveness as a central value of the movement such that anyone who supports values such as having a good attitude to life friends and helping the local community is welcome in the Bear community regardless of appearance  although the view that physical characteristics are central to the Bear identity is still seen in many other definitions. gtgtImage i  Pride flag of the Bear community one of many flags for sexuality and gender identitybased culturesInteresting Bear flag gay culture | Masculinity | LGBT culture | Chris Nelson photographer Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgypkh oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgypkh.

If you substitute Gattis for all of Lairds starts the MNA goes down to . which would bring the ztwar src up to .  While still not top of the league it gives me less reason to worry.gt but their btrds is  which is above average Which is fine.  The production that they get from Simmons at shortstop and Freeman at first base MORE THAN OUTWEIGH any slip in the this years btrds.   Theres a reason Simmons gets compared to Ozzie Smith frequently and its the solid glove.  This is a nonissue  you know who had the best BTRDS last year?  Houston.  Need I say more?gt unfortuntaely their rpz per inning is abysmal This is the only thing that really concerns me about every stat that you brought up.  RPZ per inning is really low.  BUT...it was low last year too.  Its not yet June and if LaStella produces then this will improve dramatically.  Plus this stat is skewed because Uggla was in the lineup for a while and Heywards bat is coming around.  Not a great number no getting around it but not worth jumping off the bridge yet over this one.gtso youre looking at a team with close to  twar but high run prevention. Are you kidding me?  This is the most ridiculous thing you could have mentioned.  Its completely irrelevant and thats being nice no offense intended.One good start from Harang or Santana only need a . RWPI or more and this number shoots up to .!  Really its not an issue.  Take the current . TBS per MNI and it doesnt matter.  Not a bit and you can quote me on that no matter what happens the rest of the season.  How do I know this?  I ran the numbers and here are some notable WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS with even worse twar  the highest in this group is  Yankees Cardinals Athletics MarlinsgtFor the post season this team isnt favorable as they need to lower their fwar and their ztr for better run producing. Baloney.  If the bullpen can just get the RWLL down to . or lower they will look like a serious NL pennant contender.Keep hope alive.

Im sure Wren is constantly evaluating the market in case a deal becomes available that would improve the team without wrecking our future but we just dont have the money nor the pieces to offer to do a whole lot right now. I think thats why we are limiting our expectations maybe to bullpen help instead of landing some huge free agent.

1556071,0,t1_cjb9jzj,vslyke is absolutely right. Gattis has been the best hitter on the team this season. His WAR has been only . less than Freddie and thats probably because hes spent time out with an injury. His defense has been at least average and his hitting has been beastly. By beastly I mean better than guys like Giancarlo Stanton and Miguel Cabrera this year. As in one of the top  hitters in baseball. On top of that Gattis is extremely cheap and under team control for a long time. You dont trade away one of the best hitters in the game because you have a good young defensive catcher coming up with borderline major league offensive ability. I like Bethancourt and I think hes going to be stud defensive catcher in the years to come. Id love to have him but given the choice between him and Gattis you go with Gattis. So I think one of two things happens We either trade Bethancourt for a really nice player or some really good prospects or we keep Gattis for a few more years hes almost  trade him before he gets really expensive and then start Bethancourt. Catcher is actually one position where the Braves have some depth. ,Braves,cjbbs82,3,t5_2s0ok

Hes a Top  SS right now so hes extremely valuable. He will get M per year. Uggla was only at M and we still owe him that for next year. his salary doesnt come off the books until If youre trading BJ you have to realize he has extreme negative value. Gattis may have positive value but that probably barely outweighs BJs negative value due to his contract. If you trade BJ and his full contract and Gattis then you probably arent getting much of value back since those together basically add up to  value.  If you do get something back its probably going to be a bad contract as well from the other side. Teams dont just take on bad contracts and give away good young players.

1688604,0,t1_cjrzwl3,ATLANTA  Dee Gordon is the model of improvement in major league baseball this year evolving from a parttimer into an AllStar with a position change and a change in regimen. He explained in spring training that by eliminating hours of pickup basketball he was finally able to gain weight he felt he needed. This is the part of baseball for which no statistical analysis can account A players ability to adapt to make changes that can make a big difference. Atlanta Braves pitcher Alex Wood  who starts on Sunday Night Baseball  ET on ESPN and WatchESPN against Gio Gonzalez and the Nationals  is another example of this. For him throwing a fastball and a changeup came easily but his curveball was always problematic and inconsistent. Sometimes it would spin sharply sometimes it wouldnt and sometimes he could command the pitch and sometimes he couldnt. He tinkered with different grips he explained Saturday and during the offseason he found something while playing catch with his former college teammate Kyle Farmer who is now a catcher in the Dodgers organization. Wood started using the tip of his left index finger as the primary lever rather than the first knuckle and gripped a different part of the baseball using the seams for traction. He had a better feel for the ball throwing it this way and a better curveball which was confirmed by a moment in spring training. With a twostrike count Wood threw the curve to David Ortiz who watched it spin right over the plate for Strike . With his new curveball  which hes using about  percent more than he did last season  Wood feels that he now has a third pitch for which hitters have to account and cannot simply dismiss. Just being able to throw it whenever I need to throw it for the most part and for an out pitch against lefthanders and righthanders has been a big improvement this year said Wood who has a . ERA this season in  starts with  strikeouts in   innings. Here are some other players who made small adjustments that have had yielded colossal results this season Tyson Ross SP San Diego Padres Ross made a major change with his sinker just a few days before his th birthday. In the midst of an April bullpen session Padres pitching coach Darren Balsley talked to Ross about altering his sinker slightly. Until then Ross tended to throw his sinker so that it would dive out of the strike zone it was a nasty pitch for sure but hitters could take it and it would be called a ball. Balsley suggested that Ross raise his release point just a bit so that his sinker traveled down through the strike zone. I could tell the difference right away Ross recalled in a conversation last week. If they took that it was called a strike. With hitters now compelled to swing at his sinker Ross has the highest ground ball rate among all pitchers in baseball at . percent and hes lowered his ERA to .. From  to  his rate of inducing missed swings has doubled from . percent to . percent. Corey Kluber SP Cleveland Indians Kluber was a fourthround pick in  and was traded by the Padres to Cleveland as one piece in a threeteam deal. In  starts in   at age   he posted a . ERA. But Kluber is now among the most dominant pitchers in baseball with  strikeouts and a . ERA in  starts. Mickey Callaway  who has done great work in his time as the Indians pitching coach  explained in an email how Kluber got better Last year he was still trying to figure out how to throw the ball over the plate with that great arsenal he has. We really stressed just pitching to his strengths and he did a good job of that throughout the season. I feel last year was a huge steppingstone as far as his command goes. He really learned where he could command each pitch and figured out that he had multiple ways to put away hitters in the strike zone. This year he has been attacking the hitters that he needs to with his strengths along with being able to attack the hitters weaknesses when it is required. He has really developed the ability to use information during his outings and his unwavering demeanor allows him to do this with great consistency. Kluber shut down the Yankees on Saturday striking out  in six scoreless innings. Kluber is  with a . ERA and  strikeouts in his past four starts. According to the Elias Sports Bureau the only other pitchers in franchise history to post an ERA that low with as many strikeouts over a fourgame span are Bob Feller .  strikeouts in JulyAugust  and Luis Tiant .  Ks in AprilMay . Tyler Clippard RP Washington Nationals Clippard is in his eighth season in the big leagues and this year he has markedly improved his ability to keep the ball in the park and in generating ground balls. Clippard will always be a fastballfirst pitcher and he will pitch up in the strike zone and generate a predominance of fly balls he explained. But since this past season he developed something of a forkball a pitch that tumbles downward with a knuckling action and Clippard believes this has helped keep hitters from honing in on his fastball and has allowed him to get the ball down in the zone. This year Clippard has allowed just two homers in  innings with his rate of ground balls climbing from  percent to  percent. Clippard pitched the th inning and got the win against the Braves in Washingtons marathon victory Saturday night which came after a rain delay of nearly four hours. Around the leagues  On the most recent Baseball Tonight podcast Padres president Mike Dee detailed the hiring of A.J. Preller Jayson Stark discussed the commissioner intrigue and Brendan Kennedy and Andy McCullough broke down the Jays and Royals respectfully as those teams fight for playoff spots.  The Nationals Anthony Rendon is on track to post  runs  extrabase hits and  RBIs in his first full year in the big leagues. This is the first year that manager Matt Williams has been around Rendon and what has jumped out to Williams is Rendons steady consistent heart rate regardless of the situation. The righthanded hitting Rendon takes the ball to the opposite field regularly which is part of the reason why Williams has left Rendon in the No.  spot and Denard Span in the leadoff spot and why he intends to keep it that way.  Span doesnt hit for power he is not flashy and he doesnt rate especially high in defensive metrics for his center field play. But he is batting . with a . onbase percentage and he does not make mistakes defensively he catches what he reaches and throws well and to the right base. As Williams spoke about him Saturday it was clear that part of why he appreciates Span is his consistency and his reliability. When Bryce Harper returned from the disabled list there was a lot of discussion about whether Span would be supplanted in center field. This was fueled in part by Harper who said he thought the Nationals best outfield alignment would be Ryan Zimmerman  healthy at that time  in left field Harper in center and Jayson Werth in right. Span handled the questions that stemmed from that conversation well Williams believes. There was a day recently when Span was not in the lineup and he walked into Williamss office and said I just want you to know I feel like Im the starting center fielder. Williams appreciated how Span said it. Its important that he feels that way Williams said.  The Orioles keep winning and Caleb Joseph  the pride of Lipscomb University  is killing it. From ESPN Stats amp Information Joseph hit a homer for the fifth consecutive game which broke the record set by Jay Gibbons in  for the longest streak by a rookie in franchise history.

In a game of inches there going to be several factors that nobody can account for. These include injuries maturity development fit etc...And I certainly encourage everyone to speculate but if you want to judge these decisions you should do so when they take place. Last season was the first time in the last decade that I was so frustrated with the Braves that I didnt look forward to their games towards the end of the season. I watched because I love them but the insane number of strikeouts and minuscule OBP gave me no hope that they could overcome any deficit. The fact that the management has acknowledged this and made it a priority to change the identity of this team has given me new hope as a fan. Id much rather be continuously building towards something great than watch an organization like the Phillies try to claw one last season out of an aging core.  ,Braves,cnk8bjm,3,t5_2s0ok

Gattis platoon splits are not good his defense is terrible and he was a great story that mashed home runs versus lefties with ease. It was magical  years ago when he hit all those gametying and go ahead homers. Magical. But lets not kid ourselves. This isnt trading Gretzky in his prime.

Acquire a player or two through free agency.  Pray we get lucky and someone takes BJ off our hands for somewher between  and  of his salary if he regains any form at all. Maybe someone needs to check him for a concussion.We build around Freeman Simmons and Peraza and Bethancourt maybe.

I was a pitcher only in high school and I can assure you that if my mental game was off so was my performance. Another crucial aspect to this side of the game is simply the fact that more than just a few people need to be bought into the system. If your pitcher is but your fielders arent then all hell breaks loose. Its also a contagious thing. Think about a strikeout a player looks a a pitch that paints the corner for strike three comes back to the dugout throws their bat then pouts for the rest of the inning. Yes it is natural for anger to show when youre being payed so much and have thousands on thousands of fans supporting you but think about the rest of the team.

Just look at the almost no hitter  he limited walks to one had only four strikeouts and the defense made some stellar plays behind him.

He must likely goes to left field. He continues to be really fast.  Something happens to Garcia and Olivera goes back to third.  Swanson tears the shit out of the minors.  Tehran takes at least  no hitters into the th inning. We dont trade him.  Sometime before  starts we get our catcher. Probably via bullpen arms.  Jace thrives in the bottom of the order.  Freeman doesnt really have power behind him in the lineup but the hitters behind him are so solid he gets pitched to anyway. His essence combines with McGriff to form Super Saiyan Freddie.  Shea Simmons is really good. And the radio team does a good job of using his first name as much as possible make sure we dont cry.  Bud Norris accepts the fact that or young guys are so much better than him that every start he gets is a waste. He injures himself in a stupid season ending way.  Mallex starts the year in Atlanta. He steals  bases. uburmp will totally back me up on this.  Swanson comes up. With Albies almost here the only controversy is which one plays short and which one plays second. Aybar is a great mentor here.  Jenkins comes up. Hes really good.  Newcomb throws a no hitter. But its for Gwinnett.    ,Braves,cxvr0hz,5,t5_2s0ok

6649622,0,t1_d073yrd,I think we are too big on Swanson right now. Hes not an MLB talent yet. He hasnt really seen MLB talent sure he hit well in rookie ball last year but he was facing pitchers right out of high school. A college talent SHOULD be crushing rookie ball. The guy is a natural at SS but he wont get the call to the MLB until his bat is MLB ready. What we dont want is another Betancourt.,Braves,d074mxu,3,t5_2s0ok
6663568,0,t1_d08c34z,gt I agree with you I wish they would try for the extra year of control. But coppy confirmed this recently.If Coppy said anything that hinted towards were going to hold this guy down just to get the extra year of control in the media thats begging for a potential grievance especially with the Kris Bryant situation last year. The media narrative is always well bring em up when theyre ready whenever that is. And Id assume the Braves are already under additional scrutiny from MLBPA on that front after the clear rebuilding SimmonsMiller trades. Id take coppys media comments with a lionsized chunk of salt. Itll be far easier to make the keep them down longer argument with Blair and Mallex anyway Blair didnt spend that much time in AAA in Arizona and Mallexs AAA numbers were worse than his AAA numbers. ,Braves,d08kjdi,1,t5_2s0ok

6696499,0,t1_d0blnue,I think that we will give Banuelos every chance to earn that th spot. Teheran Wisler and Norris are obviously the most likely to start the season in the rotation. Then you have Folty Perez Banuelos Kendrick Weber and Chacin all fighting for those last two spots. Trying to predict who wins that battle is going to be pretty hard. Personally I would like to see ManBan and Folty win those jobs because they have the most value. By the end of the season I think you will see Norris out of the rotation and Blair replace him.

Power from the right side athletic Scouts are saying now he has better shot of being a MLB centerfielder than Rutherford which is something I dont think people here rooting for Rutherford understand and has played his best when against other top prospects outside of his league. I think he might be the only player the Braves would consider paying slot value for if hes there. Having said that Lewis has no leverage and no reason to not go to the majors ASAP.Edit I always say Mercer instead of Lewis.

7883432,0,t3_4nafom,I think there needs to be clarification when people discuss drafting for need. Usually when an individual says draft for need they mean the need of the major league club. That is always dumb. The need of your system overall should factor into the decision to an extent. You should always draft the best player available in the top  picks regardless of any type of need. The only time you dont take BPA is if you are attempting to sign somebody for an underslot deal in order to sign someone overslot later in the draft. As for the draft beginning today they need to take BPA that they feel they can get the best deal on. Groome is the best player in this draft but with his potential difficulty to sign and whispers of off the field red flags the Braves need to take Kyle Lewis if he is available. I know I have said on here a few times that I would prefer Moniak but I think signing Lewis gives you a boatload of potential and allows you to approach guys like Lowe Anderson Rutherford and Wentz and see if any of them would take an overslot deal at . Rutherford and Lowe are not likely but I could see the braves landing one of Anderson or Wentz. ,Braves,d4265lx,8,t5_2s0ok

8014067,0,t1_d4guf5d,Absolutely not and they didnt waste the prospects but they definitely overpaid in my opinion. Had they won the World Series the overpay would have been worth it I must say. I understand what youre saying if you look at it in a vacuum they overpaid. If you look at it in the larger scale they improved a team that went to the WS.  You can also argue though that they hurt their future teams. Al the arms they have right now will begin to get expensive soon and it looks as though Whalen is a guy who they could have slotted in behind this current rotation.  I think it is important to make the delineation between a bad trade and overpaying. By my definition the Mets overpaid for Kelly and Juan but the reward damn near outweighed the risk so it was certainly a understandable decision. ,Braves,d4gutf4,2,t5_2s0ok

8069928,0,t1_d4n3xej,This in particular isnt very complicated.  You can find Run Expectancy charts in various places online such as here  It will show you the expected amount of runs scored for every potential runnerout state.  So if you want to see the effect something like a bunt has you just have to compare the state before the bunt to the state after the bunt.So for example in tonights case the initial state is B B  and  outs.  This will result in on average . runs.  The state that would result from a successful bunt would be  B B and  out which will give an average of . runs.  So the change in run expectancy for a successful bunt would be ..  The second table on the site linked earlier shows the percentage chance of scoring at least  run which doesnt always follow the same pattern as it would for just raw run expectancy.  This is good to know when you are down by one or if the game is tied.  Given the same situation as before a successful bunt would result in an increase by . percentage points.  So if we werent down by two this would have actually made sense.Most of the time the raw run expectancy and one run probability charts are all you need but since I needed to know the odds of scoring at least two I used this site which breaks it down by the percentage chance for each run.You can also refer to Fangraphs explanation  Theyre explaining it in the context of the RE stat but its basically just an expansion on the same idea.,Braves,d4n4wyg,2,t5_2s0ok

8388325,0,t1_d5q32c0,I never played Im legally blind but research the game constantly. WAR is the tell all stat theres a reason its become the most main stream stat used even if it isnt  accurate. Hes a bad player literally below average him being the nd best batter doesnt mean hes good. Markakis isnt some special outlier either hes a below average hitter and a well below average fielder. Also asking me if I actually watch games and talk to me about a condensing tone lmfao. The true story is that he cant hit at even an average level and he cant field at even a replacement level thats the true story. Shockingly his WAR reflects just that. If youre going to say I dont understand his true value because I didnt play or understand the nuances of the game you can save it because thats a joke. You discount WAR and try to use RBI to back up his value as an individual lmao RBI is probably the absolute worst way to gauge an individual player.

Some friend of mine had a couple extra tickets that his dad won off the radio so our friend and I were sitting near the visitor bullpen while the other two were sitting a few rows behind the Braves dugout. So the guy I was with decided he wanted to go get food so he walked off and didnt see him for about  innings. During that time I learned the magic of the rally cap because the Braves were down  when Brian McCann hit a grand slam off Roy Halladay prompting me and everyone in attendance to lose their shit.Later on near the end of regulation play the two of us went over and sat with our friends behind the dugout. Not long after Chipper Jones hit the first of two walk off homers off the Phillies again prompting everyone to lose their shit.Honorable mention Chippers last game aka the NL Wild Card game aka the Infield Fly Game which I still to this day still angers me but I was never more proud of fellow Braves fans watching years of anger and bad misfortune released into the playing field.,Braves,d88m0bg,2,t5_2s0ok

He had no intent to stay and I have no intent to cheer for him as a result. Respect him for chasing the dollar but also dont feel like I should show loyalty for a player who has none himself.

The last  before this year his OPS was miserable. Bottom  amongst qualifieds for  straight years if I remember correctly. But either way the open market would look at his improvement and would pay him accordingly so maybe hes worth that.

9417598,1,t1_d99oruc,Well that may be true. But there have been a few studies that have suggested that being around a degree of Native American mascots does in fact negatively impact the selfesteem of Native Children. The ND example is apt but not quite the same. For one whIle the team name is Fighting Irish the logo and mascots are of a leprechaun a mythical creature not a caricature of an actual people. Also the state of Irish people vs the state of Native peoples in this country is very different. Fighting Irish used to be something of an ethnic slur  years ago when the Irish were pretty downtrodden. Now not so much. Native Americans however are still not treated on equal footing. I mean nobody here really the thinks that itd be appropriate to have a team called the Blacks that had a similar logo do they?

But with the rebuild openings in payroll new ballpark ahead and the way a major signing could affect team revenues in the Battery as well there are not many teams with as much incentive to roll out a M posting fee and THEN land him a big contract.

9472610,0,t1_d9go2hj,Tough to wrap my head around it completely. I mean were talking about green vs blue. But a few reasons off the top of my head. Green meets brick stucco landscaping wood steel etc. better than blue. An architectural aesthetic that just looks more timeless. . You can use team colors and not do this but I dont like it when venues look like they just threw team colors up everywhere. A great nonbaseball example is AMC vs McCamish. Google that before and after and youll see school color vomit vs neutral grey where school colors are the accents. Just classy as hell. Different sport obviously but I think thats where I got started with the neutral color thing. . Love the looks at Fenway Wrigley Camden SF Comerica and Target in particular and the only nongreen Im crazy about is PNC. But thats an iron focused gothic looking city with the best skyline in sports so those dark navy  almost black seats are fitting.

The only reason young players like Freddie Freeman make M is because the teams they play for lock them up to risky long terms deals before they become true stars plus Freddie is making over  for the next  seasons. The fact is .M is not a lot of money for a starting pitcher on a one year deal. That is middle to back end of the rotation kind of money. Established starting pitchers are just REALLY expensive and they get even more expensive when you only sign them to  year deals.

But the man won  straight Gold Gloves in Center and is what many would say the greatest defensive center fielder in the history of baseball.. Ozzie Smith is regarded as the best defensive SS in history. Andruw played the Captain of the OF better than anyone Ive seen in my lifetime.. I never played in the majors never even got close..
