6887739,0,t1_d0wohr8,Yeah I got the habit of maxing Q second since I can get higher slows and more health regen but yeah for me I find the movement speed pretty cool since she had  mobility when theres no one hurt so that helps me escape faster or even help my adc escape.Edit ive only played her  games on ranked this season and I have a  winrate  and all those losses we stomp lane adc gets fed rest of team feeds to an uncarriable level. Just FML,SorakaMains,d0x1j3z,1,t5_38phy
6902688,0,t3_49pr0g,Bruh. Max Q first and w second. Free elo. U can vs sometimes,SorakaMains,d0yqleo,1,t5_38phy
6918399,0,t1_d10ia0o,People were speculating about nerfs but if it heals ally with base number plus the overtime heal isnt it a buff? Also yesterday i realized that rejuvenation effect on allies include movement speed bonus as well.,SorakaMains,d10iv3f,1,t5_38phy
8130231,0,t3_4qlggn,Its pretty hard only because you have to not play the way youre supposed to. The biggest thing is not dying which is good but unfortunately youll have to ks a few. Youll want like  or  kills  deaths or less and  assist. Should get you an S.,SorakaMains,d4twt48,1,t5_38phy
8159091,0,t3_4qlggn,Oddly I found being quite aggressive in lane well when youre not vs like a Blitz gave me lots of Ss. I can link the games if you want! I sweep a lot and ward lots. Ill admit I accidentally take a kill or two I rush a Rylais because I am the worst but never intentionally. It is kinda funny watching someone die to the second part of e heehee,SorakaMains,d4xfnpf,1,t5_38phy
8882966,0,t1_d7fh7ko,I tried that once and it was the worst decision I ever made on her. I got my teammates killed a lot and messed up really badly when I used it.,SorakaMains,d7fluou,0,t5_38phy
9830903,0,t1_danylmn,Yup people seem to exaggerate as far as Executioners Calling is concerned. Early game disengaging is usually an option so the short  second timer can be waited out. Late game Execall alone wont be reliable enough. Unlike Mortal Reminder and Morello the base stats for Execall are pretty dull.Thats not to say that GW can be ignored though. Its still something that demands attention by a healer and needs to be played around.,SorakaMains,daozl2x,1,t5_38phy
9844705,0,t3_5garzy,Stay safe behind minions. If he grabs your adc put your E under blitz feet to stop the combo your Q to slow down him or the enemy adc and heal while your teammate runs. Lvl  is usually the worst part because sorakas W has a big cooldown but it gets better after. Dont worry about using SS or your ult to save your adcyourself blitzcrank is a early game support that needs to feed their teammates with kills or zone the enemy so his adc safely farms. If he cant do that he will be somewhat irrelevant midlate game because the tanks will bodyblock his hook in teamfights. Soraka on the other hand stay more relevant throughout the game.Now you just need to train that ,SorakaMains,daqsdqu,4,t5_38phy
10264281,0,t1_dc73xat,Your justification to max EgtQ has nothing to do with the scaling which you stated being a reason for. Ratios are usually and in this case are independent of ability rank. I guess you misunderstood that o.o?Edit oh I forgot that Q rejuv duration scaled with rank effectively but indirectly giving it an AP ratio boost. On another note dont you feel like its better maxing Q second just for the damage? It increases your DPS far more than E since Q cooldown is  and E starts at ?Edit  oh wait Im getting the people whom are arguing the respective points mixed up mb. IGNORE ME AAAAH,SorakaMains,dc7ig4a,1,t5_38phy
11062680,0,t3_5xtvb7,k and still bronze? Definitely a Soraka main.,SorakaMains,delxqb1,6,t5_38phy
11700593,0,t1_dgm9w0z,Lol... quoting is just convienent to specify what are you answering to...gt  Why I like equinox is its pretty much like tibbers instant aoe damage and cc. Only its not ult but a skill to use twice in a team fight.Oh yeah the support Soraka E damages so op.,SorakaMains,dgma4f8,0,t5_38phy
