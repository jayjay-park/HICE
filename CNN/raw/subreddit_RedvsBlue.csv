He cant do anything if we ignore him.ya because Omega is just a memory he doesnt even exist if they ignore himgtYes Church may have gotten help from the memories of Omega in the past. Church uses Omega when nessersary. At all other times he wants to ignore him.yes exactly what he does with all the other AIs there there when there needed and otherwise hes ignoring themgtYou know what else Omega probably is responsible for? That huge rant that he shouted at the guys in the holoroom. Thats probably why Omega isnt allowed to run alongside the rest of them.really? you think Church turning huge and RED was Omegas fault?gtEven when he did get help from Omega in jumping hosts he got a headache. Which implies that Church allowing Omega to help him caused problems.and the award for the weakest argument possible goes to!epsilon has been shown to have problems before when he taxes himself like when he flickered alot after diving deep to get yorks logs hes not supposed to be capable of jumping bodies yet he did you dont think that there may be a price for overexertion?gtHe appeared when Theta talked about bad dreams. Seeing how Omega was linked to Church getting angry Sigma appearing probably means he has something to do with the bad dreams. She may be dreaming about the time The Meta attacked her.probably they were talking about something and a picture of that something apeared they were basically inside churchs head during that conversationgtWhy are you so invested in this scenario youve come up with where everything is absolutely perfect?

4144783,0,t1_crrytjr,gtYou are wrong Dr. Grey is a medical doctor therefor she is a noncombatant. This is why she carries a medical scanner instead of a firearm. If she were to pick up a firearm she would abandon her status as a noncombatant.lol shes a military doctor that makes her a combatant as soon as someone starts taking care of soldiers they become a combatantgtAgain you have no proof of this. Both Kimbal and Doyal stated that Locus and Felix would be gone from their armies from time to time this would leave both armies without any way to scout the areas around their bases. That means that regular patrols something that would be beneath a mercenary of their calibre would be required.patrols? sure deep scouting missions? definently notunless the scientists set up labs within  a mile of a fed base they wouldnt be foundgtI said that the ships that were brought down were carrying billions of dollars worth of cargo. Not that Hargrove was spending trillions arming the armies.you presume billions of dollars standard issue stuff isnt that expensivegtThey have to realize where they are. They have to know where their ship is at all times. Do you think that there is one ship in the US Navy that the government or the Navy higher leadership doesnt know the location of? If a submarine or a frigate owned by the US Navy was supposed to be off the coast of India and it was actually in the South China Sea then investigations would be happening to find out why possibly ending with the captain of that ship being court martialed for stealing government property.assuming that something wasnt literally preventing them from finding out if the computer saying yup there off the coast of india and the pilot is saying yup were in india then tehyd have no way of knowing there actually in chinagtAgain you cant prove that any Space Pirates were onboard the ships before they crashed.no but it would fitgtThe investigations would also search all surrounding areas and any possible locations the ship could have ended up. ie. If a ship that is supposed to be at Pearl Harbor Hawaii is missing they would check Midway Island and possibly as far as Japan to find the missing boat.right but if a ship goes missing off the coast of hawaii there not going to search norway for itgtEven if it were possible for Hargrove to pull off redirecting the ships without anyone knowing he still has to do it somehow someone needs to be paid for that to happen. You cant just aim your remote control at the ship and make it suddenly veer  lightyears off course. Someone would noticeand since he already has highly trained professionals on salary why not jsut use them?gtEven space ships have windows. And navigators are trained to navigate without computers. Airline Pilots are trained to fly without using instruments and conversly they are also trained to fly on instruments alone. The more technology changes our lives the more we need to prepare for when that technology fails. And people that are assigned to navigate and pilot ships that travel between solar systems have to be trained to do so both utilizing the technology on hand and not utilizing that technology.no not possible space is too big for someone to be able to navigate by way of stars,RedvsBlue,crsq0c6,1,t5_2rofm

6457898,0,t1_czna5oo,. Alright cool.. You gotta remember that Maine had just gotten shot through the lung with a sniper round. Despite what hes gone through Im surprised he recovered long enough to fight toetotoe with one of the Insurrectionists and he only went down briefly might I add when Sleeves shot him in the throat. In contrast Ss confrontation between the two was so short not because Sigma was there but because Sleeves punch was pretty poorly telegraphed. Plus Maine had a hatred for the guy I doubt hes gonna lighten up the second time around. In regards to unhooking the car...what does falling and sinking have to do with that? Yes Maine was flailing around on the way down but he could have easily grabbed it and removed it.. Just because not many antagonist deaths have been retconned doesnt mean that antagonists deaths will never be retconned in the future. In the S clip though I...really dont see blood. And if there is then that means Sharkface managed to tank several bullets and not go down...why would he not survive the same thing in S if thats the case? And no I dont mean Sharkfaces armor has the plating. Its implied that his plating is cybernetic beneath his skin as it is discovered thanks to Epsilons Bioscan and the way Sharkface can shrug off physical pain.. How in the hell did  years pass between S and S when we last saw CTs body? And for that matter we dont even see the body at all S and S only show the helmet. Perhaps he got up and left or maybe someone came and retrieved the body and left the helmet? Who knows.,RedvsBlue,cznag81,1,t5_2rofm

6777446,0,t3_48irxl,I watched bits and pieces over the years started prior to youtube and was too cheap to buy the episodes directly from the RT. I watched a few in super low res when they would unlock a few for a weekmonth but if you missed a section you had to wait for it to roll around again and I missed to much to try and fill in. so I never saw more than the first three episodes plus a few bits here and there however the sarcophagus retrieval episode always stood out for meOver the past few days Ive been binge watching them on Netflix as well. Its been interesting to see a the transition the show has made over the past nearly  years in just a few days. Every season was an improvement over the last.Last ep spoiler so...Seems like for a while each season has had a big fight scene at the end and then a short epilogue. So When this one ended on Churchs monologue I was a bit surprised. I figured that they were preparing for the final fight and the epilogue would have been been them all getting a notification that church had left them a message. That said about half way through it I though If there was a point where they were going to end RbV that would have been perfect. especially fitting considering the last line in the monologue Theyll never know if the day was really saved. In the end they just have to have faith. Aint that a bitch. It lets you draw your own conclusions but steers you in the direction of success.spoiler,RedvsBlue,d0ki9r5,6,t5_2rofm

9514165,0,t3_5b1ubm,Sorry I didnt mean to make this response so long I was just trying to answer the question as specifically as I could because I think its a good question to ask but then it just got away from meThe thing about a lot of their retcons over the years is that theyve changed things to make them fit in with science fiction tropes especially ones that fit in with their universe as theyre designing it while the RvBverse is somewhat parallel to the Halo universe its still a very different place. Ghosts arent science fiction so they went the AI route. Time travel didnt really fit in with the story they were telling so they explained it away.Parasitic alien babies however fits at least for the most part. Its like a much more nonlethal version of facehugger babies from Alien. We can assume that the RvB universe equivalent of Sangheili are parasitic to some degree. That in and of itself is a retcon of Halo lore which RT is very fond of doing.The thing is its hard to change something that was explained so specifically. We know for a fact that Tucker had an alien baby grow inside of him and then get birthed. There was a whole story arc dedicated to it which makes it a lot more welldocumented than well Church got shot with a tank so hes a slightly transparent version of himself now. The most they could retcon it is like instead of him being physically impregnated he was implanted with eggs that were perhaps inseminated by an alien couple and then implanted in Tucker in their final days of incubation that then attached themselves to his insides and fed off of him to sustain the baby inside until it hatched.TLDR It doesnt necessarily need to be changed to make the circumstance more clear or to fit in with the story unlike ghost Church I cant really imagine a circumstance where theyd need to change it in order to make a plot or a twist work unlike the time travel and its something we witnessed directly over the course of a story arc that all of the characters not only saw but directly assessed unlike Pvt. Jimmy. They could retcon it if they wanted to but they dont need to because it already fits in with the story and the genre and unlike the more unexplained or deliberately confusing plot points like ghost Church and time travel it was welldocumented enough that it might be more confusing if they tried to explain it away.,RedvsBlue,d9ltntj,5,t5_2rofm
