Would... oh lets say a bunch of explosives forming a shaped charge around several material lenses designed to focus a shockwave onto a large mass of uranium... be able to work if it went off a millisecond after arriving?gt Its a breakdown over time. You could bring a laptop into the Void and it would work pretty fine for a day or so!Tell me about Jagganoth. Why does he wear the mask? If he took it off would he die?gt He made the mask in his own selfimage. You can see him making it actually in the scene where Mottoms talking about him. If he took it off hed be totally fine. He cannot die. Nothing can harm him thats kind of his deal.jagganoth sounds like a big guygt hes definitely a topIs there any punishment for a Geas knight that has abandoned their quest?gt The knights of Geas usually take their quests extremely seriously and its rare for any of them to abandon them completely though some do get sidetracked. Those few that do arent punished explicitly but they are expelled from the order and ostracized heavily.What If anything can you tell us about the corpse legion other than the fact that jagganoth served there? What exactly IS it?gt A brutal group of mercenaries that ceremonially but not actually kill themselves upon entering and hold a funeral. From that point onward for all intents and purposes they are considered a walking corpse physically and spiritually dead by both their comrades and employers. Their losses are not mourned and none of them fear the bite of steel. They are no paid since nobody need pay the dead but they are honored from time to time with gifts of food or small coins to pay their passage to the underworld.gt The corpse legion have no compunctions about slaughtering the living since they are no longer among them and cannot be held responsible for their actions. They are not attached to their bodies or notions of survival and will throw themselves at the enemy with  of their strength all the time. This makes them exceptional fighters.,killsixbilliondemons,d8j858v,1,t5_352se
