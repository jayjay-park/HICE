5438781,0,t1_cvdppor,I dont think there was ever a question of what commands you can use. Unless it polls resources using some sort of special token from the internet which you cant even do to my knowledge with pure batch youre fine.

5692920,0,t3_3t2t86,I cannot believe Id find the founder for TShock on the rCyberPatriot subreddit. That is so cool. Whenever a new update would come out my friends and I would hop on our TShock server and play for hours. A month ago I broke  hours. Thanks for that! Anyways this software looks absolutely amazing.

10336252,0,t1_dcfnr6n,Your responses seem to be very inappropriate for REDDIT. I find it funny how a stranger seems to find it  okay to tell another stranger the right way to do something as if doing something differently that what is seen as appropriate is wrong. How are you to assume if one is truly an adult or child and why should it matter? Its people like you who significantly depreciate the value of this amazing program.

10336570,0,t1_dcfoyht,Claiming that someone is wasting their coachs time and effort by choosing a particular life choice is neither instructive nor motivational. This is the same case with You cannot be successful anywhere if you speak the way you type.
