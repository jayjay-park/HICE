As long as Duke Johnson was there it didnt matter all that much. When you took him out of the equation they were a little bit like running on one leg.gtDefensively what surprises me is they are not very fast overall as a team. Its opposite of what youd expect of a Miami team based on their history.gtI just dont think they are extremely quick or fast on defense which youd think wouldnt be a problem.gtLinebacker Denzel Perryman looks the part. Good player.gtThe offensive line I thought was really really good  maybe the most talented in the league overall. They have a lot of depth there and should be good again.gtThey were just kind of surprisingly erratic on defense. The defensive line was just average.gtI thought Morris was sometimes a little too emotional as a quarterback. You cant be up and down. I dont know how to describe it. He was trying to make plays that arent there and wearing his feelings on his sleeve a little bit. I just thought there was some of that going on. He was talented. I dont know much about his replacement possibly Ryan Williams but they need someone who wont hurt them with bad throws.gtDuke Johnson is good enough to erase a lot of problems.

2422228,0,t1_cmaulbt,I still think it is unfair that  of those years he was basically in trouble for shit that he had no part in. Im not going to begrudge Golden for not doing great when his hands were tied behind his back. An unwillingness to accept that also hurts future chances. Again what coach would want to deal with a potential hey we might get the death penalty and a bunch of our best players are suspended for games... but you still need to well or we will fire you! That kind of culture doesnt really breed or attract excellence. Even if you disagree keeping Golden is necessary so that any potential future staff feels secure. I feel safe in saying that no coach worth his weight wants to jump straight into shit and then have the fans adminstration etc go why is all this shit here why is said shit slowing you down why did you shit so much! My bet is if we have a mediocre season next year he gets one last shot and if it is a losing he gets fired. That way administration can look to future coaches and if he performs with this consistent mediocrity can go well we gave him  years drama free and he didnt turn it around as opposed to we demand excellence right from the start no matter what we have done prior or what situation you start in. I would imagine the administration would value atleast appearing loyal and fair to a coach so that they can attract better talent in the future as opposed to being viewed as completely irrational and at the whims of the fanbase.And the whole winning record thing is a mind frame which leads to the SEC pretty much having candy puff schedules outside of themselves. Like if we had dropped Nebraska for FIU Florida State Louisville and Georgia Tech for Wake Forest North Carolina State and Syracause would you be happier? Cause in that scenario we would be most likely be  right now.As a fan I would rather have a tough schedule in which we do okay rather than a cake walk schedule in which we excel. If next season we end up playing the    and  team and walk away with  losses I would be unhappy but accepting.

Seems like early December when they said the BOT was meeting and nothing happen I sure was discussed but I think he has a enough supportpossible in part due to the buyout and then cost of hiring another staff with the school trying to raise money for Indoor Practice Field Facility after just putting up money for improvements for remodeling most of the Athletic Center and an Artificial Turf Field. So I think Miami is going to waiting a year and hope we have more success and if they do not I think they might be more willing to make a move then . Million less in buyout liabilities.
