Theres a discussion to be had over whether those women characters are uniformly harmful and how they impact the situation of real women the role of satire various things.But fundamental to all that is admitting that it is a COSTUME a CHARACTER about woman  not about transgender.The idea that someone might put on a costume of woman without actually having any Deep Deep Identity Feelz on the matter is threatening to people who have a deep need for Woman no quotes the fundamental essence of really being a woman to be about internalizing woman and thus need woman to be reserved for Woman counting themselves as part of the group.They need the dress and heels to be a shibboleth a sign to the outside world that they are Woman really deep in their feelz and thats all that matters.   Someone voluntarily wearing a costume as in drag performance OR a man who just likes to wear dresses for that matter gender nonconforming boys threaten that.  Someone might think the trans woman really is just a man in a dress after all. ,Gender_Critical,cjd4ef0,7,t5_32njv

Its a pretty epic misrepresentation that you think that all trans people are against this. If any of them are then I am strongly on your side and not theirs only on specific points that I agree with you on not your ideology as a whole. I would certainly disagree with you if you think that all children who transition are having it done to them and that its for the wrong reasons. I dont assume to know what their reasons are.

2553966,0,t3_2oykus,One of the comments reminds me a lot of my mentality between ages  trying to reconcile my opposition to female stereotypes with the trans narrative that feeling a certain way and playing with certain toys was more concrete evidence of their true sex than their chromosomes or genitals during which time I identified as genderqueer then a transman minus the thought that heterosexuality was a defining characteristic of ones sexgtI think of myself as a person. I dont know why from a very early age I didnt feel like a girl. Primarily my brain just doesnt like gender. I spent years asking people what makes someone a manwoman? What is masculinefeminine? I was totally onboard with throwing out gender altogether. But... I got better about trans rights. Ironically being genderqueer made me worse about trans rights for a long time. But in my defense I grew up during a time when transgender wasnt even a term I ever heard. I had trouble understanding how someone could feel like a woman and mtf and ftm seemed deeply rooted in wanting to be one or the other. To me being female meant precisely two things I might have the capacity to become pregnant and bear a child and being attracted to men. LGBT rights  not a big thing during my childhood. I got better. So I didnt understand being transgender because surgery wasnt good enough to change which gametes you made or to give people the ability to get pregnant and while I did understand it for people who were attracted to the sex they were identified with at birth I heard of transgender people who were attracted to the sex they werent born into... which made zero sense to me. But then I started talking to people mainly cis people and it turns out many of them do have some attachment to their gender. Many do feel like a woman or feel like a man. Its even a meaningful part of their identity. And I dont see why theyd lie about that. I have zero clue what it means to feel like a woman but I know that my friends who are women mainly do seem to do so. And I know that those who feel like a woman do not become uncomfortable when referred to as one. I figure there is some sense of gender some people have and I do not. But I dont think the lack harms me its just a difference.gtI know that when people were explaining mtf and ftm people to me I heard the question Well imagine if you woke up and suddenly were in a mans body... how would you feel about it? And my reaction was either Who cares? or Well my partner would no longer be attracted to me so that would be a mess but other than that... or maybe a bit of Well I might want to be able to get pregnant some day so losing that ability would be unfortunate but on the other hand not having a menstrual cycle would be awesome. Apparently not the expected reaction that makes the point about how significant it is to be seen as the man or woman that you are. Ive got a body and it is usually identified as a woman but that feels very arbitrary and unrelated to who I am. Ive always really felt more like my body was the home I lived in than that it was me. So putting so much importance on some physical details feels wrong. I just dont feel like Id be any less me or all that different if I had a penis and testicles. And I have gotten far enough in trans acceptance to understand that body parts do not define gender. So theres really nothing about me that pulls me to either gender. Nor do I know what would other than the societal norms that I dont think make sense anyway. splitting into two comments as it wont let me post due to length..,Gender_Critical,cmrxv7i,3,t5_32njv

It wasnt just that he was wearing a dress it was that he was fetishistically crossdressing.  I kind of compare it to Eddie Izzard who insists that his clothes arent womens clothes they are his clothes.Versus the man in question in this article who is specifically wearing womens clothes not because he likes the way they look but because they are womens clothes.

3008460,0,t1_co9l53g,gt Imagine a cis girl being forced to be raised as a boy. Being dressed like a boy treated like a boy praised like a boy going to school like a boy everything. For all intents and purposes this girl was socialized male. Does that mean theyre not a woman?Honest answer? More likely such a girl and her parents pretend shes a boy outside of the house so that she gains privileges particularly in education. This happens still today in parts of the world. Shes not exactly raised as a boy since family is in on it but on the street yeah judged to be a boy and so getting privileges. Some places its why shes able to LEAVE the house at all.But you know? It doesnt last forever because she will obviously mature into a woman form because her SEX is woman and thats what matters in all this and then the jig is up somewhere in the teens usually. At which point no more privileges hello more obvious oppression.The good part though is that the education already gained doesnt go away.Meanwhile if you have a boy raised as a boy in some more open place who then decides to get bodymods to appear as a woman as an adult his educational opportunities also stay with him. All the formative experiences of being raised to take risks being told he can do anything he wants all careers open to him all that stays and its cumulative and it has GOOD effects on his abilities. Even in  in quite modernized places a lot of girls dont get that theyre raised to be more timid and fearful and get unspoken messages that lots of things are offlimits are still mens jobs and whatever else. Not encouraged to build things not encouraged to explore told they dont have spatial abilities not allowed to do the fail and learn better for next time thing and of course the endless fear of rape from all the dark tales about so and so who either got raped or let her guard fail and taken advantage at a party or whatever tales it is or maybe is just a slut and so whos going to marry her now?Thing is though along with educational opportunities and encouragement often comes pressure and expectations. You can do X Y and Z so we expect you to put in effort toward those things and achieve. Lots of people feel they cant live up to those expectations and so come to resent their opportunities at the same time.Whatever side of the divide one is on though we cant just identify in and out of privilege.

I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed and can any man do more than that? I have heard much about the sexes being equal. I can carry as much as any man and can eat as much too if I can get it. I am as strong as any man that is now. As for intellect all I can say is if a woman have a pint and a man a quart  why cant she have her little pint full? You need not be afraid to give us our rights for fear we will take too much  for we cant take more than our pintll hold. The poor men seems to be all in confusion and dont know what to do. Why children if you have womans rights give it to her and you will feel better. You will have your own rights and they wont be so much trouble. I cant read but I can hear. I have heard the bible and have learned that Eve caused man to sin. Well if woman upset the world do give her a chance to set it right side up again. The Lady has spoken about Jesus how he never spurned woman from him and she was right. When Lazarus died Mary and Martha came to him with faith and love and besought him to raise their brother. And Jesus wept and Lazarus came forth. And how came Jesus into the world? Through God who created him and the woman who bore him. Man where was your part? But the women are coming up blessed be God and a few of the men are coming up with them. But man is in a tight place the poor slave is on him woman is coming on him he is surely between a hawk and a buzzard.,Gender_Critical,cs463gp,9,t5_32njv

A man who wears a dress and for this reason calls himself genderqueer or a woman is preserving a narrow definition of man as being a type of person that does not wear dresses.Interesting. So it is about broadening the the definition of man and woman through gender nonconforming behavior. But does personal identity play no part in expanding these definitions?

In PAIS or CAIS women aromatization means the testosterone they produce will be converted into estrogen and other developmental agents completely naturally if allowed to do so. But most often the testes are simply cut out at birth for convenience usually at the same time the doctors are giving the clitoris a nice trim without any say from the child  Despite the fact that they almost certainly wont cause trouble until theyre adults.

These are all really good relateable questions youre asking.Ahhh oh my god Ive never heard the term smart slacker but thats me as well! Its absolutely taboo isnt it? If youre a woman and smart at the very least you should pretend not to notice eh? The easiest way to trigger peoples insecurity and misogyny at the same time is to say I thought the test was pretty easy actually. Solidarity sister.Anyway first Im sorry you went through so many bad experiences. Though they are common for women each one is still a tragedy. Ok now I will tell you about myself.. I dont deal with gendered expectations set by men for the most part. Rather I present myself in such a way hairy mens clothing never worn makeup loud and obnoxious upon first meeting people that most men dont have gendered expectations of me. Saves time. When I met my husband I was highly gendernonconforming and not in a cute way. In addition to the above I barely bathed or washed my hair I was pretty depressed.. I am now able to engage  with my husband on radical feminist issues. I used to hold back a lot fearing I would go too far and he would think I was crazy so I actually stopped myself from reading any real feminist books. But then I had a major depressive episode and tried to kill myself I figured I didnt have anything to lose after that and went all the way. I gained more confidence ironically and told him hed better read the feminist books I was reading and he did. We always started from a place of mutual respect so thats why this change was even possible.. shrugs actions are more important than labels.. Both me and my husband were always grossedout by porn so it wasnt an issue. There are plenty of people who dont like it but the ones who cant live without porn dont want you to know . No I dont engage in PIV sex. I have before and I actually do enjoy it but the stress of worrying about pregnancy is too much. Im completely terrified of pregnancy. Husband knows that and would always try to talk me out of PIV but I kind of demanded it in the moment. Sex has always been  on my terms like nightmarehound. I dont like to be pushed around and I cant be made to do anything if it wasnt my idea.. Theres no degradation. I have a really dominating personality and I love conflict.Basically once you go all the way and live your beliefs you will alienate a LOT of people. You will find that the sort of men that want to degrade you will recognize its impossible with you and they will not even approach you to begin with. However I find that these days I have more friends than I can keep up with. I get along with women really well and though I dont go out of my way to make male friends the ones I do have are ones that respect women.

Theres no one experience all gay people have that all straightbi people dont have. Yet its okay for them to organize even without proving some sort of everygay experienceThis is tangential to your original point but I sort of just wanna throw it in. The thing about heterosexual privilege is its much more nuanced than not having to come out to your parents. Kind of like living as a female person in human society has more nuance than can be raped as the poster in the sub what is not be named seems to opine. Heterosexuality is just assumed and its part of why gays are so othered. Much like gender were inundated with heterosexuality from the time were young. Were told the expectations that every little boy will one day start liking girls and every little girl will one day start liking boys over and over. Hell boy meets girl is the basic template of the majority of childrens films. And homosexuality is still something hushed and taboo we cant bring up around kids because its perceived to be somehow more sexual than all the heterosexual imagery and assumptions we pile on them daily. So its no wonder a little boy that finds hes started to like boys or a little girl who finds shes started to like girls will feel alienated. Or like something is wrong with them. Especially when peers and authority figures tell them something is wrong with them. And often the only images theyve been given of homosexuality are depraved villainous or flamboyant stereotypes that dont line up with their reality. And our pals in the peanut gallery are much like the white guy who hears your hypothetical black American talk about how he frequently gets followed by employees in stores as just one example of the pervasive discrimination he faces day to day and says Hey man Ive gotten followed in a store before too! gtBut when no other group needs to prove that their category is constituted by a universal experience why should women?Because there are men who want to embody a narrow definition of women derived mostly from a male perspective and it upsets them if we do that. ,Gender_Critical,cxqt9hp,11,t5_32njv

6424464,0,t1_czjjyyw,gt There is a mostly transliberal argument that women eg. radical feminists might contribute to a culture of discrimination and that while its men who do the physical attacks women are contributing to the idea that trans people are a subclass and not to be respected or supportedThe idea that a man being called a man could be diminishing his humanity as this line of reasoning usually goes is hilarious. Its so incredible that so many feminists are going along with it as its a particularly insidious form of gaslighting considering it inherently undermines the basic premise of feminism being that men are of the dominant class and considered fully human while women are subordinatesubhuman. Everyone knows that GNC men are punished for their similarities to women as in women performing femininity with the status of a subordinate class under patriarchy. A boy learns early on that the worst insults are the ones calling him girly. That is because womangirl is the ultimate insult women are lesser that men. If men are human which I would imagine most men consider themselves to be naturally women who are less than that must be somewhat subhuman.If we really wanted to call transwomens humanity into question... wed refer to them as women. They do inadvertently have a point regarding transmen but not for the reasons they claim.

Other people are also socialized to not take them seriously regardless of their tone. Thinking people will just accept feminist points if you say them in a nice tone is wishful thinking. Its simple people whose interests are conflicted with yours wont help you achieve your interests no matter how nicely you ask because people at least men have an acute impulse to push back against anything they perceive might erode their status. Women have a similar impulse too conditioned by patriarchy but to not allow anyone erode mens social status which is of course counter to their interests which is why women have to be actively encouraged to stand up for themselves I dont know if you read it but Dworkins Right Wing Women explores this psychology some. If you wanna please people around yourself you will have to exhibit internalized misogyny aka femininity because this is what is considered the norm.

9238694,0,t1_d8mz064,Look asshole.I wrote what I remember of what Ive read.When Im wrong Im glad to have it cleared up. But I treat people pretty nicely in general and I expect the same in return.I am not a linguist and I still dont know what youre going on about. Either you have made some assumptions about what Im saying or youre bad at explaining things probably because you have to understand where a person is with a concept in order to correct or expand it and you dont seem to excelling at that preferring to eviscerate points Id never make. I dont know what noun case is. I know that when I learned Spanish and German we were taught what gender words had which as far as I know is typical. If theres something wrong with that you really should assume thats where us lay people are coming from because most of us arent linguists. Languages having masculinefeminineneutervegetableetc genders doesnt contradict anything I know or have said but you seem to think youve made a point there. Id be amazed if peoples impressions of objects or concepts is not colored by intuitive associations isnt that largely what poetry is playing with such associations and relationships etc? and Id be amazed if gendered associations did not color peoples interpretations of things. That would actually be really amazing. I would enjoy talking about that with people who arent dicks.I dont know what you think radical feminism is that we think gender as was defined in the second wave doesnt exist. The term was invented to describe sex roles and the cultural shit around them that naturalizes patriarchy. Its rather central to radical feminist theory. Watch the first link in the sidebar. This transgender identity stuff is an unrelated concept and you can assume that no radical feminist is using the word gender their way. I dont know what arguments youve had with other people what weird assumptions youre bringing into this but I dont think gendered nouns proves anything about transgender identity concepts. Theyre trying to retcon a historical basis to their disorder to grant it legitimacy and if you think youre going to make some kind of difference by defending noun case from them youre wasting your time. They dont give a shit about facts everyone already knows theyre full of shit and no one cares about your noun cases. You certainly arent going to get anywhere projecting their ideas onto me.You can count the number of radical feminists who are going to put up with you mansplaining radical feminism that you dont even understand the first thing about on no hands. Before you get pissy you might want to avoid embarrassing yourself by checking that you understand what is being said what words mean in the context first.

9304603,0,t1_d8vf91z,Nadia MD from the reader recommendedgtIt is sexual harassment and assault to say that a women or girl is bigoted or uptight for not wanting to change in front of a biological male. It doesnt matter if the biological male is gay or straight. He has no right to expose himself to other women and girls and he has no right to view them changing or showering. Women and girls have rights. And even if a woman is prudish she has the right to be. This is like when men say women are frigid for not wanting to have sex with them. Even if it is true women have the right to give and take away consent. End of story.gtAnd biological sex is not complicated. Over  of humans are strictly male or female. And those with intersex conditions mostly lean in one direction. Penises do not belong in female spaces.,Gender_Critical,d8vfc2r,35,t5_32njv

10359361,0,t1_dci3vqa,This is super super helpful. It seems that careful phrasing and asking the right questions will be the best way to argue from the radfem perspective. The cotton ceiling business is probably my peaktrans. A Ftt called me a bigot and transphobic in a forum two weeks ago because I said I wouldnt date a trans person. Im attracted to men. I was told that of course I could date a ftt because they are men. I said no I like PIV sex and its really important to me. I was told that there are substitutes for a penis. I find this to be truly outrageous. Ive used these substitutes when I was single and I refuse to accept the argument that its the same thing. I said I want to procreate with my partner and I was told theres something hateful about having a desire to procreate with my partner because we could be infertile and have to adopt anyways? After reading this subreddit it does seem to me that this concept disproportionately harms lesbians. As appalled as I was by the way this Ftt spoke to me like my disinterest in dating someone like them makes me hateful I cant imagine what its like to be a lesbian dealing with a mtt.

Also there are second wave feminists who never went completely left wing because we are gun  owners or held other conservative positions on SOME issues.  Maybe the Heritage Foundation sees a chance to win some older feminists votes on certain issues.Most of the lowbrow right wingers seem to think transpolicies are the punishment that dumb feminazis brought on ourselves and there is a certain sting of truth to that since rd wave faux feminism is pretty much in the bag for men in womanface.,Gender_Critical,dfmdzw0,3,t5_32njv
