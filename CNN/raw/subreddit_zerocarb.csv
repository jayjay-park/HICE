777539,0,t3_22zztg,From what I understand if you have healthy kidneys then fluid intake plays a much bigger role than protein or fat. As long as you keep your fluid intake high you should be fine but go ahead and have your doctor monitor your kidney function if youre worried always better safe than sorry!.Its true that excess protein in the diet converts to glucose which is why even on regular keto people keep their protein intake in check. The only difference between this diet and regular keto is in the name we keep our carb intake to a bare minimum most or all of it coming from animal sources such as egg whites dairy or offal. Some of us also enjoy seasonings with our food which does add a small amount of carbs to the diet but we keep it to a minimum.I have a moderate to high protein intake with an average of  of my calories being from fat. I have no trouble staying in ketosis ,zerocarb,cgsns8z,2,t5_2s4q6

9871066,0,t3_5goq5w,ZC has definitely helped with my tendency to binge. Before ZC I would binge eat like you wouldnt believe and I even went through a phase where I would purge after I binged. That was definitely my lowest point. These days I know there are certain nonoptimal ZC foods that can confuse my hunger signals and cause me to binge but its nothing like when I would binge on carbs. I dont make myself sick Ive never considered purging. If youre sticking to just meat and water your cravings will go away and so will the temptation to binge. ,zerocarb,dau81gb,5,t5_2s4q6

I usually only get my calcium from bone broth. But after research I realized that the FDA uses scare tactics with calcium like they do with iodine in respect to dosage. I use calcium tablets just for the third trimester since the requirement is higher and the baby will strip from your bones if its not provided adequately in diet and I dont eat leafyhighcalcium veggies and dont do bone broth every day so it works for me right now.

10830224,0,t3_5uub48,I was an obese vegan. I weighed  lbs at my highest. Becoming ZC changed my life and was a large part of why I was able to drop down to  lbs and still losing  well I will be when I recover from surgery lol.I didnt have a vegan childhood I was a vegan for  years as an adult so my experience will be very different.I had to do some mental gymnastics to find peace with eating meat. But heres what it boiled down to for me  I dont begrudge the lion or the snake for eating other animals. They are obligate carnivores unable to thrive without eating meat. Realistically so am I. At  lbs I was dying not thriving. Eating plants was killing me. Eating meat saved my life. I am an obligate carnivore. And thats okay.The choice to be vegan for me was predicated upon the idea that I didnt need to eat animal products to survive. So killingharming animals was done because I wanna basically. That for me was not a good enough reason. But the truth was I DO need to eat meat to survivethrive. And that makes it okay for me. Also and this will sound weird but I rarely or never have any gas and I poop a LOT less. Why? Because my body can use virtually everything in meat. My body was made to break meat down absorb it and derive nutrition from it. Plants have a ton of fiber. Know what fiber is? Its a substance I cannot digest. Massive colonies of bacteria in my gut are tasked with dealing with fiber because my body has no ability to do a darn thing with it. The bacteria give off gas as it deals with the fiber and large quantities of poo result because fiber isnt food. Its a substance you cant even digest! Meat is food thats why my body can easily use it.As far as soft foods... Hmmm.Ground beef isnt bad for chewing and adding small amounts of it to other foods at first will help.Quiche is great I think. You can add small chunks of meat ham bacon chicken beef  anything you want really and its still a pretty soft food.You may want to try making your own chicken salad if youre okay eating some mayo. If you chop the chicken and then whirl it up in a food processor it will be a very soft texture.,zerocarb,ddx27v0,18,t5_2s4q6

When I last looked at how much to take it was quite hard to actually overdose on it. Taking it along with vitamin K is optimal helps direct calcium to where its needed  either absorbed thanks to the D or mobilised from where it shouldnt have been.
