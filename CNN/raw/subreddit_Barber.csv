10597140,0,t3_5rodhj,The cool thing about the slim lines is they run the lithium ion battery. Which is more powerful and it holds the charge a lot longer. The detailers are also a good clipper. Those are my go tos! Its really comes down to preference. I like corded because I always feel like Im losing power as the clipper dies down on cordless. ,Barber,dd90hw5,2,t5_2w333

11243392,0,t3_60g15u,Andis Profoil. Its a great tool and from what Ive heard the foils hold up better than the Wahl  stars. It also has a lithium battery so you will get more use with less charging. ,Barber,df6f75t,5,t5_2w333
