5388699,0,t1_cvzp396,Your points are valid but Id say we do all that. We save over k a month which is a lot given our incomes versus the cost of rentbillsfood we rarely drink or eat out and always buy sensibly for food and the like. Its all very well to urge more and more saving but the point is that your outgoings versus income are already huge and we have good chunky salaries  i.e. we should have enough but everything is just too expensive. But I take your point. I think its crazy that at my age with my income I have to consider a second job or something like that.

If you can get by on public transport sell the car or transfer the lease.Also everything is subjective depending on how much you owe on the credit cards and what your payments for student loans are.Maybe you could be fine for a year and a half.
