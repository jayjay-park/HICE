666592,0,t1_cgg0wut,Yeah I completely understand that. The thing is that giveaways here and on pokemongiveaways are completely different. When on pokemongiveaways you are usually receiving a pokemon with good IVs probably around . However when here you are receiving a shiny pokemon most likely with the same  IVs that is given out on pokemongiveaways. What I am trying to say is that you are giving away something much more valuable here which is why I do not like when it is a requirement to add the giveaway host before posting especially when I am not near my DS. I completely get where youre coming from though.,SVExchange,cgg1h2l,1,t5_2z47n

667356,0,t1_cgg102h,gt You may not have seen someone deny an egg to someone for never hatching an egg request beforebut I have. It does happen. I denied someone today. They had three posts in their entire history. One was two posts on the same giveaway asking for a nearperfect Eevee giveaway which was given to them the third post was asking for the pokemon in my giveaway which matched the TSV. I asked for proof of their TSV which I thought reasonable because I thought it was pretty shady behavior. All they did was just create a TSV thread and link me to it. So no I did not give them their egg. However I did give eggs to multiple people who had only a day or two old TSV threads no hatches to their names. This because hey why would you pick a random four digit number make a thread and then stalk and hope? Sure you can do it but... what if someone asks you to hatch an egg? I dont think its necessary to go power mad and demand everyone have a TSV thread but I do feel it is necessary to just make sure youre giving eggs to legitimate people. ,SVExchange,cgg4lqr,2,t5_2z47n

792120,0,t1_cgu7zi3,I would like to point out that using a powersaver to check your pokemons stats is no hacking and is just as legitimate as KeyBV and I find it much safer actually. All the powersaver does is save your game data to your computer this puts the data in a format that KeySav can analyze it and then spit out the data in a form that you can read. Nothing about the game is altered in anyway. Its like saying that a German book translated to English with a digital translator is not as legitimate as someone who does it by hand. Honestly the most legit way to check your pokemon IVs is to take them to the battle institute and then punch their stats into an IV calculator. KeyBV is still using the game code to tell you your pokemons stats just like KeySav does.,SVExchange,cgubgbf,2,t5_2z47n

966989,0,t3_256gkm,I personally do  egg batches. I just have nonTSV matches participate from the getgo but I think  days is a good amount for match only stuff. It allows a decent amount of time for TSV matches to see the thread but still is relevant when you make it a free for all. As for what to do I only breed pokemon that I find will have a purpose all of my giveaways are leftovers from my personal projects. If I dont feel the pokemon is good enough for me than I dont give it out everything has at least  IVs a nice ball competitive nature and good egg moves. I am by no means elitist but if Im going to dedicate a good weeks worth of work of breeding and giving out eggs Im going to make sure the pokemon Im giving are damn good.

1877561,0,t1_ckf9z1l,I understand your point. Im not really taking into account new users for ORAS because to be honest I dont know and we dont know if what what we are doing here will even still work. It is possible for nintendo to block us from KeySAV and KeyBV. That being said they could block us at anytime with a patch to XY if they really wanted to. I guess its just a  chance at this point. I also no longer want to use the format of people commenting on a giveaway thread. It creates a lot of stress especially when dealing with awful users. Its easier for me to check  eggs save the  matches out the batch and contact the users myself. Then I can immediately delete the leftover egg and have my box space back. It makes me feel more in control and I dont feel overwhelmed by  comments just for  eggs. Ive been using my system the last few weeks and I absolutely enjoy it more than a giveaway thread. Im just asking for people to give their information here so Im not just randomly messaging a user without them having the knowledge that I may message them in the future. I know that in a few months that some users will not be around which if they do get a match I can go right to their reddit profile and see the last time they were active on reddit and the sub. I will be checking last activity and TSV threads for unattended hatches if the user no longer partakes anymore I will remove them from my list. It is a lot of work but I enjoy doing it I having nothing else to do all day as Im unemployed. Also if this is against the rules in any way tell me and Ill take it down Ive read the rules and didnt find anything about doing this.,SVExchange,ckfftoe,1,t5_2z47n

Granted the HA is not ideal on this one but I had it in the box ready to go. Just thought I would at least offer something with solid IVs. Oh also they are useful because they can learn all of the egg moves so breeding any egg move in the field group gets easy. Enjoy! Thanks again.,SVExchange,ckmj4xd,1,t5_2z47n

2161228,0,t3_2jpzjc,Are there detailed instructions that we can review for each category? For instance in the Egg category I put my user name name down as the user since I was the one hatching the egg. Is this incorrect?  If it is incorrect how do I undo it or change the input information? The computer did not tell me I committed error by putting my user name in the slot.Second I dont see a place for evolution assistance. If we traded with someone to evolve their pokemon does that go in the casual trade category? If so what do you put in the give and get blanks? Also these trades occurred in the pokemon giveaway forum and not on the trading board. Thanks.,SVExchange,cleji1z,1,t5_2z47n

2247274,0,t1_clph5yi,. It is a valid argument you are not everyone else on the subreddit. Neither you nor I could speak for them. I am going by what people are saying in my comments on my reference threads and FAPP. If you dont believe me go read them.. That was your single giveaway. My  giveaways are mine not yours. You cannot tell me how to run them.. Dont participate is not a rule its a statement to you and you alone. If you dont like how I am running my giveaway Im not going to change something that works for me and everyone else who read through my post just so you can participate.More rules does not mean better giveaways. Refined rules means better giveaways. I will not give someone an egg if they do not want to help people. I will not give someone an egg if they disrespect me. I tried to be a better person by giving you one. I now see that it was a mistake.Again I hope you enjoy that Pumpkaboo. I should have withheld it since you have been disrespectful. I am absolutely open to suggestions but not when they are to step back and go revert to letting everyone run me. These are my giveaways. These are my rules.You are singlehandedly the only person who has ever come to me and actually had a problem with how I run my giveaways. Heres a haiku for you.You are such a jerkFor being disrespectfulSo kindly back off.Thanks.,SVExchange,clphcbv,2,t5_2z47n

3068134,0,t3_2vamjc,I agree that they are getting annoying. I sent a message to the mods about this on Friday. Ill just post the message here because it sums up my feelings and opinions.gt Hey Mods hows it going? Good I hope.Im not entirely sure how to put this so Ill just say it flatly. I think reminder posts on giveaways should be banned. I think that this sub is fantastic and the users are all really nice so I know nobody is trying to do anything nefarious by reminding anyone that they have a giveaway going on but I find that it clutters my feed.gt I would say that i am an active user of this sub and I check each giveaway as they are posted usually within a few hours to see if I have any matches. Usually I dont and I move on. I am aware of the giveaways that are taking place and dont need reminders telling me that there is a giveaway where I dont have any matches.gt Normally I dont care but lately it has been quite ridiculous. In the last four hours there have been  new giveaways  FFA post and  reminder posts for old giveaways that I dont care about. If anyone has any matches in their threads that are older I think they can find them with a quick search in the Reddit search bar its what I do. Im sorry if I come across as just some random cranky person but as community leaders I thought I would share my opinions with you. Who knows maybe others are feeling the same way I am.,SVExchange,cog0bdk,2,t5_2z47n

3118852,0,t3_2vurj9,For me I have two threads and three TSVs. The reason I dont have a thread for my third TSV is because I dont have OPowersFlame Body on it so hatching eggs takes an age and most people dont prehatch unless specifically asked to. This train of thought applies to more people than just me and as such when doing giveaways of my own if someone has active threads and claims a TSV egg that is by my standards a good egg I will check the threads before I give them anything. If their threads are inactive and I check them because its a good egg I wont give it to them. If the egg is pretty average or good but not great they can have it. First in first served. People dont often claim those kinds of eggs unless theyre fairly confident on the shiny hatch so if theyre offering to take them off my hands I dont mind,SVExchange,col9oaq,3,t5_2z47n

4744230,0,t3_3fwckz,Giveaways arent usually designed. What happens is that someone starts collecting competitive eggs because they personally want the shiny that will come out of it. Once they have a substantial number of eggs they will check the ESVs and either hatch the one that matches them If there is one or theyll get a hatcher here to hatch the best one.After this is done all the excess is placed in a giveaway. This means that honestly barely anyone starts breeding eggs with the sole intent of making a giveaway its more a way of getting rid of excess stock and making people happy in the process.,SVExchange,ctsjzoc,2,t5_2z47n

5032486,0,t1_cusl9rc,I think its great that people are doing these giveaways but they should at least breed for IVs first. IV parents are not hard to come by these days. That particular giveaway would have been immensely better if he had even used iv parents with imperfect spreads. He would have an easier time getting rid of the eggs at the end of it too.  In fact I would give someone IV breedjects for free if they would do a giveaway with them.,SVExchange,cusltgy,0,t5_2z47n

5033150,0,t1_cusoaot,for the absol would it be okay if I gave you one like this mild Justified F dream ball x?  It has  EMs.  When you stock the eggs for the giveaway I think you should breed it first so the missing IV is in special defense. Its better that way since the only attack Mega Absol can comfortably take is a nonSTAB knock off. Thus I run a naive nature and the defense should be perfect. Sorry but my only ones that have the right IV spread I am saving for trading as perfect breeds.,SVExchange,cusop75,1,t5_2z47n

Since you already know your TSV  you just need to find a Zorua egg that has a ESV value of . You can breed your own Zoruas check the ESVs of the eggs and then hatch the egg with a shiny value that matches your own. Or just find the egg with the perfect stats and find someone on this sub or elsewhere with the TSV that matches the ESV of that particular egg. ukrishyabishIve explained it above!

6828860,0,t1_d0qch8r,So the way shiny hatching works is that every trainer has a shiny value or TSV. Whenever an egg is created it is given a random egg shiny value or ESV from . If a trainer hatches an egg with the same ESV as their TSV it will hatch shiny.If you dont know what your TSV is you should try hitting up some of the daily checking threads. If your shiny value is NOT  your Charmander will not hatch shiny,SVExchange,d0qcnwa,1,t5_2z47n

It stops every two minutes and has once caused me to accidentally lose someones shiny riolu during a trade. They were able to get my egg but I didnt get their riolu If we are going to trade while Im in college I need you to send me a junk Pokemon in return for the egg in case the wifi causes me to lose your Pokemon. Otherwise the only good wifi connection I have is back home and I can only go home on Thursday nights and during the weekends. Ill try to find better wifi spots outside my college campus in the future to make this less inconvenient.

8981747,0,t1_d7rftd4,Im guessing youre using MenuHax then. Unfortunately that problem occurs as a result of the exploit MenuHax for newer firmwares works. You will need to find another exploit and then uninstall MenuHax afterwards.Remember that if you plan to avoid updating the exploit you choose only needs to be compatible up through .. so some of the ones that arent compatible with the latest firmware are still an option for you. You also have the option of using secondary exploits rather than just primary ones since you will presumably have MenuHax installed and remove it only after youve gotten another one working.,SVExchange,d7rgvpt,1,t5_2z47n

I figured Id put this out there since Ive had the same complaints about Bank not storing eggs.  this particular utility has been quite nice for my egg storing needs as well as for storing all the IV things with egg moves I catch on my Dexnav shiny hunts.  if you want or need anything else from me regarding Homebrew or just about any other questions relative to the DS or Pokemon in general feel free to ask and Ill see if I cant help you out.

10260005,0,t3_5mtv8k,Detailed instructions for those who might have problems like I did  These instructions are for homebrew launcher   Install Homebrew launcher if you dont have cfw. gt  Follow all the steps that website provides you to properly install it.   After installing homebrew launcher make sure to run the ctr program once. Assuming that goes well continue with these instructions.   Go here  and download the file that says PKSV.zip to a folder on your computer. wherever you want but not the SD card yet.   Unzip PKSV.zip into the same folder you just saved it in so that it creates a nonzipped version.   Plug your SD card into your computers card reader and open it.   Copy or drag the unzipped PKSV folder into the root of your SD card then put your SD card back into your ds. Launch homebrew launcher.   Press B when the main homebrew launcher comes up.   Find the PKSV folder and press A on it.   Press A on the folder named ds.   Press A on the folder named PKSV.   Press A on the application with a white pokeball on a blue background labled PKSV.   Select your pokemon game and press A.   Let it run once and then repeat the process to select the copy of your game again.  And this is how you make instructions for people new at this.  ,SVExchange,dc71052,6,t5_2z47n
