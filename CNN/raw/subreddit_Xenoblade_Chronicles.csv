994332,0,t1_chg9hgo,I like the plot focus. Ive been unable to find a full playthrough where the player actually expresses reactions during the cutscenes which viewers like when theyre trying to get the story out of it I guess.

1414461,0,t1_citfdf6,The Wii to Wii U system transfer is the irreversible process I think youre referring to strips all the info off your Wii. However moving Wii save data is in most cases no problem. You absolutely can move your Xenoblade save back and forth between consoles with an SD card.

2060665,0,t3_2ib8nj, Mechonis Fallen Arm? Probably best not to think about it too much.  through  are something Ive been thinking about today. Im not sure and Id love to get my Wii working and play through again so take this with a grain of salt.Klaus now Zanza used Alvis to create the world. Ive finally come to think Alvis is not entirely without agency. Its interesting that Alvis cant seem to function without an operator but can choose his operator.Thats part of Zanzas downfall of course. He created new operators and he thought through the Monado he had made them deterministically. I think this is what gave Alvis the opportunity to choose new operators.Of course Zanza likewise had his difficulties.Zanza and Meyneth are effectively blind spots for each other. For the most part anything that happens each knows ahead of time. In fact because Meyneth prefers such a passive role with her utter distaste for the whole system Zanza can understandably mistake his knowledge for perfect. I suspect Zanza himself was surprised by Meyneths actions over the course of the story. This is I think what happens when you have two otherwise omniscient forces at work in one system.I still need to think it through but that allseeing capacity...Well heres where things get interesting. Much of Tetsuya Takahashis work plays with concepts from Gnostic Christianity. The very term Monado probably derives from monad which Im only beginning to understand. For example Ive not yet read through how the Gnostics played with the Greek concept of the monad. More obviously the character Sofia of Nisan led a rebellion against the Deus in the game Xenogears and in Xenoblade Chronicles the city of Alcamoth is named after Achamoth the Lower Sophia which I dont remotely understand. Looks like doctoral thesis stuff to me. Ill ask the wife about it.But the upshot is this. He thinks hes a god. Hes proud hes haughty and at one point he gets this notion to make intelligent beings out of lonesome boredom.Then he decides theyre done and its time to kill them.But what actually empowers him proves his undoing as it chooses instead to empower his creations... Its very Gnostic really. Not even sure what a plane of existence would be in this setting so I cant begin to answer that question. Shulk? I kind of assumed they began resuscitation. Hed been alive for a long time after dying. Looks like it became a habit. This honestly chalks up to about the same thing as him getting his own Monado his own godhood. His steadfast refusal to stay dead is probably just the first clear manifestation of such. No clue.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,cl1r7br,1,t5_2vcc3

2550432,0,t3_2oxmo1,The core group involved in creating Xenogears eventually left Square to form Monolith Soft.Xenosaga and Xenogears have similarities in overarching story archetype concepts etc. although Xenosaga diverged from this throughout its development.  Basically Xenogears didnt get to be all it could have been as a game or as a series because of budget issues and more cultclassic rather than mainstream success.  Xenosaga was their second attempt at it but the names were changed to protect the innocent as it were  Square still owned the rights to all things Xenogears so they had to make it slightly different enough to not get sued.  Saga also ended up with budget issues it like Xenogears was envisioned as  games but ended up being .Both Saga and Gears were more classic cutsceneheavy turnbased JRPGs.  Xenoblade was a completely new style in terms of gameplay and storytelling even if it did share similar themes albeit not as deeply explored.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,cmrh92b,13,t5_2vcc3

I think that Nopon though are like Moogles they transcend the games and are just a recurring race.If we are right about Mira then this would likely be in the future and the belief of Gods may have returned. History repeats so to say.On the other hand in Xenoblade we know that Klaus destroyed the universe and only him and Meyneth survived. Which means the Earth in XBCX is either a new Earth in Shulks new universe or it really isnt connected at all. Although the ending in XBC does suggest that the people of Bionis will move to other worlds. So maybe it could be a new Earth in Shulks new world.sThe other thing that suggests its tied to XBC somehow is them showing Shulk or Zanzas in the reveal trailer.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,cog9sm6,1,t5_2vcc3

3481881,0,t1_cpowqu9,Ive never run the numbers. I just think it looks silly to have one of my party members running around naked. Doing the math right now though...The best light armor in the game with buffs from lightweight expert provides a little over  defense. Dunbans body of steel further reduces damage by . If Dunban is level  with max agility up gems and fighting Final Marcus a level  unique monster he has about a  dodge rate and can expect to take about  damage from an autoattack.If he is wearing no armor and has agility up gems on his weapon his Inner Peace skill provides enough of a boost to give him a  dodge rate against the same enemy. And only because  is the cap. His agility is high enough that it would be . On the off chance he does get hit hell take about  damage closer to  without body of steel.Wearing glory armor the best medium armor which is so much better than the next best its not even funny is interesting. Its light enough that with his Natural Born Warrior skill he can still reach his maximum normal agility. With Sharlas middleweight expert skill linked his defense hits . With max agility up gems he maintains the  dodge rate and takes about  damage on a hit. Most other medium armor is heavy enough that his dodge rate falls.And thats probably way more than you wanted to read on the subject.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,cpp5rhh,2,t5_2vcc3
3484689,0,t3_305x7y,Im fairly sure its Shulk because at some point in the game he mentions the fact that the Creation story is taught to Homs as children so he definitely knows it.

Complete any and all quests with a clock icon before moving on. This is because they will not be available end game.

4004556,0,t3_36bxn6,Xenoblades story is far less complex and mindblowing than Xenogears but that doesnt mean its bad especially considering how bland JRPGs of this generation have been. If you like exploring in DA then youll like that from Xenoblade because the world is massive and its rewarding to just explore the place. Youre right about how Xenogears felt like a generic JRPG until after meeting Ramsus and then things REALLY kicked up a notch  of the way through Disc  and the same can be said about Xenoblade in the sense that you need to get maybe  hours in before the story REALLY pulls you in with patience I guarantee it will. Xenogears had layers of depth with The Elridge The Miang Factor and Feis Dissociative Identity Disorders just to name a few but that was also due to the fact that there was an entire universe of lore put together by Takahashi that existed in the game but was never explained in a comprehensive manner considering the game was created as episode  in a series of  games. Remember how confused you were playing Xenogears and how as soon as one of your questions was answered even more popped up? Xenoblade doesnt have that which can be a good thing considering it makes it more inviting to play at the beginning. The opening cutscene in Xenoblade makes total sense right from the getgo unlike XG lol and the game progresses in a meaningful manner where questions are answered but you arent left confused throughout  of the game. Also the end of Xenogears Disc  was a disappointment gameplaywise but the end of Xenoblade is far more satisfying. Xenoblade in a way is a love letter to fans of the golden age of JRPGs so if you enjoyed Squaresofts earlier titles then this game is the game to play. ,Xenoblade_Chronicles,crcr0wl,2,t5_2vcc3
4009587,0,t3_36eita,The main issue with something like this is that it depends so much on where in the game youre talking about and going for an overall loses some of that finer detail. For example Melia is really solid mid to lategame arguably the best character due to her fantastic support and damage output but shes really bad when she first joins and doesnt really get good until over midway through the game. And Shulk goes from being really good to okay to good to badish to great between the earlymid mid midlate late and postgame respectively. Its very odd.I would maybe focus on either postgame where comparisons are easiest or else average characters over the entire game which is harder to compare fairly but also gives an overall more accurate picture.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,crdbnm1,2,t5_2vcc3

4931496,0,t1_cug4vke,To reach the Mechons base Galahad Fortress the party first descends the Bionis right arm  Valak Mountain. Alvis joins as a guide and takes them to Ose Tower halfway down where Shulk and his family discovered the Monado  years ago.Further down the mountain Fioras face Mechon Nemesis Face shows up to speak peacefully with Shulk. Before she has the chance to speak however Metal Face attacks and pins her down he apparently really hates Fiora. Metal Faces operator opens his Mechon and steps out to reveal  Mumkhar. Dunbans friend and war buddy who supposedly died at the Battle of Sword Valley. Mumkhar reveals hes always been jealous of Dunban because while Dunban was crippled by the Monado eventually Dunban was the one who got to wield the Monado and play hero. Mumkhar was always spiteful that Dunban was so much better than him.Dunban and Mumkhar have an epic sword fight which results in an avalanche and the battle is interrupted by the golden face Yaldabaoth piloted by the leader of the Mechon making its debut and taking both Mumkhar and Fiora back to Galahad Fortress.The party of   Alvis continue onwards to the Bionis wrist where they get onto the Mechonis sword still lodged in the belly of the Bionis thousands of years after the battle between the Bionis and the Mechonis. Here Dickson shows up with supplies and returns to the Bionis with Alvis while the party of  push ahead to Sword Valley. In Sword Valley the party encounters Mumkhar again and have one final battle with him. The battles end when Shulk suddenly turns on Dunban and stops him from dealing the finishing blow.This is a huge point of contention for some fans  why on earth would Shulk protect Mumkhar? Ive always seen it like this  Shulk and Dunban were both close friends with Mumkhar theres certainly a lot of unexplained history there. Furthermore Fiora is clearly brainwashed so is it not possible that Mumkhar is as well? For all we know Mumkhar is innocent. Dunban agrees and stands down and as the party is about to head to the entrance of Galahad Fortress Mumkhar launches one last attack which misses smacks into a part of the fortress which then falls off and impales Mumkhar sending him falling to the endless ocean below.The party proceeds into Galahad Fortress where they try to reason with Fiora and snap her back to her senses. It doesnt work and they end up falling to the basement of the fortress where Yaldabaoth is waiting. Yaldabaoth unleashes a mysterious wave called Apocrypha which disables the Monado and takes complete control of Nemesis Face so even if Fiora snapped out of it she wouldnt be able to do anything. The party fights against Yaldabaoth and defend against Nemesis Face despite the lack of a functioning Monado while Galahad Fortress collapses around them its pretty awesome to watch the walls collapse midfight. Eventually Fiora is able to temporarily regain control of Nemesis Face and attacks Yaldabaoth only to be majorly damaged in the process. Yaldabaoth flees Nemesis Face falls out of the fortress to the ocean below and Shulk WILLINGLY JUMPS AFTER HER TO WHAT WILL PROBABLY BE HIS DEATH. Meanwhile the fortress explodes and everybody falls.Shulk awakens on a beach and sees Nemesis Face nearby. He makes his way over to it and pulls Fiora out and brings her back to life with a kiss of life Shulk Do you remember me? My names Shul Fiora I dont believe it  my first kiss!. The two spend some time catching up and snuggling together while they both recover. Fiora talks about how she was always conscious of what was going on but she wasnt in control of her now largely mechanical body  somebody else is inside her controlling her. Whoever this somebody is Fiora believes them to be benevolent and wants to help them. Shulk and Fiora then set out to find the others.Meanwhile Reyn and Sharla wake up near each other in a little lakeish thing. Reyn reveals to Sharla that hes been feeling inadequate because he was supposed to protect Shulk he promised Fiora a few hours before the Mechon attack that hed protect Shulk and hes tried to hold himself to that to make up for not being able to save her but Shulk has gotten so much stronger during the journey that the roles have reversed and Shulk is protecting Reyn. Sharla does what she can to cheer him up and they set out to find Shulk and the others. They come across Shulk and Fiora surrounded by Mechon while the Monado is still down. Shulk is able to force the Monado to work but it strains him greatly. Reyn and Sharla provide backup while Fiora rests shes still not used to her body and it took some bad damage in the fall. At the end of the battle a very heartwarming reunion ensues Reyn Im not here to protect you Shulk anymore. Sharla But you are here for something. Reyn Yeah what I did just there. No matter how strong you get you aint got eyes on the back of your head. So you keep looking forward cause Ive got your back.. The new party of  advances onwards and runs into... something.We then cut to Dunban Melia and Riki who are searching for the others. Riki suddenly demands to stop and take a break but instead of taking a break Riki goes fishing and cooks some fish for everybody I havent talked about Riki much but hes pretty much the comic relief without being annoying  he appears to be selfish likely due to his trying to pay back his massive debts but as we see here he has a strong soft side to him likely due to the fact that hes  and has  children. Meanwhile Melia is sleeping and Dunban calls out Riki for trying to be thoughtful and help out Melia. Riki and Dunban then have a discussion about watching over family Riki accidentally calls Dunban Fioras father but catches himself immediately. In the morning they advance onwards to what appears to be a village nearby.In this village they reunite with the others finally completing our party of  Shulk Reyn Sharla Dunban Melia Riki FioraSeven. Dunban nearly cries and it is the most adorable thing to see him so happy to see Fiora again. We are also introduced to the Machina the true people of Mechonis. It turns out that the Mechon are but weapons created by the Machina not the actual creatures of Mechonis. With the exception of two Machina all living Machina live here in the Hidden Village. They harbor no illwill towards the people of Bionis though one of the two that dont live in the Hidden Village the pilot of Yaldabaoth is bitter about the battle between Bionis and Mechonis  years ago the game doesnt specify  but we know its around then. We meet Linada the Machina medic who offers to repair Fiora and Miqol the chief of the Machina. The Machina have ridiculous lifespans living for thousands of years to the point that most of the Machina in the Hidden Village were alive during the battle between Bionis and Mechonis including Miqols son Egil pilot of Yaldabaoth. Miqol requests that the party kills Egil to put an end to the conflict that has raged on for so long. Shulk is hesitant but a surprise visit from Dickson who is close friends with the Machina and trades information about whats going on on Bionis for technology assures Shulk that everything will be alright. Dickson returns to the Bionis to join in an allied forced of the High Entia Nopon and Homs led by Melias brother Kallian whom Melia left in charge while she assisted Shulk in his journey.Were pretty plot dense in this section which covered from the  mark to the  mark so Im already running out of space.

Enemies as a whole felt more difficult to kill with fights taking longer and pulling multiple enemies at once even ones  levels lower than you was a bad idea. Lack of dedicated healershealer skills. Personal thing I know a lot of people like it without healer skillscharacters. QTE events in combat press B prompt felt much faster and more difficult to get used to than XBCs. Having two seperate weapons equipped ranged  melee felt odd being able to transition between ranges based on the situation. This pretty much killed off any sense of role in the party and turned combat into a giant DPS clusterfuck. Again this is pretty personal. No Visions Combo attacks or Talent Arts.

5323399,0,t3_3ndczk,As JRPG combat systems go the one used in Xenoblade is actually really straightforward  Your party is either in combat mode or out of it.  While in combat mode you can have one enemy set as your target at a time.  If youre close enough to your target your character will automatically perform a basic physical attack.  You can use special attacks by selecting them from the command bar at the bottom of the screen. Once you use a special attack you have to wait for it to cool down before using it again.Xenoblade expands on this system in ways that add more depth over the courseo of the game and X does so as well but the basic interface and concepts remain pretty simple. Most of the game strategy revolves around intelligent use of your special attacks.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,cvs4jx6,1,t5_2vcc3

5827950,0,t1_cxjj5wv,How much are you willing to pay? You have to look at this from Nintendos perspective. There is the set cost of what it would take to impliment a DLC situation where someone could download these audio files allow them to be selectable within game and change the coding for every audio file in the entire game to reference either english OR japanese. And then you have to get this out to be available in a reasonable amount of time close to release otherwise the more time that passes the more potential sales you lose. All of those things take money. Wanting speed and considering how much audio there is in this game I can imagine that would be pretty expensive. Even if you had several people working for a couple of months on this that might still cost at least  grand in productivity resources salaries and the loss of these people on other projects. Or less people working for longer on this. Even if it costs  thats  people that need to buy this for them to break even.another  or so for it to be considered worth the trouble. If XCX sold  copies in the US you would need about  of players who bought the game to be interested enough to spend  in a few months on just audio.Unless Monolith programmed this game to allow for easily changing the coding for something like audio files this is a tall order.Lets just be realistic here  a petition wont change this.

Its not the traditional trial and error dying over and over difficulty either. Its the vastness of the world and depth of classes. Choosing a class to level first took me over an hour of looking through the arts and skills. As far as fights go nothing seems too hard yet   but most jrpgs tend to be like that until near the end.

They didnt even aggro me so I may have gotten lucky. if they do just keep sprinting and you should make it.This game isnt like an mmo where they funnel you from quest to quest and area to area fighting mobs of your level. As soon as you leave the gates you need to learn how to avoid aggressive high level monsters as they roam around at random and often like that particular quest you wil be forced to learn how to get past them without fighting.

6044154,0,t3_3y9czm,People here are going out of there way to defend the really shitty charcater development in XCX. If you want well written fleshed out characters XCX is the worst example of that. In fact the game is intentionally very light on character development to keep the players focus on the big ass world and the exploration aspect of it. Be who you want to be go where you want to be was the motto when this game was conceived. None of the characters are memorable in the same way as the characters in XC or in Xenogears or in Xenosaga. In fact the worst  offender is the fuckwit silent protagonist who has nothing more but retarded facial expressions to express his dead personality. Better or worse yet the only way he is ever pulled into conversation is by forcing some sort of a one word conversationaction choice on the player... Thats it sadly.This is a great game buy it for exploration and the beautiful world the crazy enemies and giant robots but beyond that the games story characters and its mythology is paperthin.Also before buying this game I heard a lot about these affinity side quests and how they flesh out characters. Bullshit. Affinity missions offer nothing more than fetch quests and beatemup objectives with forced themes thrown in.

6090618,0,t1_cyhvrhh,Its a bit of a step up from XBC where you could optimize chain attacks to either kill everything effectively instantly requires good RNG or lock them in toppledaze for so long that you can almost immediately chain attack again. If theres one thing the series can improve on and I havent played the preXBC titles so I dont know if this applies its having a wider variety of encounters that dont boil down to equip the correct equipment and then either one shot it with a skell superweapon or sustain through it with ghost walkerinfinite overdrive.Shoutouts to the Seidr in that one cave in Cauldros you know the one that kited me into the water the one time I tried to seriously fight him. Shoutouts to the second Boze affinity mission which was a cool idea even as badly implemented as it was party members have some serious tunnel vision. Shoutouts to Atriedes and Gesserith for managing to give two gigantic sand worms a sense of personality. Shoutouts to the Zu Pharg although the devs missed an opportunity when they chose to despawn all the local wildlife during that battle IMO. Maybe there was a technical issue? Need more fights like those and less fights like Buchwald the Superweapon Check Guardian. Regenerating boss is a neat idea but phase two of the final boss did it so much better. While its kind of cool to have a weapon you can optimize to oneshot things I dont think having a boss thats designed to only be killable by massive burst damage was the best idea. Unless theres a gimmick to that fight I couldnt figure out that stops him from regenerating? I tried Dispel but it didnt help.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,cyhxuih,5,t5_2vcc3

6095876,0,t3_3z0j0i,I run a really good support build. Max out your G. Knight then go the Mastermind route with P. Launchers in place of raygun and abuse the hell out of Jetstream. Stellar Ray is great for racking up OD counter. As for Knife abilities I roll with smooth recovery energy source absorber skin or repair slit edge just for the sake of having a melee art with low cooldown screamer and secondary speed acquired from hopes affinity mission. Secondary Accelerator and Tactical analyst is a must for this build. Try using weapons with TP gain on hitarts. With this build never use any of your abilities before secondarytetiary bar is filled unless it doesnt reuse on secondarytetiary cooldown. You can spam abilities nonstop with this build and can effectively heal with smooth recovery every  to  seconds and pump your party full of TP. You can also permastunsleep by just going back and forth between jetstream and screamer. Just make sure you switch weapons between each auto attack to maximize TP generation. Increased Max TP is useless for this build so dont bother with it. Having high TP does no good since you wont use more than  at once and it will come back faster than you can spend it. Focus on potential or secondary cooldown reduc. If your secondary cooldown is fast enough your potential wont even matter. If your secondary isnt fast enough you might need potential to compensate.If you learn to OD correctly you can pretty much make your entire party invincible unless the enemy can deal enough damage to shot you. Im thinking of trying this build with Dual Guns in place of P. Launcher. Ill lose out on Jetstream but gain Ghostfactory as well as Zero Zero which gets twice as many hits as Stellar.Update Just tested what I put in the last part and it is OP. Zero Zero really racks up the counter when used after a green art. Once you get to max slit edge into zero zero for tp along with screamer and you have more than enough to keep spamming ghost factory energy source and secondary speed.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,cyije6k,2,t5_2vcc3

6267297,0,t3_41ethk,Commando is kinda an awkward one to switch into without having mastered a weapon first for exactly the reason you just said. It shouldnt be too bad after gaining a few class levels but itll be rough at first. I would recommend either mastering Psycorrupter and Mastermind and then take Knife over to Commando  that way you can keep a weapon which it sounds like you dont dislike and have a pretty much full art pallet for a bit as you learn new arts.If that doesnt take your fancy I would recommend going for Striker instead. You get to keep your three Assault Rifle arts from Drifter and its a relatively easier class line to get used to so you should be able to kill stuff more quickly more easily. You can still use the skills you learned from Enforcer and Psycorrupter so you have some advantage from that and youll also build your art pallet up to  again relatively quickly.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,cz20sx9,2,t5_2vcc3

6307059,0,t1_cz5wevp,Spanish has the particularity that it is spoken as a primary languaje over a really large area each zone and country with their own dialect local variation. So chilean spanish where im from is different from the spanish speaked in per bolivia and argentina our neighbours. The core itself is the same but the way things are said are totally different.Add to that that there are two big variations in spanish called Tuteo and Voseo meaning that You are ChrissMH can be translated as Tu eres ChrissMH or Vos sois ChrissMH.This tends to be the biggest point of argue between LatAm and Spain because here the voseo is used only in argentina uruguay and spain while the other  countries use tuteo. The problem is mostly that it feels weird to us because the spain translations and VO use ALL their slang and dialect words while the LatAm translations use a neutral spanish called international spanish to try to accomodate most people.I hope this helps if you have any more questions ask away,Xenoblade_Chronicles,cz6ji5i,2,t5_2vcc3

You need your dual guns to be Ether so you dont break appendages with Zero Zero or autoattacks unintentionally and thus putting to waste the Appendage Crusher augment Ether based builds tend to run. That being said Ether Blossom Dance build is not mandatory to be able to take hundreds of RP from an Yggdralith. I currently use a gravity longsword switching between topplelock a build with which I can take around  RP from it on my own and evasion around  RP with this one. Of course theres people with Ether based builds not Blossom Dance mandatory that can take thousands of RP from it but they usually do solo runs because teammates may break appendages that they need intact to maximize their damage.

The Lailah has a very defensive overdrive and I cant think of any equip able armor set that would be of much use to a thermal diskbomb build. The reason Im asking in the first place is to try and figure out if there is some reason to use the Lailah over the Mastema. All I can think of is the Lailahs very user friendly OD the extra  GP and the fact that the Mastema is dogbutt ugly.

If you feel the same get your level  Skell put a GBuster or EScythe on it load up on a few mechanoid slayer augments and head out to the island south of Jair Fortress in Oblivia. Theres a few level something Qmoevas around the island you can take out without drawing aggro from other enemies. Take one out exit your Skell use the return to Skell command in the menu to reload and it will respawn. Rinse and repeat until youre the level you want.Do not do this if youre enjoying your game the way it is. It will become boring hella fast.

Even if you choose to do it on foot here is a tip  Bring Phoenix Wings on your Skell. Really.   or  after level down.  Check missions there might be some when you only need to talk to someone also optimize your probe layout remember the points of interest they can make a big difference and leave the game running.Alternatively augments are cheaper than new equips and can do wonders depending on your build.

6666125,0,t3_46y7ns,Level  with a good infinite Overdrive build will get you through. My avatar Elma and Lin were  and my fourth was . I managed with four level  Skells as well. For me the most important thing was having high TP capacity. I kept those high through a couple Skills and an augment I had around  TP. Using a basic Duelist build I was able to maintain infinite Overdrive. I do believe it is possible to create an Overdrive build with Fullmetal Jaguar or Galactic Knight as well so once you play around and get that working Id say youre ready to tackle the final battle.Edit If you happen to have Duelist leveled you can check my account history for my build. Its not too far back. You dont need Duelist maxed just have a few levels on it.There will be a few stages to the final boss. Be very very careful with your Skells in the last two stages as there is an attack called Apocalypse Roar that the boss can do that will drain you of all your fuel. If you are careful and eject from your Skell and tell your party members to do the same when you see that its about to use it you can keep them in the game longer which helps. I chipped away at the bosss health with the Skells bit by bit switching between that and ground combat then finished up with a good infinite Overdrive run.Note I didnt put spoiler tags on the previous paragraph because I think its pretty vague.

She just isnt lead protagonist material and doesnt interact well with most of the cast but in the main story and the affinity quests related to her she is effectively the protagonist.

First off Javelin is centered entirely around electric so Id suggest buying an electric javelin from the shop since it goes best w the arts Javelin gets. The three  Javelin arts you get from Partisan eagle RaijinArcing HornSpiral Horn are all great and Id suggest them on any Javelin build. Raijins reflect isnt important at this point in the game it is later on but its abilty to heal you for using arts makes it worth keeping around. It also increases crit chance which goes well w the Sniper Rifle arts youre probably using. Arcing Horn amp Spiral horn have a trait that boosts damage in melee combos. This doesnt only refer to using these arts after another orange art but also after any art tied to the Javelin. For instance both Raijin gt Arcing Horn and Spiral Horn gt Arcing Horn boost arcing horns damage. The conductive strike skill from Astral Crusader also pairs well w a Javelins electric damage. Id suggest using Sidewinder from astral crusader to inflict debuff resistance down to make it easier to inflict shockfatiguestunelectric resistance down all of which are useful debuffs you might use w Javelin. Another tip on to using Javelin would be to combo from a miscellaneous Javelin art into Arcing Horn into Spiral Horn to take full advantage of Arcing Horns electric resistance down effect. Once you level up more classes youll have more freedom w your build because youll be able to pair different weapons together and use other skills. ,Xenoblade_Chronicles,d282x8x,3,t5_2vcc3

7475941,0,t3_4hn7tm,Hes bad but isnt quite as bad as everyone makes him out to be. True the food jokes are pretty terrible and repetitive but those are mostly Lins fault. Blame jerk Linly not the dorkpon.Actually Its not either fictional characters fault. Blame the writers! In chapter six he was a damn idiot but he just wanted to bring everyone snacks to be nice so at least had good intentions. His desire to share food seems like a likeable trait and one part regarding this later on in the game almost made me like him. But...Hes still a really unlikable character. He wasnt written well and has practically no redeeming qualities. He insults others a lot probably not even realizing hes doing so. If he does realize it then thats worse. Hes a selfcentered coward who rarely if ever lends a hand in anything unless it involves making food that he gets to eat. Actually I think if he was left out of the game entirely the story wouldnt have been altered aside from preventing a conflict in Chapter  so his only contribution to the game was his comic relief which for the most part failed.L was much better as comic relief imo Tatsu could have and should have been handled much better by the writers for sure. Perhaps they will do better in the sequel and then we will all come to love the dancing turnip.A lot of charactersnpcs in the game bully him probably because they look down on Nopon in generalliterally and dorkyass Tatsu in particular comes across as an easy target. Other Nopon tease him for the same reason. Hes bullybait the little token wimpy nerd. And he isnt even a smart nerd...One thing in Tatsus favor His one true redeeming quality is that he grants us use of the majestic follow ball. This was most generous. Very helpful. Lifechanging.

8025051,0,t3_4ot56x,One thing I will add here is dont be afraid to explore.  The only penalty for dying while on foot is that youll go back to the last landmark you were at and discovering new regionslandmarks as well as planting probes are some of the best ways to get experience while also getting to see how huge the world is.  The game isnt quite a sandbox but you should definitely not be afraid to explore try out different classes for your character etc.On the note of different classes a couple things that werent immediately obvious to me when I played.  When you pull up the class tree you start at drifter and then you can switch to a new class at class rank  which is different from your character level so just keep track of your class level so you know when to switch.  You can only rank up one class to  and you wont get anything new for that class after that point so you should go ahead and switch.  Each of the three branches you can take have a different ranged and melee weapon class with different arts to go along with each.  Each of those three splits again into two paths with the top having the same two weapons as the base class and the bottom having a totally different set of weapons and arts which puts you at  different pairs of weapons and arts total.  What the game doesnt tell you is that after you max out a class tree reach rank  in one of the classes on the far right of the tree you can use the weapons for that class regardless of what class you are.  So if you really like the dual swordsdual guns weapons you can then switch to a different class to get its benefits while still using your preferred weapons.  You can also mix and match weapons from different classes if you like for example I use a longsword as my melee weapon but a sniper rifle as my ranged weapon.Basically just dont be afraid to just try things out and see what the game lets you do.  The last thing that I will warn you about is that enemy size matters a lot.  A level  enemy thats the size of a school bus is going to be significantly harder to fight than a level  enemy thats the same size as you and may even be close to impossible to fight unless youre at least  levels higher than it so make sure you pay attention to the physical size of an enemy as well as its level.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,d4i3abg,1,t5_2vcc3

I have yet to figure out how to switch the colors of my grounded gear Ive been told that you can do that not sure if its true tho.  I havent found Elmas nd affinity mission yet this late in the game.  I havent explored the argument mechanics yet and my miranium storage is   I assume it should be higher.  I cant find all these heart to heart places I could only find some with Phog and Im stuck at the number .   hours back in the game I didnt knew I couldshould give skells to my party yet Elma just broke it twice.

8184608,0,t3_4rf4yr,   I believe you receive resources from your probes every  minutes of active gameplay. So if you just leave the game on and go AFK you wont get anything unless you get creative. So once you put probes in and keep playing normally you should start to accumulate miranium credits and other resources without having to do anything special.   I dont think theres a way to get it back but there are plenty of similar items to find in chests and from defeating enemies and you can buy them in the shop as well.

8232482,0,t3_4s5cao,.... nope I honestly dont. At least not a direct sequel  another game set on Mira explaining more of the world would be interesting for me but so much of my enjoyment of the game was tied to the circumstances of playing it and the way our Cross ended up interacting with the world. I mean the only thing that could really satisfy me would be a fullon Mass Effect treatment and lol not even Mass Effect did the whole continuitydriven sequel thing that well and even then Im not a  if the magic could be captured. Id much rather they go for some kind of a tangentiallyrelated thing if they didnt just outright do a third thematic sequel. After all the ending to XBC was plenty vague as well.I would pay in blood and body parts for a good expansion pack  plot DLC for XCX though. I dont usually like plotDLC but considering just how expansive the game is anyway and how much I love this cast I would be willing to shell out quite a lot of money for it.EDIT I should add that as far as the gameplay goes XCX actually felt super good to me already and if a sequel were to happen I wouldnt have any problems with them just copying the system wholehog and adding more customisation options maybe more exploration options why cant you climb things??? and better integrate ground and skell combat make it more viable to have a mixed team and all sorts of other personal quibbles. Just as with XBC I cant actually find a whole lot of things in the gameplay department they need to fix just in the plot.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,d56m70h,4,t5_2vcc3

Ive always been a fan of desert levels and this is probably my favorite desert in any game period. Ive spent literal hours just running around the place soaking up the atmosphere and all the little nooks and crannies Sylvalum. Even though it was a huge pain in the ass for me to traverse the place during my first playthrough Ill never forget the first time nighttime dropped along with my jaw. So pretty Primordia. The music in this game plays like  into how I rank my favorites x An awesome introduction to the game with plenty of neat locations and crazy geography and the way everything opened up after getting the flight module I first experienced with Primordia. Noctilum. This areas one of my favorites to actually explore because of how much variety is on the continent... but UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME the flute actually drives me nuts x Forgive me pa for I have sinned Cauldros. The only area in the game that legitimately annoys me.

8507527,0,t3_4w8169, Noctilum sure I was annoyed by the design initially and spent an entire day looking for  item for not even an important quest but the pure adventure and diversity of this places landscape is just too good. Oblivia I dont really know what makes Oblivia so cool. It might be chapter  I dunno. I also like the ancient structures and the theme is honestly underrated. Primordia Maybe its just nostalgia kicking in already and it hasnt been a year since I started playing the game but I like Primordia. It has some diversity and its pretty simple while being interesting at the same time. Sylvalum at night is really cool but during the day its really bland. And the whole place is just one valley of sand Im not even entirely sure what they were going for. Cauldros I expected this place to be a lot better considering its the enemy base and when I first heard the theme before getting the game it was my favorite but its kind of disappointing which might be why I say its last even if I might like it more than another but my disappointment clouds my judgement. Its very cramped and adventuring is almost impossible because there are too many enemies frankly. Still my favorite area themes though.

9405451,0,t3_598aid,Personally I cant say I prefer either dub more. For me  being from Alberta I hear lots of North American accents as well as European. For me European always makes me think of fantasy. The original felt like a game that invoked a lot more fantasy into it in the traditional sense. More of a focus on different gods and mystical blades not to mention all the mythological references which being someone who LOVES mythology I really appreciated. The original really felt like a fantastical story to me personally which I adored more than any human being should ever enjoy a piece of art. X didnt really use fantasy to craft its narrative but was more a tale of survival dealing more about the human spirit. It felt like a more real story just set in a different world. No crazy swords or self obsessed deities. So it felt better to me that X had a more varied in terms of accents and drawls cast. Honestly I cant say I love one more than the other because I truly believe they both nail what it is they are going for. It reminds me of the story of how the movie Shrek was made. Myers originally did a Midwestern accent than changed it to Scottish midway through as his mother read him bedtime stories in a Scottish accent. Watching scenes with the Midwest accent feels wrong to me. In the same breath the original with a more varied cast would lose the fantasy for me as would X feel somewhat lost if it wasnt so varied.

Simply you want just map.pkh in the root SKE folder. Looking back at my files the corresponding pkh files are in langgtengt and then compressed in static.arc. That is the part I forgot again it has been awhile since I did all this myself but if you extract static.arc there will be all your pkh files.Edit You need UMii to extract arc files.

10351619,0,t3_5o6so8,Maybe level a bit before taking him on. You are very near the cut off point of Fallen ArmMechonis area timed quests and not too far off from the cut off point of the timed quests of other areas either so now might be a good time to look into doing them.Some tips for the battlegear You might want to focus more on Ether Defence than Physical Defence against Gadolt cause his Ether arts are very nasty. Level up Shulks Monada Shield Speed and Armour if you have it already and save using his Monado Arts only to counter Gadolts arts Shield for white arts Speed for red arts and Armour for blue arts. Take care of his minions first cause them using LockOn on you can rob you of your chance to use chain attack on Gadolt. Always aim to toppledaze him during the fight. Use combination of Shulk Reyn Dunban and Fiora as your party. Shulk has the useful Monado Arts Fiora has two daze moves and ReynDunban can be used to topple him. Remember that toppledaze effects stack so use all of them whenever possible. If some of his Ether blue arts are problematic you can save your chain attack and use it to disrupt him from using them by dazing him during it. Remember that positional attacks and ciritical hits are the way to gain party gauge Dunbans Heat Haze and multiattack arts are a good way to fill up the gauge quickly. If you are worried about healing maybe share skills that heal your party after chain attack with your party members.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,dchezwo,6,t5_2vcc3

Lazy or. Felt entitled and thus didntAnd decided to bitch about how its the games fault you didnt learn how to play pfft.Give me a break.

While I did run around for a bit and consult the map I eventually just gave up and tried jumping up there instead. That feeling when I finally made it half an hour later was amazing.Similarly the first time I entered Noctilum was on a pollen night. I just stood there for a good few minutes stunned by the beauty of all the glowy little pollen in the air the lush forest and the huge flying things.While Ive previously criticised Xenoblade X for many things Ive never played a game that was quite so beautiful quite so amazing to explore.

10806032,0,t1_ddujm2u,No worries its a complex game. There are class skills that boost TP as well and most infinite overdrive builds make use of the Commando class line using arts that rely on twin swords Blood Sacrifice for TP and everything else for positional damage and twin guns more TP gain and survivability thanks to complete evasiondecoy.Dual swords also allow you to use Shadowrunner which hides you from enemies for several seconds at a time. This is actually a huge boon since it allows you to pass through particular areas without fighting whether it be because you are too weak to fight the enemies or just want to save time by skipping them.That all cuts into what makes Galactic Knights unique though and too much reliance on other weapons defeats the purpose of using those arts anyway. Galactic Knights are great support for other party members and being able to force topple is not to be underestimated but as a GK you can also benefit from a TP battery in the party whose role is to share TP. Some party members with certain Knife Arts e.g. Energy Source make a nice compliment.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,dduke4q,2,t5_2vcc3

10873435,0,t1_de1giob,I mean there definitely are many cases where localization has overstepped its bounds both in video games and elsewhere.  But I dont think actual editingcutting is necessarily inherently wrong.  For instance the West has much harsher views on pedophilia than Japan.  Scenes involving the sexualization of younger characters can viewed as completely harmless or even amusing there but come off as insanely creepy and disturbing here.  Much as it may seem counterintuitive heavily changing or cutting parts of scenes like that actually preserves the original intent of the scene within the work as a whole which was not to shock and disgust viewers.  For those familiar with Japanese cultural or whatever culture the work was originally for this will appear like baseless tampering.  But the whole point of localizing the thing in the first place is to make it understandable for people who dont know the culture.Localization is a constant balancing act between preserving intent and preserving details.  Sometimes people make the wrong call but sometimes there isnt a single right call so I think its important we recognize localization as the subjective process that it is.  And for those that dislike any tampering with the original work that version is generally still available though import fees can be pretty brutal and regionlocking is sometimes still an issue.,Xenoblade_Chronicles,de1in0x,7,t5_2vcc3
