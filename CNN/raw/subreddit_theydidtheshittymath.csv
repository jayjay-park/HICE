11261227,0,t3_60m3fc,I counted them falling for about  seconds although to be honest I didnt bother to actually look at the time in the video because Im extremely lazy and day drinking.Assuming Middle Earth has the same gravity as our Earth acceleration due to gravity of .ms squared we can figure this out.  Im on mobile so cant show equations very well but I did the math assuming a human body has a terminal velocity of ms googled it.  I arrived at a depth of roughly  meters  assuming they really were falling for s.  This is not accounting for he terminal velocity of a balrog which would likely be significantly lower than a human due to its large size and the resulting effects of drag. Also I did not have a precise value for time. Im making a guess based on the above conclusions.  Im gonna say we are looking at a real depth of about m or about ft. Edit they were actually falling for  seconds.  This gives a new value of m.  Lets reduce it by a purely arbitrary  to account for the Balrogs lower terminal velocity.  We now get  m or  ft.,theydidtheshittymath,df8fz1y,6,t5_31lpg
