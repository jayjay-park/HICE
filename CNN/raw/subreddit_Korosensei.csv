3459513,0,t3_2zs5o5,gt he does well to characterize them his best with the time he hasSeriously though. Like Okano is my favorite character and she STILL hasnt gotten an official introduction. And in fact she doesnt even need one anymore. Matsuisensei is very good at showing rather than telling  thats why out of the thirty or so students only a few have chapters dedicated entirely to them.,Korosensei,cpmlz2n,3,t5_32ou1

4054739,0,t1_crid2sl,Haha compared to Tokyo Ghoul S I think the manga adaptation for AC is beyond phenomenal. They actually adapt the manga closely and stick to the main branch of the story. They also managed to do the lighthearted atmosphere really well and holy shit...the art style is one of my favourites. Its so crisp clear and colourful. Even if some symbolism and side plots are left out the anime is still a  for me. ,Korosensei,crigymq,5,t5_32ou1

4516784,0,t3_3cxykj,If he only wanted to die he could easily commit suicide. At the same time we cant say he doesnt want to die because if he wanted to survive he wouldnt expose himself to assassination attempts all day.My guess is that he does want to be killed but he also wants to teach his students. He teaches them how to kill him so they can learn from their attempts.I dont think he would let the Earth be destroyed though. If time runs out and he still hasnt been killed he might kill himself or fly off into deep space.,Korosensei,cszzgld,4,t5_32ou1
