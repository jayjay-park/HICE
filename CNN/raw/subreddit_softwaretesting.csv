Then again Im extremely happy with them while I was always annoyed with Selenium.  Either way I bookmarked your blog.

2931854,0,t3_2tny3o,Interesting. . . as the speaker mentioned there are some hard truths in this video but I think the core problem is one of perception.  Whats missing here is the reality that many pure automation testers are net liabilities especially when compared to talented manual testers.  Ive worked at over a halfdozen companies primarily in testing positions and in all of them I witnessed uselesswasteful automation.  I have been involved in such automation myself so please dont think I view myself as perfect.  However I am mindful of this problem now and do my very best to only automate where it makes sense.There are many tangents to this type of discussion.  Ive long been a proponent of requiring and only hiring testers who can and are willing to do BOTH manual testing and automated testing.Uggh the war stories I could tell. . . Im going to start a blog soon. . . this  kind of stuff drives me nuts.  Im sure that many of you have similar tales to tell.  ,softwaretesting,co1d3jp,3,t5_2rtrr
3715516,0,t1_cqdhjup,IMO RF is not necessarily an abstraction because were calling functions  just with different syntax.  I would call it more of a wrapper.  Thats the job of the framework though IMO  manage the test cases and report the results.If youre not calling your test code from RF then youll still have to use something to manage your execution and reporting.For me the way RF reduces test ambiguity is its value.  You could argue that any framework can do this and youd be right but it also gives me a usage model at which to point new test writers.  We do a lot of development in the Python space and I think I mentioned that in my original post test writers frequently use this method to sidestep the clear usage model represented in the RF libraries.  This is where the RF sometimes gives me heartburn.  Theres no enforcement of test case patterns especially when adding libraries.Bear in mind that my perspective comes from working on custom python libraries not developing RF tests.  We have a very complex UI that requires a lot of extra code.  Personally I enjoy using RF  The simplicity made it very easy to bring up a test framework and start reporting results quickly.  Plus its free  managers always like to hear that.,softwaretesting,cqfsmp6,1,t5_2rtrr
6216146,0,t1_cyvt5t9,gt k a day is a bit of an exaggeration but there are certainly a lot of terrible performance testers out there. I used to be billed at k a day for a performance engagement  years ago. The k number is from a discussion I recently had with a fullybooked consultant specializing in Oracle performance testing. It might be high or maybe he was bragging a little but the idea remains the same.In terms of how can the tool can know it starts with building the idea of a website into the tool and organizing the data around it.From there well look at the test types let you compare to previous and suggest what steps tests are left in order to vet the site. With a concept of a site and type of test associated with each run you can compare data and generate meaningful reports. As one example imagine a dashboard where you see a graph for each testtype concurrency with a realworld scenario stress longevity with the results  plotted on a graph over time. Essentially a snapshot over time. And if your site passes testing a proofofperformance report that managers can use to cover their butts. ,softwaretesting,cyw7jam,1,t5_2rtrr

6731082,0,t1_d0fjfvj,You can try to automate look and feel tests but youll run into nothing but problems trying to achieve a high standard. Youll end up spending far more time writing and maintaining those kinds of scripts than you would just testing it manually for each test run.  Quite often you might have a few tests cases for this but not enough to eliminate manual testing.,softwaretesting,d0fjx30,1,t5_2rtrr
7240853,0,t3_4bm8f5,I am not sure what exactly you want to test. Desktop web or mobile applications? And what technologies need to be tested? Without any further information it is hard to suggest a testing tool which fits your needs. In general it is a good practice to just grab a testing tool and try try try. Learning by doing is really important. I personally can recommend Ranorex for automated testing of desktop web and mobile applications because it supports a lot of different rd party controls. Maybe you want to give it a try. ,softwaretesting,d218ddm,1,t5_2rtrr

7961485,0,t1_d3j1cyh,It is not my intention to dominate. Domination has no value to me. Its repugnant to me in fact. My intention as you rightly suggest is among other things to get people to question the underpinnings of the testcasedriven workflow which to me is the antithesis of testing.  It fosters lousy development and lousy testing which in turn contribute to irritation misery and diminished value for many people.  We in the software development community have the power to make peoples lives easier and in my view were blowing it because so many people are thinking uncritically about what were producing and how were producing it.  Ideas and opinions like that are inevitably controversial.  I welcome scrutiny and critical thinking about those ideas.  I welcome alternatives to the remedies that James and I have proposed. Please bring them on.Michael B.,softwaretesting,d4ay2tp,1,t5_2rtrr

10145895,0,t3_5l7fe7,Hi   Congratulations on graduation and your choice to start in testing.  I usually recommend testing as a great place to start a technical career because you generally get a wider perspective on the systems used to power business and if you do go into development later on  the testing experience will help you create higher quality code.I recommend Udacitys software testing class   This class teaches the concepts of testing like domain partitioning boundary analysis etc...     Getting some training on the concepts will be more helpful in the beginning than the selenium course.   Then apply those concepts with the udemy class.  Selenium webdriver Java and logJ are definitely very popular technologies and a good base.  ,softwaretesting,dbu0hr5,1,t5_2rtrr

10731085,0,t1_ddmsczm,Yes I double as both a manual and automated tester in the Ohio area. One thing to note is that ruby wont be supporting selenium soon and is instead going full support of Watir.  Watir is based on selenium though so if you can work with one you can work with the other. While I prefer ruby and Watir I know the area also has at least some jobs that use spec flow instead which is a .net based framework. Spec flow supports selenium fully. You said you want to learn API testing as well I dont have much experience there as our developers are in charge of all the unit and integration tests. I can say front end acceptance testing is generally one of the worst ways to test APIs so if you want more on that youll want to look outside of selenium for that. Thats about as far as my expertise on those types of tests go.,softwaretesting,ddmtxnr,1,t5_2rtrr

I would play with the latter and maybe look at YouTube for tutorials.Which one you use will depend on your it budget.For recording defects the key things to consider areDefect ID a unique identifierDescription a title which summarises the defectDefect detail the steps taken to reproduce the defect. The advantage of a tool is that you can include screen shots. Include details of data version number environment.Tester who raised the defectSeverity is this defect a show stopper or cosmetic? Severity usually ranges Priority what is the business priority of the defect? A cosmetic defect may be that you spelt the company name wrong but it will be a business priority of  to fix it straight away.Defect owner who is going to fix it?Status openclosed etcDate closedYou can go into more detail but generally as a high level that covers the basics.,softwaretesting,df1ric2,3,t5_2rtrr

Both are to be connected with one another each step of them must be understandable for all team members. But as far as you have an experience you know it perfectly well. There are different methods of software testing. Every time the team of developers starts a new project members of QA ream start thinking about how they will test it which tool they will use how many test scenarios they will create and execute etc. Of course it depends upon the company which tool to use while testing. It can be manual or automated testing tool. A tool selection depends on the budget types of project testing objectives life cycle model used documentation functionality characteristics prices and feedback.No matter if you need automated testing tool you may use selenium.But in case of manual testing here you have a plenty of tools.
