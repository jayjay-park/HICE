4613397,0,t1_ctc0ygo,I never ordered this I used to work in Subway so I would make it myself. The recipe got passed to me by my manager which she had heard from her old manager and she had heard from hers etc. Fairly sure you could find ancient tomes scribed with this recipe. Itll be on the Discovery Channel soon enough.Bonus Ive had some seriously more complex and annoying orders than this one haha.,MimicRecipes,ctc3kwu,5,t5_396mz

4803009,0,t1_ctihp53,Im pretty late to the party but its not white cheddar. Its very different softer and milder. Its normally sold behind the deli counter at grocery stores but not often in the dairy section with blocks of cheese.The typical restaurantstyle queso that Ive found is actually even simpler. Its just white american cheese with a little bit of milk in it for good measure then a finely diced jalapeno a touch of cumin and a little garlic powder. Im sure it would be great with diced tomato and onion as well though. When melting it cut or crumble the cheese into small chunks and toss it in with the milk over relatively low heat. It also works better if you use a double boiler in order to evenly heat the cheese. I dont have one so I use a small pyrex glass mixing bowl over my smallest pot making sure to keep the water level low so that its not in contact with the bowl.,MimicRecipes,ctzyjk1,1,t5_396mz

7129099,0,t3_4d6w4e,Its been a while since I made croissants so take all this with a grain of salt. I allowed the butter to reach room temperature placed it between two cling wraps and rolled it out into a rectangle about  the length the dough gets rolled out to. Freeze it.Take dough roll it out place butter on fold into thirds so that the butter is between each layer! This is important for the flakiness! Chill the dough between folds it heats up real quickly and then butter melts out like you were describing. If its melting out during baking you had a butter pocket. I do more like  folds for more flakiness fewer butter pockets. Really i think you can fold it a lot more times than that recipes shows.Good luck!,MimicRecipes,d1ohy34,4,t5_396mz
