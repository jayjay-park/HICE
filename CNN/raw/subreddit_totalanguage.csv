6745508,0,t3_481tas,Mandarin ChineseI continue to do my repetitions on Anki for Mandarin Chinese. Again Ive almost hit  flashcards for my selfmade deck! I just need to add some more sentences from my backup list I made from conversations with native speakers on HelloTalk or wait until I get enough corrected sentences from my Lang journals.I am still writing an entry everyday on Lang and get corrections from native speakers.I still chat on HelloTalk but I have decided to turn off the feature that lets other people find me because I was getting  chat requests per day and I was losing the ability to have more in depth conversations with some of my HelloTalk friends from before. I am still reading Colloquial Chinese in my spare time. I also have Teach Yourself Chinese which I might start reading as well to learn more grammar.I still havent looked at Memrise yet. So that remains a mystery for me although it seems like a lot of people here use it so Im going to take a look soon.All in all I have to say that my smart phone has saved my language learning daily progress time and time again. I cant stress the number of times that I have been out late and realized Wait I need to write an entry on Lang in Chinese! so I take out my phone and start writing post it and Im done.It is the same with doing flashcards. Im glad I switched from Mnemosyne to Anki because I can synchronize Anki across my laptop desktop and phone. Therefore I can do my reps on the phone wherever I am or whenever I have time!JapaneseJapanese practices still comes from watching an occasional anime show chatting with Japanese friends on LINE listening to Japanese music and lastly writing a journal entry every day on Lang.I am still reviewing my flashcards in Anki and taking the corrected Lang sentences and putting them in my deck for study.I think I am abusing Lang a bit because I have over  corrections on my journal entries and have only made  corrections on others. A Japanese speaker wrote a very long note on one of my entries in both English and Japanese urging me to do more corrections. But hey I dont have a lot of time and if people keep correcting my entries do I really need to correct other peoples entries?SpanishI have been talking to people on HelloTalk in Spanish more often now. Sometimes I even use the voice feature and send a voice message to practice speaking Spanish. It is interesting to hear my accent in Spanish again as I am not entirely aware of it when I am just speaking in the moment. HelloTalk gives me the chance to step back and think for a second before I start talking. If I mess up I can always rerecord.I am glad that my Spanish is in maintenance mode. I dont know how some of the people on here study three languages at relatively the same levels at one time. I would feel like my progress would be so slow. Id rather just study one language to a high level then move to the next then finally the third. Id get a lot more enjoyment out of having my first language at a high level where I could watch TV hold fluid conversations etc. when I started on the second language. It would make it a lot easier to remember everything and not give up in the long run on any of the languages. But I understand everybody has their own method and motivation. For language learners it is sometimes difficult to focus on just one language when there are so many other tempting ones out there to study!,totalanguage,d0h1j9b,2,t5_2vuki

Im very glad I stopped reading out loud now my reading is much smoother much more enjoyable and more extensive so Ive been really absorbing a lot. On that note though I do need to find something else to use for pronunciation practice maybe Ill find some other text. Didnt really do any of it this week anyways so I have to get back to it this coming week.Watching and listening have been amazing. I was watching today and couldnt believe how easily I was comprehending everything. Incredibly smooth.Watched a presentation from last years Polyglot Conference on how to sound like a native. It was really good and fairly thorough with many practical ideas. Im going to definitely be applying some of the things I learnt from it.Extremely excited to be starting Farsi soon. So much so that I need to make sure it doesnt distract me from Hindi now...,totalanguage,d36g7kl,2,t5_2vuki
