7487465,0,t3_4hxocj,I would say be wary. Goenka isnt always so wellreceived. But as long as emphasis is on meditation and the canonical teachings of the Buddha youre good to go. ,theravada,d2ta8yy,2,t5_2ra0d
7957720,0,t1_d4a4038,Well you can believe that something has a good moral or story to it or good wisdom without taking it on as teachings of the Buddha.,theravada,d4aity1,3,t5_2ra0d

8341781,0,t3_4tteyo,gtThats very good. The fact that you can be vegetarians is very good and Id like to express my admiration. As for those who still eat meat if that meat is pure in three ways  in that they havent seen or heard or suspected that an animal was killed to provide the food specifically for them  and they obtained it in a pure way then eating the meat is in no way against the Dhamma and Vinaya. But when you say that your mind becomes peaceful and cool thats the result of the strength that comes from being intent on practicing correctly in line with the Dhamma and Vinaya. It has nothing to do with the new food or old in your stomach at all.,theravada,d5k9yxr,1,t5_2ra0d
