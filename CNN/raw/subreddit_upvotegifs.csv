166327,0,t1_cexd9qt,Ah geez that wasnt necessary but thank you!The one other thing to consider is the  degree rule. Since the arrows are d you would have to be on the complete opposite side of the scenery in order for the arrow to face the other direction. I would assume the animators would correctly follow that guideline.,upvotegifs,cexdlti,1,t5_2uqpl
338460,0,t1_cffplru,No delay in a gif would use infinite cpu time so most viewers increase zero delay to  tenths of a second delay.  In fact many viewersmost browsers also slow down  tenth of a second down to six tenths so a  tenths delay will run faster than a gif with  tenth delay.,upvotegifs,cffuo30,2,t5_2uqpl

1269852,0,t1_cicfz40,RES users used to see the upvotedownvote spread of comment. | for a  score comment is a lot different than a | spread. RES users could see the difference between the two now all we see is that it is a  score comment. It was probably the most used feature of RES and we are pissed that Reddit decided to make it useless by no longer making that info available in their API.,upvotegifs,cich43k,3,t5_2uqpl
