3706823,0,t3_32t9o0,there are  issues to considerFirst one. always in history whenever any army came to Slovakia they were so exhausted by battles that when Slovaks surrendered and we always did they said ok rested and moved on only to be defeated by the nations that lie behind Slovakia.The one time Slovak army fought was in s against Hungarians and after we won and were promised autonomy the lovely Austrian empress Sisi fell in love with Hungarian aristocrat and Fd Slovakia over by handing us over back over to Hungarian rule ... suffice to say our ancestors were handled by Hungarians as afghan interpreters are handled by Taliban these days .... have some pro Russian friends most of the people i know have some pro west liberal friends but i know one thing. neither of the  groups is willing to die so Bidens son can get a million dollar bonus from the UA mining company his daddy put him into. So if it comes to war no one will fight for US nor for our own oligarchs. So not even the anti Russian people in Slovakia are stupid enough to go and die for someone else money interests.Second big issue is as what the guy below wrote about our water sources. US held Russia during soviet era back by threatening them with their poison well doctrine. Basically they told Russians that if they invade US would detonate a nuke on their military bases in Europe to stop Russian advance. Since Slovakia has significant water reserves if something like that has to happen it will probably be Poland and not us. that water is way too preciousNow how can any politician these days allow US a military base on his countries territory is beyond my understanding. Ou wait Vlads BFF Angela Merkel did  on him just shortly after it was revealed she was spied on her phone for  years. What has Angela done wrong to change her mind abruptly? Maybe ask NSA PNow in regard to Russia it seems as if Nato is not seeing the forest cause of the woods. Russians can tank entire Nato while China supports them and once Nato has exhausted itself as well as Russia China will be able to do its move whatever that might be ...,Slovakia,cqesx9u,4,t5_2qyjb

6348009,0,t3_42jixu,I lived in SK for five years and by the final year had reached a level where I could speak it effectively in most situations well enough that I spoke it almost exclusively when with Slovak friends. For the first two years I learned a lot of vocabulary but the grammar stopped me from forming more than short sentences when speaking. During the third and fourth years I lived in Prague half the time and took intensive courses in Czech thats when I finally cracked the grammar barrier and reached a decent level of fluency when speaking. Its so easy to just get by in English in BAPrague that you have to be motivated and push yourself. I also found that SlovakCzech friends wouldnt have the patience to practice with me until I reached a decent level of fluency it was much easier and faster for them to speak English and they wanted the practice as well. In the fourth and fifth years I met Slovaks who didnt speak much English and thats when I really started to feel proficient in using Slovak as a primary language. Ive been away from SKCZ for four years now and still read webpages in SlovakCzech regularly to keep the level up but Im sure my speaking ability has slipped significantly without practice.,Slovakia,czb74pg,2,t5_2qyjb

10134466,0,t1_dbraotk,There are two occasions when such possibility comes to my mind. One is using a Slovak equivalent for instance Suzanne  Zuzana Jane  Jana Thomas  Tom and such where its very similar in pronunciation. Another case is adding the suffix as mentioned in another comment. The suffix is a thing of our grammar and allows us to distinguish the gender. Every word in our vocabulary has a gender. Some words can be used with more than one gender especially names adjectives and verbs. When speaking in Slovak and using a genderless or gender neutral word in a sentence in the Slovak language it can sound awkward and hence it can feel natural to add a suitable suffix. However the general rule which is being thought at English lessons in here is that foreign names shouldnt be translated and that they should be used in their original form. On the other hand this rule is often disregarded by the lack of professionalism from journalists and especially by tabloids. ,Slovakia,dbsixi8,3,t5_2qyjb

The Polish thing is more rare but not unheard of. However the combination of both the Polish and Hungarian spelling is so weird that I believe you have the spelling wrong.
