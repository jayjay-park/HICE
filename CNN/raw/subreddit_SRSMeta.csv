I think we should still have the irl recommendation option or however is best to word it because as I said I have turned at least one person onto it that way so there may be others.,SRSMeta,cgy0rid,3,t5_2t6z6

7011898,0,t3_4bmefq,Not wrong. I dont know how long youve been here but SRS was much different at the beginning. I dont think its a bad thing at all I should add but the difference between the days of AmazingPerson amp OfficeFistingParty vs. today are definitely real. At the beginning much like rbadphilosophy there was a no learns policy hence the creation of SRSD for people who needed learns. Nowadays learns are acceptable which has changed the tone considerably. And Ive imparted my own learns so Im not without responsibility here.Anyhow its still great compared to everything else on this site.,SRSMeta,d1b59bi,1,t5_2t6z6
