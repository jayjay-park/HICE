1047355,0,t1_chn91n2,Honestly I would say go for Mudge as the difference in distance is pretty marginal at that point its like an extra two minute walk max and the place is a bit nicer than Donner.  Youll have a nice mansion courtyard with hammocks... and its not quite as old as Donner which is nice and doesnt get quite as ungodly hot.Also you dont usually see shit smeared on the walls or anything that bad.  The worst thing that Ive seen is a friend left their door open and a drunk guy puked in their room while they were gonenot a very common occurrence either just be smart and keep your room closed.  Either way the cleaning people ISS are pretty on point and will deal with anything crazy given a few hours unless its am or something like that.,cmu,chnc7nu,2,t5_2r87b

4007079,0,t1_crcz1dk,At cmu there are five areas under the ece umbrella. We had to take one course in three of the five now signals and computer systems are required which are the beginnings of signals and software areas. Im not sure if they have to take more breadths since two are already selected. Then you have to do depth within one of the five areas. I think my friend was one class away from meeting CS major requirements just by doing the software area of ece he didnt want to take  which you probably wont have to take as a grad student. Its great theoretical ideas in computer science or something like that and nobody seems to enjoy it. I took signals semiconductors and algorithms for my breadth areas. I ended up doing signals because I didnt want to take computer systems now required which meant I couldnt do a lot of higher level hardware or software classes. But now Im a software developer anyway. I never did anything related to VLSI or comp arch. Every school is going to have a different structure ECE curriculum so if the question is ECE anywhere vs CS anywhere it may be easier to get a job with a CS degree but from CMU thats not the case. My friends who did ECE at other schools didnt have any trouble finding jobs doing what they want and I would say about a quarter of the developers at my company were ECE then a few physics and math and the rest CS. I did ECE over CS because I wanted to major in BME which is only offered as a double major with another engineering degree. If I could have chosen CS instead I would have because I was interested in CS but I didnt have that choice and I dont feel like the ECE degree hurt. My masters research also at CMU. I was in BME department was in surgical robotics and that was awesome. Its probably rare that BME people do robotics but because I was ECE for undergrad I could. I know you can minor in robotics from ECE and Im pretty sure you can from CS as well. CS at CMU requires a minor so you could do that with a general engineering minor and take a bunch of ECE classes. Either major will allow you to take classes in the other department that youre interested in but itll be easier from ECE to take CS classes because its more likely that youll have done the prerequisites as part of the ECE curriculum.,cmu,crd1cx2,1,t5_2r87b

4499326,0,t3_3ccrn1,I had credit for six courses from AP and I also passed out of Concepts and started in secondsemester programming.  I overloaded my third semester because I thought I was slacking by only taking four courses my second semester and it wasnt until planning out my next semester that I realized I could graduate early with some breathing room I took weightlifting and baking my last year to stay above .  Also my minor was business administration and all the classes were pretty straightforward.I wasnt having the greatest time my second year I went home for Carnival that year because I was so homesick and I was tired of all of my social interactions involving Smash Bros. or drinking myself silly so getting out a year early was really compelling.  My family situation in my thirdfinal year really compelled me to finish up.  I certainly could have stood to slow down take more classes for fun and broaden out socially but looking back it wasnt really that big of a deal a year of CMU was not a trivial amount of money to me and my family.My recommendation would be to go for it if you dont have to overload and if you think you can get As in some classes without going to lecture you probably wont know if you can do this until you try it and you certainly could fuck it up.,cmu,csxsm55,1,t5_2r87b

If you screw up the later courses as well grad school is probably out at least directly out of undergrad.So unless a retake will increase the odds of good grades in later classes dont retake it.,cmu,czy8bcq,1,t5_2r87b

I was actually in the nd to last class of pure Computer Engineers before they merged the ECE programs   IMHO if you are worried about job offers you will be qualified for most every industry coding position with either degree.  The ECE degree will open up hardware options that generally wont be covered by straight CS.  If you are looking to continue on to grad school you would be best off with whatever you plan on specializing in post grad.   Ive never really seen any prestige difference between the degrees in industry the CMU name itself carries enough weight that most folks wont even ask what you majored in.

10269084,0,t3_5mqrmf,I transferred from a different university after my freshman year. The staffmember that reviewed my application later told me one of the biggest things they look for is whether youre being provided for adequately at your current school  ie if youre going to MIT right now theyre probably going to reject you since their education is top notch and someone else can benefit more from that transfer spot. If you go to a CC youre probably going to be rejected because youre going to have too hard of a time catching up. If you go to a decent school but youre finding that youre being restricted or youre not being presented enough opportunities youll have a higher chance of transfer.Jesus fucking christ my essays so cringey  I just read through it. I hope yours will be better than mine lolI am NOT telling you to just rant and trash your current school. My old university had ridiculously easy classes and I was bored out of my mind main reason why I wanted out but I didnt mention that in my essay! Keep things positive talk about what you want career? goal? startup idea? and why the CMU culturecurriculumstaff can help you get there. Why are you a Math major? Why dont you want to stay at your current university? Really ask yourself why youre doing all this.Obviously the staffmember and i didnt discuss all the ins and outs of the process  it was just a short casual conversation  but these should be good to keep in mind.,cmu,dc82253,2,t5_2r87b

11625483,0,t3_65tvpx,Read the other thread and noticed you said your parents wouldnt take out loans. I know its a risk considering the visa upheaval going on in the US right now but almost all students going to expensive universities like CMU take out student loans then pay them off with their fancy postCMU jobs here in the US. Have you looked at all into loans? If you used them the first year you could apply for more scholarships for the other  years merit based ones and need based ones. You also would have more accomplishments with which to get scholarships and could do competitions that earn them as well. Unfortunately the type of jobs you can do with a HS diploma wont really make a dent in CMU tuition. I would forget about doing any jobs that pay lt an hour like online gigs instead focusing on applying to as many scholarships as possible. The return on investment is much higher especially after you write  stock essays that you adjust for each scholarship. Its better to focus on these and on your school work plus competition extra curriculars which will make you far more in the long term. Weigh the current and future benefit of each hour spent on different tasks. Is one hour doing a research study worth more in the long term than an hour spent applying to a scholarship or getting an A on that coding HW?The summer after HS I worked  hrsweek at hr and made a couple grand. I also spent  hoursday applying to scholarships and made thousands in tuition.,cmu,dgdrdvf,7,t5_2r87b
