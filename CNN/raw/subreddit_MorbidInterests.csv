11798053,0,t3_664z8c,Not really someone I knew personally but a man shot himself in the head in his car in an office building parking lot. His car ended up covered in snow and just looked like part of the snowbank. He was there for months before he was discovered. I was in that office building frequently that winter. He was there dead in that parking lot the whole time when I was there.,MorbidInterests,dgxclo0,2,t5_3k030
