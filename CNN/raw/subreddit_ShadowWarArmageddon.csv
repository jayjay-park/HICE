11403592,0,t1_dfocm4q,Not every army states a minmax size I think just the ones that diverge from the standard...but I dont know what that standard is.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dfokzpw,1,t5_3jj5w
11406007,0,t3_62rpq1,Well I doubt theyll be true to their word and deny copies to people who want them but worst case scenario is I get the rules online that weekend and save  on terrain but just using old terrain.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dfouubm,1,t5_3jj5w
11409502,0,t1_dfp8rid,Sweet! Compiling my list atm.On another note when the ammo roll is failed and the gun fails this is useless for the game or the whole campaign?Thank you for the answers! D,ShadowWarArmageddon,dfp95rm,2,t5_3jj5w
11421332,0,t3_631nk0,what does a photo visor do?,ShadowWarArmageddon,dfqlhcb,2,t5_3jj5w
11426767,0,t1_dfqvsym,IIRC it specifically mentions it to say that you in fact cant store equipment.  Basically if you leave your plasma gun laying around the Chaos FOB and go out on patrol for a few days it wont be there when you get back.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dfr7nj1,4,t5_3jj5w
11450345,0,t1_dftr72r,Coming from following Battletech they love to release books. I cant figure why GW would he hesitant to produce new copies of the rulebook in a physical format. They love pushing copies of codex books a rulebook would be just another book. ,ShadowWarArmageddon,dftvydb,1,t5_3jj5w
11458766,0,t1_dftr8sg,So with the two Sicarian SpecOps having two weapon options each you could make one of each with a single box and have one spare for parts. Of course as those models are only available in that boxed set thats basically the only way to get them new.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dfuuddx,1,t5_3jj5w

11543436,0,t3_64nune,The only thing Id say about this is that it limits your ability to enhance your team using the Recruit gt Trooper Mechanic.Im tempted to throw in a few Warriors to start because I think getting more shots per turn and therefore more chances to pin is more important than inflicting wounds.Then I can use the  Prometheum at the end of the each of the first  missions to add Immortals with Tesla Carbines and PhotoVisors.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dg4g7p6,1,t5_3jj5w
11553893,0,t3_64u7yd,Is there a special rule for the droopy Lasgun on the Death Korps trooper?  Poor fella ,ShadowWarArmageddon,dg5myj3,2,t5_3jj5w
11560568,0,t1_dg6e1p5,haha I just wanted to make sure. I definitely dont trust myself to get the math on this perfect which is why I chose to just roll it  times instead. Id be interested in seeing what the numbers look like. I think number of attacks rolled is going to play a huge part in this as well.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dg6e83x,1,t5_3jj5w
11562009,0,t3_650nny,Harlequins and Skitarii also get enough soldiers for a team in  box.The Ork boyz box is enough for a starting team but you can take up to  Orks so will probably want a second box at some point. For the Scouts you probably want a second box or a box of Sniper Scouts as they can take up to  guys. You get  Sniper Scout and  Normal Scouts in the box set. ,ShadowWarArmageddon,dg6k40w,3,t5_3jj5w
11568075,0,t1_dg785xb,It is now BS! I also think my opponents will be okay with it because my second choice of model was a rail rifle specialist with ammo hunter!How would you get BS though? Can only roll each stat increase once.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dg78w7d,1,t5_3jj5w
11568669,0,t3_64z06i,Im going Necron so theres a bit more variation in the models but I bought a transfer set which has numbers on it which I intend to apply to the shoulder plate.You could easily put them on the rim of the base.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dg7bbke,1,t5_3jj5w
11569753,0,t1_dg7ffx9,I have lost both my opening games nd one due to purely poor positioning but line of site is constantly obstructed on weapons that are negative at close range when a board is set in a dense pattern. Maybe I am just deploying poorly and not taking advantage of my own benefits.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dg7fqwh,1,t5_3jj5w
11626666,0,t1_dgdi9le,i like what u did there,ShadowWarArmageddon,dgdw80m,1,t5_3jj5w
11633874,0,t1_dgeodza,Haha yeah. Only because they are simple and cheap and so good to use as a benchmark. I would absolutely vary that for personal taste. I should have mentioned that Autoguns can be swapped for Shotguns as desired as both are pts. Other rifle option is Lasguns but they are pts more for identical stats to Autoguns except  instead of  Ammo Roll. Only benefit is future option to add a Hot Shot pack. Id go with Auto.If you go for the second list note Autopistols can be swapped for Laspistols both are pts. Autopistols have  instead of  To Hit at Short Range but again  instead of  Ammo Roll. Again benefit of Las is the Hot Shot. Id go with Auto.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dgepncw,3,t5_3jj5w
11641093,0,t1_dgcfuln,Hiding counts as not being in line of sight though maybe?  Meaning that half cover and hidden then running to the big tank and not being in line of sight would work for it?  Im not sure Id rule that running into another bit of cover and hiding would count as theyd take the shot before you ducked down but as long as you started hidden Id count it if you could end out of line of sight.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dgfj51r,2,t5_3jj5w
11677396,0,t3_66m8qw,Yes and yes. ,ShadowWarArmageddon,dgjndwy,4,t5_3jj5w
11700274,0,t1_dgm4erx,I think that the Enginseer is meh overall and I think you dont ever take more than one commissar. I feel like there is a definite benefit to bringing multiple scions and Ogryns though but youre right. It would have to be a vital mission to justify it especially with multiple Ogryns.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dgm8tj1,1,t5_3jj5w
11737962,0,t3_67g5a0,My group is experimenting with starting  instead of  but then thats it forever. But you get  skill ups per game and dead guys are replaced for free with rookies. This way your team grows as if they were gaining experience and getting better at fighting rather than gradually having new recruits and guns sent to them piecemeal.Plus it makes the games seem a lot more even. Not nearly enough games played to say how well its actually working though will probably require adjustments  especially to the teams whos rookies are totally different from their troops.,ShadowWarArmageddon,dgqj0ik,3,t5_3jj5w
