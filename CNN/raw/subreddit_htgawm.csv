3257776,0,t1_cozobz9,Yes yes. But thats only if they knew Rebecca was hidden somewhere in the basement. As we know Wes went into the basement and she was gone already. The main bulk of my theory is hiding aliveRebecca under the stairs and then someone coming to kill her afterwards. Realistically why would anyone suspect that Annalise was lying?

It reminds me of the butterfly effect. if anyone had done just one little thing differently murder night might not have happened. But I dont think that means she is at fault for all of this. To be honest I think Sam is at fault for his own death. You cant try and kill someone in front of their friends and expect their friends not to try and stop you.

7001061,0,t3_4bkaww,I have seen several theories but this one makes the most sense to meAnnalise had just rejected Bonnie in a very real way.  Even though their relationship wasnt sexual Bonnie did have a weird Oedipal fascination with both Annalise and Sam and she lost both of them that day. By the time she got to the bar she had nothing left. No job no purpose no Annalise to serve or Sam to idealize. She decided to act out by picking up the guy in the bar.  In many ways Annalise basically owned her and having sex with the hotel bar dude would be a sort of declaration of her independence and a way to distract herself from how much she was hurting. So she decided to pick up that guy but while they were making out in the lobby something about the situation felt wrong to her.  Maybe its that he was a Sam type. Maybe its just that having sex with a stranger wasnt typical for Bonnie and she changed her mind when confronted with the sloppy drunk dental salesman reality. Unlike the hotel bar guy Asher was safe. She knew hed be DTF but she also knew him well enough to know he wouldnt murder her. And having sex with one of the K had the bonus of being either an added fuck you to Annalise or one last thread of connection to her. ,htgawm,d19wxm9,25,t5_31rdt

Of course they try to hint then that Asher is alive Laurel in the hospital so where is Connor.  I cant help feeling there is going to be some huge twist in ep  like say Connor and Wes are the final  but then at the end of ep  they are both alive. And later on that night someone else dies who is the main character. So we all thought it was going to be Wes or Connor and it ends up being Laurel or Michaela say during their reveals it was Meggy who was safe since she was in both of those  reveal scenes and somehow Simon is dead in the ambulance. Oh I dont know I just never trust this show and HIGHLY doubt it is Connor who is dead.  And Nate and Frank seem too obvious.  Plus they stopped filming for  hours after finding out who died so I highly doubt it is Nate I just dont think they are as close to Billy as the rest of them are.

Theyre going to come back in late novemberdecember and probably didnt even read the scripts for the rest of the season yet since they get them at the table read in the pre production of every episode. So yeah maybe Charlie said that because he didnt have any scene with Annalise in the episodes he had filmed so far. But recently I think last week he said he does have a scene with her in the mid season finale.Lets be real Annalises reunion with Frank will be wild and the x synopsis says that Annalise will have a fight with Nate too.

9618929,0,t1_d9ybjao,I figure if Oliver Bonnie Asher and Michaela are in the hospital all night they wouldnt die.  I dont see someone killing them in the hospital.  So they would be safe.Laurel could die from her injuries but again I dont see anyone coming into the hospital to kill her. It could be Laurel but then I think would it be too obvious since she is critically injured I just dont know.If not that only leaves Frank Connor and Wes. Maybe Frank kills Wes? But if that happened Frank could NEVER be back on the show so it would be like  main characters dying really. Although if Nate really is UTS I wonder who killed him Frank?This may be way way off and probably is but I will throw it out there anyways.  When AK called Laurel Connor and Asher to come to the house the first two did but Asher did not. Connor doesnt like Wes from the beginning and he told Wes if you go to the police and give my name I will kill you which I think was an empty threat but he did say it.  Maybe something happens and Wes ends up saving Connor?? I doubt it but I thought it would be very ironic if that happened considering how much Connor dislikes Wes and threatening him. I know Wes is with the police but we dont know the exact time  maybe it is before any of this went down. The more I think about this the less I think this happened!

And his subsequent cruel amp savage demolition of Aidens heterosexuality then says everything He wasnt just a BS hookup amp I know we wont see it on the show again I was so surprised when they mentioned him in ep!! But this is firmly my HC amp Ive absolutely no idea how people cant see it Its SO obvious.Hahahahaha I thought I was the only one who was super annoyed by that lightening fast verbal vomit by Rebecca! She annoyed me immensely if they wouldve got a better actor wouldve made a big difference in how I see the character.Oliver was wasnt he. So shy naive amp innocent.   But even then it isnt hard for me to believe hes the older one he clearly is much more mature amp together than Connor despite his shyness reserve amp apparent innocence he isnt really innocent amp nowhere near what Connor amp co believe he is. I really like that contrast in his personality because thats really how people are irl His navet amp seeming innocence contrasted by his maturity emotional control amp reserve. That entire bar scene gives me LIFE every time I watch it because what even is that chemistry???? That controlled seduction by Connor??? That little tongue flick on the rim of the glass which is indicative of the fabulous rimjob Oliver will receive later that night the pleasures of being with Connor Walsh for a night Connor was putting it aaaall out there so classily amp so so in control!!! He was the tiger amp Oliver the deer and really Oliver had no chance so good he just gave him those damn emails lol. I do wonder if ever Connor wonders how different his life mightve been if Oliver hadnt fumbled amp stuttered amp walked into it   like what if Connor went to the guy a few tables behind Oliver and seduced him amp Oliver looked on wistfully at the amazingly hot brilliantly sexy man who is charming that man right over there..its amazing what all I think when it comes to Coliver!!! Also since Connor loves kicking the asses of all those people who slighthurt Oliver can we pls have him kick the asses of all those horrible colleagues laughing amp making fun of Oliver???

9657507,0,t3_5d9p6k,udaisylion commented on another thread thatgt What I dont understand is why Laurel panics as she wakes up and writes down Wes on the notepad. The first thing she thinks of as soon as she wakes up is Wes. Why? Immediately after that scene they show Wes talking to the cops as the anonymous source but how does this warrant the absolute panic that Laurel wakes up in?gt It makes sense to me that she and Wes were in the house when it caught fire. The only other option left right now is Frank. But it would be too obvious if they revealed Frank as dead when hes the only main character that hasnt been revealed as alive.gt One of the things many people point out is that in the episode where they reveal Wes it was actually a safe reveal for Laurel. The episode where shes rushed into the hospital was a safe reveal for Meggie since at the time she was still serious with Wes.Seeing all of these points together in a single comment has me seriously questioning Wess viability as the anonymous source since. Why would Laurel be so panicked about Wes when she woke up unless Wes was at AKs during the fire as either a victim or perpetrator? . Assuming both Laurel and Wes were at Annalises house during the fire is it even possible for Laurel to have known Wes was there without Wes knowing that Laurel was there? In what scenarios could Laurel have seenheard Wes but Wes not have seenheard Laurel?. Assuming that Wes did know Laurel was at Annalises house during the firesince Laurel knew that Wes was thereWTF is he doing at the police station instead of at the hospital with Laurel? Or at least trying to call and make sure Laurel is okay like OliverMichaela trying so frantically to make sure ConnorAsher are okay? And now that we see Weswearing the same clothes from his flashforward revealbeing brought into the police station by his lawyer while Nate looks on from another room we can assume this scene is taking place before the fire since if it was duringafter the fire Nate would be on his way to Annalises house. So.... If Wes stays at the station all dayinto the night how could he be the anonymous source who gets Annalise charged with arson? He wouldnt even know about the fire.. If Wes leaves the stationcomes back later to snitch about AKs role in the fire WTF is he doing at the station instead of frantically calling Laurel to make sure shes okay?It doesnt add up. ,htgawm,da3hmn9,6,t5_31rdt

He is the anonymous source that ratted out Annalise maybe he had a tracker on Wes or some other way to figure out Wes was at the station maybe Connor was ahead of it and assumed Wes talked. Obviously he solved the Wes problem himself making good on his promise instead of telling the others Wes went to the police because what would that solve? This is why Connor had such a cold stone emotion at the end of the episode and the cameras focused in on him. This is why he was last to come to the hospital. CONNOR KILLED WES! Everything was foreshadowed the threat the minor confrontation scene with Wes in this episode him embracing himself as being damaged after Oliver said what he said to him etc.,htgawm,da5uv18,5,t5_31rdt

But it also leaves inconsistent details like you mentioned. I completely forgot about the mystery surrounding Annalise at the beginning until now but youre right. In season one I thought that we were going to find out Annalise was a terrible person but from what weve seen so far she used to have a fairly boring life at least compared to now. Looking back it seems strange that she was so unfazed by Sams death and the cover up afterwards.,htgawm,da6r78c,3,t5_31rdt

Comfortably late s to beginning s the fact that he is near  years of age is shocking! I think he eats very healthy works out well takes care of himself. Hes also always smiling amp laughing all the time amp whoever meets him cant stop talking about how genuine amp sweet he is. From Matthew Risch recently Thomas to Karla who adores him so much that she wanted Laurel to hook up with Oliver in an AU lol to Jack amp his cast mates from previous work he has done to the fans who meet him. Hes genuine very nice sweet amp gives lots of hugs.  He just puts a smile on your face when you see him just like he does as Oliver.

9727212,0,t1_dabz7y2,gt I think much of the writing revolves around whether theyll be able to explore particular plots within a given time frame. So as opposed to having one particular fixed point there are a series of shifting goal posts that are patched together marketed as plot twists. That goes against literary conventions and logic. Were not being presented wih a plot twist but weve been deceived.I think that is symptomatic of a show that relies almost solely on surprise as a dramatic tool.

10259401,0,t3_5msxch,I liked some of the character work in it. It is most evident with Bonnie who was in the background for the whole first season but then got her role hugely expanded. Which is great because when it comes to acting Lisa is second only to Viola. Frank also became a little bit more that deus ex machinae who occasionally has sex with Laurel. Oliver started to develop as a character in his own right instead of being just a prop to Connors story. Asher got a storyline. WesAnnalise relationship was finally explained. The rest of the characters barely did anything though.The rest of it was meh at best. The plot looked promising at the beginning but apparently the writers tried too hard to overdo themselves. There were so many plots that barely any of them had enough screentime to get developed properly and become interesting.,htgawm,dc6yjp8,5,t5_31rdt
10282521,0,t3_5n5efl,A suicide would make sense to me but not under those circumstances.  If Wes KNEW who killed Rebecca hed be off crusading to get justice.  It would give him purpose.  If hes alone in the house thinking about his life and his choices... Hes had a fight with Laurel and is doubting her feelings for him and his relationship with AK is about to change which leaves him very alone. Rebeccas dead and he probably feels guilty since his doubting her is the reason she was tied up in the basement in the first place.  His grades arent great being involved in all the AK shenanigans has probably already derailed his career he doesnt have any family and his only friends are the murder crew. I can see how he might become suicidal especially after last season when he said that he understood why his mother did it.  ,htgawm,dc9kwcb,13,t5_31rdt
10369322,0,t1_dciv4o1,gt But how would a call between Nate and AK change the fact that Wes couldnt listen to a voicemail that someone left him postmortem?Im not following you here. Please elaborate.gtI still have a hard time believing Nate would go from wanting to protect Wes from Annalise to wanting to kill Wes to protect Annalise or to help cover up Wess murder to protect Annalise so abruptly. But given the episodetoepisode writing style and the way they rewrote Frank and Wess characters this season its certainly not beyond the realm of possibility.Nate saw that in spite of Annalises indiscretions she still cared for him when she confronted him in the parking lot regarding ADA Rene using him to get closer to her.As to helping her cover up a murder its not outside the realm of possibility because as you cited the writing hasnt been consistent this season. Nates been involved in some rather shady dealings tohelp AK and K win cases.gtWes has a black iPhone. Annalise has a gold iPhone. The phone Annalise gave Oliver to clear was a gold iPhone.I didnt pay much attention to that detail but is it possible that this was a prop oversight?gtShe called Wes from the same device used to call Oliver and Laurel. She could have an app that places calls from a burner number but what would the point of her doing that be?If she intended to off Wes what better way for there not to be a record of it on her main device?Im still curious as to why she had that small flip phone in her drawer with the hitmans number. Where did that phone come from? Why did she have his number? That whole plot was ignored.gtWell she called Oliver too before calling Laurel. I think it was more efficient to just delegate rounding up the K to Laurel instead of wasting precious time doing it herself especially since Laurel was already with the others. And its consistent with things Laurel has been tasked with by AK in the past as the big sister of the group. What other reason do you think AK had for not calling everyone individually?It makes her look less suspicious if she only called Laurel to gather in the rest of them. I really dont see why she called Wes earlier well assuming it was earlier and then to later call Laurel to ask if Wes was with her. Why wouldnt she just suspect that he was busy and that he would show up at her home with Laurel and the rest ofthem? What was so important regarding her asking about Wes specifically and why did Laurel specifically text Wes but didnt go out of her way to look forcall Michaela or contact Connor that we know of at least? Maybe AK setup Laurel to look like the murderer.gtI dont think they were going for anything tbh.

She must have told him about  the investigation on Annalise and come up with a sick plan. She did ask Frank to kill the woman who bribed him  years ago. Fortunately he didnt.If Frank hadnt leave her stranded in Coalport she would be gone by now. Just because she came back telling Annalise she chose her doesnt mean its true.She might not be doing all of of this in urpose but there is something wrong with her. Sam was the reason Frank stick around. I guess the same goes for Bonnie. Frank hinted at this once. Id like to know what really happened between Sam and Bonnie.

10677743,0,t1_ddgxwq0,Ah that makes a lot of sense. Through that lens I can see how the escalation seemed extreme here. I was attributing Wess vehemence when he attacked Sam to a protective instinct but that could extend to the bigger picture of wanting to keep Rebecca free. That would be really cold and calculating though. Although he WAS going to finish Annalise off before she said Christoff so maybe he did have that in him.

And it was Annalise who convinced K to go along with it when Connor and Michaela were going to come clean to the police.

10921916,0,t1_de5vsj3,And whos the mystery witness that the DA keeps referring to but never wants to identify? Maybe someone paid by Laurels dad to say whatever?,htgawm,de6ipmm,2,t5_31rdt
10924280,0,t3_5w28al,Of course he was Wallace hired someone to take care of all the illegal crap at least thats what we saw last year and Annalise confirmed on this season finale,htgawm,de6rhoi,2,t5_31rdt
10929558,0,t1_de5ptez,She has lied about so much!! Obviously she would remember having a child but for whatever reason hid it and had someone else aka rose take care of them. Unsure of who the father is there will be a whole new back story maybe involving Mahoneys or maybe not as that wouldnt make sense  because of the timeline true. ,htgawm,de7b2e0,1,t5_31rdt
10938171,0,t3_5w6tjg,Not to mention she couldve been Atwoods niece thus having a lot of the same plot points involved or even Meggy being the one forging the forms.,htgawm,de871zv,3,t5_31rdt

10949134,0,t3_5w2cka,Its not so much the One Drop Rule as it was the custom to disown or not acknowledge a mixed race child. He may have been biracial but as he would have been a bastard in the legal sense he would have been seen only as the child of his mother who just so happenned to be a black woman who destroyed the Mahoney home. His nonblack heritage would be of no consequence as it would have been of no consequence as he was not acknowledged by his father.,htgawm,de9bqi8,2,t5_31rdt
10951578,0,t1_de999i2,Yes true! In effect my theory is a little bit a lot far fetched! Nonetheless Dominic did say to Laurels father we got a problem when he saw Connor running away... and since hell probably be in season hell probably be in contact with all the K... ,htgawm,de9kswh,1,t5_31rdt
10955313,0,t3_5w3866,This was my biggest question and one they should have answered. If it is laurels dad they should have told us and it might have made the reveal land a bit more for me. Im not mad at the show its probably just my least favourite twist so far.,htgawm,de9ynw2,1,t5_31rdt

10995049,0,t1_dea2i8m,They already closed the door on that plot when it was pinned on Wes.The show is getting repetitive at this point with its Scooby Doo format with the DA coming for Annalise EVERY season without fail.If they repeat that formula I would hope that they actually have a compelling DA which actually strikes at the consciences of K. Every DA depicted comes off like a tool. Sinclair looked deranged in how she interacted with them Atwood looked perpetually lost Denver was just laughable with that sandwich and while I dont recall the name of the first DA she had that How does she do it? attitude about her.,htgawm,dee966v,6,t5_31rdt
