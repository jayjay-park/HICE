11390169,0,t3_623d1i,Alexis looked sooo cute in this episode and all of her scenes with Ted were really funny. I cackled when she awkwardly danced backwards out of Teds office. Always nice to see Patrick and Stevie. This honestly might have been my favorite episode of the season! Also everyone was looking really sharp in that final scene. David looks so good in a slim Tshirt its a shame he always goes for those grandmother sweaters.,SchittsCreek,dfn2215,2,t5_35vhk
