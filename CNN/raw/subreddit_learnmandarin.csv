3333136,0,t3_2ycfud,I think our podcast is useful if you have kids you are teaching Chinese to. It might even help adults but the podcast is geared towards kids who already have a basic foundation. We need all the motivation we can get... give us suggestions and good ratings on iTunes to help us continue! ,learnmandarin,cp87c7i,1,t5_2saod

We definitely learn to readwrite best because we arent surrounded by native speakers but thats more of a geographical problem than it is a component of the classroom.,learnmandarin,crs9txg,2,t5_2saod
