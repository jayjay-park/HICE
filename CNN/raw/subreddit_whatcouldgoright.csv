The people who come here for dumbass stunts going right will be pissed off about all the gifs of dumbass stunts going wrong getting in the way of what theyre looking for and viceversa.  Both sides end up unhappy because they cant find what theyre looking for in the middle of all this shit that starts out the same but then ends the wrong way.
