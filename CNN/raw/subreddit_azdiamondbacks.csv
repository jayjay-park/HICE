Not playoffs good but maybe betterthan. good.Next few years should be pretty exciting as players develop. Stew seems to be going Oaklandesque in strategy acquire young cheap controllable highupside players built around a core of a couple stars. Once theyre near freeagency you flip them at peak value for the next wave. I dont expect them to buy an ace this year. Theyll want time to see what our young arms develop into over the course of next season since theres a ton of potential there. I think well be seeing a good amount of guys like Bradley Shipley and Blair once the Super risk is over. As for the Padres theyre in a position we arent. Thats why theyre making big moves right now. It sucks to see them suddenly get scary but theyve been working with a plan for quite a while  something I hope were working towards.Edit How about a conversation rather than a simple downvote?

So I think that should be a good thing for Luis Alejandro Basabe that he could potentially turn around and be a good hitter. He has good speed.

11289993,0,t3_6110md,Because Leyland is a jack ass. Sure Hosmer was swinging a hot bat but Stanton Arenado and McCutchen were all hitting under the Mendoza line for the entire classic leading into last nights game. Hosmer could have easily been the DH while Goldy played first. Even if he continued to struggle at least his defense would make up for it. I find it hard to believe there was no other options at third or outfield that forced the hand and made Goldy ride the pine. Hell Goldy would have been a better option at DH over Stanton in the last couple games. All those guys got twice the at bats that Goldy did.selfishIwantedtoseeGoldyplayrant,azdiamondbacks,dfbpday,5,t5_2sc56
