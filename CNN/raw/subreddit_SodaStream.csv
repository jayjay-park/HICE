634893,0,t3_21bow3,I love the diet lemon lime I pretty much only buy that and the crystal light fruit punch tonic and other non cola syrups. I agree the cola flavors dont taste like coke or pepsi. ,SodaStream,cgcfrs1,1,t5_2sfu9

11415824,0,t3_5s4nnl,Hi nd that request. Interested in alternative bottles or suitable adapter for use with other plastic bottles. Same reasons. Im aware that PET bottles from soft drink vendors can withstand pressures of up to  PSI or more. They are also commonly used by homebrewers for self carbonating brewed drinks. Each of the proprietary bottles being the same price as  full bottles of supermarket soft drink it would certainly reduce costs to be able to refill and carbonate the empty supermarket soft drink bottles. Any information about other peoples ideas appreciated.Cheers Peter,SodaStream,dfpz0ff,1,t5_2sfu9
