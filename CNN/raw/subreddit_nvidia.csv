2963230,0,t1_co4x1i6,Because if youre loading texture from both pools the combined bandwidth is GBs. If you only wanted to load textures from the .GB pool that would GBs but the drivers prevent that situation from happening. Also in practice thats not how the game engine is going to load textures.You can think of it as a torrent. If one user is giving me Mbs and the other is giving me Mbs Im getting Mbs. If only the one user had the file I needed I would either get Mbs or Mbs but if I want the whole thing Im getting Mbs.Also Nvidia drivers and the OS prevent cases where only the .GB is being accessed. And in game benchmarks thats what we see if theres a performance hit to having two separate pools its minor and imperceptible but we cant even be sure if there is one at all. On top of that we only get frame lag when the game is running on settings it cant handle regardless.SLI might be a different story no one that Im aware of has done much testing on it. Although the performance of  GTX in SLI are still value for money there might be a performance hit we dont know. It gets com,nvidia,co4xn2s,1,t5_2rlgy

On low settings I will only get around  fps on some maps and around  GPU usage when it should be at . Its really annoying. My old HD  outperformed my  on low settings. If you just look up GTX  low gpu usage you will find many forum posts of people with this issue. I dont think there is anything you can do to fix it because I think it might just be a driver issue that will have to be fixed by Nvidia someday. Some things that might fix it  Go into Nvidia control panelgtProgram Settings select BF.exegtPower Management ModegtPrefer Maximum Performance.  For BF.exe you can also change the CUDA GPUs to use these gpus and checkmark the gtx   Also if you are using one monitor set it to single display performance mode under the program settings. Then click apply to apply all these changes.  Do a clean install of the drivers.  Update your BIOS and possibly your VGA BIOS  If you are desperate Ive heard that reinstalling windows might work.   Make sure your motherboard is compatible for this card.  Make sure your CPU is not bottlenecking your GPU  Make sure your Power Supply is capable of running your rig  Make sure you have a PCI . or . slot for your GPU I think thats about everything I tried.

3470048,0,t3_2zyaj2,As someone who has spent a lot of time with multiple GPUs from both providers these are my observationsSoftware support     Shadowplay is a FANTASTIC recording software that takes up literally  performance. After using fraps on AMD and now this I would never go back. This alone is enough for me to get nvidia.     Better drivers while AMD usually has slightly better performance for price NVIDIA has always had better drivers. Meaning less glitches constant updates to ensure max performance on games.     Geforce experience is super easy and nice to use.     Quieter. Seriously AMD cards are loud as hell compared to Nvidia     Inventing random stuff. Nvidia seems to keep pushing out new ideas like the Shield or GRID streaming TXAA etc. None of which are particularly huge right now but are all nice touches and I think GRID is going to be big in the future.     Better multiGPU support. With AMD crossfireX I always had issues some games just straight up wouldnt use the second card a lot of dropped framescrashes. Just constant issues. With nvidia however it was practically Plug and play.,nvidia,cpnt6ir,5,t5_2rlgy

3707045,0,t3_32uqi8,Continuing what udownhillculture said...A second GTX  should get you to  fps or . I have a Titan X and I hover just below that. GTA V is getting reports that people are running stacked Vram on JUST THIS GAME so you may get  you may not. Otherwise youre stuck at four and everything maxed out for me at p is .GBs. The whole double ram thing wont start until games start using DX. The rumor of the GTA V sli vram doubling isnt actually accurate as it doubles the Vram requirements as well...meaning it isnt stacking it is just showing you that it is mirroring the data put on the vram.As for MSAA nobody even on p has been able to get a stable framerate from MSAA xx. It seems bugged somewhat as it drops the frame rate like a rock and laughs at you as it does it.NORMALLY a second  would get  more performance on most games. Not all games have good SLI support a lot do so YMMV. I had nothing but issues with my SLI setup as it would just do plain horrid on some games Wolfenstein and modded Skyrim and magical on others BF the Witcher . Personally I said fuck it and went for the most powerful single card the Titan X.The only two issues buying that is A Youll only ever match the  SLI on a very small number of games but OCin gets you close to the stock speed of SLI. In a lot of cases you do surpass the x. In almost all cases you end up having better frame times and less stuttering with more Vram.Im warning you the second reason gets very ranty as I want someone other than my wife to read this.B The only place that has it available is the Nvidia store. Nvidia uses digital river for its transactions. While Nvidia is great by themselves digital river is almost hilariously incompetent. DR said they wouldnt charge me before it shipped yet put a hold of that money on my account and tried verifying it was me who bought the card. The guy who literally only called me once in the span of a minute called sounding very annoyed and angrying grunting YOU BETTER CALL ME BY THIS AFTERNOON TO VERIFY YOU ORDER OR IM CANCELING IT IN A COUPLE HOURS. ASK FOR . Well it took me hours to get to a hold of someone in his department. Then my product shipped....at PM the next day. Got the card just yesterday when I ordered it Friday morning. Fun times. Gets better though they also put a restriction on the shipping that says you cant customize the delivery or have FedEx hold the package at a location. Thats right they have to deliver it to you in person. If you call them to have it removed Digital Rivers says WE CANT CHANGE IT! WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE NO MO and Fedex will understandably say We cant registrations placed by the sender. Yet they have the audacity to NOT put signature confirmation on the package that I waited all day for so the FedEx guys get to just leave it on my porch out in the open.Yayyyy.Edit Fixed an inaccuracy in the first paragraph.,nvidia,cqetu44,1,t5_2rlgy

3721845,0,t1_cqggxts,I did a lot of research on this before I bought the tv and I have read that post and was aware of that issue. Sony along with many others did some clever math to try and fit a K signal thru HDMI .. What they came up with was that they were able to do that but not at  frames which is fine if youre watching movies but not so much for gaming. They can however reduce the color space and fit  frames through at K. This they call HDMI .B. HDMI .A would allow a  color space where HDMI .B can only do a reduced color space of . I thought thats fine since I doubt Id notice the excess colors and even still am very happy with the TV but was just curious as to why some options would show up and some would not when it made very little sense.

I watch the showsmovies on the p since I can see pixelation in anything below p. The internet here is slow...When it comes to desktop space p is brilliant for programming it is a dream as I have so much space to have the information open that I need. I do have to say my reflexes in FPS games have slowed as I dont see changes as quick as my eyes have to travel further compared to my  p screen so it takes a while to get used a larger screen I dont think the resolution is the problem here.When it comes to image quality p is brilliant as most p screens use IPS panels. The colour is just amazing and you can see this in games as well. The only problem I sometimes experience with p is that older games that have dynamic resolution support the game itself isnt limited to a set amount of resolutions the textures look absolutely horrible compared to p as older games used lower res textures.When it comes t games I do have to say I like it a lot more since the screen is bigger I feel a lot more immersed into the specific world I am currently playing in also you dont have the problem of being able to see pixels like on larger p screens. Visuals look great I recently finished GTA  and I just loved how it looked like on the screen. Also you can turn down AA a lot not completely off or very low like on K screens but you can turn it down quite a bit compared to p so by default you have less jaggies.But in general just having more resolution in general is great.,nvidia,crici68,2,t5_2rlgy

DirectD  levels of article  DirectD sfw gtDirectD  requires graphics hardware conforming to feature levels  and  which support virtual memory address translations. It introduces a revamped resource binding model allowing explicit control of memory using descriptor heaps and tables. This model is supported on majority of existing desktop GPU architectures and requires WDDM . drivers. Supported hardware is divided into three Resource Binding tiers which define maximum numbers for descriptor heaps used for CBV constant buffer view SRV shader resource view and UAV unordered access view CBVs and SRVs per pipeline stage UAVs for all pipeline stages samplers per stage and SRV descriptor tables. Tier  hardware such as AMD GCN has no limitations allowing fully bindless resources managed through dynamic memory heap while Tier  Nvidia Fermi Intel HaswellBroadwell and Tier  Nvidia KeplerMaxwell Intel Skylake hardware impose some limits on the number of these resources.  gtInteresting DirectX | Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform | DDX | Comparison of OpenGL and DirectD Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcsekep oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecsekep.

4214774,0,t3_3963ij,A few questions need to be answered before you determine this man. Like for instance what resolutionfps combo are you trying to hit p  fps.....p? p?Then when you are in a game make sure you have a GPU monitoring overlay like MSI afterburner to see your GPU usage.Apply the resolution you want and you need to look at the numbers for your GPU usage. Are you getting your target resolutionfps combo you want? Keep raising it until you drop under your target fps. Then take a look at your GPU usage is it at ? Yes? Then you are being bottlenecked by your GPU at that resolutionfps and you really shouldnt upgrade your CPU.No? Then you are being bottlenecked by your processor more than likely and you probably should upgrade.Keep in mind you need to try this with many different games. Games that arent massively online are going to take up far less CPU resources than games that are like Planetside  or MMOs for instance. Basically its your call.I dont think you will have a problem with most games but heavily online ones like the ones I named you probably wont keep a consistant framerate. Hell I have a i k OCd to . GHZ and I still drop to like  fps on Planetside in massive fights because its so CPU demanding.Lastly the reason I look at the GPU usage capping to determine this is because you cant really rely on threadnumber usage on CPU monitoring programs for your CPU capping. Lots of games dont optimize well for CPUs and even though your CPU is making you lag it wont show youre maxed out on all cores for some games so its best to find your GPU cap first and work down from there.,nvidia,cs0o2y0,4,t5_2rlgy

4480277,0,t3_3cf1dr,Simply stating that your GPU is at  most of the time means next to nothing.  There are TWO reasons why a card will downclock itself from its highest available boostA As you mentioned TEMPERATURE  c is pretty much where throttling beginsB POWER LIMIT  being reached.  Typically you would never know this number  limit unless you install some OC software and inspect it.As others have pointed out and youve determined most likely you are hitting right on c and getting throttled.  Download EVGA Precision X and set up a custom fan curve so that your card is at about  fan speed at c and  fan speed by c.  This should keep you from hitting the c limit!,nvidia,csven52,1,t5_2rlgy
4487986,0,t3_3cj68k,I have a reference OCd at . None of the other cards were available when I desperately wanted to upgrade.  Correct me if Im wrongbut those OC speeds are greater than any of the stock speeds the variants offer.I bought a NZXT Kraken and mm AIO cooler and put some vram heatsinks on it. Runs c full load. With my OC I cant imagine I could get many more frames out of the card if I had waited to get some other variant that wasnt available at the time. While some would argue the  FPS is well worth it I say meh. Whatever card you get if you dont plan on putting any aftermarket coolers make sure it runs cool. You can easily OC any of the cards but the heat is going to be the biggest concern. While some cards will obviously overclock higher than others my scenarios reference   should be bottom line.

Ofcourse there is no simplegt DoAsyncShadersfunction like you are saying. There is no gt DoTesselationx either. Yet we do have it. gt Being a lowlevel API you can go closer to the metal and basically build features out of that.

6079164,0,t1_cyg073f,You need to actually understand why Maxwell made such a powerful gaming performance leap from Kepler.  It isnt just magic that is now a standard increase for future generations.In designing Maxwell Nvidia had to make some tradeoffs for creating such huge increases in performance this deep into a node cycle. Making their architecture more efficient and more focused cutting back on compute and streamlining task scheduling for DX yielded great results.However these now strippeddown features of Maxwell are ones that DX applications will employ.  GMXX represents an extremely well polished and efficient architecture for current gen but you cant expect the extreme performance optimization of  years on the same process and API to carry over.More transistors doesnt always mean incredible performance increases.  Look at Intels cumulative performance gains from all the die shrinks starting with an even bigger fab than weve been stuck on nm Sandy Bridge to nm Skylake.  Not too impressive.However the performance per watt has skyrocketed which is more likely what we will see with PascalArctic Islands.,nvidia,cyggmub,5,t5_2rlgy

6180316,0,t3_407ygv,Usually good for me too but generally I have the luxury of not depending on SLI to game happily. In the past I would pair up an aging card with another to help both along for another generation as I did with a GTX  and a GTX  previously.This time around I just went crazy and got two brand new and overpriced cards. I actually game in K though so the VRAM is nice to not worry about.Anyway the lack of SLI support is definitely disappointing in games. But as long as enough main titles support it its worth it to me. And as unoremac said you can just get on games later when they have proper SLI support.Edit DX will be fantastic but I dont expect perfect  VRAM stacking. I imagine you still need at least some common content in memory to render for the same scene.Maybe you can have one card do certain character models and textures while another does world rendering.

6914573,0,t3_4ag2ib,if your spending an obscene amount of money on a cutting edge computer this close to the release of polarispascal GPUs then you are basically flushing your money down the toilet. If you need a flagship GPU setup right now and money does not matter then i would say ti for Single card rigs and FuryX for dual card rigs.when in SLI the GPUs share memory and memory bandwidth so the massive bit memory bus of the FuryX does come into play. Also the AMD cards scale more efficiently in SLI than NvidiaMaxwell cards and there are even cases like in Rise of the Tomb raider where AMD cards are scaling . in SLI which has never happened with any graphics card in history.also AMD architecture is much more advanced for next gen DX games and for Virtual Reality Nvidia cut alot of design corners to make maxwell fast in DX and power efficient and now their cards are getting curb stomped by the GraphicsCoreNext architecture in the latest games coming out. Even in DX AMD cards are winning on some of these games without the extra DX features being leveraged,nvidia,d103837,6,t5_2rlgy
6921296,0,t3_4ag5k2,So first off full disclaimer  my systems are all AMD. My own desktop is an FX R x beast. The desktops I built for my brothers are both midrange AMDAMD computers as well. Im not a fanboy for one side or the other I just currently prefer AMD mostly due to priceperformance being better and partly because of NVidias business practices.Now that being disclosed lets talk up NVidia a bit. We dont actually know if Async Compute will be important. DX isnt really in use yet. Remember a new API takes years to get any real traction. Hell there are still some games being updated to DX now let alone DX. Its growing a lot faster than DX with it being added into several major game engines now. But... Until DX actually starts getting used in any real capacity we dont know how important Async Compute really will be.Next were in a weird generation in terms of GPUs. NVidias  series cards are old in a way. The GTX  launched in September . Its now over a year old. The  series launched in the middle of  but it was mostly rebadges. So all the cards available are old news. The cards being released this year which we still have very little information about they could be completely new and different. The NVidia cards could gain something to bring them inline with AMDs Async Compute. It could have those extra components. So I wouldnt take NVidias current offerings as anything indicative of their true performance in DX because the next generation of cards are going to be the true DX cards.This is all a bunch of speculation right now. We dont really know enough to say anything conclusively. The only thing we know for sure is that the  and  series cards by NVidia will not fully support Async Compute at a hardware level which is where it actually matters. Beyond that? We dont know if the  series will support it. We dont know if it will matter anyway.Just trying to keep things even in this discussion NVidia is being slammed a lot for something that might not matter. Believe me theres a lot you can slam NVidia for. Lets just try and make sure its for stuff that they should be criticized for.,nvidia,d10upgm,6,t5_2rlgy

I know the difference.AMD has Dynamic Vsync but through a third party program that hardly works.Edit To all the kids who downvoted me because theyre obviously ignorant on this subject Adaptive Vsync and GSync are two totally different technologies. As you may or may not know Adaptive vsync disables Vsync if you go below the fps cap that Vsync has. Gsync Adjusts the monitor refresh rate to match your fps. FreeSync is almost the same as Gsync they both do the same thing but to my knowledge FreeSync is more software based than hardware. As of me typing this comment AMD has no official technology that does the same thing as Adaptive VSYNC the only way to get something similar to that is Dynamic Vsync through a rd party program called RadeonPro however this program hasnt been updated in almost two years and doesnt work with some newer games.,nvidia,d1vfaap,-13,t5_2rlgy

VRAM issue is BECAUSE the misadvertised ROP and Cache the ROP and L Cache that come with it are the cores that grab data from VRAM and do some final math before sending to elsewhere example to do antialiasing colour correction transforming to some other format the screen prefers etc... and the missing ROPs that made the last . GB of VRAM be slow the existing amount of ROPs are sufficient only to process .GB of data in a frame thus to use the actually existing full GB of RAM the GPU need to process .GB of Data first THEN process the reaming .GB.I believe this might have been yield problems in the manufacturing? So they binned s that have the exact amount of ROPs as the  advertisements claimed that were faulty regarding some ROPsL cache of those ROPs as  maybe?,nvidia,d22gkej,1,t5_2rlgy

7398514,0,t1_d2hega7,No its not true.  SPIRV is a neutral intermediate language being deployed for GPUs.  It is used by OpenCL and shader code.  CUDA uses PTXParallel Thread Execution.  PTX is compiled against VMs that match Nvidia GPUs but not so much that the code isnt portable.  CUDA still has a purpose.  SPIRV is basicly like a Kronos version of PTX that will allow much greater portability of compiled code and interoperability in their ecosystem.  Its great in that respect.  Kernel source code no longer has to be directly exposed so the obstacle for proprietary code is removed and that will make it more attractive to commercial developers.

If your desktop isnt set in a DSR resolution it forces Hz but if your desktop is set in the DSR res your games should have the same feel at the same framerate because DSR on your desktop somehow breaks the Hz barrier and lets you use Hz Hz etc. Its kind of a hassle to switch my desktop to K when I want to play a game in K Hz.

We now know that at least one manufacturer covers the card still under warranty then there is no real reason he would need to stick strictly to MSI. You are mistaking thegoal of his post To get a red and black graphic card. with your research result does MSI void the warranty. Heck if he does get MSI then he doesnt even need to worry about warranty becuase he doesnt need to paint it. Two.  Now you are just playing semantics. The last time I checked the most commonly used aerosol version of plastidip used by modders is considered to be spray paint by most retailers.

I guess along the same lines can you talk a little bit about the Founders Edition of the new gaming products? Is that different from previous reference designs that youve done? Is there any difference in economics to NVIDIA if you sell Founders Edition?JenHsun Huang  CoFounder President CEO amp DirectorgtThe Founders Edition is something we did as a result of demand from the end user base. The Founders Edition is basically designed by  wholly designed by NVIDIA product. A reference design is really not designed to be an end product. Its really designed to be a reference for manufacturers to use as a starting point. But the Founders Edition is designed so that it could be manufactured it could be marketed and customers can continue to buy it from us for as long as they desire. Now our strategy is to support our global network of addin card partners and well continue do that. We gave them  we gave everybody reference designs like we did before.gtAnd in this particular case we created the Founders Edition so that people who like to buy directly from us people who like our industrial design and people who would like the exquisite design and quality that comes with our products that we can do. And so its designed to be extremely overclockable. Its designed with all the best possible components. And if somebody would like to buy products directly from us they have the ability to do that.gtI expect that the vast majority of the addin cards will continue to be manufactured by our addin card partners and thats our expectation and thats our hope. And I dont expect any dramatic change in the amount of shifting of that. So thats basically it.

7696815,0,t1_d3h1rj3,okay so. According to the article it seems board partners of AMD are experimenting with some heavy factory overclocking and custom cooling sollutions on the polaris  cards. And advanced custom cooling is expensiveLets say youre a budget builder planning to spend  on a GPU. to make you buy a  or usd card itd need to perform great fancy cooler or not. SOME could be swayed with great thermals and low noise but most people would loook at the FPS. AMDs board partners know this. they KNOW that if they are to sell cards with expensive coolers it needs to perform according to price. You need performance justifying the premium! And how do you get that performance? You overclock! But the problem is that even then the gains need to be good enough to justify it. If you cant overclock them enough then you cant manage to justify the expenses to most people and you wont sell the card.And THAT is where this article comes in. It implies the board partners are making said expensive and great cooling solutions. on budget cards. So that means they expect to sell said card too! And to sell it needs to perfom!See what this implies? That the architecture used for polaris and vega in the future is overclocking friendly enough to give them the margins needed to justify an other extra increase in cost for the more premium card versions.It is simply the fact that using said coolers which is heavily implied in the article is not worth it unless it reflects itself in measurable performance. And the only way to do that is by overclocking.,nvidia,d3h2t6j,2,t5_2rlgy

Also important to note Manufacturers both Nvidia or AIB arent to blame for vendors price gouging or dropping it unless they themselves lower the card officially. Nvidia and AIBs themselves usually have an MSRP in their press releases.European prices  FEs MSRP in Germany   Euro on launch day and on some gaugers still its over that on other stores its under the MSRP by quite a bit.The lowest KFA card is basically European bottom end MSRP which is the starting point that determine all other prices depending on how custom and fancy youll get.

So unless between putting your credit card in and clicking finalise order NewEgg get a change of heart I cant see these extra s of dollars rolling in.

8248226,0,t3_4sdw1f,I returned mine last week. The fan revving issue is a problem turns on and off so often you can hear it during intense gaming session.But thats not the reason I returned mine. Out of factory mine came in unstable screen flickering artifacts I think out of the factory this card was not cut to be extreme. I tried underclocking and that didnt do anything.... uninstalled the drivers and reinstalled and that didnt help. Tried to do a clean install with DDU hoping maybe it was a driver issue but that didnt fix it. Also the firestorm software the card ships out with is crap. Their support is average at best. Just hard to get any help when needed with Zotac. Overall I am disappointed from one of the most EXPENSIVE cards out there.  As the reviews says this card just cant OC if you want out of factory card this is nice the LED lights are bright but those can be adjusted the LED effects on this card are very nice too. But keep in mind this card is huge and will definitely have some bend to it when you put it in your rig unless you put some support bards on it. The card runs very cool even during benchmarking the card rarely went above c in my rig but unfortunately couldnt play or complete any benchmarks because the card I got was factory defective due to artifacts screen flickering. ,nvidia,d58l18s,1,t5_2rlgy
8252583,0,t1_d5930ez,The  is a valid choice for p if you have the budget and want some eye candy.According to this review the  already cant do p with max settings in Crysis  Hitman and Witcher . And in Rise of the Tomb Raider it averages  fps which means there will be frequent dips below  and that causes stutter if vsync is on. The  can hit p with some combination of settings they just wont always be the max. And it only gets worse with time.But the  will let you max out just about anything at p. Some games it can max out well enough that there is headroom to crank up nicer antialiasing. And it will probably be able to max out or nearly max out games a few years from now while the  will really start to struggle.tldr Do you want a graphics card that can get by at your resolution and refresh rate or do you want a graphics card that is comfortable there?I dont know numbers for the other resolutions listed but similar logic applies. There are cards that are good to enough to handle a resolution  for p and there are cards that are great enough to excel at that resolution  for p. If that list is of the former and you want the latter you may need to adjust it.,nvidia,d594n3o,5,t5_2rlgy

Note how the  Ti moves places between the the p and k tests. We see a different picture in Deus Ex however with the Fury X moving beyond these margin of error variances. This is a huge deal which is why Im making this point to start with.gt Re Doom i did see that NVidia was supposed to be working on their implementation to bring out better performance. The fact that NVidia demoed the vulkan version would make me question those devs making the game run better on AMD cards.Its common knowledge by now that Nvidia runs the OpenGL version a lot better. The demo was probably simply to demonstrate Nvidia cards had Vulkan support.gt Its so interesting you bringing up that the  is ahead of a ti when some in this sub say theyre the same specifically when a Fury X manages to edge a  out. Stock for stock the  is ahead of the  Ti. Its the overclocked performance where you see the gap closing in cases with the  Ti actually exceeding the performance of the . The problem is that most of these benchmarks are done with the  Ti at stock clocks aka  MHz or so which pretty much no one runs at.Even if you disregard this point looking at the Hitman tests even in DX which gave the Fury X a larger lead over the  Ti the  was almost  FPS ahead of the Fury X which makes me curious why this is the case.

Ive had friends say that the rd party distributors Amazon NewEgg ect. can and sometimes do charge for RMAs that EVGA has said they will try and provide for free to anyone with this defect and the cards they got back were faulty because they werent tested. If anyone is going to RMA be sure to pick EVGA theyre going to test for the issue and not charge and give an Advance RMA when applicable.

No the ideal resolution is k x. On the desktop then you have nice crisp font with x scaling in games you set the render to x which on a k panel upscales and looks exactly like a p panel  pixels just act as .On a  monitor however x would be an acceptable gaming resolution and it doubles to x for a desktop resolution with nice clean font scaling. No blurriness from the upscaling when you game its basically as if you are running on a x monitor. I admit a k monitor would be better but its  that shit is tiny already.,nvidia,d77h8x6,3,t5_2rlgy

9221084,0,t1_d8khj9u,Benchmarks Ive seen show it can hit just over  fps in AAA games at max settings but it often dips below. I dont have GSync yet so that might as well be  fps for me or a  ticket to Tear City heh.That said the benchmarks out there are iffy. Some have AA on. Some are at stock clocks Id water cool a Titan since the stock cooler is such a piece of crap. Some are probably out of date. Contemplating the Titan and also SLI has been a bad combination of extreme cost and lack of information to make an informed decision.If I had GSync Id probably pull the trigger on a Titan but nobody sells  k GSync screens and I want it to have the same pixel density as my existing monitors. GSync k only come in   and  for whatever reason maxing about  DPI instead of  DPI. I tried mixed densities before and it relegates the other monitors to secondary parking space instead of peers which all get used at once. That and it seems a high refresh k monitor may come out in the next few months and I figure its worth waiting for that. Not many things will run k  high refresh but I figure itd be nice to have the option for older games or future GPUs and could run some games at a lower res if it suited them.Right now Im waiting for that monitor and waiting to see if a fullfat Titan comes out by the time the monitor is out while sometimes thinking I should just blow my money now heh. Also waiting on Kaby Lake. I dont usually wait for new tech but right now it seems like a bunch of things are just about to come out and will be worth waiting a short amount of time for.

9249033,0,t3_57270o,CSGO isnt a good benchmark of gpu performance. Try something like crysis  the Witcher  doom  or maybe rise of the tomb raider.Since youre playing at p btw sli s is really dumb for a p monitor no matter the refresh rate your cpu is bottlenecking you.Yes yes you have an i k but that doesnt matter. The higher the fps youre pushing the more draw calls youre creating for your cpu to render geometry etc etc and eventually it will hit its cap. At lower resolutions like p compared to p or k gpu power is much easier to bottleneck than at the higher resolutions. You can see the trend when comparing the relative performance margins of a  to something like a  at p vs k or even p.At p a GTX  will likely hit the cpu cap especially on a game like CSGO only using like you said  or more likely spiking to  usage. While a  on the other hand will likely struggle to max out a GPUs frame rate via likely hitting its own  usage before hitting the max cpu fps.Crank the resolution up and the number of draw calls the cpu has to make will go down as the gpu has to work harder. At k youll notice both GPUs will obviously produce less frames but the  will produce a larger marginal percentage less than the . Essentially your problem is what you have done to yourself.Youve purchased  beastly graphics cards and made them work together to achieve a simple task. Like asking  excavators to dig holes to bury goldfish. The excavators are going to have to wait for you to put the damn goldfish into the hole before they can move on.Edit also Arma is an awful game to benchmark GPUs in. The game seema like it should be optimized to work on an entire cpu using all its cores and threads but it primarily uses a single thread on a single core to do its geometry draw calls.

Probably a bug or something.But regardless of CPU usage while most of the time fps is solid Ill see fps drop lt   x on SLI Titan XPs depending on the action and GPU usage on both near max.,nvidia,d8xj9mx,4,t5_2rlgy
9322235,0,t3_584nf7,When thinking about the cost of the Titan XP remember to factor in that it has a completely inadequate cooler on it and you either need to replace it more time and hassle and probably water cooling which is even more time hassle and extreme cost if you arent already using it or set it to an obscenely loud fan to get good clocks out of the card.OTOH the ti will have AIB versions with various cooler designs so it will be good to go out of the box. Unless you want to water cool it anyway in which case it makes no real difference other than the possibility of prefitted water block versions.While the leaked specs may turn out to be true I am sceptical of them. There are two leaks which contradict each other and cannot both be right. There are some dodgy things about the leak almost everyone seems to believe like the numbers on it clearly being photoshopped although that could just be how whoever found the info decided to present it and it may still be legit info. A lot of tech YouTubers and bloggers seem to have believed one of the leaks but Ive seen no justification for why they believe it other than that a bunch of similar people are also putting it on their sites with nothing to back it up. Maybe they all know something like a trusted source that they cant say but it seems more like everyone takes it seriously because everyone else takes it seriously and nobody actually knows anything yet. I mean everyone thought Pascal consumer GPUs was going to have HBM or HBM until the things literally launched.I am going to be disappointed if the ti doesnt match or beat the Titan XP specwise and thus massively beat it when you factor in the cooler issues. I dont know whats going to happen but I hope NVidia use a fullfat GP because yields should be improving now and demand for the workstation cards those chips were going to is presumably decreasing and freeing up capacity for gaming cards to start using them. And because the Titan XP isnt quite there for kultra and we can use all the extra we can get.Similarly if the leak that says its DDR and not DDRX is true then thats really sad even if the bandwidth still beats a . k needs that extra bandwidth badly in places e.g. scenes with lots of transparency still hurt even a Titan XP in k.Im waiting for the ti hoping that it is better than the Titan XP and we potentially have a Pascal Titan Black to follow it like the generation before last. If it isnt then its going to suck as I waited another  months and the best option will still be the card I could have already bought with my savings and still be the stupid card with the inadequate cooler that has to be replaced to work optimally.,nvidia,d8xnu20,2,t5_2rlgy

Halon is a highly effective agent for firefighting in closed passenger carrying areas. Due to its effectiveness and relatively low toxicity the FAA continues to recommend or require Halon extinguishers for use on commercial aircraft.Extensive toxicity evaluations have been compiled by nationally recognized United States medical laboratories and institutions on Halon  and Halon . These evaluations have shown that Halon  and Halon  are two of the safest clean extinguishing agents available. Dual Halon concentrations of about  by volume in air are adequate to extinguish fires of most combustible materials.

Honestly just buy one GPU you think suits you best and roll with it. You REALLY cant go wrong with any choice from a well known company. Its kind of like choosing a chocolate candy bar they all are basically the same minus some small details and either way you still get the chocolate you wanted. With that said Id recommend holding out on buying an EVGA card for now. I LOVE my  FTW even with the current issues but until they iron out the little bugs Its currently a hard sell. Theyre a great company though and stand by their products just for now its not your best option IMO. If you like the EVGA cards Id wait a month and see how everything plays out Im sure retailers will get updated versions once EVGA gets the ball rolling and go from there.

9588182,0,t1_d9uwsxt,gt Also if you knew about Fast Sync then you would be jumping to support this post instead. Fast Sync reducing load on your GPUAgain you dont know what you are talking about. Fast Sync does not reduce GPU load whatsoever. As opposed to VSYNC and frame rate capping while using Fast Sync your GPU will still render all the frames its capable of regardless of your monitors frame rate. It reduces tearing by locking the monitor scan to its refresh rate but it will still render at full capacity. This is why input lag is greatly reduced compared to VSYNC although its not eliminated as you mentioned.Lets say you are playing CSGO on a hz monitor and your GPU is capable of rendering fps. If you use VSYNC your card will render frames exactly at your monitors refresh rate fps. If the GPU is not able to render fps it will lock at half the refresh rate fps. With Fast Sync your card will render as many frames as it can fps even if only  of them reach your montor per second.Please educate yourself on these topics before spreading misinformation here.,nvidia,d9uxtmw,2,t5_2rlgy

9971273,0,t1_db60tr7,Socket LGA  CPUs like i K are dual channel. Only LGA  CPUs use quad channel RAM. Quad channel memory has higher bandwidth but no latency benefit. Latency is more important for games in general.Memory latency is one of many factors affecting CPU performance. Using very slow RAM can manifest as higher than expected CPU load for a given game. This is because the CPU is considered busy if its waiting on data from memory.Given that your GPU load is in the high s you are not being CPURAM limited. The OP from the link I posted above was getting very low GPU usage  with fps. This is also from rCompetitiveoverwatch so many players there will use lower settings in order to get extremely high FPS gt Playing at very high FPS is much more demanding on CPURAM.The TLDR for RAM in Overwatch If you play at normal FPS just avoid ultracheap RAM and you will be fine. If you play at very high FPS  you will probably benefit from fast RAM like DDR  or DDR ,nvidia,db7a891,1,t5_2rlgy

Id rather just have the iGPU and save on batteryweight of the laptop. Another advantage is you can upgrade GPUs without changing your laptop.Even if youll be gaming away from home you can always take the eGPU enclosure with you though personally I dont usually game while on vacation but the problem will be the monitor. If you could loop the output of the card in the eGPU back into the laptop and render on its screen thatd be awesome.Either way I think Ill wait for Ryzen APUs in H  before I upgrade my laptop.

10106862,0,t3_5klahi,To be honest I used to hear a lot when I was using ATIs how much better the UI of NVidias graphics settings were. Changed over for an unrelated issue Great deal on a card and personally found that the new driver setup to me felt horrible. There was one slider for ALL graphics settings which is great if you werent a power user but all the functionalities I wanted to tweak were behind an additional window. It also loaded slower and really didnt offer the information in a better or a more intuitive way.Who knows how it feels now and I became much more apathetic about it. I dont think they even use Catalyst Control Center anymore. I looked at a video a while back about Radeon Software Crimson and it looked interesting as it would eliminate the need for fan controloverclocking programs as well. At the end of the day though its not something I will throw my purchase power behind Ill just go like ever other rational human and get the best deal on performance at the time of purchase unless you have to have the newest thing and have a large disposable income.,nvidia,dboxoyd,0,t5_2rlgy

Also gt The rest is just charging more because they know businesses will pay it because its no different than buying another server or any other business cost for them. Being a business doesnt automatically justify paying more for anything. The price differences between business and consumer products is due to the discrepancy of units that are likely to be sold over a products lifetime. There are always more consumers than businesses and somethings got to cover the  million or whatever cost of development. If NVIDIA is marking up the price for no reason competition from AMD can easily swoop up a good chunk of the market with lower priced WX cards. However we see the same story from AMD with inflated prices of workstation cards and for the same reason above.The only condition under which a product can be given a huge price markup because they know X would pay it is when there is no competition i.e. GTX   Titan X Pascal.,nvidia,dbthipa,2,t5_2rlgy

10873661,0,t3_5vdz32,Generally all the comments here are pretty accurate.  Youll get some bottleneck but theres always going to be some bottleneck in your system.  The bottleneck you worry about however is the type where you see severe bottlenecking because of components.Your CPU is still strong enough that you wont see the latter type of bottleneck yet.  Also since youre running one card youre less likely to see bottlenecks compared to say SLI. Yes overclocking your CPU will give you some of the performance back that you could be missing due to bottlenecking.  However youll probably want to play around a bit to see whether overclocking the CPU or the GPU ends up giving you better and smoother framerates.  Id wager that a CPU overclock will be a bit more helpful in that regard before worrying about the GPU.,nvidia,de1jh7y,1,t5_2rlgy

I like to run my games in fullscreen windowed mode because it allows me to tab over to other apps without leaving the game. However I have two issues Occasionally when I open a game in fullscreen windowed mode the GPU never activates the D mode so nearly all games run around fps. The fans do not even turn on. If I reboot sometimes it fixes itself. However other times it does not.  If I change the game to fullscreen when this issue occurs it runs the GPU correctly but when I go back to fullscreen windowed the GPU goes into a lowpower mode. When the game runs at fps in fullscreen windowed mode and I alttab out so that another app is in focus the games fps rises to the level I would expect while playing. This makes no sense to me. GSync does not seem to do anything when games are fullscreen. I have GSync set to work in fullscreen and windowed mode however when I play in fullscreen the framerate goes way higher than  and gameplay is noticeably less smooth.

11124464,0,t1_desxstk,You do have the benefit of additional power phases on thirdparty cards. This can help with stability but there are many cases of GTX  Founders cards overclocking higher than AIB Partner cards.For what its worth I would just get the card now if I were you. Im a fan of blower style coolers myself simply because it keeps the rest of my components cooler. It doesnt dump heat into the case like open air coolers. EDIT Another factor to consider is that you dont have to worry about issues with the thirdparty custom PCB or coolers having problems if you get a reference card. With the GTX  there were some cards that had to be shipped back or customers had to add VRM thermal pads to fix overheating issues. So peace of mind is another good reason to get the NVIDIA reference design.,nvidia,desy5w2,5,t5_2rlgy

I think you seem to think that the GP on the GTX  ti is one that didnt make the cut and because of this they throw it into the  ti bin.However you should know that the memory modules on a PCBPrinted Circuit Board are not on the GPU die like HBM is for AMD. The memory is added separately and is not integrated into the GPU core it just communicates with it. Here is an example of a GPU layout.So NVIDIA chooses the type of VRAM it wants to put on the PCB just like you choose your ram for your motherboard. The Micron memory on the  ti is a higher base frequency and tightertiming VRAM. They chose not to put GB on the card because they feel it wouldnt be utilized by its target audience. Titan X targets a different audience than gamers and is more for productivity. So to put it into perspective the Titan X has more slower vram. Its not vram that is just clocked lower it is different entirely and is actually olderslower. NVIDIA is putting new and faster vram on the  ti and advanced s.,nvidia,deu8fxk,1,t5_2rlgy

I can only do  Hz for example because thats all my cards support and they wont hit that framerate in recent games.

On the other hand my old monitor didnt have Gsync before so maybe  Hz looks smoother on this one. Ill have a better idea when my card can actually drive games at that res.Initially I was a little hesitant on keeping it but the more I use it the more I like it.

Im attempting to lower the stock temps to hopefully mid s while OCed and dare I say it even reduce the fan speed.  Might be a pipe dream but Im doing what I can for now.  I purchased a twin pack of Corsairs Magnetic Levitation case fans that supposedly do a fantastic job  moving air quickly and quietly... even  high speeds.  So Im planning on raising the curve on the my case fans after install.Another thing Im considering is buying a better PSU w a better fan as my case has only  fans aside from the PSU equating to .  The EVGA W G Gold PSU looks promising and will likely order tonight.Anyone else got the coldest case air in the game and found your ti runs cooler as a result?  I have to say... I think Arctic products have let me down for the last time and Im not going to risk messing up my ti on one of their maybe will work cooler kits.  So outside of EVGA EK I dont even consider looks like its the best we got.  I would hope theyd reduce the price eventually or even immediately after potential backlash.

I mainly play Rocket League and Overwatch and switching between Gsync and ULMB along with my monitors refresh rate and colors is a NIGHTMARE.  I have to do this for each game even when I have specific profiles set for said games.  What sucks is I know the optimal video settings are out there for each game but the amount of tweaking that is required to get there is very frustrating.ULMB is a perfect example.  Its a great and promising feature especially in Overwatch  but in Rocket League I get so much more tearing and artifacting and im not even going to go into Fullscreen vs Windowed Mode vs Borderless.  In Overwatch ULMB  Fast Sync seemed to help alleviate the background artifacts but in Rocket League I cannot achieve these results.  Gsync seems to provide a smoother experience over all in Rocket League  which sucks because im running a gtx  and I should be able to use ULMB.  Anyways thats my little rant.

Also dont confuse my buying preferences for me being an amd fanboy. I have a . The only and main reason why i even brought it up was because he has a free sync monitor. not because i think ti isnt worth it or anything. ,nvidia,dgmps8d,1,t5_2rlgy
11706171,0,t1_dgmwz17,gt I was more wondering wether the card would work with my motherboard and with windows .PCIe slot is PCIe so card should work. The fast UEFI boot feature might not work well with a regular older gpu bios. Need to read the motherboard vendor manual to sort any minor issues.Windows  driver wise. Obviously theyll be no more optimization or serious game bugfixes for future games. Security fixes only.GEFORCE . DRIVER WHQL a late  driver.How well itll work with latest windows  version creators update idk but whql drivers are mandatory.,nvidia,dgmx567,1,t5_2rlgy

11777480,0,t3_681vyu,I think AMD have created and cultivated a cult like following of which a defining trait is opposition to NVIDIA and Intel. Like if you compare rAMD with rnvidia youll see that in rAMD lots of the posts are about bad things that NVIDIA does and AMD allegedly doesnt while in rnvidia there are no such posts. People might point to this thread but honestly its one of the very few threads regarding AMD Ive seen on here.So its not that people on here are unaware of AMD products they just dont give a shit. If NVIDIA does something bad nobody is surprised on here because NVIDIA is a fucking corporation which is about making money for shareholders. Like the price hike for the original  FE didnt lead to people making excuses for NVIDIA people thought it sucked. Corporations do bad things NVIDIA Intel AMD you name it.I think it would be a boon to the AMD community if they let go of the fanboyism and hailcorporate toxicity I think both of those aspects can be off putting to many people. Probably not going to happen though as I said AMD themselves are cultivating this attitude through their marketing.,nvidia,dgv0jg3,3,t5_2rlgy

It doesnt appear to be temperature or power limit related as Ive seen it go down even under C and well under the power limit. I wish we couldve told it what voltages to run. Ive set  for example and it goes above to  at first and then drops to  or even  at the same voltage.

One game my GT crapped out was in ROTR with only  fps on the lowest settings. I still managed to finish the game. So  should provide playable framerate in a graphics dependent game like ROTR and ROTR is quite a graphically demanding game. ,nvidia,dgxrz7e,3,t5_2rlgy
