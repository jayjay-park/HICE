Its only really an issue if youre charging off a computerlaptop or a poorly made wall charger or often a wall charger designed for an iPhone. If the phone senses that the data pins are active it presumes that its connected to a device instead of a dedicated charging source and limits the power draw to mA. If the charger is made properly andor if youre using a chargeonly cable youll pull at whatever the charger can deliver or the phone is willing to take probably around A.Long story short youre almost certainly fine using the same cables youve been using and youre right about not getting fast charging.

Read somewhere that Light Flow doesnt place nice with ambient display yet so I uninstalled. Ambient went back to normal. Tried Light Manager and now it works just fine  the only thing Id point out is that you should NOT have a LED set for Google Now notifications. I dont think its on by default but I set it up just for kicks to have a white LED and it would pop up randomly for no reason presumably when a card updated.

5633882,0,t1_cwve1hu,I will agree that iPhone battery life is not as good as it used to be. I think thats partly due to phone and screen size better resolution better SoC and of course more features in iOS    etc.  The thing about iPhone that I like is that the standby works exceptionally well and it doesnt have to shutoff everything like Doze has to. When I fire up the iPhone after its been on standby for a while there isnt a big strain on the battery like it seemed to be with my P. I cant speak for Nexus because the P was my first one but it has not been my experience that Android has improved battery in each version with the exception of L to M where M is an obvious improvement. In fact most people agree that battery life had a HUGE drop off from K to L and that was after Google claimed that lollipop had better battery usage. It was pretty common back then to make fun of Google for this stance.  ,Nexus6P,cwvfq2w,2,t5_39zt6

If you think of it as just a camera then they can always rotate the image with software to match it up with the original they have. Now that I think about it I wonder why the swipe ones werent as accurate if it was just a scan of your fingerprint.

6033804,0,t3_3y4oyo,gt How is Android M? I used to have a Nexus  so I know about Android .  . but I had it rooted and ran CyanogenMod for hopes of a better battery lifeIt is pretty good. I have very problems with it. Very smooth fast. Battery life on my phone is nearly  hours SoT over  hours usagegt Which Android Wear is the best as I currently have a Apple Watch SportCant answer this as I dont have one but my Dad has the Sony Smartwatch  and that has a few  things that other Wear devices dont but does require charging most days. The software is the same across all of them so it comes down to hardware and personal preference on looks. You might wish to compare Wear vs iWatch platforms as part of your decision if the watch is important to you.gt Does Android M have inbuilt call amp message blocking?I can block numbers through the Dialler app.gtNexus Protect is it worth it? For its process is it simple to do RMA or ask for support?A lot of people have said it is probably not worth it unless you expect to break your phone twice or something due to cost of the plan and the excess. People seem to have been very happy with Google RMAs and support. I havent had to deal with them myself though thankfully.gt Does Nexus p have a Movie Editor or a app by Google to edit K Resolution Videos? If not what Windows program can do it?A quick Google says no to editing on Android. As for Windows start heregt How is the battery life with Doze and without Doze?As I said above I easily get through the day with hrs SoT over about  hours usage. Havent turned Doze off and I guess the closest you can get is making the timeout really long.gt Is root needed? Because if you root you affect Android Pay supposedly.I think systemless root doesnt stop you using Android Pay. Something about deleting a file afterwards and it allows you to use it? I think there have been posts on here about it.gt If Im convinced to purchase this by tomorrow on Christmas Day hopefully it gets by here before January st what accessories do you recommend the most?

Giving that she has broken every damn phone she has gotten for the past  yrs it isnt hard to see this as a possibility. The thing is she has had it dropped like last week from a stand she had on her desk flat on the table... Nothing.. So wondering how any other drop could happen that would cause this.But who knows seems Google has had this reported a lot and they will replace it. Just need to find a better case for her..

6838485,0,t3_49ezes,If you want systemless root is super simple. Follow these steps You need ADB and have your bootloader unlocked. Remember that unlocking the bootloader will restore your phone to factory including your data an apps Download the latest image and decompress it twice until you get the folder anglermmbv in your computer. Go to that folder and unzip the anglermmbv.zip file You will NOT need none of the flash files nor the userdata.img. If you prefer to be safe just delete delete them. Using ADB restart your phone in bootloader mode         adb reboot bootloader It seems that the bootloader and radio are not updated so you dont really need to flash them but if you want to do the following        fastboot flash bootloader bootloaderanglerangler..img        fastboot reboot bootloader        fastboot flash radio radioanglerangler..img Now is time to flash everything else. As you will not flash userdata.img you wil NOT loose your application data        fastboot flash boot boot.img        fastboot flash cache cache.img        fastboot flash vendor vendor.img        fastboot flash system system.img Now that all that is done you can reboot your phone fastboot reboot. Wait for the applications to update and you are basically done with stock Android non root. If you want to root keep going. You are going to need the latest SuperSU . and TWRP ... Copy SuperSU to your phone SD card        adb push BETASuperSUv..zip sdcard Reboot your phone in bootloader mode again. Flash TWRP        fastboot flash recovery twrp..angler.img On the phone launch the recovery option volume down twice and then press power Use the Install option to flash SuperSU and reboot your phone.And thats it. You are rooted now. If you want to be able to use Andrpid Pay you just need to delete the folder suxbinbind. Use the app SafetyNet Helper to verify. If you pass the test you should be able to use Android Pay                                                ,Nexus6P,d0rg1lh,16,t5_39zt6

Do factory resettweaking?A I dont experience lag on my P I am running stock .. with root and the ElementalX kernel running with the stock configuration.Q Does lag happen randomly on stock?A It seems to. I cant replicate when it happens but a reboot usually makes the device run great for many days. Im going to actually just make a Tasker profile to reboot my device every morning.As a former N owner and current P owner Ill say this about the upgrade in device its not worth it. The only reason I upgraded was because I smashed my phone screen after a drop and it was too expensive to repair. For the cost of the repairwarranty replacement I was already  into the cost of a P.When someone puts the question to me whats different from the N? the only quick reaction I can say is the vibrations are nicer. Seriously the Ns vibrations made me think that a whole was being ripped in the earth. I wont miss that otherwise the speed and screen seem the same to me. The OS support for the N is still current so why change?,Nexus6P,d365r6i,1,t5_39zt6

8839056,0,t3_519s7q,Theres been a number of issues with TWRP on Nougat. To my knowledge both .. amp .. have fatal bugs in them when restoring backups. The safest way to downgrade at this point would be to boot to TWRP and perform a factory reset. Then flash the .. factory images MINUS userdata.img and cache.img. Flash everything else. Bootloader and radio reboot to bootloader and flash vendor system boot amp recovery IMG files via fastboot. After that boot to stock recovery and wipe cache. This doesnt wipe your internal storage so your files will be intact. A factory reset from stock recovery or fastboot flashing userdata will wipe all data. The TWRP wipe will reset the phone so you dont need to flash userdata and the cache will build on first boot so no need to flash that. Just wipe it from recovery. After that just fastboot TWRP back on there and flash your ROM. No issues with this route for me. Ive switched a handful of times.,Nexus6P,d7abv6p,4,t5_39zt6

Getting off the original glass was the hard part I ended up shattering it. But the new one already has adhesive on it so its simply a matter of slotting it into place. Because I had to mess around with the camera afterwards because of the  autofocus issue i had to remove the replacement glass about  times.

9004723,0,t1_d7u7lvd,It simply wouldnt have worked at all.  If you used the Flash Stock  Unroot button and selected one of the factory images from the list it was a TGZ file and would have worked normally as always.  If you used OtherBrowse.. option to try and select a ZIP file you downloaded from Google it wouldnt have allowed you to select it only allowed TGZ file selection.  If you manually tried to rename a ZIP file to a TGZ and selected it with that feature it would have just thrown an error and caused the program to crash.  So no the lack of these recent changes did not mean the old version was improperly flashing anything  it just was completely incapable of flashing the ZIP packs.Regarding your issue however. I would recommended trying to reflash the device anyway using an alternate usb portcable before deciding to RMA.  Its possible that a connectivity issue during flashing could have messed it up.,Nexus6P,d7u87dm,1,t5_39zt6

Im not a fan of how the back of the phone looks but i care more about how the phone operates and it hauls ass. Cons sometimes have issues with Bluetooth connecting to certain devices however this problem may be in the devices themselves and not the Nexus the screen can be hard to see in sunlight compared to other phones type c chargers arent common so youre fucked if you leave your charger at home the audio output isnt as good as youd expect considering it has dual speakers Ive had issues with a few apps continually crashing COD zombies wont run at all and virtual wallet used to crash after a minute of use.

Im now hearing it may actually not make it back even on the final build but lets not get into that right now...Ive had to reset this phone and previous phones several times before due to whatever issues and I was always able to get my phone back up and running by simply signing in with my Google account during the new setup process for the phone. All my apps wallpapers settings  everything would show up exactly the way Id left off.This time around nothing. The setup process seems to be complete Im signed in with my Google account and yet the only apps that have been installed are the default Google apps. None of my stuff seems to have been transferred over.Im kind of freaking out right now. Resetting my phone has always been so smooth due to the ability to simply sign in with my Google account and have all my stuff back the way I left it but now Im shit scared all that stuff is lost and Ill have to go through the painful process of setting up everygoddamnthing manually one by one.Does anybody know what happened and know a solution?

The Pixel loads faster shoots faster exposes better and blurs less. It really puts that aspect of my P camera to shame which was only great if what was in the frame wasnt moving for a good  seconds.

9622372,0,t1_d9z2i8c,I have hands on the smaller side and its near impossible to use onehanded. I use my pinky finger along the bottom edge to rest the phone on and to reach the far left side with my thumb takes some hand gymnastics. Reaching the top  of the screen is not possible with one hand without removing my pinky from the bottom and risking dropping it.Most times its not a concern but on occasions when you only have one hand free to manipulate the phone its frustrating at best and infuriating at worst.I user Nova Launcher with a swipe down gesture for notifications which alleviates the issue somewhat but doesnt fix it.The phone is perfect if you can sit and use both hands to enjoy it and I dont regret purchasing it at all but my next phone will most likely be . or less especially when this trend of huge bottom bezels doesnt seem to be going away anytime soon. The dual speakers are nice but I would gladly lose the bottom one if it meant getting rid of the ridiculous bezel.As far as your original question of the P being futureproof I think it will be more than passable for the next  or even  years. There only thing on it thats showing age is the processor. Newer processors are faster and more efficient but the  still fares well. Just dont expect to play graphicallyintensive games for extended periods without noticing some throttling.Hope this helps you decide.EDIT Downvoted for sharing my opinion. Awesome.

Huawei is basically a shittier company so from my conversations today here is where it stands They do not offer advanced RMA but had my send the phone in the old fashioned way They sent the phone back and said nothing Turns out they dont believe the  shutdown is their problem so they merely flash the phone and send it back They do not offer any estimates for repair as they dont do it There are no authorized repair companies in the USAIronically the woman I spoke to at the warranty company said shes heard of this company already so I think others are putting in claims and seeing what happens. ,Nexus6P,dbflshj,1,t5_39zt6

10058699,0,t3_5fpeee,I have both phones here and have to say that this is a very close call. Oneplust has much better battery life and dual SIM which is very nice for me since I travel a lot. Also it does seem to be a bit more snappy than P but not much.P camera on the other hand is in my opinion even better than Samsung Galaxy S edge has I did have that phone also and having .. is a bliss.Why I have two phones now is because P started to have those battery issues. First I learnt to use it so that  always meant end of the battery but when it started to shut down when  left I just couldnt handle it and I had to send it to warranty and get a replacement.e. if there is something I also noticed if I am listening to same song with same headphones Sennheiser momentum I think that OnePlusT gives moore oomph to it.

10988955,0,t3_5wufxb,I just replaced my battery a week ago and have not yet experienced the suddenshutdown in the cold. Previously my worst scenario was it shutting down at  bullshit. I replaced the battery and havent had the cold shut down since. I also get more usage from each charge than I previously was. I no longer have to top my phone up in the afternoon before leaving work. If youre wondering about where to get a battery I got mine from esource parts and Canadian company. I think theres issues ordering batteries internationally due to the potential for fires etc so try to order from within your own country if possible. The trickiest part for me was getting the enclosure off of the phone the chin sticker and camera shade came off relatively easy with proper cell phone tools. Also make sure you buy some adhesive for sticking everything back together after surgery. The only thing that I damaged by doing surgery myself was a slight marring of the chin sticker and the black plastic that goes between the screen and the aluminium backing got pretty mangled. Its been getting smoothed out quite nicely just from the friction of being in my pocket and its just aesthetic. I dont give a shit what that tiny little plastic looks like so long as my phone doesnt suddenly shut down in the cold.    Unrelated but I also suffer from the dust on the camera lens issue. I figured I could clean off the back of the camera shade when I had it apart but that didnt work. I tried taking a photo with the shade removed and the dust spots remained. Attempted to clean the lens of the camera module itself and that also didnt work. There might have been a minor improvement but pics that are primarily white or bright show the spots pretty bad still. I might look at replacing the camera module as well if it gets any worse. ,Nexus6P,dedkabx,1,t5_39zt6

11442771,0,t3_63c61v,This sucks. I am glad I bought a power bank. We have  choices. Either replace the battery or buy a  Anker power bank. Replacing the battery is not easy or  safe. I recommend the second option if you are worried like me about damaging the phone. It is a shame that this problem is a hardware issue. ,Nexus6P,dft106p,2,t5_39zt6
11444867,0,t1_dft94fb,Yep. Twice actually.  I bought mine in December .  Out of warrantee they replaced it and the first phone I received had major issues with just shutting down. It wouldnt even show powering off and do a graceful shutdown it would just shut off as if the battery was pulled.If you looked at the battery stats it would show a gap in the graph and a big dip in charge percentage.  I contacted them on the same ticket the RMA was opened under and they sent another which has so far been good.EDIT I should add to this that they did have some requirements before issuing the RMA. Im on the .. beta and they required the phone to be on a stable release. Also they requested I run in safe mode to see if the issue happens.,Nexus6P,dft9kdg,2,t5_39zt6

11452988,0,t3_61x66q,Thought I would share my experience. I would avoid their support like the plague. Initially it was great called in very helpful recommended RMA for bootloop issue sent in pics then the device for repair or replacement. Waited about a week never got confirmation it was received called in to ask they asked if I shipped it back red flag I provided the tracking and they said not to worry. Got a mysterious We have received your device email  days later. Called to be sure that this wasnt accurate and they said it must have been a glitch probably BS. Waited the full  days from the day it was received and the rep said I would be getting a call back from a manager in  hours and they would get it shipped within that time frame. Neither happened. Called back  days later oh sorry still a delay we will try to get it out by weeks end. Still no call from management. Called Friday oh sorry still a delay you will be receiving your device in  business days. Today is the rd business day after that Tues and the rep today said oh sorry still a delay. We will be shipping them out on Friday another  days. Sent the device in and signed for on  it is now  and no device has even been shipped even though they claim it has been repaired. I am not sure that anyone over there cares at this point but if this post keeps even one person from buying a Huawei device I feel like I have saved them.,Nexus6P,dfu6rf7,3,t5_39zt6
