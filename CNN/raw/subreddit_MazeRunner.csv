681554,0,t1_cfpm1ny,thanks for the info! i like the location ideas! now that the trailer has come out for The Maze Runner I heard they confirmed that there will be a second movie. Where do you think the Scorch Trails movie will be filmed. Obviously many places but the main parts of the movie. ,MazeRunner,cghqrre,1,t5_2t0k1

Yes the dreams played a huge roll in the movie since  seconds of film often explains more than two pages in a book. It could be that the telepathy will be visual in next movie in that way they will be communicating in their dreams somehow.. I totally agree with every word you just said. The only scene in the maproom was good I really hoped they would spnd a lot of more time comparing maps like in the movie. It felt a bit like you would watch an episode of CSI and they would find out who is the murderer in the start and the rest of the episode they try to catch him. They took away the thinkingconspiracy part.. I thought of that plot hole aswell. I miss the scene were they are throwing rocks out in the air to find were the hole is.. Yes it was good.. I liked the cast! Dylan OBrien did a great job and theresa ooked like I had imagined. I give alby and newt a big Plus and I think the rest did okey. Gally was uglier in my head but he acted really well. Too bad they deleted that he had gotten stung before. Well well.Thanks again!,MazeRunner,ckmxq6v,1,t5_2t0k1

But if youre curious might as well I hear hes writing a sequel so it may turn into its own series. ,MazeRunner,clt6qky,5,t5_2t0k1
2435540,0,t1_cmc29o7,I couldnt agree more about Teresas death. It happened super quick with no emotion at all....especially on Thomass end.,MazeRunner,cmcqlky,3,t5_2t0k1
2533093,0,t3_2nr4km,Towards the end of The Maze Runner when Gally barges into the homestead and does his insane speech he gets carried away towards the Cliff by grievers. Considering they tear Alby to shreds when he sacrifices himself a few chapters later I would think the Creators wanted him alive.  ,MazeRunner,cmp7mle,2,t5_2t0k1
4470359,0,t1_csu20wt,The budget was most likely a factor in changing the Griever hole into something thats physically there rather than creating an invisible portal at the edge of a huge cliff. Besides it served the same purpose so why does it matter?The Gally and Chuck scene played out pretty much the same as the book though. You can tell Gally was being controlledwhich is why he was crying.,MazeRunner,csu5vif,0,t5_2t0k1

5301290,0,t1_cvp9fhb,Spot on! Although he probably forgave Brenda because she showed him the way out the whole thing felt like she was about to betray him especially at the very end of the third book. In conclusion i feel like the movies so far have been really good. They nailed the first movie with amazing surroundings grievers and lightning  what people have to realize is how the second movie is a bridge to the last one. Lastly i feel like Teresas betrayal and the third books ending was poorly done,MazeRunner,cvpauqz,1,t5_2t0k1
