360914,0,t3_1y7xj0,Whatever you do with the channel I want you to remember that most your audience is a silent majority there is only a small proportion of people who choose to voice their opinions the rest are people like me Ive been enjoying your videos for months and shared them with my friends but have never felt the need to comment. I love your videos and are always excited for the next instalment and have recently noticed when buying fast food and energy drinks that I hesitate to buy a product that has not been reviewed by the Report of the Week. I think you should take a well deserved rest from making videos no reason not if you have a backlog of  videos what you should definitely not do is give up completely and pack it in what you have made here is fantastic and I would be sorry to see it go.,TheReportOfTheWeek,cfi6arv,12,t5_2ywwz
674891,0,t3_21vube,Honestly I dont know why the hell I continue to watch this show.   The characters are so one dimensional theyre just average rednecks that you can barely relate to. But on top of all that the episodes are just boring. I guarantee this entire next season is going to be spent in the train waiting for Beth like how they did on the farm waiting for Sophie. I hate this show yet for some reason i continue to watch it.    Thoughts?,TheReportOfTheWeek,cggzhf7,0,t5_2ywwz
1265989,0,t1_cic0per,I intend on keeping things as they are if you were meaning the whole thing on the Average day video I did that to prove a point. That within seconds post upload there would already be hate there. I figure let people think what they want just dont post it on my videos. ,TheReportOfTheWeek,cic1ful,5,t5_2ywwz

I never said he could live off that quite the opposite but its silly to argue that he earns nothing or  a month from his channel. If he wants to use YouTube as a fulltime job then unstable income is unfortunately the norm. ,TheReportOfTheWeek,dg2jior,6,t5_2ywwz
