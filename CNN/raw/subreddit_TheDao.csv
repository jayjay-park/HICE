7531762,0,t1_d2xqinm,Whether or not android is open source is irrelevant  the monetisation model is completely different. ARM is an even worse analogy  they are the opposite of open source as they make money by licencing their designs for a fee.,TheDao,d2yboz4,1,t5_3desi
7553254,0,t3_4iqtvu,Great Idea Craig. But at this stage its too late. That change would have to get voted in and im not sure if it will pass. It might. Or the next DAO that pops up should consider doing something like that. ,TheDao,d30rp0x,1,t5_3desi
7573868,0,t1_d333odq,Because it creates a misalignment of interests. Spending USD to earn future USD or Eth while making Eth more valuable in the process is more aligned than spending Eth to earn USD while making Eth more valuable. ,TheDao,d3341ce,1,t5_3desi

7764018,0,t1_d3op5id,You can check the ID here with a text description   so far theres nothing that really ties this proposal to and actual details  but yes just entering a  in the id field should work.,TheDao,d3opi0q,3,t5_3desi

7928835,0,t3_4nvhfm,Seriously. Give me a mobile app with a slider to indicate my level of agreement like consider.it. Id love it even more if each proposal included a link to an elevator pitch on YouTube. That in turn would link to a longer presentation if Im interested in learning more.,TheDao,d479xor,4,t5_3desi
7979686,0,t1_d4cyo6y,Yeah but the moratorium vote ended just days ago. Not surviving  months IS a premature release of a product. This is like releasing a videogame with a day one patch...its bad and means it was rushed.,TheDao,d4czpkj,2,t5_3desi

8054922,0,t1_d4lfo8y,You are correct....but again.. whatever we want is not the issue. The powers that be are waiting to define and tie up the space to control and kill it if possible..It is obviously not possible but...Years of litigation are waiting in the wings to tear up the Etheream space. the blowback from a fork will be real.  Our losses and vigilante justice will not stand in the long term. Once a blacklist is established of the attackers funds then players will be identified and defined as in controlThen any future contract will be able to be rolled back through litigation. The DAO is a general partnership without a defined jurisdiction and legal opinions that I have read on the subject agree that ANY jurisdiction where ANY token holder lives may be chosen to litigate ANY issue...right or wrong. That means no justice and eternal legal issues....forever....I am sorry I lost money as did many but the cost of recovering the funds with a fork of any kind will be the defining of the network and players. It will take only one person to start the process and we all know there are people who dont want Crypto to succeed. Burn the DAO,TheDao,d4lg6p3,2,t5_3desi

8123747,0,t3_4q9xgo,There is an open DAO proposal proposal  that may be needed to stop or at least frustrate the attacker.  But that is only needed if the hard fork does not go through.  I believe the Ethereum devs will bring it to our attention if it becomes necessary to vote on it.  It has more than a week left.,TheDao,d4t6k94,1,t5_3desi
