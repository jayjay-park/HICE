1026042,0,t3_25u43b,You make it seem as if this is the only year that disasters have happened. Look back at any year in your living life and youll find similar or worse events that have made headlines.Terrible things have happened since forever. Without government emergency response infrastructure and health amp safety regulation there would be many many many more flight crashes sunken ferries and mass terrorist successes.I think its unfair to judge a year and therefore draw conclusions from the few sexy sad news stories that surface. How many millions have been killed kidnapped oppressed hungerstricken or discriminated against this year? . more than have been mentioned on the news you watch.,internationalpolitics,chkx19s,5,t5_2tb55

1432880,0,t1_civqtf7,If you think that theres no evidence for the leadersip of Hamas hiding behind their own families then you havent been paying attention. And what genocide are you going on about? The population of Palestinians has been rising steadily for years now. Please go elsewhere with your propaganda. The only group involved here advocating genocide are the leaders of Ha as.,internationalpolitics,civvzfo,0,t5_2tb55

1550972,0,t3_2bz8ju,I think there are examples of how states act at least if you look at it from the rebellion  movement perspective.  Id argue that states will try to harness or advance anarchy if it will help them achieve their goals.  I would also argue that this is nothing new the Byzantine Empire actively funded and supplied rebellions in neighbouring states to achieve goals and this still happens.  As for dealing with anarchy internally or the potential of it.  Either through the use of violence or control Stasi KGB and probably NSA sorry NSA people reading this but....  I dont think states repressive or free fear anarchy.  Its a reality.  In the international system its dealt with via alliances.  If the UN didnt exist alliance systems would a  la pre WWI.  Domestically its dealt with in varying ways.  I think freedoms in Western states are a trade to prevent anarchy.  Give ppl freedom and the majority wont revolt plus requires less intervention and capital than the repressive model but the state gives up more control.  Maybe Im way off just throwing thoughts out.  ,internationalpolitics,cjaorvq,1,t5_2tb55
1555307,0,t1_cjb6j79,Youre not an idiot. The title misleads you when you look at the map. If china were at war however the percentage would be much higher. That said why China and the UK are lit up but not Russia confuses me.,internationalpolitics,cjb8c41,4,t5_2tb55
2221006,0,t3_2kiytw,If theres any justice in this world everyone in the NK leadership will hang. And thats the problem. If the world punishes them like the world should the higher ups in the NK military and government is going to fight tooth and nail to prevent it. How far down the ranks does that feeling go? Even junior officers deserve to be punished and they know they will be if the west comes knocking. So they fight and fight and fight slaughter their own people to how their crimes do whatever it takes to raise the casualty rates to force a decent peace settlement. Dont kid yourself if it hits the fan NK will let a couple of nukes fly. Not all of them of course. Just enough to say See? Well do it and we have a few more stashed away. We can use those too.  If you really believe that the west can neutralize ALL of NKs WMDs in the first few hours or days of the conflict I have a bridge to sell you. The safest solution is a golden parachute for NK leaders. Its not fair at all and sends a terrible message to wannabe dictators all over the world. But thatll keep the bloodshed down a bit. ,internationalpolitics,clm55xd,2,t5_2tb55

5999362,0,t1_cy6107n,Its not that the author has a different viewpoint its that he makes wildly broad claims without backing them up with evidence as is generally expected when arguing a case. I can appreciate other opinions. I even really liked a neocon lecturer I had who thought that Reagan was the greatest president ever and that Obama was the secondworst because he actually substantiated his opinions. Thats whats missing here.,internationalpolitics,cy61p95,3,t5_2tb55
