7738318,0,t1_d3lmllo,Thank you! Ill edit the title I am a qualitative researcher that fell into the profession out of pure love several years ago. My background is in market research but I have no academic qualifications in the field. Something I really need to get working on. It always makes me feel inferior and lacking. Everything I have learnt I have learnt by doing but because I havent had any mentorship as I progressed through my career I am constantly doubting myself. Dyslexia doesnt help. I  have spent a good few years on agency side and a few more on client side between the UK and Middle East where I am currently based.I have decided to conduct a self funded ethnographic research study around middle eastern womens perception and body image especially compared to the west and also to men. I feel that so much has changed over the past few years. I am looking for someone to mentor me and make sure that I am on the right track. I have some tools at my disposal A great social media listening tool  pulsar  a great photographer videographer and a bunch of people who are willing to participate..fashion designers who have a lot of interesting input.doctors..fitness instructors etc .The output will not be sold but will be published on my website and I would gladly share credit for the time taken to provide me with feedback.If there is another topic you would like to work with me on I would be happy to listen and change directions as long as it doesnt touch on politics or religion. Anything else  technology..culture..habits etc is good.,Ethnography,d3lsgv7,1,t5_35ft0
