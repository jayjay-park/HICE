8220892,0,t3_4ryk64,Seventeen fans called out for disrupting Sketchbook recordings multiple timesOn July  Seventeen performed for the viewers and the live audience of Yoo Hee Yeols Sketchbook showing off their bright boyish charms!After the recording for the recently aired episode however problems arose among fans and netizens as several witnesses claimed that those who attended the recording of Sketchbook experienced disruptions and rude behavior courtesy of Seventeen fans or Carat.One online post claimed Because of the bomblike cameras in the audience the recording was disrupted twice and normal people in the audience got tired and started cursing...Reportedly the mild to unresponsive reactions of the audience members during some of Seventeens performances aired on Sketchbook were due to the continued disruptions caused by Seventeen fan. Some netizens even said they spotted video footage of Seventeens leader S.Coups begging fans before the recording to please dont take photos.What are your thoughts on the recent controversy?I am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles.,seventeen,d5561su,2,t5_2spu6
8556194,0,t1_d6b1t7f,So fun that you went yesterday! Great to hear that they were okay after two shows that day   Agree it was just something different about seeing them live in a good way. Did you have a seat closer to the stage?  Yes Wonwoo looked soso my show too I wonder if he and Mingyu had a fallout or if there was something else going on that was troubling him. He didnt even smile during the aegyopart   Haha yeah I really noticed it during Very Nice! But hes so energetic and jumping around everywhere and its hot on stage so its probably due to that.  Out of curiosity were there any merch left for the last show? Most were already sold out at mine so I wonder if they saved some for the last day or if just everything was gone by then?,seventeen,d6b3lbe,1,t5_2spu6
8780971,0,t1_d7385qj,Ah But you can buy multiple tickets right? For friends and such. I guess they would be strict in case of scalpers.I really enjoy concerts for the group obviously but for the whole atmosphere with fans I really hope SEVENTEEN does a world tour sometime soon so I can see them live!Oh! Are you from Europe? Did you go to Japan for the concert?,seventeen,d73aiy6,2,t5_2spu6
