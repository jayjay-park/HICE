Flight seems better mostly due to the strafe changes certain ships perform different of course m feels meh at the moment but overall I like it better. Aiming on the other hand . . . there are a few issues. On the plus side ESP can be toggled in the menu now for anyone that dislikes it though I prefer it on. Sadly ESP feels off compared to how it has worked in past iterations end of . and through . were working well for me personally. In the . PTU it was listed as a known issue I dont see it listed anymore but it feels like it still has the same problem to me. Also the lag pip disappears sometime when you get close to a targeted enemy,SpiceandWolfTrading,cpnp576,1,t5_34f5o
