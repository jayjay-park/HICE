764236,0,t3_22vve2,Yes it would work so long as you were able to get to the BIOS configuration and set it up to put a CD or USB boot priority ahead of the hard drive. From there you can use any personal pick be it Damn Small Linux Hierens Boot disk mini XP Konboot. Its pretty much as simple as you can think. Alternatively you can do the same thing but instead of extracting the files you need you can do some tricks and get sticky keys to summon a command prompt window with administrator access at the windows log in screen.,hacking,cgr5dy2,2,t5_2qhva
791673,0,t1_cgtv1r7,Why thank you for the question you just reminded me of physical security measures I went on a tangent about stopping attackers from remote vectors. Last time I checked the sticky keys option was still available but even if its closed there are many ways to login to a device if you have physical access generally the attitude researchers have is that if an attacker has physical access youre screwed no matter what you do. But if you are worried about these types of vector there are things to help mitigate attacks. Put a password on your BIOS settings depending on what BIOS you have this will stop anyone from seeing your settings or simply stop them from being able to change them looking at you Dell. Disable boot options this will stop people from being able to boot from a USB or CD with a live distro such as BacktrackKali or Hirens BootCD and getting access to your hard drive or use your computer at all. Encrypt your hard drive something like the option within TrueCrypt to use System Encryption should do the trick it will then ask for a password before windows even begins to log in stopping people getting to the point of using the Sticky keys or Windows recovery methods and it will also mean that if an attacker gets around boot options and is able to run a live distro the hard drive will be encrypted anyway making it pretty pointless. Dont leave your computer on while unattended it wont matter if your hard drive is encrypted if its at the lock screen or even worse logged in so just shut it down and come back later.p.s.

On the back end you run a virtual machine compatible with x architecture or whatever architecture you target but start with x and build upon that you create vulnerable programs running as SUID someuser where someuser does not have administrator priviledges.

1855296,0,t3_2ftijj,Well you kind of dont.The thing is to detect spyware you have to have to be able to examine it in a reliable way  that is a way it doesnt control.  Essentially you must be outside of it.  Its relatively easy to make software spyware thats undetectable to antimalware software running in the OS because the spyware having control of the OS kernel is outside the antimalware softwares control.  But if you run that same spyware on a VM and scan it from outside the spyware is easy to detect  it is no longer able to tamper with its own evidence to hide itself.If your hardware is compromised  e.g. a malicious BIOSUEFI or even backdoored CPU  no software on the computer can reliably detect this.  If the spyware is not wellengineered it may leak evidence of itself through sidechannels but if its wellengineered it may be nigh undetectable.  An example method would be silently overclocking the CPU and running the spyware only in extra clock cycles not reported even to the OS kernel so even timing analysis wont show the spyware running and storing the malware in bad areas of flash memory that the OS cannot read or even report as existing.The primary way to detect is is likely that for spyware to be useful it has to phone home somehow  at some point itll send a network transmission and that has to leave the computer and thus go outside its control.  If you have network traffic monitoring on the router or another PC you could detect these transmissions.  The hard part is knowing theyre anomalous  if youre surfing the web on a compromised PC the data exfiltration will probably not be noticeable.  However if the compromised PC only sends traffic with known signatures you can likely detect anomalies in it.,hacking,ckcrb1j,17,t5_2qhva

Highly unlikelyThis is a good point.The idea is that some time into the development timeframe of the Navis a few years from today the other alternatives such as Google Glass and other wearable technology began to fall by the wayside as Navis were superior. Navis are commercially available in  years and by  years I want the Navis have a  adoption rate and the . of people who dont adopt the elderly mentally disabled and neoLuddite types are not a regular part of society. For characterization reasons I want the . of everyday society that are nonNavable peopleNonniesthose whose bodies flatout reject the implantto be regarded as disabled and secondclass. For one thing they actually have to speak out loud. People with Navis effectively communicate mindtomind.So whatever the alternative to the Navis is it should be something that doesnt work nearly as well or elegantly as the Navis. It shouldnt be alwayson and alwaysaccessibleusable with mental commands it shouldnt allow instantaneous mindtomind communication it shouldnt be able to watch through your eyes and listen through your ears to give you realtime feedback to for example warn you that youre about to be mugged. It shouldnt be a part of your body so that it cant be taken away and broken a point later in the book.As Im writing this Im realizing that maybe its not so plausible that the Nonnies would be radically more limited than the Navable folks Im thinking specifically that it would be hard to explain why they arent at least always connected probably with a wearable device but ideally I would like it to go that way for characterizationworldbuilding reasons.

You can see him pasting all the information in there that he needs to successfully post to someones timeline. Hes passing in the developer key which is being allowed by the other user.

This isnt the regular user ID that everyone has access to. Then hes passing in his message. The code would look something like this without the arg parser  import facebookgraph  facebook.GraphAPItokengraph.getobjectidgraph.putwallposthi there!So unless someone allows the permissions to this app then arbitrary comments cannot be posted on their walls.

What does NK gain from hacking Sony and wouldnt their skills and time be better spent doing pretty much anything else? This seems to be one of those did it because we could scenarios and not something a government that has very few cards to play would invest resources into.. the payoff just isnt there.Honestly I believe the authorities are grasping at straws. I think the correspondence from GOP makes it pretty clear that this is the work of a group of hackers that live in a country close to NK either China SK or Japan that wants the region to avoid war. If NK did hack Sony why stay anonymous? Theyre NK they dont need to hide from any authorities... fuck they launch missiles towards us when were training... And why release all the stupid shit? emails sceptre script movies? There was a point when they had Sony by the balls then they cut the cord and started leaking shit.. If NK wanted the movie pulled surely they couldve contacted Sony directly while they had their boot on their necks and made some demands...

AuthType Digest is rather safe.Secondly the Live Headers Plugin is broken when used in recent versions of Firefox. But if youd like to try it you could download for example Firefox Portable lt v.Edit Alternative method wo the plugin.

4875853,0,t3_3hmrw3,I guess my take on it is a little different. Instead of beating people with the moral authority stick after the fact how about we focus on the problems that caused this to occur in the first place? The idea that one person can meet all of our needs throughout our lives is ignorant and childish. It didnt feel that way to me the day I got married it didnt feel that way the day our first child was born. However there have been plenty of times my wife and I couldnt or wouldnt be there for each other on many other hard and mundane days. This has never to my knowledge resulted in either of us cheating but its clear to me relying on one person is asking too much sometimes. Its unrealistic and our society needs to think on broader terms over longer periods of time. Whether someone is depressed bored feels unloved forgotten ignored maybe they find out they arent cut out for monogamy those are the reasons for infidelity. If we solved these problems AshleyMadison wouldnt exist. Ive said my peace and my kids are knocking on the door to use the bathroom. CU later alligator. ,hacking,cu951lp,11,t5_2qhva

Good schools educate you on the theory and the button pushing training you can do on your own or later. If I want a guy thats really good at networks Im not going to go sit him in front of a router and show him how to configure it. Im gonna give him a stack of books and come back when he can tell me what a TCP header is supposed to contain and how OSPF sends routing updates through a network and why I shouldnt use SNMPv. The rest of the configurations are easy. Forensics is an incredibly large field that desperately needs people. I am a certified forensics analyist I hate forensics with a passion btw its so tedious I just want to kill myself but there is an incredible amount of opportunities out there for people good at forensics. Pick a field and get good at that then start looking at the security side of it. If its hacking you like pick what youd like to hack. Web apps? Okay start programming web apps.

Im guessing you may need to try access the modem and tinker with some settings you can get the modems ip address via ipconfig command for Windows or ifconfig for Mac or Linux. You then need a password to login to the modem. Alot of people are shit at security and tend to leave passwords to defaults so check the make of modem and try some default logins. If they have changed it you might need to crack the key via packet sniffing. Only ever seen this done once to hack my neighbours WiFi not me who did it but it was all done with a Linux distro called backtrack and using packet sniffers to sniff out packets and build up a key. ,hacking,d3yb7pf,2,t5_2qhva

Its a fairly unknown attackvector but nevertheless it has been around for years and it works Defcon  talk on the subject BNutMost likely those kiddies youve met have known about some exploit for an unpatched TS server or something that could DOS someone and then thought they could hack...But theoretically hacking you could be done something like... If you use an ISP supplied modemrouter chances are that someone could get into your local network through the router fairly easy. Most ISPs dont use ordinary firmwares but have them somewhat customized which in turn means that exploits are open for longer until a new firmware patching holes is available. It wouldnt take long for someone to find your IP and from that take an educated guess on what modelmake CPE you might have and then base an attack on that. If you get into the CPE then you have access to the local network and could use whatever exploitshacks on boxes there or even better just set up the CPE to redirect you to phishingsites and whatnot to steal credentials hacking your box would be waste of time if someone could make you give them your info with little or no effort.Although all of the above is something fairly inexperienced people can do it does take time and knowledge plus access to zeroday vulnerabilities others have found the hardest part.Steps to take to prevent it would be something like adding your own router on the LAN side of the ISP supplied equipment two locks are better than one use NAT or a firewall on the router pref. your own on the LAN side make sure that your ISP uses CWMP and that is open for firmware updates and what not use a manually configured DNS server on your computerYou can keep  of the bad guys out be you need to be aware that the really talented guys out there can get in no matter what precautions you take.,hacking,d4cuor5,17,t5_2qhva

8014674,0,t1_d4dgshb,Fun thing about the internet  its global. What may be a federal crime in the US can be merely a state level crime in say Germany. Elsewhere it may not even be a crime. In some cases it may be merely a small time tort. Now imagine I know the legalities behind these things and actually go out of my way to have a VPN set up in a place where all of this is legal. Sure if you could get at me you could still point fingers but overall youd be at a disadvantage. For instance one of the reasons why theres so many Nigerian scammers is because even if you know who is doing the scamming its hard to get your money back even trough civil courts let alone get them busted for a crime. ,hacking,d4gx9xa,1,t5_2qhva

I have a Linux VPS with  public IPs is be willing to let you use. Its mostly setup for LAMP but I own it so you could do whatever. The other option is maybe clearly outline what to report and start doing warnings and bans. Im sure you take no pleasure but I dont see how you could turn things around without it. Oh maybe in the rules have some questions that you shuffle around. Make a rule that if you dont know the answer you probably shouldnt be posting. Something simple like what is a buffer overflow? what is SQL injection? How many tcp ports are there? What is the difference between DoS DDoS and DOS? What does an exploit actually exploit? Can a mac get a virus?  Who created Linux? I can come up with more just some examples. Like I said Im donate server space. Ill also donate my time. Ive pretty much done it all aside from art major stuff. I dont know how easy it is to integrate this stuff into reddit as I have no experience with that but if there is info out there and its possible Im sure I can figure it out. Whatever you need. Oh a rule could be that these posts should be reported immediately and not replied to. Im guilty Im sure but any attention just encourages it. If posts are removed right away they will find somewhere else to go. I like the suggestions for other sub reddits. Maybe add some to the rules for beginners so they see that they have somewhere else to go. I think just the name hacking instead of netsec is an issue but too late now. With the posts gone and rules highlighted though more people would instantly realise they are in the wrong place. I think its cool for people who wanna learn and if they ask serious questions in the comments in fine with that. Maybe develop FAQs or a link that people can respond with that explains everything you want a beginner to know. People can simply paste that when a comment seems out of place. I still feel kind of elitist but that is why there are a ton of different subs right? I totally believe you about all the posts you get. Im sure its full of junk.

9328146,0,t3_58889c,The definition has changed dramatically over the past decade. Back then they didnt even use Linux at all it was simple software used on Windows XP at best. So going by that? No I dont think so.By modern standards I notice Kali getting a lot of attention especially due to movies and TV series. So some people think its cool install it then switch it off because theyre in way over their head. Youve got to at least be mildly competent to muddle your way through it whether or not thats an acceptable way for people to start learning Ive no clue.A collection of tools is handy. But say someone decides to use Arch Linux for the experience? That is bullshit right there once youve done it once or twice you dont ever want to bother with that again. What gets the job done conveniently and expediently is what matters in the end the sooner you start working the better. You could set the software up for yourself on another distro you could write it even but do you really want to go through all of that? How far are you willing to go just to consider yourself some elitist prick better than everyone else? If you ask me such people are just a little dense. Granted that is all only if its the same shit done over and over by other people if were talking about an original exploit then yes worth the time and effort.But this here is where I make the distinction. Those who want to learn and use their knowledge of networking programming social engineering etc and those who just try to emulate such people by doing as they do as some kind of passing fancy.

Generation based fuzzers youd have to define a grammar which is basically the layout of the thing you want fuzzed tools like SPIKE or Sulley.I will say that using a generation based fuzzer is an excellent learning opportunity. For example to fuzz and FTP server you would have to put together a grammar defining the FTP protocol which has the side effect of teaching you the ins and outs of the protocol. The same is true for file layouts other network protocols etc.That said if you dont have any interest in learning to put together or build test cases learn how to triage crashes to determine if theyre exploitable etc then this wouldnt be a route to go.You could always donate spare cycles to something like SETIhome?,hacking,davc8gm,1,t5_2qhva

Edit FYI filter is already a function in Python so you might want to name your function something else,hacking,dfwfmf5,3,t5_2qhva

Do you know the length of the key can you brute force it? Is the code in the JavaScript in the page source?,hacking,dg2fegg,1,t5_2qhva

Skype him threw a vpn and use wire sharkone of the best sniffers i used to capture the packets between you and him. If hes not using a vpn or proxy youll see his ip out there in the open.

11583499,0,t1_dg8zrsj,The protocols themselves are both good for evading monitoring of traffic. However it depends how theyre set up. No logs VPN paid for with cash or Bitcoin e.g. Mullvad is pretty good assuming youre not connecting from home and they arent really logging. But connecting from home through your work VPN with your login credentials isnt going to be a great idea for not being traced. Likewise with SOCKS. Proxying through a chain of compromised machines is better than through an AWS instance paid with your credit card.,hacking,dg8zvw8,4,t5_2qhva
11603696,0,t3_65il9h,You cant. That is a security vulnerability so it has been patched. Since you arent using this for hacking just run the file yourself. Or write an application to automatically run the program from your usbdrive when it gets mounted. Since you arent using it for hacking there should be no issue with installing an application on the computer to facilitate this.,hacking,dgbae4w,5,t5_2qhva
