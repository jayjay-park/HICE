595090,0,t3_20uo1i,Really glad to hear youre getting into baseball this year! Honestly there are so many sites now that the best advice I think is to go to a variety over the next few weeks and find two or three that you enjoy the most whether that be that you like the style of the site the particular writing style of the author Bob Elliott of the Sun is worth following and seeing what speaks to you. Also certain players are very active and interactive on Twitter JoeyBats follows many people back which can be fun too. As well podcasting is getting big and theres some great ones to follow. Heck Ill insert a shameless plug here  My podcast The Dugout is a weekly show where I mainly focus on the Jays. Next weeks guest is the Jays new Broadcaster Joe Siddall. He was a great interview. My show the following week will focus on a company that is literally changing the game. Sorry about the teaser  All my info is on my blog TheBlueJaysDugout.com. But above all this reddit community is a good one. Come here often and get to know people. Great debates and theres always a few people who toss out links to tv feeds if you want to watch online. The best thing is to ask as you did above. I hope you enjoy the season!  ,Torontobluejays,cg7wz5h,2,t5_2sb61

My guess would be that they were just looking in all the wrong places. Maybe a better team doctor would have thought to take a look but I have no idea. He looks great at the plate though hitting the ball hard and power starts with the lower body.

So I think his .M a year contract would have ended up being a huge burden for us now that were looking for a front line starter and Im glad we dont have him.

4132305,0,t1_crr6x1p,I think Gibbons is very consistent in putting his players in a position that they will most likely succeed in. Its not his fault when players dont come through on where he uses them. At the point where Gibbons took Hutch out he had given up what a single double and a home run? We needed to put our best noncloser reliever out there to stabilize the situation. Jose Reyes is a good player. Dont discount him based on one close play at turning a long single to a double. Defined roles in the bullpen help the psychology of the players. Knowing when you are going to be used sometimes helps in not being overly stressed out about possibly being called upon. ,Torontobluejays,crrb1tr,2,t5_2sb61

Im not saying thats the case with Gibby nor am I trying to start rumours but theres a strong connection to make here. Hes clearly frustrated and looking like he doesnt know what else he can do at this point. Thats pretty common for any coach on a struggling team where players keep making the same mistakes and the holes arent ever getting plugged. A lot of that for the Jays is on the injuries theyve had to endure some of that is just on lacking skills in certain areas i.e. Reyes while an exciting offensive player has major flaws with his defence.,Torontobluejays,crsy61q,1,t5_2sb61

At the same time there are many players who have great initial starts to their MLB careers and couldnt stick after.gt Holy unfair comparisons batman! Stroman started the season in the bullpen where he struggled. In Stromans first four starts he pitched . innings Ks nearly a  to  KBB ratio an ERA of .. Meanwhile Norris FIP was . and his xFIP was . and his KBB ratio was .. Stroman was called up to replace Morrow when he got injured. Norris currently sits behind Felix Doubront and Scott Copeland in the Jays depth charts.Is it unfair because it doesnt fit your narrative? Did you or OP say that your criteria is only relevant for starting pitchers? All I read was the followinggt A small sample of bad innings is far far more indicative of future performance than a small sample of success. And really your  response matters in what sense? Comparing one pitchers situation in how they were originally called up to anothers current place in the pecking order is relevant because?gtStill if youre being given even odds that any given minor leaguer will become a leagueaverage baseball player or not the smart money is to take the or not bet.

My one and simple point is that the performance of a players first  innings in MLB is not a good forecast for the rest of their career.You said Im mistaken.

Its also why Sanchez got  games Relief pitchers will almost never sit  games in a row and if they ever do its completely unpredictable. Plus you dont know when MLB will hear your appeal. Once they hear it if they dont nullify the suspension you have to serve it immediately so theres no guarantee that an appeal will allow a player to play in the game they dont want to miss.,Torontobluejays,ctthj3h,2,t5_2sb61

He was sent down to get more work so that when he does face major league bats he isnt so cold. Hell get to pitch a bunch of innings with the Bisons and then come back even better.

With injuries to certain players Pompey being sent down and pitchers under performing in the beginning of the season these  in particular have played exceptionally well to keep the Jays afloat and competitive. Then you add the additions via trade and the Jays have now become a powerhouse team with established roles and everyone is doing their part to the best of their ability. You can also add Smoak and Goins to that list. Unsung heroes   you always need these guys if you want to win championships.,Torontobluejays,cuhh98r,4,t5_2sb61

The fork is poised its just waiting to be stuck into their steaming smoking carcass. Forks just ready to be stuck and twisted. gtBuck Showalter is a bit of a knob hell have his guys throwing at the Jays. Its just theway it is with these teams wear your body armor if youre going to the game it could get nasty. My big fear would be Jose Bautista taking one off the wrist or something like that from one of the Orioles fine upstanding pitchers. gtI think theres going to be a lot of nastiness in this series these teams throw at eachother all the time and the Orioles theyve got nothing to play for.

5037947,0,t1_cut94rk,Yeah pretty much every pitcher begins as a starter and then moves to the bullpen if they cant cut it. Usually this happens if the pitcher doesnt have the endurance to throw for  innings at a time effectively or they dont have enough good pitches to keep batters offbalance for long enough.Some pitchers will move to the bullpen before they make it to the big leagues like Aaron Loup and Mark Lowe but even they will begin their career as starters in the minors. More often players who show some promise as starters but ultimately arent good enough will get moved to the bullpen Cecil Hawkins Hendriks etc..Sanchez and Osuna are both in a slightly different situation. More than anything else they were moved to the bullpen for this year because theyre too young to pitch an entire season as a starter but theyre good enough to be in the majors so using them in the bullpen can limit their innings. It helped that the Blue Jays desperately needed better pitchers in their bullpen at the time too. Sanchez actually started the year as a starter but he was just okaynot great before he was injured. Hes still young enough though and his pitches are nasty enough that I would fully expect him to be in the starting rotation next year and going forwards unless he shows them that he cant handle it. Hes too good to be in the bullpen so young. Same thing with Osuna.,Torontobluejays,cut9inn,7,t5_2sb61

If its not Cricket Rugby or Race Cars our country doesnt really report on it and being a person who doesnt show interest in either it may be a tad difficult to answer your questions.But I have always felt baseball to have the more difficult tendencies. With cricket you are only hitting to make it to the other side where baseball you can hit or bunt for a sacrifice the chance to steal is there and for the other team the chance for the double or triple place is also there. Plus I always thought hitting a ball pitched at you would be a lot harder then one that bounces first.In saying that I feel that makes the game a tad more exciting to be watching. That plus all the colourful uniforms makes it a treat to watch hahaha.Im pretty sure there is a video of a baseballer than come over and played some cricket and he killed it smacking balls into the crowed. yeah here it is lol. ,Torontobluejays,cuw7jop,1,t5_2sb61

The bullpen has been pretty not okay lately. Its rough to lose like that but hopefully this serves as a rallying point. Leaving the bases loaded with EE and JD at bat in the th and th was pretty sad.

Its so close it goes to a game  in Toronto. Winning run on first and a ball hit down the line get touched by a fan and kills the rally. Next batter strikes out and they lose. Then they never return to the playoffs for the next  years and fade back into irrelevancy where they belong. Because God damn when the Jays are relevant they have the worst fans in the game. Worse than Boston worse than self righteous Cards fans. They are disrespectful insulting knownothings that have the nerve to call themselves baseball fans.

Mlb.tv gives you the ability to sync the radio over the actual broadcast. This will only apply for home games in the playoffs. I would also suggest syncing up the away teams radio for away games as radio broadcasters do a better job in almost every case. Jays radio ranks th and theres a good reason for it. Jerry knows how to describe the game in detail with colourful language and Joe has been sensational with his stats and notes.

5223833,0,t1_cvfmkui,The record isnt the complete story... its not even half the story.Yankees are limping into the postseason  their bullpen has been a train wreck the past couple of weeks and their only pitcher worth anything is Tanaka after him you dont really know what youre going to get.Houston hasnt been playing great since giving up the AL West lead but they have a deeper line up than the Yankees and their pitchers have the best average WAR in the AL among both starters and relievers.The Yankees are also not better than Texas.  The Rangers are playing great ball right now and as good as the Jays have been since the trade deadline the Rangers have quietly kept pace.  On the trade deadline July st the Rangers were .  The Jays were .  They Jays have gone  since.   The Rangers? .  If we should be concerned it should be for the Rangers you do not want to face them in the first round.

I mean thats the whole point of the post yea a lot of what he does is a no brainer thats why hes never going to make a good team great but this team is great they need a guy that will always make the no brainer play and not fuck with his teams ability to play because they can they dont need micro managing they just need steady consistent managing which is exactly what Gibby brings and its for that reason Im giving him praise. Hes never changed hes always just done the obvious thing and when other managers might have started micro managing and trying to get more out of this team to ascend them from great to amazing and possibly fucked up the chemistry gibby has just sat back and managed and let them be great which is what I love which is why he deserves praise because I have no doubt there are managers out there that wouldnt have sat back that would have fucked shit up and then were not where we are right now.

You must account that whoever plays the WC more than likely uses their best pitcher on Tuesday meaning that he will be unavailable for Games  and  of the ALDS. This is a huge advantage to have and something I think alot of people arent seeing. In the end the Jays hold this destiny in their own hands. This reason alone was why I was disappointed Gibbons decided to field a B Lineup for the second game of the double header. We all knew theyd be hungover the day after and given the field conditions Id be cautious with my starters. The Jays have had  games to try to win . You dont count on anyone else beating the Royals you take care of your own business. Theyve essentially wasted  games as a result.I understand theres multiple permutations where the Jays still beat out KC still...Jays Record | Royals Record | HFA|| |  | Jays |  | Royals |  | Royals |  | Royals |  | Jays |  | Jays |  | Royals |  | Royals |  | Jays |  | Jays |  | Jays |  | Royals |  | Jays |  | Jays |  | Jays |  | Jays,Torontobluejays,cvlggip,10,t5_2sb61

Honour the men who keep the fans coming in those long  years of mediocre teams. The amount of times I went to games simply BECAUSE of Doc and Carlos was huge.

We always have the worst playoff game times  typically  starts.  They also typically have the lowest total of national games eg. TNT games with Charles Barkley amp company  even when theyre a good team they usually have the same or fewer games than shit teams.Nonetheless I hope to god these playoffs are the last we see of us using the American playoff broadcast.  ,Torontobluejays,cvzeuwn,1,t5_2sb61

ALDS Game  he struck out  out  batters and a lineout.But yes its completely bias and feely. Hes just pitching so well right now. To be honest Ive comparatively no clue how Davis is doing right now all I know is Im very confident with Osuna.,Torontobluejays,cw1x7n3,-8,t5_2sb61

5446020,0,t1_cw7rmq7,Ill answer since Im one of the guys that often does it when I say true fan I mean fans that have been supporting this team before this season. Fans that actually watch and understand baseball and actually knows a bit about the Jays besides the names Bautista and Encarnacion. The people who started watching after the AllStar break are arent true fans. I dont mean that theyre pathetic pieces of shit but they dont truly understand baseball and dont know the Jays very well. Theyre the type that will pretend to support the team but likely wont watch another game if we lose this series. I know this comes off as a very elitist statement and Im sorry.

5571386,0,t1_cwno1bt,Your plan hitches on two unlikely scenarios. The Jays will still have the best offense on paper unless several people regress heavily. Of these regressions I would expect JB and EE to be the main contributors for the lack of success on the offense. Which would mean they likely lose a lot of value.Youre forgetting Hutchison. If we sign  FA  Estrada our rotation is likely Stroman Estrada FA Dickey Hutch.  Our rotation would also have to underperform which is unlikely since Hutch should actually improve. Although you could argue Estrada will probably get slightly worse.We wouldnt lose Sanchez in the pen and people seem to always forget that Liam Hendriks is a thing. Loup is also a person who should regress to the mean. He was actually a pretty good pitcher this year. He just got BABIPd and HRFB to oblivion.I also stated that if the Jays were not a contender they would likely leave.,Torontobluejays,cwnok0w,2,t5_2sb61

They were both pretty ok first basemen and stunk in left field.  Unfortunately we wont know the full scope until we find out what Valencia can be traded for when Cola runs out of options If he becomes a free agent before running out of options we made the wrong choice if we can use his options later to our advantage and he stays a productive member of the team after callups we made the right choice.

Made big moves that got fans excited and propelled them into the playoffs for the first time in  decades. Theres a lot to like but he wasnt perfect. He sold the farm and threw a hail mary to get into the playoffs. It worked so we love him but had it not wed be singing a different tune right now.Shapiro is who he is and thats why he was given the job. Rogers wanted a corporate guy so even if they didnt go with Shapiro wed have someone else in his place with a very similar profile. Thats not Shaprios fault. Hes never tried to act like something hes not. As much as it hurts to see Beeston and AA go I think we have to give Shapiro the benefit of the doubt until he proves otherwise. If you want to be mad at anyone blame Rogers for how poorly they handled this mess. None of our angst should be on ShapiroAtkins. They both have their work cut out for them as they have to maintain a team that wins now while building a farm system that can support them in the future.

6309727,0,t3_421j1t,We dont need any more relievers. I also dont think we really missed out on Bastardo as he was more a luxury than a necessity. We have four very good arms back there. Expect Sanchez to be stretched out though and he could well end up being the th starter. If thats the case then you still have CecilOsunaStoren. Osuna wont be stretched out as a starter this year as he still has to build up his innings count so I expect him to be the thth inning guy rather than the closer.With few really dependable arms still out there I think that the team is just going to try to add some starting depth for Buffalo. Thats fine with me. We need more guys to fit in as  starters right now. Another place where they might spend money is to find a backup catcher though that might have to come by way of trade. Shapiro doesnt sound too enthused about depending on Thole if Martin were to go down with injury. Again we have enough good relievers,Torontobluejays,cz6uftc,7,t5_2sb61

6488898,0,t3_44hq8i,Well they have a budget to maintain. Lets say they signed Price. That means no Estrada and no Happ. So the starting rotation would be Price Stroman Dickey Hutchison SanchezAnd no depth to back that up. No money to resign Barney so the backup infielder would be Russell Martin he played some shortstop in college so hes the best fit. Maybe the can still make some of the minor league signings but mostly they cant afford anyone else. But heres what they did instead of spending  million on one player. Got two very goodsolid starters. They wont win the Cy Young award but with this offence theyll be fine. Improved the bullpen with the Storen pickup. Picked up Floyd to be a minor league starter or big league bullpen piece. Filled out the minor league roster. They need people there so theres depth in case of injuries.This is a much better option for the team since it takes  to  players during a season. The average team used  starters last year. If the jays signed Price then they jays would barely have  starters.,Torontobluejays,czqi0yy,3,t5_2sb61

They could they just dont want too.

6984692,0,t1_d17y5dx,Youre right that a solid starter is more valuable than an elite reliever. A lot of people argue that WAR undervalues relievers though because it doesnt take into account high or low leverage situations. For example a strikeout in the top of the second inning with nobody on base isnt nearly as valuable as a strikeout in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded but WAR would value them the same. Anyway I still agree with you. But theres definitely a debate over whether WAR really captures a relievers true value. ,Torontobluejays,d181zc3,4,t5_2sb61

7061371,0,t3_4cbeun,So this is just a bad way to rank teams. If you dont want to give this site a view they simply rank each team in offence Starting Pitching and bullpen from st to th average your rank in the three and that is your score lowest score wins. This doesnt take into account degrees of separation in teams. For example it would make no difference if we had scored one more run then the Yankees last year or the  that we did we would get a score of  and they get a . I think we can all agree that  runs is pretty important though. It also skews heavily towards pitching with a x weight when I think its pretty clear that it makes no difference if you score one more run or allow one fewer at the end of the day. Anyways Im assuming the author is a Yankees fan since I dont think anyone else is projected them as the th best team in baseball ahead of St louis Mets Pittsburg Dodgers Giants and of course the BoSox and Jays. ,Torontobluejays,d1grmnz,3,t5_2sb61

7230125,0,t1_d1zyj5t,Ill start off by saying  million for the next  years of Tulo should be a good deal.  The value is front loaded though and by the end I see him as a WAR player do to injuries and age regression which in  years might be worth million.  EE is a year older then him and the sub is quite critical of giving him a  year deal because that last year projects to be hard to justify...this is the same situation Tulo is a better player then EE as he can play D but you get the idea.I see Tulo by the end of the contract regressing enough that he is not the everyday shortstop.  He might be moved to third if we cannot keep Donaldson or transitioned to nd or corner outfield depending on how Goins and Travis develop I think he will still have enough in the tank not to be a BDH but his next contract might be signed as one.  The other concern is he just might end up playing even less games than before he is an injury risk and as you get closer and closer to  they take longer to heal I think his contract takes him to  or so.It isnt inconceivable that he could become like the guy he replaced.  Still one of the best hitting shortstops in the game to the point where he still holds the roster spot but slowed down to the point defensively that we are cheering for a replacement level player to get his spot.,Torontobluejays,d200fgz,2,t5_2sb61

7338177,0,t1_d2caay8,gtIm not entirely sold that Bautista would be a below average defender. Nor Im a sold that Smoakabello have an average bat or above average defense for that matter.Becoming an every day player at a different position will see growing pains. Theres things about first base that Bautista doesnt know and will have to learn. A ball in the dirt easily scooped by Smoak or Colla might be a passed ball with Bautista. Or a diving stab would instead be a base hit. Again as my comment stated variables. gtThat sounds made up to me.Well no matter what it sounds like to you its true. Look at Miguel Sano. There was a huge drop off on his bat after moving to the outfield from third. And thats a young guy. Imagine Bautista. The issue is that he would be spending more time learning his position and practicing and getting comfortable with it than he would be in the cages taking BP.

7447616,0,t3_4hb1yh,This game seemed all too familiar. We saw the starter pitch a gem and the offence didnt do much to help out. The frustration was palpable. Having said that the offence kicked into gear to close out the game. If they can play like they did in the th on a regular basis then everything will be fine.Stroman was phenomenal today. He went . IP with  H  K  ER Most impressive was his nine strikeouts which had been missing from his game in his previous five starts. If he can start to strike people out and not rely so heavily on contact then it would give the team a different look in the rotation. Its been such a nice change to have our starters pitching so well day in and day out.Things started off slow for the offence. Donaldson hit a solo shot  Everyone else was bad for much of the game. The only other preth inning hits came from Carrera and Barney. So our best hitter and two bench players were the whole offence. Or at least thats what this recap was going to look like until the very end of the game.Fortunately things turned around in the th. As mentioned Barney had a leadoff single double. Saunders then tried to lay down a bunt but Cedeno gifted him a fourpitch walk. Colome came in and helped us out by walking Donaldson. Bases loaded nobody out Bautista at the plate. Jose worked a full count before striking out swinging on what would have been a ball. Thankfully Edwin picked him up with a fielders choice RBI that should have been a double play. Tulowitzki then came up and hit a three run homer Pillar also hit a single before getting picked off on a play that really should have been called as interference against Ryan Webb. Im not sure what happened there. I guess that it was a judgment call which isnt reviewable. If thats the case then the umpires need better judgment. At least the offence had figured things out by then so it wasnt too costly.Osuna finally got to pitch again. It wasnt a save situation but I dont think the lead would have felt safe with anyone else on the mound. After a leadoff single he struck out Dickerson and Souza Jr. and Morrison popped out. Game over.Even after how yesterday went its hard to complain too much about this series. They won a series at the Trop and are  there on the season. Even better we dont go back to Tampa until September.,Torontobluejays,d2oqw62,75,t5_2sb61

8419210,0,t1_d5trbts,Youre assuming that the batter has more control over the pitches he sees than he really does. Getting the pitch you want isnt about blasting the first one your bat can touch its a matter of forcing the pitcher to give it to you by rendering his best stuff unviable. By fouling off as many as he did Travis made it clear to Villanueva that he wasnt going to strike out on the outside pitch leaving Villanueva no choice but to come in or walk him. The one time he tried to go inside Travis fouled it off. Thats a lot of wasted pitches. The reason no one calls a firstpitch homer masterful is because the batter has no direct influence on which pitch he receives whereas Travis saw the best Villanueva had to offer and rendered it all unviable. The only mistake he made was swinging at the inside pitch but he got where he needed to go because of his very professional approach. ,Torontobluejays,d5ty05s,10,t5_2sb61

Now he is getting worse on top of the fact he has had a couple of trips to the DL pretty frequently in the last two years.Why would we want Puig? He isnt a necessity as you kind of make him sound out to be hes not great basically you be throwing the dice and hoping hes good and healthy.Also BautistaDickey trade for prospectPuigLHP Yeah thatd be a great trade for no one first off why would any team be trading for a  year old pitcher who the team would need to ideally trade for his personal catcher or hope and pray with the knuckleball landing in the catchers gloves on top of the factDickey hasnt been pitching great frankly unless the Dodgers were looking to fire sale some players like the Padres have been doing just Dodgers definitely are a contending team so that wouldnt happen.Trading away Bautista for that wouldnt make sense period in this sense people are complaining with Bautista in right field at Rogers Centre I cant wait to see him in Dodgers Stadium which has a lot more ground to cover on top of the fact that frankly Bautista should be either at st base of DHing full time. But the main problem is that the Jays are a contending team prospects go out the window if the team has a shot at the World Series and seeing as the Jays are . games back prospects shouldnt be something they are trading top players for right now unless they get something equally good in return and thats not hoping and praying for Puig to live up to the hype.,Torontobluejays,d5z2gqb,2,t5_2sb61

Of course it helps Edwin is at  wRC.Nate Silver did an interesting piece back when he was still at Baseball Propsectus called Making RBIs Useful. I tried my hand at calculating Edwins Context Independent RBI CIRBI for this year but unfortunately Fangraphs only has stats for a batter with a bases empty b men on base and c men in scoring they dont specify how they did in particular baseout states. Ah well.As a substitute we can notice that Edwin has been underperforming in clutch situations. His Clutch stat for  ranks th worst in baseball at . Saunders actually ranks as the worst at .. Thats a poor grade according to Fangraphs  Its worth pointing out that this isnt prescriptive. As noted on summary pagegtClutch does a good job of describing the past but it does very little towards predicting the future. Simply because one player was clutch at one point does not mean they will continue to perform well in highleverage situations and vice versa. Very few players have the ability to be consistently clutch over the course of their careers and choking in one season does not beget the same in the future.Man I really got off topic.,Torontobluejays,d6j88lw,7,t5_2sb61

I know were all used to not having a chance unless we destroy teams but this team has shown this year that we can win with mostly pitching. Sure thats not going to win us a world series but it is enough to get us a playoff spot or at least keep us in the hunt while we wait for the offence to figure it out. Be patient.

8870417,0,t3_51qx9w,I looked back to last years lineup when we scored a lot of runs solely for the purpose of maybe we should do that lineup just for the sake of doing something? Then I realized how huge Colabello was for us. This was the lineupRevereDonaldsonBautistaEdwinSmoakColabelloTuloMartinNavarroPillarGoinsIt is amazing that on paper we replaced Revere with Saunders and Goins with Travis but have a less potent offense. Just shows what a magical year last year was.  We could do the same lineup with Travis as lead off Saunders in the th spot and Upton at ? Again solely for the purpose of just doing something.,Torontobluejays,d7e3kwf,6,t5_2sb61
8872635,0,t3_51qx9w,The way I see it is this no matter what anyone says whatever happens is going to happen. No one can predict the future. If this team is going to do it theyre going to do it and if they cant then thats that. If they start losing and end up in the wildcard spot or worse out of the playoffs then maybe we can just chalk it up to a great push last year. Or they could end up smashing their way into first place and everyone will be laughing at these posts at the end of the month. Statistics can only speak so much but winning games is the thing that counts. As long as there are still games left theres still games to be won so I wouldnt be getting too worked up just yet. We know what this team can do when theyre hot its just whether or not theyre going to be hot against Boston and Baltimore for the rest of the month. ,Torontobluejays,d7ed6b2,6,t5_2sb61

8945618,0,t1_d7n30a0,Okay theres a few points I need to decompress here.Yes the Jays are a part of Rogers Media but so is SportsNet and they need content to show on the air when hockeys not in season. Hell the RogersNHL deal hasnt borne fruit yet so they need proven ratings hits to keep their ratings high and thus charge their advertisers profitable rates. And a winning Jays team especially postseason Jays is a proven ratings hit.The key point in your second statement is dont grow revenue to match. You saw how the fanbase came out in droves this season when during the slow April start.  million fans for the first time since . The message is clear to Rogers  invest in the team and youll earn back the revenue by more than that. The multiplier effect is in full force here especially with Rogers owning the team the stadium and the broadcaster they get every penny someone spends on the Jays.For arguments sake if Rogers spends M on the Jays they may see M in revenues across the board. But they expanded payroll up to roughly M this year and they could very well see M in revenues. If I was a CEO Id keep raising payroll until we saw diminishing returns then level off there because the revenue increases would come in line with the team.I also think youre overestimating how much of an impact the Jays payroll makes on Rogers bottom line. In their  annual report Rogers Communications pulled in . billion in revenue with  billion in operating profits. Rogers Media in particular had revenues and profits of . billion with M in profit. Adding on the annual salary of a Bryce Harper or Jose Fernandez even at M a year again for arguments sake would be the equivalent of a . drop in the bottom line for Rogers Communications  thats a rounding error for Petes sake. Its more drastic for the media division true but I think the other more stable and profitable parts of Rogers already subsidizes it because potential wireless cable and Internet customers get Rogers Media content as an incentive to choose Rogers.have I said Rogers enough? yeeshI think after the calendar year weve had Rogers management has finally seen the light that yes investing in the team makes business sense too. Certainly moreso than the opposite.,Torontobluejays,d7n4qj3,3,t5_2sb61

Im someone with Irish ancestry and the Celtics logo doesnt bother me at all. It really bothers me more that they dont pronounce the word Celtic properly but that isnt cause to get angry more just amusement over dumbasses mispronouncing words.I think that if a logo offends someone it should be changed its just a logo. But I really dont get why people are going on with the hyperbole of if some other ethnic group was used as a mascot wouldnt it offend you? like theyre making some grand checkmate on everyone. Dude my ethnic group is used in the exact same way and no it doesnt bother me. Stop with the guilt trips just say it offends some people and leave it at that.,Torontobluejays,d8rxw9z,2,t5_2sb61

9286384,0,t1_d8t124h,Well to start the Pirates and Raiders names and logos represent chosen professions are not specific to race and dont use sambostyle racist caricatures. The Celtics on the other hand simply have a person in their logo. Its not a midget just a guy wearing Irish looking clothes and leaning on a shillelagh. If you think a guy being dressed and spinning a basketball is offensive by all means protest. Your argument would have worked better had you chosen Notre Dame and the fighting Irish but there is a growing movement to eliminate that.People like to say none of the native American people are offended but thats just not true. There has been native people showing up to protest the use of the name and predominantly the logo on opening day for many many years. Even if most are not offended does that really matter? Should we as people continue to marginalize minorities or even a minority of minorities simply to avoid having to change a racist caricature of a logo or a derogatory slur of a team names?,Torontobluejays,d8t471o,1,t5_2sb61

Because there are positions that definitely need improvement.Some  will come off the books when they let Bautista walk which they should because hes  and has given little indication that hell be worth the investment this time around. Dickey will freeup some more and he doesnt even need to be replaced.But just a look at the names weve got until  or later has got to make a fan feel goodDonaldson Tulo Martin Happ Smoak Loup Carerra Pillar Goins Sanchez Osuna Stroman Schultz Tepera Travis Pompey and Ceciliani and very likely Biagini.Thats a good list. Thats a solid foundation to build off of. A decent catcher a budding B a solid SS a excellent B serviceable glove backups at B and IF a solid CF three very good SPs a closer a serviceable backup OF a couple guys with RP potential and a couple OF prospects.Thats pretty darn good. Theyll need to get a few quality bullpen arms eventually a couple more decent starters a B EE!!! and corner OFs not too hard to find on the market.

9339735,0,t1_d8zhcay,Keeping your slowest player on base  because hes not the tying or winning run is old school baseball and fails to looks at the situation. Keeping your fastest player on the bench in case you get the tying run is the same logic Showalter applied when he kept Britton in the pen in case the Orioles got the lead. Heres what the situation was Dioner Navarro was on base with one out. Kevin Pillar is up and the potential tying run is on deck. Pillar is a threat to GIDP and neutralize the threat moreso with Navarro on base Pillars wGDP  he has GIDP  times and rd in GB. If that happens th inning starts with  coming up. Despite the  eventually starting the th if Pompey pinch runs for Navarro then Lindor has no play anywhere and we have runners on stampnd with Bautista on base.Based on the scenario you suggest bringing in a pinch runner. the only people Pompey can run for is Barney Bautista Donaldson Encarnacion and Tulowitzki or Martin. All of which are bad situations because you are tied after  you have replaced one of your four best bats with Pompey he of  PAs editor Goins or have switched Navarro for Martin at C in which case the P is now batting. Under your PR criteria PRing for Barney is in the unlikely scenario where both Pillar and Barney get on base. Gibbons failed to give his team a chance to get back into the game in the th and that cannot be ignored.,Torontobluejays,d8zvnyh,2,t5_2sb61

Im much happier with that than overpaying for fowler like the cardinals are. Plus its not like our team is shit or anything. We still have one of the best rotations in the AL and our offense is still really good despite what people would have you think. Even our bullpen is still solid with osuna biagini and grilli and im sure they will add a couple more pieces later in the offseason.

9949253,0,t3_5hyxw2,I think you need to apply a bit more critical thinking about what these stats imply with respect to runs scored. For example there is a positive relationship between HRs and Rs  there has to be by their very nature of  HR   R.  But how many Rs a HR scores is context dependent  sometimes the bases are empty sometimes they are loaded and thats not up to the batters skill but the teams overall skill  so the correlation isnt strong.Likewise SBs are really important in the context of their success rate creating outs is very damaging to run production.  I would guess if you look at SB success rate that youll see a bit of a positive correlation but SB success rate has to be high in order for the trade off the extra bases outweighing the extra outs.,Torontobluejays,db4ew76,2,t5_2sb61

9977920,1,t3_5igerc,I think Shatkins gets too much credit for Happ and Estrada. Atkins wasnt even hired when they signed Happ. And I dont really get how Atkins gets so much credit for Estrada when Estrada had a great season and it was clear he wanted to resign here. I get the Price rumors but this pipe dream that we could have offered more than what the Red Sox did was insanity. So I personally hate this whole narrative that started about Shatkins chose HappEstrada over Price! I think a lot of the offseason last year was a continuance of AALa Cava. And I would say that if Happ was a disaster too. Overall I am going to judge them for what happens this year as it is clear it is them that are driving the boat. Trade wise its a wash for me because I still dont like the Chavez trade I didnt like Storen because I didnt like his numbers  nothing to do with Revere Smoak extension Upton trade also not a huge fan of the Liarano trade I personally dont value prospects high because we all scream about budget and potentially that plus Upton plus Smoak could be almost  million this year. Obviously Grilli was great but apparently AAGibbons wanted him in the past too. Again I think if last year was a disaster I wouldnt blame it on them  maybe La Cava pushed for ChavezStoren?Im patient and am indifferent at the moment. Dont hate them dont love them. Just like AA they will have to earn my love. I also dont love prospects as much as others so who knows. I think Shapiro gets way too much credit for  Indians as I doubt he would do the Andrew Miller trade and that is really a big reason why they made it to the WS. I hope hes learned and realized sometimes you have to go all in for a trade but maybe not. Also this offseason not a fan so far. I think they jumped the gun on Morales because I just dont think a DH only player is that important that you need to sign him without first seeing the market for EE and Jose. ,Torontobluejays,db85g08,-2,t5_2sb61
9978194,0,t1_db85wva,I can give them credit for Happ because Shapiro was in place and chose to put the resources towards him. Upton was in the midst of a decent season when the Jays signed him. He was better than any of our bench bats and provided legitimate depth ifwhen Saunders or Bautista got injured. The fact that he failed to deliver doesnt make it a bad trade. There was a real belief that Upton had regained his form. Being able to gamble on that upside for nextto nothing shouldnt be seen as a bad move.As I said Hendriks was not good in high or medium leverage situations. But he was good in low leverage spots So the Jays had a choice. They could retain their quality mopup man with control or swap him for someone who could potentially be a starter and sure looked like a decent reliever. At the time Hutchison was still penciled in as the  starter with no depth in Buffalo. I can understand why they wanted depth. The extra year of control never tipped the balance for me in favour of keeping a mopup man instead of trading for a potential starter.Sure it is premature to say that this was the best drat since . But when you look at the players who they brought in compare them to years past and listen to what Baseball America has to say Im hardpressed to think of a better class. Most of them wont live up to their high expectations but they offer a lot of potential. Hell if we can convince other teams of their potential then job done. Trade pieces are valuable.,Torontobluejays,db86qby,5,t5_2sb61

A very rare few can make an immediate jump to the bigs without any seasoning and most prospects spend  years in the minors being being considered.

11060432,0,t1_deloamw,I think that Stroman will have a good year. Maybe not as good as his  but probably better than his . He made some positive strides in the second half that I think can be sustainable.The reason I say that Sanchez could be a disappointment is that I think people expect him to take another step forward this year. If he adds a solid changeup then maybe he can. But I dont think he will. I see him still being a very good pitcher but a . ERA seems a bit farfetched. His peripherals improved last year but still give some cause for concern. A .. ERA would still be a very good season but it would also be a step back from where he was last year and thats where I can see him ending up though its also possible that he has another Cy Youngcalibre season or he might lose his control and GB and end up north of ..

Youve got a lot of good advice in this thread so far but I also think theres another simple way to go about it  just watch games live. Watching old games is great but live baseball is always amazing never knowing when the next huge play is gonna happen or something offthewall comes out of nowhere.Spring Training is on right now  sort of a bunch of friendlies held a month before a season to get everyone prepared and to test out new signings and prospects. Opening day of the main season is on April rd! Plenty of time to get yourself immersed. Hope you enjoy.If you ever need help understanding whats going on Id be happy to help you with any questions.

Obviously if you have a bunch of players that hit for close to  you can arrange your batting order such that your run production plummets. It all depends on the specific numbers involved and combined with the Jays losing so many low scoring games the impact is a lot higher. I dont need to be lectured about the numbers from you.Literally just one example I pulled up without even trying. Martin struck out with the bases loaded. The next batter hit a single in the next inning. Martin should have been hitting th. Theres no guarantee the same thing happens in that circumstance but multiply that by  games and x players that are in suboptimal positions. You are going to win at least  more game with better management and were only  games into the season. The point is Gibbons at best doesnt do any better than some random Joe. I can write a computer program to do his job and the Jays would have a better record because of it.

Finally Salty has been so bad at the plate. Hes literally striking out  of the time.

11727160,0,t3_67bpfk,You know a lot of guys will say that youre just a keyboard fan and havent played in organized sports. I can tell you as far as physical abuse goes its irrelevant. Yes vets can taun rookies or make them do menial tasks but never physical or emotional abuse. There is an imaginary barrier line and it should not be crossed.I think Zaun does not have perspective on how the clubhouse has changed since he retired. Old school mentality is a thing and it still has its hold on some clubhouses. There are some things which used to happen but they were not right. We have better information now and those things needs to be pushed out.

The Jays seem to be a perfect storm of regression age and bad luck this year and its hard to imagine that the pendulum swings back next year. The best thing an organization can do is be pragmatic. My personal view is that if we havent magically salvaged the season in the next  or  games then we start looking to sell our assets to put us in the best position in the long term. The good news is that with our payroll and current assets it shouldnt take a savvy front office long to get us back into regular contention over a long period of time.,Torontobluejays,dgv9gnr,1,t5_2sb61
