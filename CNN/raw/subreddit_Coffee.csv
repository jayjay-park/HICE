5665,0,t3_1u6r64,Ive owned multiple generations of Contigo Autoseal mugs and they are without a doubt my favorite travel mugs. I had issues with the first two generations eventually getting a bit gummed up but in all honesty it was our fault as we were sometimes waiting days to rinse them out due to forgetting them in the car or my wifes purse which in addition to being very stinky is bad for the longevity of the mugs life as the original Autoseals were a pain to clean once youd gummed them up.However Ive yet to run into any of those problems with the latest generation which I think is partially due to us being better about rinsing them out in a timely fashion and partially due to improved design. If you do go with the Contigos I highly recommend them especially if you have access to a Costco where they are super cheap in sets try to get the latest version.,Coffee,cef2yep,3,t5_2qhze

16876,0,t3_1ub8kv,Good article. Id love to get into home roasting myself. Ive recently past few months discovered the absolute nirvana of fresh roasted coffee and I can never go back. I source my beans from both a subscription service Modest Coffee and a coworker who home roasts. There are times when I run out of both and cant get more for a few days though. In those cases I have to default to something like Starbucks whole bean until I can get more. I dont think there are any local stores who roast in my small town I should probably find out. I would love to get a very small setup that would let me roast a pound at a time. ,Coffee,cegcsfs,2,t5_2qhze

33284,0,t3_1uhkef,Well need to know more about the tools you have at your disposal. In all likelihood the beansgrounds are stale already but there might be something you can do to squeeze more flavor out of the brew.    If youre using a standard automatic drip machine use  full tablespoons of ground coffee for every  ounces of brewing water youre using. Id also recommend starting with very hot filtered water throw it in a kettle on the stove let it boil then cool a few minutes as most typical auto drip brewers use heaters that wont brew hot enough if you start with cold water.    If you have something else like a french press or drip cone at your disposal we can offer advice for those as well. Alternatively check out Brew Methods for a plethora of techniques.    I know for certain Kopi Luwak will never receive a penny from me but you shouldnt be shunned just because you got a gift. I would however advise that you dont go in expecting to be blown away as the coffee is more about the mystique of drinking feces than it is about flavor. Its supposed to be unique but not worldclass or awardwinning.,Coffee,cei7ykb,2,t5_2qhze

70966,0,t3_1ux17z,Dont really think its an absurd question though I am definitely no expert on this. However Ive realized that I prefer my coffee from cupsglasses with a thinner lip. I think it makes the coffee easier to sip and actually changes the taste. Although thicker cupsglasses have better heatretaining abilities I find that because of my preference for lighter roasts a thinner glass usually enhances the flavour plus allows my coffee to cool at a good rate for me to enjoy the coffee both hot from the initial brew and cool enough at almost room temperature to taste the change in flavour.

The slightly higher priced gaggia new baby or something like thatlook a little better than the gaggia pure the pure is a just a big hunk of black plastic but it works pretty good.as you may know the reason these are recommended is because of the commercial style nonpressurized portafilter most of the similar priced machines have pressurized portafilter which isnt so good.,Coffee,cepr5cv,1,t5_2qhze
103678,0,t3_1v7p7m,Completely seriousIf you want to actually get the signature Starbucks flavor its not found in overroasting. Anyone can make a Vienna roast Starbucks is usually much lighter than that yet still tastes toasty.Heres the secret Roast fairly quickly until you hear the very first first crack then stop. I mean that literally. Hear a single crack and pull it. Cool it down quite a ways if possible let it rest. Once it has cooled  minutes resume roasting go through first crack keep going till as dark as you desire. Even at a light roast though youll get the taste. Whether you love it or hate it I care not thats how you get it.I think it has to do with the endothermic reaction that happens during first crack which requires significant heat inputs to continue properly. Without that source something goes awry. But thats just a guess really.And in case you are wondering I discovered this when I popped a circuit breaker right as first crack began once and that same breaker also had my basement lights so I had to maneuver through the obstaclerich basement in the dark before I carried a phone that had a light on it without waking my wife sleeping just above in order to reset the breaker. By the time I returned the beans had cooled so I figured I would find out what they tasted like and probably subsequently toss them rather than just toss them. I have repeated this experiment twice more purposefully with the same result.tldr Starbucks coffee isnt messed up the banal way you think it is it is messed up in a strangely creative way.,Coffee,ceq8h1l,3,t5_2qhze
106858,0,t3_1va9uu,Intelligensia is great. I am in the midwest so they are the roaster whose coffee I can enjoy in person with the greatest ease. I primarily do espresso and I really enjoy Honey Badger and my girlfriend enjoys a Honey Badger Affogado. Its double desert. Holiday mornings with my family have the celebration blend as a staple. Really all around a great experience.However there are other really quality roasters in Chicago that deserve your time and attention if you are in the area. Passion House is great and flies low on the radar with Chicagoans in my experience. They have some amazing pour over blends and SOs that are unique and enjoyable. Metropolis is a serviceable roaster with some sentimental memories for me I lived in Rogers Park and frequented the Granville location though I think the Metropolis roasts tend to be too dark and leave to few origin flavors for your enjoyment. ,Coffee,ceqliho,2,t5_2qhze

Link is for same article  ScienceDirect and Pubmed The findings from this study conducted by researchers at Oxford Brookes found that adding tea to milk lowers the overall antioxidants in the tea  assessed using a method that tests the ferric iron reducing antioxidant power FRAP of the tea itself. This simply means that there are fewer compounds present that can prevent oxidation from happening in your body. In fact they found that the most wellknown compounds  catechins were completely absorbed into the bloodstream even with added milk.

343107,0,t3_1xzwi8,As a Barista Id make you another free shot if you brought it back saying This is tasting a bit sour  Id offer before you even asked for another but I would be surprised if you did ask and they refused... I probably wouldnt come back.Its hard to answer how to say... formatted questions over the internet because there is so many nonverbal factors that play into that kind of conversation. Unless you talk like a total asshole in general Id assume that the Barista would give you the benefit of the doubt. Whats most important is being aware of the Baristas environment before you ask. If there is a lul in the line start a conversation about it. If there isnt an easy opportunity stand next to the pickup counter and wait a bit until you ask  if I noticed that someone who has already received a drink is waiting I will always ask them if they need anything else. Although there is a bunch of snobbery when it comes to the specialty coffee scene a Baristas job is service. If you feel judged by your local Barista... theyre doing something wrong. Heck you telling the Barista about a poor quality shot is probably really helpful. Then the Barista can make proper adjustments and give future customers the best damn drink they can make  all because of your input!TLDR  Be your nice self. Be aware of the working circumstances.

It can vary a lot in taste from lot to lot and throughout the year but the common thread in all of it is amazing balance acidity and that unmistakeable fruity character. It also responds very well to different roast levels.If you like Kenya you should give Sulawesi a try if you get the chance. Tana Toraja is the variety I always get its similar to Kenya in the way the cup is balanced but the fruits are a bit more roundedsweet and there is a bit more earthiness to it.

454551,0,t1_cfrwz44,Heres the point Im trying to makeLets say youre a typical American used to making Folgers in a Mr. Coffee. The change you could make that would make the single biggest improvement in your coffee IMHO along with adjusting ratios since your typical American is probably not using enough coffee per unit of water is to start buying whole beans and grinding right before brewing  even if its a bag of Peets from the grocery store hell even a bag of  OClock would be a big improvement.Depending on your setup once your grinding whole beans the change that will have the next biggest impact again my opinion would be method  tossing out the Mr. Coffee for a french press Aeropress pourover etc.At that point youll probably get the next largest improvement from using fresher beans. Youre right that the difference is significant but not in my opinion as significant as the first two steps.With the amount of coffee I drink and beans at my favorite local roaster running around  a pound Ive made the decision to skimp a bit on the last step. Yes there is a difference in quality but not much as you might think. Per pound beans at Costco are about half the price or even a bit less. Thats more than enough in my mind to make up for the difference in quality.One of these days Ill get back into roasting my own again and this will all be moot.,Coffee,cfrxj57,5,t5_2qhze

Quality grind also mandatory possible on pods but probably done differently. most pod machines simulate grind and tamping through a pressurized portafilter system that produces a lot of crema and nothing else.  temperature this has more play and really needs to be tuned to the coffee being used. hottermore bitter coldermore sour.Im sure automation is in fact capable of producing a solid cup in fact we already have this in world or superautomatic machines. These grind tamp and pull the shot with the push of a button. Have adjustable pressure grind and temp parameters and are quite expensive but approachable. Still without fresh coffee theyre no better than a steamtoy. They also require extensive cleaning to keep producing consistent espresso.Im going to have to side with baristas here.

516343,0,t3_201mwa,I have a Silvia too and while its a great machine it has a few flaws. The single no heat exchange boiler is one. After youve pulled your shot you have to wait an age to get up to steam temperature to froth the milk. All this time your shot is getting cold and the crema is slowly dissipating. With doubleboiler or heat exchange models its instantaneous so your coffee is ready so much faster. Its also not fun if youre making a second cup to have to cycle down the temp back to brewing temperature. The other issue is the manual process of extracting your shot. Theres no automatic cutoff when youve extracted the right amount of espresso so you can either weigh your shots or count them off assuming your tamp grind and dosing are all good. Many higherend machines have a plumbedin version which is so much bettermore convenient. Im always worried about running out of water in the Silvia water tank  considering how many people have burnt out the element. If youre not in a hurry just keep an eye out on classifieds sites or craigslist for someone whos selling a nicer machine for cheap. If youre patient youll be able to find a great bargain.

The drip rate had to be adjusted a few times as the water level in the bottle dropped. I kept it around s. It didnt really matter that the seal between the bottle and the infusion set wasnt entirely airtight because the slight vacuum in the bottle and the waters surface tension prevented water from taking the wrong route.

689392,0,t3_221drz,I seriously doubt it has anything to do with chaff. It probably has more to do with your roast being fresher.  Are you allowing a bloom?  The Encore is a pretty decent grinder but still throws some fines.  It will be important to avoid washing fines into the tip.  Avoid pouring around the edge of the bed.  It may be better to target a grind size that minimizes the production of fines since more fines may be produced at the coarsest settings.

Thank you for doing this! It seems like when history records the rise of coffeehouses in the th and th century it mostly focuses on England and the penny university.  Is that because of Englands leading role in commerce and culture in that time period or its colonial domination of Africa or are there other factors?  What was coffee house culture like in other parts of Europe like Scandinavia or Holland or Eastern Europe? Are there any social constructs that arose from the coffee house culture of that era that still function today maybe in other venues?  Could the advancements in science and culture commonly attributed to coffee houses during the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution happen in todays coffee house environment or has that type of communication and information sharing moved into other realms?  ,Coffee,cgjd2k9,2,t5_2qhze

In other terms  ounces is about  mL which could perhaps be rounded up to  mL given that the coffee mass will retain water and we usually measure brew inputs when talking about ratios. This is still a rather conservative figure but Im merely trying to illustrate a point. A standard starting ratio is about  grams of coffee per liter of water so youd want somewhere in the ballpark of  grams of coffee. That translates to . ounces or a bit shy of a quarter pound of coffee per pot. You should expect to get four pots per pound with some left over. Too much less and youll have a liter and a half of overextracted under strength coffee.,Coffee,ch6hvd6,3,t5_2qhze

I dont have a lot of experience with this machine but from what I can tell your friend seems to have only half the story.  If theres actual steam coming through the group thats gonna scald the shit out of your beans.  After youve turned off the steam boiler run the grouphead without a PF until its just water coming out.  Then grind tamp and pull and you should be at a better brew temp.  If you want to get technical about it get a styrofoam cup a stopwatch and a thermometer.  Wait set amounts of time say   and  seconds after steam stops coming out the grouphead.  Pull g or so of water into the cup after waiting  seconds.  Repeat the heating procedure and do this again at  seconds and then again at  if the temp still seems to high.  In this way youll find the amount of time you need to wait to hit your optimal brew temp.   You can do the same experiment using any other reliable temperature indicator  such as the brew light on the machine.  Watch for when the light comes on bust out your stopwatch and pull some water into your styrofoam cup.  Eventually youll get an idea of the heating cycles of your machine and know when the best time is to pull.  Or you can google Gaggia Classic Temp surfing and see what comes up Im sure theres plenty of information out there. ,Coffee,chl5xi2,3,t5_2qhze

Its otherwise a pretty nice little spot and would be awesome if their coffee was up to par but I suppose theyll just have to learn the hard way and hopefully adapt to our developing palates. ,Coffee,chlcho0,9,t5_2qhze

Fill the aeropress with water to the top.  Then start a timer and let sit for  seconds.   Then stir for  consistent seconds.  Put the lid on tight.  Flip.  Press as slow as humanly possible.  Literally just put your hand on the press.   Take about  minute  seconds to press everything out.   The timer should end At . M he said thats usually bulletproof.

Again this is the cheapest way to get a decent cup on a college budget. If youre really tight on money Cafe Bustello coffee is better then most major brands and comes preground so you dont need a grinder. You can brew in a drip machine and make an ok cup of coffee.

1218048,0,t3_281vai,Yep coffee is definitely a popular drink in Turkey and theres some excellent stuff to be had. The length of time it takes to prepare Turkish coffee and to drink it given that its served so hot makes it even more of a ritual than I already have at home. Im told by an Albanian friend that the same kind of culture is pretty prevalent throughout the Balkans. Having said that though tea is probably more commonly consumed over the course of the day particularly as a social or hospitality thing.Italy definitely has the sort of culture of strong coffee that you describe cappuccino in the morning if thats your bag but woe betide you if you try ordering one after am Ive seen American tourists literally laughed out of a cafe for that and espresso throughout the day. Quite a few Italians I know do tone it down in the evening. The strength of the coffee culture is still evident though  in many cases toning it down means switching to caffeinefree caffe orzo made from roasted barley which is treated much the same as espresso. It tends to come in teabaglike things that are just put in the basket of the espresso machine. Its surprisingly tasty not really that much like coffee but still quite rich and I found that it benefited from the addition of a little sugar.Just for context I live in the UK but have spent a fair bit of time in Turkey and Italy on workstudy trips with people living there.,Coffee,ci6nd5o,6,t5_2qhze

1263427,0,t3_28jy0j,I dont think Ive ever washed my Aeropress. The rubber seal really does keep the coffee maker clean. You could really just wipe it with a wet paper towel and dry it off before you store it. Look into an electric kettle  there are plenty on Amazon. Some of them are pretty inexpensive and itll heat water a lot better than a microwave. Its possible that youve already thought of that but I figured Id share anyway!Not sure what other equipment you have  but you could really go legit and get a decent burr grinder like the Hario. Works well for a finer grind like the aeropress and its pretty cheap. There are also a lot of coffee bean subscription services out there to get good beans shipped to your dorm. Its actually cheaper than buying a cup of coffee every day too. Doing the math  If you go with a subscription service like Moustache Coffee Club  they charge about  dollars for a  ounce bag of coffee which includes shipping. About  grams in every ounce  so thats  dollars for about  grams of coffee. The aeropress depending on who you ask uses roughly  grams for a oz cup of coffee. That makes each cup about .. Youre also supporting sustainable growing small business and overall better coffee. KCups will likely be cheaper quicker and more convenient. Cant really blame a college student for making a decision based on those qualities! Just my two cents. ,Coffee,cibr26k,3,t5_2qhze

Both being the same price youll likely get better value from a hand grinder though there are like four or five in production that are worth considering so if you have  to spend for instance electric would be better  Conical burrs are not inherently better than flat burrs.  There are cheap crappy flat burrs.  There are cheap crappy conicals.  There are excellent versions of each.  Most all? hand grinders are conicalburr grinders presumably because the way a flatburr works is by using centrifugal force in part to feed the beans and eject the grinds.  It wouldnt work nearly so well with the slow speed of a hand grinder.If you have enough for a Lido  and are willing to grind by hand get that.

I dont know if this is what they have in your store but if you are making one cup at a time its hard to get a good technique with these because the sides are too tall its simply too large.A french press is not too bad just be sure to pour the coffee out of the french press and into another vessel after a few minutes so the coffee doesnt continue to brew even after the plunger is pressed down.Im guessing you dont have a grinder?  Getting preground is a loss in flavor but it will do.  It turns out that light roasts seems to benefit in particular from being freshly ground because the aromatics are more delicate and volatile.  Dark roasts more ashy taste persists even when ground.   Finding good coffee in a supermarket is tough.  Im going to go ahead and suggest an aeropress and a blade grinder.  You could get those both at World Market.  Blade grinder should do alright with an aeropress because you can just grind fine and do a quick plunge with the aeropress after  seconds so it doesnt taste overextracted.,Coffee,cirhg1t,1,t5_2qhze

1782878,0,t1_ck3uxfr,Fair enough.  Im guessing decreasing temperature is an issue along with decreasing pressure which would both contribute to the underextraction you noted.  Do have a way to measure the temp of your shot? Do you use boiling water? Do you preheat the handpresso somehow I really have a limited understanding of how it works so excuse any ignorance that may be coming through here. Given the choking issue you may well find that letting the beans rest  days will allow for a finer grind andor a higher dose with less choking since there will be less offgassing.

Grinding your beans fresh will make a world of a difference in getting a good cup of coffee. To avoid having to get a new kettle I would stay away from pourover methods. Look at getting an Aeropress a very popular choice here or if that doesnt interest you you could also get a French press.

2506782,0,t3_2obrxx,Im gonna copypaste a post a friend in the coffee business wrote on this because it was pretty interesting for meOver tacos a while back a friend and colleague said something that stuck with me ever since. He mentioned that specialty coffee as an industry shames success like no other and I cant say I disagree with him. Starbucks as a company gives me many conflicting opinions. On the one hand no one in middle america might know what a latte was if not for them. On the other hand everyone in middle america thinks they know what a cappuccino is and are often wrong because of them. The very idea that coffee can be a pleasure that coffee can be a luxury was promoted to hell by Starbucks and it has sunk in greatly as a national ideal because of them. It has also promoted the ideal that in order to be a pleasure that coffee needs to be diluted to hell with milk caramel and mountains of whipped cream. I had my first espresso at Bongo Java before Starbucks arrived in town. It was terrible. After Starbucks arrived the company started taking its coffee program more seriously because they could no longer afford to be the only game in town. They needed to be better than the chain. It was on that model be better than Starbucks that I ultimately cut my teeth in this industry. Better though just meant more nuanced and balanced raw coffee taste with more local character. We couldnt compete with them on speed or convenience or consistency of course. Last year the US cup tasters champion was won by a lady from the jolly green mermaid and I cant say it surprises me one bit. The variance in flavor between various sources of coffees can be vast and Starbucks needs the Pike Place Blend to taste the same from Aukland to Zurich. Their tasters need to understand nuances of coffee that mere retail quality control folks like me cant fathom. Anyone whos seen a Starbucks barista working a busy shift on a Linea classic can tell you that they are hella good baristas. Starbucks has the buying power they have the money they have the passion and they have the skills to do everything that your Intelligentsia your Counter Culture your Stumptown heck your Peace Coffee does.Im fascinated by this space.

This place is awesome.  The building is great the atmosphere is great and the coffee is great.  This is the highest priced place because I feel like you pay for the atmosphere.  For noncoffee drinkers you will feel overwhelmed and out of place.My favorite  Crema.  These guys know their coffee and still have a great atmosphere.  They are a little more tame than Barista Parlor and youll feel more welcome if you arent a hipster.  Though there is still an over abundance of macbooks beards and undercuts.Cheapest th and Roast.  This is another great coffee shop decent atmosphere cheap coffee and multiple brewing methods.  You can try clever beehive aeropress etc.  The others will have v and Chemex options but thats about it.  Barista Parlor has siphon for a few beans.Food and Coffee  Fido.  They get their coffee from Bongo Java a local roaster and they brew it right.  I mainly do espresso drinks here so Im not sure if they do pour over.  The food is amazing here.

Professional roastersreally intense coffee drinkers will go through cupping to figure out which flavors they should notice but the way I see it is that if you can pick out the flavors described in the coffees flavor profile and just from smelling the beans beforehand its probably brewed pretty well. ,Coffee,cmzqsao,2,t5_2qhze

2777304,0,t3_2rvw1p,I think whole bean coffee should contain more caffeine because it is fresh. Pre ground coffee goes stale sooner and looses some caffeine content. There are  reasons why you might be more relaxed placebo effectIve noticed people tend to over exaggerate the effect off coffee on their bodylighter roastThe pre ground coffee may have been a lighter roast which contains more caffeine although I doubt this to be the case because lower end coffees tend to over roast to mask taste.   robusta coffeeThis probably the most likely. Many cheaper coffees add in robusta beans which contain a larger amount of caffeine compared to arabica coffee. Arabica beans are used in higher end coffees because of their better taste. Robusta is used in lower end coffees because of the caffeine but their taste tends to be bitter.

All the chatter about you took a risk they have no money etc. is all BULLSHIT. You have options. Dont let anyone dissuade you from pursuing whatever settlement you feel is fair for the time effort and possibly money youre willing to invest in getting a resolution that is satisfactory to you. Maybe its not worth a few emails or phone calls to you. Thats fine. Your decision has nothing to do with anyone elses right to seek their own conclusion.My story. I purchased a ZPM Nocturn during the preorder phase from the ZPM website for  plus shipping for a total of about . This was step one in mitigating my risk. ZPM had a year in showed a working machine regular updates etc. so it was reasonable for me to put down what I felt was a fair amount for a bleeding edge machine. I have seen many other comments from people who used the same strategy. When I paid for the machine not a share in ZPM or a promise to deliver or  ZPMBucks that could later be traded in for a working machine I used a credit card. This part is important. When you use a credit card especially one that explicitly protects you from fraudulent charges YOU the user of the card are paying in advance for potential disputed charges in the future. Effectively you are paying for an insurance policy. The payment for that feature comes from your own pocket. The poor credit card company isnt stuck with your loss. They are using your own money to pay for it! How you ask?Merchants pay fees in the area of  on each transaction to access the various features of card payment systems. There are a number of positive reasons and benefits for them to pay this fee but it is a high fee so they mitigate it by raising prices on their goods to cover most or all of those costs. You the consumer are paying those fees. When the merchant fails to meet the obligations of the exchange they are rightly on the hook for the fraudulent charges.Should that merchant not have the ability to meet their obligations the agreement the credit card company makes with the consumer is we will pursue the merchant and if that fails we the CC company will refund the purchase price. The unspoken part of that agreement is our fees are high because we are pricing in our risk of having to refund unrecoverable fraudulent charges. Dont worry about us we will make a fuckload of money either way.So my point here is dont give up. If you want a refund figure out a way to get it. There is probably going to be a lawsuit. Maybe take part in that. If you Kickstarted the project get on board with others who are testing Kickstarters responsibility in this. If you bought with a credit card touch base with their customer service and see what they can do. There is a good chance you have some form of fraud or liability coverage on anything you buy with that card. You dont explicitly pay for that coverage but it is there. Dont feel bad for the CC companies. They are your business partner not your best friend. Allow them to work with you and execute their obligations to you the cardholder. Finally if you downvoted me I would appreciate it if you would turn the frown upside down.

It grinds fast for a hand grinder and is virtually maintenance free. This is the more expensive option that is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the skerton.   However this far exceeds your  budget.

After I killed it with green beans last month dont ask  it was a BAD morning I sent it in for repair a couple of weeks ago and it was returned better than new.I purchased it for espresso and it performed great at that task.  However within the last year I shifted more to pour over brewing using a Chemex and it does that satisfactorily for me as well.  Ive sometimes shifted between the two types and adjusting for espresso usually means a wasted shot or three to dial in the grind.I roast my own beans.  My palate is not advanced enough to discern flavor contamination from differing beansroast.  Then again I am not doing hazelnut or any other shit with weird flavors that would tend to capture my attention.Aesthetics are subjective.  Id agree that the Vario lacks the pizazz  of a Mazzer or Mahlknig yet the Baratza Vario does have Mahlknig inside according to a sticker on the hopper!.  On the other hand the Vario looks very purposeful to me in an almost sublime way.  I would not describe it as ugly but utilitarian and for my purposes espresso and pour over grinds it handles these tasks with aplomb.  I can see how it wouldnt look as good as some other choices but I cant imagine it looking like a sore thumb in any kitchen.,Coffee,coizto3,1,t5_2qhze

3318566,0,t1_cp6itzc,Seconded. Unless you know someone with an agtron or similar device colortec minolta etc. then youre not going to get it exact. If getting a clone roast is important to you Id recommend getting agtrons on them either by buying them and getting a roaster to see for you or by just asking them if youre close to the roasting facilities in question. Some are more open than others. Personally Ive never cared about releasing agtron numbers because anyone with their own machine and a credit card can find out what they are. Only other thing I can think of is that coffeereview usually has an agtron number listed when they do a review of a coffee.

3429327,0,t1_cpj45ln,gt We want the same extraction percentage across volumes  for the same coffee. Different coffees are going to taste better at different extraction ratios. For most brews this is going to be correlated to TDS but it doesnt have to be if for example we dilute the coffee afterwards. Yes this is what I was really getting at though you are right. My question was about the same coffee for two different volumes. gtMaking coffee too strong and then diluting it a little is a neat way to match up a good extraction for a particular coffee with each persons preference for strength.I agree I guess my whole goal here was to create a concentrate that wasnt over or under extracted which scales up to normal drinkable levels nicely. It seems the consensus is that aeropress isnt close to the saturation point even with  oz coffee doses so Im just gonna keep doing what Im doing and adjust for taste! ,Coffee,cpj63fx,1,t5_2qhze

3496163,0,t1_cpnh0l7,I think most of us realize that the comment was meant as a comedic reference.But coffee does age even if kept in an oxygenfree environment. The changes in the beans continue and when exposed to the air after a long period of storage as shared by the OP the beans rapidly oxidize and when ground the process is complete. When the bag was opened they might have smelled OK but once ground in this case they will smell and taste like they are seven or eight years old because they are. The only reported method that has been documented is for the beans to be stored in a sealed container and frozen in a deep freeze. The freezer section of a home fridge will be OK but for long term a deep freeze has been recommended. ,Coffee,cpqsded,1,t5_2qhze

3540475,0,t3_30tywh,gt Currently my theory is that the darker roasts have more oil on the outside of the bean which could help lubricate the plungerIt is a roastlevel characteristic but I very much doubt that the friction of the plunger on the walls of the tube is whats causing slow or hard pressing.  At least dark roasts arent easier to push than were it just filled with water right?  So its coming down to resistance in your puck far more than it is friction of the tube.  I dont know exactly why youre experiencing this Ill run some tests this week and see if I cant isolate this a little.  That said my initial guess is simply that dark roasted beans have a more damaged cell structure due to the longer roasting and may not be as solid or pack as tightly as harder lighter roast would.  I also think that the particles swell less on a light roast allowing them to settle closer togther?  ,Coffee,cpvu4q4,2,t5_2qhze

Spread the beans on the sheet pan and put them in an oven on low heat for  minutes or so. Id guess  is sufficient but I havent done this in a while so maybe google it first. The idea is you want to pull them out of the oven just before they reach first crack. When you pull them place them in the pot on high heat and stir the shit out of it. It should happen quickly but that depends on how hot they got in the oven. Youll hear a series of small pops as the beans continue to darken. Pull from heat once sufficiently roasted and cool them off rapidly. I use two bowls transferring back and forth. Give the beans a couple days before brewing.Using this method Ive been able to get a pretty consistent roast. Sure it takes time but in my opinion its a skill worth developing and youll save money if youre already paying for decent coffee. Plus its just badass.Dont know if this is what you were looking for but it is how I would save money on coffee. Hope you found this helpful. Enjoy.,Coffee,cqib8el,5,t5_2qhze

3752313,0,t1_cqjk9kg,I dont find a need to. I bloom the coffee then pour in circles so all of the coffee gets wet. Stirring wouldnt give me any more contact with the coffee. Id also like to add that the technique that Im currently using is only adding little water over the top of the coffee maybe in or cm and not filling the brewer to the top. The end result is a flatter and less conical stuck to the sides in the brewer that looks similar to how I added the coffee in the first place. Hypothesis If anything stirring would speed up my extraction time by not having to flow through the coffee and instead be more of a solution.,Coffee,cqjznpf,1,t5_2qhze

As far as noticing these flavors in super dark roasts I brewed in my French press any idea how they might have got there?I understand the idea of acquired tastes when it comes to thinks like scotch and various varieties of strong beers so I definitely like trying new things and even enjoying things I at first didnt think I would enjoy.  But perhaps with bright light roast coffees that is just something my palette doesnt like.What Id really really like to do is try various light and dark roasts but made by someone who knows what theyre doing and can tell properly brewed from off flavors.  Ive looked into cupping classes but they seem to be designed for professional roasters and as such are prohibitively expensive I would much rather spend  on something else...are there tastingcupping events for amateurs that are just trying to learn as opposed to be in the biz?,Coffee,cqnhn22,2,t5_2qhze

3850975,0,t3_34ix3v,I try out about  different coffees a year and the only way I can manage all those bags from  or so different roasters is to freeze most of it. My usual routine goes something like this. See an interesting coffee somewhere or someone recommends it or I get an email advertising some new coffee from a roaster. I go online and order the coffee and usually at least one other coffee from the same roaster. A few days later the coffees show up and since Im probably in the middle of another bag I cant get to them right away. I split the bags up in to what Ill drink in a few days anywhere from oz put them in zip lock bags label them put them all in a big freezer bag. Toss the bags in the freezer and Ill likely already have a few pounds of coffee already in there. When I get low on one coffee I look through what I have in the freezer pull out something that looks interesting and put in the cabinet for the next day. The next morning the coffee has come up to room temp and I can open the bag without worrying about condensation ruining the coffee and it tastes just as good as the day I got it. Usually Ill get behind because Im ordering more coffee than I drink but having some friends over for brunch every once in awhile will usually clear out my backlog. It also gives me the chance to pair up a few coffees that I think go well together or offer a range of coffee if I think some people are more adventurous than others or just dump a bunch of coffees I didnt love on my guests Freezing keeps the coffee from going stale and it means you dont have to worry about using coffee up in time. Just split the bags up in to whatever portion youll drink it could just be g per container.Some people like to drink multiple different coffees per day and that might require keeping track of roast dates more carefully but I like to drink the same coffee for a few days in a row at least so I can play around with different extractions.,Coffee,cqv8vnh,5,t5_2qhze

Its flavor profile changes more throughout the year than other blends but its usually a brighter cleaner espresso which is a style thats become much more popular lately.

4121882,0,t3_37u5pq,This is a pretty pisspoor article providing little in the way of new information or any sort of meaningful analysis of coffee consumption habits in America. The StarbucksDunkin divide has been widely noted before and is greatly overplayed. Its no more interesting than looking at American hamburger consumption habits by noting the SonicsMcDonalds split in Texas. It doesnt tell us a lot other than that there is one chain with a national dominance of the retail coffee market and another chain with a strong regional presence. Drawing anything like an accurate measure of Americas coffee drinking habits or its preferences regarding artisan coffee from this information is pretty weak sauce for an article.The abundance of Dunkins in the East coast says nothing about coffee preferences nationwide other than Dunkins had a strong presence before Starbucks was even founded. Its a popular place to get cheap coffee. Its hardly even a direct comparison to Starbucks any more than Chipotle is a competitor for Taco Bell. Same genre of food but much difference price points. The more common comparison would be convenience stores or gas stations which are also major coffee retailers working at a similar price point to Dunkins. Potential Dunkins customers arent going to Starbucks in the West and Midwest theyre just getting cheap coffee through a wider variety of local outlets. Starbucks on the other hand is basically aiming for the same middletoupper class consumer base everywhere it operates. Without actual sales data how much revenue is Dunkins getting from coffee vs. Starbucks we dont really have anything like an accurate picture of what this article thinks its describing.The articles weird digs at artisan coffee are hardly more credible than anything else it claims. It uses one small example Blue Bottle to note that higherend coffee is hardly a major trend outside of a few urban areas. But artisan coffee isnt run by national chains. Its a movement among hundreds of small local roasters across the country that collectively represent a growing aspect of the coffee market. Correct me if Im wrong but Ive never seen anyone legitimately claim that highend coffee is going to dominate the American coffee industry anytime soon which seems to be the point this article is awkwardly arguing against. But its certainly a lot larger a presence than  stores. Something this article seems to overlook is that for a lot of people not the people here on this sub generally Starbucks IS highend coffee. Its priced higher and brewed with better beans than what a vast swath of Americans drink on a daytoday basis. People sometimes forget what the American coffee market looked like before Starbucks told them what a cappuccino was and their current ubiquity hides the fact that theyre often the only way to get something better than gas station coffee out of a pump for a lot people. Its the second tier in retail coffee with the first tier represented by Dunkins and other places that sell cheap coffee as a side to other businesses and the third tier by gourmet local roasters. This article basically treats the first two tiers like their the same and laughs at the third tier and thinks this is somehow useful or revealing of some wider trend.,Coffee,crq4bcb,2,t5_2qhze

Sure coffee taste differs from method to method but if you just want good coffee at home cheap the biggest factor is going to be the beans. Depending on where youre from I honestly wouldnt go with a local roaster. Im from the NW and  of the roasters in my city crank out nothing better than Starbucks.Order a bag from a roaster such asRoselineHeartStumptownSlateth Parallel George HowelId start off with an African coffee either Ethiopian Kenyan or Rwandan. Theyre going to generally be the most fruity Ethiopian and its a great place to start because being how light and fruity they can be youll notice a stark contrast to what youve been drinking. As for brewing Id definitely recommend a hand grinder. The Haribo minislim is ok but not that consistent. Id recommend a Porlex but they can be more expensive. You can always bring it into a shop and they should grind it no problems if you dont want to spring for grinder right away. Do that before buying an electric grinder. An old burr grind is better than a fresh blade grind. Just tell them its for a pour over and theyll grind it the consistency you need.Find a brew recipe online usually the roasters website and go from there.Cheers,Coffee,crv3wlo,2,t5_2qhze

4324195,0,t3_3aimp8,Espresso is F water forced through a finely ground puck at a high pressure .bar. Other than the source of the required pressure steam vs pump you def want a pump theres a few design things to look for. Pressure valve most pumps make more pressure than you need. in order to get in the . bar zone you need some sort of bleed device. This is normally called an overpressure valve OPV. This is basically a spring that opens a valve above the pressure setting and closes below. Most prosumer devices have this setup with a vibratory pump. way solenoidbackpressure valve  when youre done pouring a shot theres high pressure watersteam in the piping from the boiler to the grouphead. This needs to be vented before you pull the portafiler off or you could be sprayedburned. The  way gets rid of this pressure in the piping. Some  machines have this some dont. Generally its a good thing not getting steam burns. used moddable equipment  espresso is not cheap to produce well repeatably. kijijicraigslist is a great place to get quality gear as a discount provided you can make repairs yourself. Theres a few great machines in your price range that are well documented and built like brick shithouses  years design life. If youre not in a hurry find a used one thats in god shape and fix it up if need be. Dont skimp on a grinder its arguably more  important than the machine itself. At minimum you need a burr grinder that can grind very finely and has a lot of adjustment in the espresso range if its stepped. The majority of the resistance during brewing comes from the coffee puck itself. a small change can have a large effect on extraction time and shot quality.good luck and happy brewing.,Coffee,csd2dfy,6,t5_2qhze

4488317,0,t3_3cjvkj,I live in the UK but the worst coffee was at a hotel in Arizona. It was an inroom set up with a kettle and some kind of coffee teabag. It tasted almost but not entirely unlike coffee. Nothing has come close to being that bad. It might have been a Folgers offbrand ripoff? OH Lordy  just remembered the second worst in a very large wellknown coffee chain Costa Coffee UK. Usually its reliable and slightly better than Starbucks. Asked for a decaf americano and got a weaktasting latte thing. Tasted gross. The laconic and grumpy barrista tried to convince me that you made a decaf by watering down regular coffee and adding more milk. Sure. Admit you ran out of decaf!

An insulated metal carafe as opposed to a glass one will prevent the coffee from picking up a burnt taste as it sits on the hotplate. Get goodish fresh coffee to use pretty much every city in the country has a handful of roasters. Grinding your coffee fresh is the next step. For some offices the added hassle and mess and investment isnt feasible. Thats totally fine  youre at work not a cafe.

It is composed of pentasaccharide repeat units comprising glucose mannose and glucuronic acid in the molar ratio .... It is produced by the fermentation of glucose sucrose or lactose. After a fermentation period the polysaccharide is precipitated from a growth medium with isopropyl alcohol dried and ground into a fine powder.

5152034,0,t3_3laq7r,Whether you can effectively use any bean for espresso depends quite a bit on your goals the gear you are using and your skill.  One of the big challenges of espresso is balancing acidity.  Espresso accentuates acidity.  With sufficient gear and skill it is easier to mitigate the higher acidity of lighter roasts.  This can facilitate more interesting shots as darker roasting tempers acidity but also degrades many flavors.  As a beginner or with entry level gear it will be easier to work with beans that dont have a naturally high level of acidity. Brazilian beans are a go to bean for blending because they are typically dry processed and are grown at lower altitudes both of which result in lower acidity.  You can add very small amount of higher acidity beans with more flavor to effect a blend.  The flavor contribution generally outpaces the contribution to acidity.  This is one reason espresso has historically been blended.  The trend towards single origin espresso is fairly recent and mainly facilitated by improvements to gear particularly grind quality.,Coffee,cv70h36,1,t5_2qhze

Its been refined to a series of steps that the only occasional forgetting of putting water in the bottom of the Moka Pot when one isnt quite awake yet.We grind our beans about every  days use a clear tall cup with markings for the watermilk amount and do the same routine all the time for always perfect results of strong concentrated coffee without bitterness and a nutty like taste.If we change the beansroastgrind yea sure there is a slight tweaking of the amount of coffee but all the other ingredient amounts remain constant. gtHow do you make great coffee at home especially in the morning?Moka Pot and put our milk in the top so its warmed up and self mixes with the fresh brewed coffee.gtAre there certain factors temperature ratios etc that you control?Yes most certainly. Amount of water amount of grounds brewing temptime etc are all factors although the MokaPot will take care of the latter one just takes care of the ingredients and time.gtThere is the SCAA Coffee Brewing Control Chart do you use that?Not entirely the amount of water to grinds is important however we dont agree with the excessive temperatures. We found that brew temp the temp of the water when it actually touches the grinds should remain just below  F as to avoid releasing the largest acid component of coffee.Many recommend scalding hot temps in excess of  F then poured right onto the grinds which drops the temp to about  F releasing the most acid. People then try to reduce the acid amount by adding more milk sugar and cream which distracts from the taste of the coffee.Unfortunately adding cold milk to  F coffee reduces the final result to about  F which isnt quite hot enough for a mug drinking so we learned to add the milk to the top of the MokaPot so it also gets warmed up and mixed with the fresh brew coffee and allowed to sit on the burner just a little longer so it reaches about  F or so then when poured it drops to about  F perfection.For the disinfection aspect we run our Moka Pot though the dishwasher every few days.gtWould love to hear your experiences!,Coffee,cvgqfd7,1,t5_2qhze

Im no connoisseur mind you.But its like beer I prefer a craft beer but a domestic shit beer is still something I enjoy if its all I have.

As the water is forced through against that resistance it dissolves out the coffee solids and carries them through to the cup.In a cheap espresso machine think the Krups Delonghis etc you do get a pressure basket portafilter which has a single sprung hole at the centro of the portafilter which lets the coffee come out at a certain pressure on the way creating a kind of false crema and carrying with it pretty mediocre coffee.  The advantage of the way those cheaper machines make coffee is that it is pretty easy to do and you dont have to worry about stuff like grind and tamp.

So they being diligent baristas they set out to see how the could get the best results out of a whirly blade grinder.Turns out the ONLY way to get semidecent grinds is to actually fill it quite full almost to the top so that theres very little room for beans to bounce around under the blades and get pulverized into fines or something. If I can find it Ill share it here. I cant remember how much shaking or tapping they advocated but they did find a useful method of using them and the take home message was just to cram it full.Edit Here you go. ,Coffee,cyz1lz7,2,t5_2qhze

I would assume the effect to be subtle based on the two authors research that led them to believe that calcium magnesium and bicarbonate affect the coffees flavor the most but its an interesting idea to ponder nonetheless! I digress! The test kits I purchased were Elos brand. They seemed to be reviewed as fairly accurate when browsing marine aquarium forums. I bought their Ca pH and KH kits. Of course as I learned these tests were meant to be testing much higher quantities of these chemicals in water than any coffee enthusiast would be working with. My recommendation would be to buy the Elos Ca test if any of them as it is excellent. Their Mg kit does not test for any amount less of Mg less than ppm so dont bother with it unless youve got the math skills to figure out how to scale testing ratios test results within the drinking water range  to ish ppm??. I certainly dont. The Elos pH kit only tests for a very small range . to . save your money and buy a pH test intended for nonaquarium use. The KH test seemed good though. I suspect one of the KHGH combo tests from another brand may prove more useful and cheaper!.

As far as negotiating none of the smaller roasters in town have negotiated with me. Last I went in they were wanting around  for green beans not even anything special like Yirg. Granted this is also the shop that sells most of their roasted coffee for around  per oz bag so maybe they are getting gouged as well.

To train new people when I used to work in cafes Id say  coffees eg. Small Flat white large soy cap and piccolo latte  sugar then have them do a random times table out loud eg  etc.. and then repeat the order back to me.Its useful because distractions will be constant and needing to recall an order can be crucial if you dont get a chance to write it down.Australians take this shit way too seriously hopefully youre somewhere more chill GOOD LUCK!!,Coffee,d1k6mw9,1,t5_2qhze

7150690,0,t1_d1qxy29,Right. Not an economist but the loss aversion makes sense to me. But so does leaving to another shop in order to gain a free cup and avoid such aversion. I understand what you are trying to do and in a way its very altruistic since the sustainability wouldnt benefit you in any way. If it were me Id create some sort of null benefit. Something that doesnt cost you but creates a benefit or exclusivity for the customer. For example if you could buy an organic sustainably harvested bean and offer these only to people who bring their own cups. Also any coffee made with these beans will bring a  cent discount. Then you might also have a shelf selling reusable cups  the purchase of which would also allow one free drink. This way youre creating something of value that incentivizes people to bring their own cup  but doesnt punish those who dont. Also it might be a good way to educate customers who are curious about the difference between the coffees or why the shop is pushing this different agenda. There are more places to promote sustainability than just the cup. ,Coffee,d1qymd5,2,t5_2qhze

7195366,0,t3_4e09wq,I wouldnt worry too much about water retention for a single cup especially at your ratio its pretty normal. I grind coarser since the filters on the v got thicker and I only lose about g of water at most.Focus more than anything on getting that time down to around   minutes is way way waaaaay too long. The thing is you have to find the sweet spot between hitting that  mark and not going too coarse otherwise you will underextract . A lot of people pulse pour pouring certain amounts in intervals but you can still get great results from pouring slowly and continuously in concentric circles and it will help you get that brew time down.I personally bloom for  seconds with gwater and ggrounds and then try and get another gwater in in a minute you should finish pouring with gwater at  and brew time should be  dead on like this if your coarseness is spot on.This is a extremely consistent method that will yield pretty good results however its a very good method for dialling in time and grind before you move on to a pulse pour method.,Coffee,d1w1yhr,3,t5_2qhze

Wed do the brewing class on Sat and the tasting class on Sun using the same methods you listed we also included a cleverdripper and coffee from an airpot as well. I taught the tasting class once and we went through the process of using a v and went over a little information regarding the sensory system such as the olfactory system the sensory experience of taste the chemical process of taste and smell working together looking at the coffee for oils and colors and talking about sensory memory Im a huge psych nerd so I threw some interesting info in. I also had a big taste wheel that listed various taste descriptors. Wed brew up about  different coffees then I basically just went through how to mindfully taste and experience coffee through looking at it smelling it tasting it experiencing the mouthfeel and describing after taste. They usually went around an hour and wed also give them a free espresso. Just make it fun and go off of their interests as well. When we did a tasting at one of our staff meetings we had to write down and list what we smell taste mouthfeel and aftertaste. Again this really teaches you to mindfully experience coffee. Also at one of our staff meetings we were challenged to see how well we knew our own coffees so the owners of the shop brewed up each of the coffees and we had to guess what each of them were.

However it seems like this part wears out faster than the charcoal part and might only be good for the first few weeks of use. I might have to do some water testing but if brita filters do remove hardness but wear out quckly maybe having one dedicated for the espresso machine and one for other general drinking is the answer. I Have a  pack of brita filters so being able to use them would be convenient.EDIT I was able to find  source that provided some quantatitive data on brita filters I tested the brita filter new and after  weeks or  liters use about half the recommended cartridgelife on mgl hardness  mgl alkalinity water.

8054119,0,t3_4pi91k,Ive used both in commercial settings and home settings. Ive found it to be sort of like a french press versus a pour over. The mason jarfilter method is a full immersion brewing method. Youll get a lot of deeper notes and a fuller body much like a french press. The Yama cold drip or Kyoto Towers give you a brighter and cleaner flavor much like that of a pour over. A big draw to the Kyoto Towers is the appearance. Theyre a beautiful display. Heres my current setup for my Kyoto Towers. Also you can make iced tea with them! But the price tag is a lot higher theyre really finicky and the dripper can stop dripping as the barometric pressure changes. Ive seen a lot of shops changing out the dripper for a solenoid to fix this issue but thats quite the cost for a home user. I should also say that you can buy the replacement glassdripperfilter pieces for the Yama cold drip and just skip on the wood frame for almost half the cost.Hope that helps! if theres any other questions you got feel free to ask.,Coffee,d4lcxov,1,t5_2qhze

In general french press is earthy and fullbodied aeropress tends to be pretty smooth and balanced depending on recipe and Chemex is the cleanest cup out of all of them due to the thick filter.,Coffee,d586u9n,1,t5_2qhze

If so be sure to check out the competition as Columbus actually has a pretty healthy specialtyfocused coffee community. Heres a good example of that  a whole site dedicated to showing off the coffee scene and having shops participate in strengthening the market together. If thats your kind of angle on coffee then it would be a good idea to connect with these shops make friends and get their support for opening up. In Columbus it seems more than likely that while its not a huge city theres still plenty of room for more thirdwave style shops in terms of competition and market saturation. Weve got a few customers in the area who seem to do pretty well so it feels like theres a decent appetite for great coffee in the city. Also I believe Mission is roasting these days so you might be able to get your coffee taken care of that way using their brand to help you get off the ground.Anomanders touched on equipment suggestions rather well as usual. Id recommend focusing on a batch brewer  group espresso machine  can be overkill for some but a lifesaver if one should go down at some point grinders for drip and espresso. With grinders you can often find used ones in decent shape that just need some deep cleaning and a fresh set of burrs. Bunn and Mazzer are common enough to find used in good condition and burrs and parts are easily available online.For other equipment youll need refrigeration and an ice machine would be pretty wise as well. Cold brew is a huge seller these days and its easy and cheap enough to prepare with a food grade bucket and a nut milk bag. We sometimes have to remind people to plan for their dishmop sinks and what that workflow will look like. Im not familiar with what the water is like in the area but it may be advisable to install water treatment to protect the machines from damage from scale and hopefully preserve your coffees flavor.

Really take a look at dietlifestyle choices living in such a manner that you need a caffeine kick to function is gonna run you down and doesnt seem like a recipe for longterm life happiness and satisfaction. Thats just my view on it.Anyway if you dont much like black coffee I advise trying the espresso drinks with milk. Latte flat white cappuccino. Of those I prefer a flat white since Im not in love with foam really. Heres one of those great charts thatll tell you what drinks have what ingredients. Start with milkheavy drinks and if you want work your way down to more coffeeespresso percentage. Youll figure out what you like.

Looks like parts are readily available for all the well known machines like La Marzocco and its easier than buying a complete grouphead then trying to build a frame etc. If you or your brother have experience of boiler design youve got a head start. Stick to NCB brass compression fits the standard compression fits are rated psi and youre going to be working at up to psi and make sure whoever welds up your boiler is good. Brass is standard offtheshelf ... I dont know how it stands with regard to food safety. OK  seems that brass is not recommended but copper is fine. Conex compression fittings are rated to bar psi between  and mm with fittings available to bar psi at C. So check the rating on these fittings build yourself a copper boiler hows your brazing? with copper pipes and fittings. The pump and motor looks to be readily available. If youre going to go to all this trouble you might as well add the steam ... theres lots of options too many to list but it looks like the wand valve springs and switch are going to run to  USD.Case ... well youre making your own ... make it something different.

9049605,0,t1_d7zlkby,Part of making a good cup is repeatabilityeliminating variation wherever possible. Youll want a burr grinder and a scale. Its tough especially with an inconsistent grind to correctly measure coffee by volume. Any idea on your general brew time? That might be a good indication of whats going on. Lets experiment with technique a bit! It sounds like youre pouring all of the water in at once after letting it bloom instead why not pour about a cup at a time let it drain for a bitnever letting it get completely dryand then add the next cup.  Rather than pouring in the center continue pouring in circles the entire time to ensure an even extraction. These are all super minor and Im honestly unsure if theyll make any difference. Still worth a shot!  Maybe try a finer grind if you can. Shake the blade grinder grind it for longerwhatever works!

There is a lot of competition and if you have not built any semblance of a brand it will be an uphill battle. All too often I hear that same question how much do I have to sell to quit my day job?  Its a tough question to answer seriously because everyones circumstances are different.  Rents vary utility rates vary what type of coffee youre going to be selling has a major impact on expenses  .... the list goes on and on. The profit margin is higher for brewed coffee sales rather than whole bean however a cafe requires a lot more infrastructure.  The successful coffee roasters will fall into two camps.  the roaster that also owns a cafe and....  the roaster that provides commercial coffee services to restaurants breakfast joints etc. Unless you have other passive income coming in selling beans online or at farmers markets will be a tough row to hoe. ,Coffee,d9v64y6,1,t5_2qhze

10023924,0,t3_5j6psp,In my opinion the better method is dependent on what kind of coffee youre brewing. When brewing immersion you generally have to grind a bit more coarse to prevent over extraction. When you grind coarse you change the extractable compounds in the coffee and generally the ones that dont extract as well are the brighterfloralnuanced elements. Immersion brews tend to be more on the sugarynuttysweet vibe without acid.Drip brews move faster and are filtered so they can withstand a bit of a finer grind which gets you a more balanced brighter cup. So really for more floral nuanced coffees I prefer drip things from Africa especially. ,Coffee,dbe58kz,1,t5_2qhze

Some says you can slightly slow this process if you put coffee into the freezer. Some says it doesnt work.On top of that coffee takes over odors from surrounding so if you must grind coffee for later use keep it in string bag.Last word You can expect some problems with pour over if your coffee is too fresh it was roasted less then week ago but waiting after grinding is not an answer.

10275591,0,t1_dc8c1jy,In my experience having managed a Stbx and having friends who manage McDo  the difference is mainly that McDo tends to have better more strict procedures in place to ensure the filter coffee is fresh. Outside of office rush hours the filter option is not as popular at Stbx as espressobased beverages so the staff will ignore their routine in brewing fresh coffee and let it sit. Protip  if you see the Bunn brewers blinking red on the bottom at Stbx that means they havent been removed from the heating elements and rinsed in a long time  stay away!  I find that if I brew Stbx beans properly mildmedium roast the cup will come out superior to a McDonalds cup.

10521474,0,t3_5qjyws,I have some homeroasted Panama Camiseta Estate from Happy Mug that i am liking quite a bit. I got a lot of it because it sounded like a bean you could play around with  a bit. after two roasts its not quite perfect but very nice with a delicate caramelly base and some green apple notes. im sure a pro roaster would do magic with this one but its still good enough for me! im also battling a cold so i am having a bit of trouble smelling the coffee while trying out my aeropress before i go on a work trip. i havent used the aeropress since this summer but i think im already close enough with it. this is actually the best small cup ive had in a while. i might have to switch up it for my afternoon cup because my chemex recipe for small cups doesnt always come out quite right. also both Yirg Gedebs from happy mug are awesome right now. i might roast one of those for my trip,Coffee,dd0q11s,1,t5_2qhze

Depends heavily on beans and conditions. There is no firm date after which they are bad. If you start roasting you can learn what the peak time is for each bean. I roast weekly so my beans are always in the  day old range the fresh beans offgas for a day or two while I finish the lasts weeks roast. Occasionally I go out of town and they sit for a week when I get back they taste different usually its the aroma that is the most impacted.,Coffee,dd142qc,2,t5_2qhze

10546702,0,t1_dd3kfm5,But there is a lot of pretentiousness in coffee beer literally everything but primarily trendy things that are pushed as a fine craft not that they arent. Every few years something new comes out that has the media hype of inventing cold fusion. Thats the definition of pretentious  having an inflated sense of importance. Whether its a deconstructed latte or some limited run annual beer that people fly across the country for that really isnt very special... or foams. Holy fuck foams.Its there. To deny that is just silly because its just part of how trendy things work. If I search for deconstructed latte theres a slew of articles telling me why I need to drop what Im doing to drive  hours to a cafe that makes one. Thats literally pretentious. Does that mean the product isnt worthwhile and interesting? No. But the way the media hypes literally EVERYTHING turns almost anything into an eye rolling exercise. To me people complaining about these pretentious trends are making a statement more about the media presentation than the product itself... except foams. Fuck foams.Anyway I like being able to play with my food and dishes that let you be a bit interactive. The deconstructed latte is fun but it has an inherent disservice of being called Deconstructed and being coffee which are already  buzz words that make people think of chefs and baristas with inflated senses of self importance. ,Coffee,dd3l4jp,7,t5_2qhze

I once went on a coffee tour and at the beginning the tour guide brought out a wood box of little glass vials. He then had each of us pick one out unscrew the cap take a whiff and try to identify the smell. I knew I had smelled the one I got before but I just couldnt put my finger on what it was until I looked at the label and was like Ahha! Thats what it was!He went on to say that almost all smells were compromised of the individual fragrances in that box and before he could begin cupping he needed to be able to identify what each glass bottle contained which just took a lot of practice.I think the same thing applies to these individual notes in coffees if they do exist. As my experience showed its easy to forget a tastesmell that you dont come into contact with regularly which it makes it difficult to pick up in a sip. At least thats what I tell myself. haha,Coffee,dd5gsen,10,t5_2qhze

10667897,0,t3_5smuyi,gt  As a coffee enthusiast what are the biggest coffee related problems you face?Im not as serious about coffee as many folks here but I do prefer a quality cup and pay attention to my brewing process such as the water temperature quality of grind etc.  The biggest issue I have seems to relate closely to your project and thats identifying what I consider to be the important qualities in a new bean namely when it was roasted and how lightdark the roast is.  Ive come to prefer medium roasts but it seems that many high end roasters dont mention the roast level of their beans so Im faced with potentially paying a premium for beans I may not like at all I find the citrusfruity notes in light roasts very offputting.gt  Do you have a favorite blend? If so what blend and why?Im not sure blend is the best word here since most beans from quality roasters tend to be more single origin.  That being said I seem to prefer beans from Peru Guatemala and Columbia but the freshness and darkness of the roast are still the more important factors for me.  As I said Im not as hardcore as many here and I doubt I would be able to identify all the subtleties of the different beans but from the beans Ive tried from the local roasters these are the varieties I like the most.gt  Are you averse to trying new blends?Im very open to trying different beans as long as I know the roast level.  If theres a useful description of the flavor profile e.g. low acidity full body notes of chocolate and molasses etc. thats even better but any roaster that uses anything approaching poetry to describe my coffee experience is instantly off my list.gt  Do you have the proper knowledge and resources available to you while searching for new blends and flavors?Theres generally plenty of information around about the general flavor profiles of the various regions around the world but the specifics of a particular farm and how the individual roaster roasts the beans is less available so I generally depend on trial and error.gt  What are your favorite brewing methods and why?I primarily use an AeroPress because its quick easy to use and clean and I like the quality of the coffee it produces.  It also uses a paper filter which some say reduces some of the coffee oils that can increase levels of bad cholesterol my wife knows more about this than I do.  Ive found that I prefer the extra smoothness that a paper filter provides.  Ill sometimes also do a pourover with a cheap plastic Melitta cone with  paper filters for similar reasons quick easy and generally good.  I grind all my beans immediately before brewing with a Lido ET hand grinder and I store my beans in an Airscape steel canister that seems to work well.  I buy enough beans to last about a week and generally make one cup before work and then another cup at work I have an AeroPress at both places.gt  Do you think you would benefit from a service that provides a variety of different blends and flavors as well as information cards that provide knowledge of these blends?Id be willing to consider a service that provided the information on roast level and date as well as flavor profilenotes in a meaningful and consistent way between different beans but not if it were significantly more expensive than what I can already get from the few local sources I already use and know I can depend on.,Coffee,ddgb9j5,1,t5_2qhze

Replace over pressure and antivac valvesOnce sealed up again amp warm Id check your head flow rates the shot programming and evenness between heads  if thats all ok it can go back together completely and be cleaned up.OR clean it now prove it works move it on for profit its not worth much parted out especially as a working machine.Edit for Formatting,Coffee,delq7nb,6,t5_2qhze

The AeroPress includes  filters in the box but at some point they will need one of these two   Aeropress filters  Able DISKFine reusable metal filter .I went AeroPress on this because it doesnt require a gooseneck kettle unlike pourover and because it uses a fine grind which is much easier to get consistency with a cheap grinder.  French Press uses a coarse grind and you would have to spend most of your budget just on the grinder to get a semiconsistent coarse grind.  The Porlex Mini will also fit inside the AeroPress and the whole setup makes a great compact travel package which fits your spacesaving criteria.Now you can actually forego the grinder if you have easy access to a local roaster with a professional grinder and can pick up freshly ground coffee every three or four days in small quantity.

11173883,0,t1_deybqx9,Im not trying to apologize for your boss but there probably is a method to the madness and it doesnt involve something the public cant see like roasting a coffee to hit a specific nuanced flavor profile. As you know there is a lot of labor involved like roasting and cupping to discover the optimal roast profile for a given coffee.  Since you have  coffees on the offering sheet that can take up a lot of time.  Add to this having to substitute one Brazil estate coffee for another and that compounds the problem. If you are supplying cafes and youve always roasted Brazil Estate A coffee to full city and then you have to substitute Brazil Estate B coffee the cafe will neither know nor care about the substitution as long as the coffee isnt dramatically different in flavor or roast color.  If you discover that Brazil Estate B coffee tastes better when roasted significantly darker or lighter then that causes problems because then you need to explain the difference in your product to the customer.  Most cafe owners simply dont have the time to listen to an explanation on why the coffee looks different or tastes better.  At that point your company or sales rep comes across as a high maintenance drama queen which no one has time for.  As far as the cafe owner is concerned they contracted you for a specific coffee at a specific price and when you change it youre in violation of the contract end of discussion. However if you have built a well known brand like Blue Bottle or Intelligentsia your cafe clients are going to be a different breed and will value your brand over the coffee and will gladly take anything you give them regardless of quality. Funny how it all works.  Ive learned so much more about coffee and business and the industry in general when I started working for commercial coffee accounts.  It can be both fascinating as well as depressing at times. ,Coffee,deyjpnd,4,t5_2qhze

11558403,0,t3_64z66k,Im going to point to the grinder. I went through the exact same experience as you with the exact same equipment. I know its a pain in the ass to upgrade yet again but there is a substantial improvement over the Encore from a higher end hand grinder e.g. the LIDO Helor  Made by Knock anything that floats around the  mark. The Encore is what I would consider the first entry into passable grinders but once you taste a good cup again at a coffee shop using their commercial grinder youll come back home wanting more from your coffee. Lastly try increasing your coffee dose. I was sticking to a  coffee to water ratio and kept over extracting in the Aeropress with any variety of finer grinds until I used the World Aeropress Championship recipe that calls for g of beans and g of water which would be a . ratio. That helped me hit the sweet spot. Good luck! ,Coffee,dg65drb,1,t5_2qhze

Thats been good for me although Ive been trying the Perger method of pouring toward the outside a bit to even out the grounds bed the last couple of days and it increased the draw time by  seconds so I need to play around with it to get it back down. Typically I do circular pours in the middle and do  pulses g for  sec bloom g for sec g until it draws about halfway down remainder of g water in the middle to g until it finishes and aim for . I do use a Kalita  a lot and have been using that more lately with a similar method but am still dialing in my grind for that.

The LIDO will grind better than the Baratza Encore wont it? From what I have heard the LIDO is as good as the Baratza Virtuoso or Baratza Vario. Is that true?I agree though in the long run I would be better off getting a LIDO. I probably will eventually but for now I want to keep price low. If I do get a LIDO I would not send anymore than that on a grinder. A Baratza Encore for a automatic and if I want any better grind I would use only the LIDO lol.,Coffee,dg9jsv2,1,t5_2qhze

11605993,0,t1_dgayv7g,Honestly youre just being pretentious about this with the whole no true scotsman argument. A low volume fine grind high ratio brew from an aeropress is a decent proxy for espresso. Remember espresso covers everything from the shitty  dollar  bar machine on amazon that people put grocery store coffee into all the way to the proper setups worth like  grand. In my experience an aeropress pulled shot is a lot closer to something similar to a not really dialed in entry level espresso in terms of flavor and a lungo in terms of body. Is it going to bamboozle a Q grader in a back to back compare with a slayer pulled espresso? No. But its  dollars worth of gear so thats not the appropriate comparison. Id much prefer an aeropress fake espresso than a real espresso from somewhere like starbucks. ,Coffee,dgbjryr,2,t5_2qhze

11711429,0,t3_6724bo,If you are making significantly more youre going to need to coarsen your grind to allow for fast water flow. However since youre grinding coarser you now need longer water contact time to get the same extraction. So this means that you will both be coarsening the grind and getting a longer brew time.
