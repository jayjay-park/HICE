2601643,0,t1_cmy5dzk,I saw your headset before and I dig it.  I want to do something similar soon but maybe with a full goggle.  Also makes me think this,coredump,cmy6839,3,t5_346ms
3356831,0,t3_2ym4jm,I liked how you broke down the runs into their requirements for play.We need a place to consolidate the things that are being built.  Some place to host the glossary and runs and any rules that are developed. Maybe the wiki or somewhere else you mentioned another sub?  We need to start compiling the info into categories and making lists so we can see what we have so far.  We have a ton of great ideas but no centralized place to review them.  The sysAds name for run mods? and the corePunks players will need to have a basic understanding of what they are doing and I know that in game discovery is a big part of it the info needs to be somewhere and searchable.  This is especially important for the dev team as we need to be on close to the same pages.  An outline of rules as they are developed or changed and glossary would be a great start so the framework can be defined. ,coredump,cpawj9l,1,t5_346ms
3381537,0,t1_cpdoecr,well it looks like youll be a great asset. The story starts with using the Coredump as sort of a mock ss network hopefully to help bring people up to speed with some older technologies and techniques. Im even hoping to create a database of useful old DOS programs that people can run in DOSBox like UUENCODE ZIP MASM etc ... The story eventually moves on to where the antagonists are a corporation of nottootechnicallysophisticated people who need to be taken down a peg or two ... I was hoping to use that as a vehicle for the gamification of learning about things like network security and meshnets.I think it would be trivial to get a meshnet going in my local area if there were any reason anyone would want to USE it. A game like this might be the nudge people need to start setting stuff up. I feel like we need more pirate radio and dead drops and meshnets ... we rely too much on what people are selling us and not enough on what we can do on our own. So I invented a game where even if for only one night a month it makes sense to experiment in those areas. It sounds like youve got the skills and experience to help make tutorials and show people how to set up the infrastructure for compelling runs. Well need that. ,coredump,cpdpyjq,2,t5_346ms
