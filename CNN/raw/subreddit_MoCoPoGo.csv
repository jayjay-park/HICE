8363869,0,t3_4u08zf,DratinisDragonairs are best found at the bridge. Joes crab shack and Copper Canyon If you are hunting dragons DONT wander.If you want to walk for egg hatching and pokestops your primary catches will be fairly strong Psyducks and Magikarp. Squirtles are the starter which is here most. They seem like they can appear literally anywhere.What to expect from an average HOUR of pokehunting at RIO  Magikarp  Psyduck  Slowbro a few other waters horsea tentacools  Dratinis  Dragonair  Squirtle  EVOLVED stuff Usually Water and Poison. the normal trash you see everywhereAlso Snorlax lives here. I cannot tell you where. I have seen him on the Radar at Rio  different times. I do not think he hangs out on or near the boardwalk but with the  footprint glitch it is hard to tell. I SUSPECT he lives near the traffic roundabouts as he seemed to get closer when I went near the road. Dozens of people saw him on tracker and no one knew where he was so I assume he was where people were not. Enjoy! Rio is the best consistent quality Pokemon I have found in MoCo so far. ,MoCoPoGo,d5n19yk,8,t5_3fei7

9140844,0,t1_d8ae4zm,Might just be because theyre arent as many spawns but it seems like its only tweeting every  mins or so. Is this normal? I just started using this yesterday and it seemed like much more tweets were made in a small amount of time. Also any advice on the best place for the rares you feature on the tracker Ive seen White Oak is usually in range of silver spring spawns. Thanks!,MoCoPoGo,d8ao1u5,1,t5_3fei7
