8666659,0,t3_4xtzt2,Monero has bounced down hard off this level twice now over the past two years most recently back in marchapril. This most recent rise has followed quick on its tail but has also been be paced and conservative. This is good. The market will hesitate here for who knows how long but I believe the fundamentals are far too strong and there is too much just over the horizon for a downtrend to happen again. When it breaks this resistance level it is going to break HARD. I know it gets said a lot in crypto but IMO this is likely the last time we will see these prices.Additionaly I suggest perusing the r monero subreddit traffic stats www.np.reddit.comrmoneroabouttraffic,xmrtrader,d6oy9z9,1,t5_3f5wu

10198504,0,t1_dbzz9s7,Quoting GoogleSee in which location your term was most popular during the specified time frame. Values are calculated on a scale from  to  where  is the location with the most popularity as a fraction of total searches in that location a value of  indicates a location which is half as popular and a value of  indicates a location where the term was less than  as popular as the peak.Note A higher value means a higher proportion of all queries not a higher absolute query count. So a tiny country where  of the queries are for bananas will get twice the score of a giant country where only  of the queries are for bananas.,xmrtrader,dc022fv,1,t5_3f5wu

Moreover Jaxx have already said the integration for XMR is complete and theyre just waiting for their next app update to make it public eta  weeks. Hence people will be purchasing now and much earlier in anticipation of the news.The same applies to Coinbase. The xmr community were aware Fluffypony was going to speak at Coinbase and at that time it probably caused a rise.That aside this is a small and hopeful prediction.

10933270,0,t3_5w34n5,My theory about the DASH growth out of nowhere is this. DASH and Coinbase have come to terms of agreements for integrating DASH into Coinbase. There are wealthy insiders buying DASH before the official announcment which normally is illegal insider trading but crypto is not regulated. DASH has already announced that they have joined with a new fiat funded exchange. But they have not announced with who. DASH will market this heavily as it simplifies the process of owning DASH.
