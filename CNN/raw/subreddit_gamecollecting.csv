Itd be something worthwhile to look into.My mom taught herself Spanish by surrounding herself with hispanic people and today shes completely fluent  so much so people have a hard time believe she isnt hispanic. So if you had a friend you could converse with in Japanese it could be a big help. Even just vacationing in Japan which I know is definitely not an option for many people due to the expenses and getting a chance to interact with people that speak Japanese on a regular basis even for just a short while can improve your Japanese speaking skills quite a bit.,gamecollecting,ceznmem,1,t5_2s8fe

I love the Genesis and I love Sega even more but the last thing Id want to do is expect the Genesis and Master System markets to rise. Theyre definitely buyers markets  I started collecting Genesis last summer and I was floored at the sheer number of quality titles that fail to cross the  threshold. Which makes it the perfect antidote to the insane SNES market.Still though very impressive collection and I wish the guy luck.

Funco stores potentially did disc resurfacing but they would have stopped that a decade ago when the merger was completed.The stores all follow the same corporate rules use the same computer system for sales and orders and stock the same stuff.  Some stores may not carry the same amount of things due to store size or sales preferences of the local client base but they are the same countrywide.  District Managers and to a lesser extent Store Managers may shape how one store or another handles some things like who carries blown out games in a district or who may try something first in a trial mode like dumping cases of systems that are on their way out like DS.  None of them act like separate entities.

440200,0,t1_cfqb2j0,Well said  I do most of my collecting from eBay as well and I am very careful at reviewing the pictures and details of games to ensure I get it in satisfactory condition. Thats another thing try to decidefigure out what your personal condition requirements are as soon as you can. For example Im picky about my carts and wont add any to my collection that have a torn label or any noticeable damage. I also need to know for sure that the front of my carts match the back so with my SNES games a  cart front needs to have a  back with its proper country code Mexico or USA etc.. Also if youre going to use eBay I recommend being patient. I usually spend months tracking games and wait for one in the condition I want at a lower than average price. To prevent yourself from getting antsy resulting in getting ripped off compile a big list of saved searches on eBay and search often  that way youll find games more regularly and most likely get a better deal.As mentioned by others Genny and SMS are good to go for right now  of all cart based games youre most likely to find CIBs there for a decent price.Clean the inside of your games properly when you get them. Keep an inventory. Rock on.,gamecollecting,cfqe3s0,2,t5_2s8fe

449606,0,t3_1z7pwk,These are absolutely hilarious.So theres a halfdozen or so GBA games that display a Game Boy Player logo on the screen for a few seconds. The Gamecube detects this and starts sending a special button combination to say it is a GBP to the GBA. This unlocks rumble functionality in a few titles.But now you have these GBA Video carts. Apparently they were gravely concerned that people would buy these carts and then watch the videos on their TVs. So these video carts display the GBP logo wait for the special response acknowledging its a GBP then they change the text to NOT COMPATIBLE WITH and deadlock the videos forever.Yeah because you know why buy a  DVD episode  p when you can pay  for a xx colorfps compressedworsethanRealVideo cartridge plus a  Gamecube plus a  Game Boy Player plus another  if you want a component display cable am I right?As a result for my GBA emulator I either need a special database flag to enable GBP mode on rumblecapable carts or a special flag to disable GBP mode on video carts.,gamecollecting,cfrd9i7,11,t5_2s8fe

456680,0,t1_cfs5fqa,This is Craigslist It is a site with classified ads similar to the want  for sale ads in most local newspapers.They have a specific section for video games under the for sale section and in it youll usually find a bunch of posts from regular people like you and I that are either selling something or looking to buy something. Sometimes a business will post an ad too  those can be the best way to find new locations to visit. Dont be alarmed by the large amount of stuff that is either junk or overpriced  Craigslist is known at least for our hobby for having people who think video games are worth much more than they really are.That brings me to a big one  If you arent sure of the value of something the quickest but roughest way to find a price is to go to Video Game Price Charting You can search by title or by system to find what you are looking for  the site gives you a rough average of what it has sold for using prices from eBay and Amazon.If you want to know a more accurate price of how it is selling youll need to do searches on eBays sold or completed listings. To do this go to eBay.com and search for the game in question  on the left hand side bar there will be a check box to tick for completed or sold items. This will tell you what it has sold for and give you much better information.I hope this helps and please dont hesitate to ask me any questions you have about reddit or our hobby in general.

However dont let that deter you from collecting them just know that the value for the ones that arent valuable anomalies is in the gameplay.  For me its NHL World Cup World Cup  games I played the shit out of as a kid stuff like NFL Street  NFL Blitz pretty much any version NBA Jam even the Wii version is killer not to mention the older ones MLB Power Pros holy crap is this game fun get it for PS or Wii Wayne Gretzky D Hockey basically the NFL Blitz of hockey in spite of NHL Hitz and the consensus GOATs like NFL K MVP Baseball  Tiger Woods  not to mention the other sports games like the Tony Hawks most people love .  There are plenty of great sports games to collect for the play value but just know what youre paying for.  If you have a local retro store in town chances are theyll be selling these types of games for less than the local thrift stores if they slap their standard  game price or whatever they charge will ask for them.,gamecollecting,cg8yi0a,3,t5_2s8fe

The Playstation and Gamecube games were  a piece and thrown onto the general media shelves at store  while the Gameboys were  each at the second and each came with at least  game the eReader the only separate item.  I asked if they had anymore and they said no but as I was leaving I saw the red DS phat in the case.   with Metroid Prime Pinball and a rumble pack.  The third store had all of the rest.  Somebody had just picked up the NES console when I walked in but the games ended up being separated from it and I snagged the better ones first.  I was kind of unhappy to see that the games on the top of the stack were generally overpriced  per ouch but for some reason halfway down they switched to  each.  I snagged a slightly overpriced Super Mario Bros.  from the first half and got River City Ransom for a steal at  plus the cashier offered me  for having bought several items.

Maybe have handicaps for top  such as no research for the next game limited preparation time... I dont know thats a tough one to solve.

791280,0,t1_cgty47z,I can walk you through what happens.  Ill let skcin speak for himself but in general this is what happens.You have . of SNES games and you either want or want to be able to claim that you have . Of course no one ever has  because there are certain carts of which only  or  exist and no one is ever going to have it all but according to certain definitions that game is canon and you have to have it to be done.  Depending on how much stock you put in others definitions that can be a strong motivator to obtain it.  That or youre just dead serious about collecting at almost any cost.  I think the former is probably the deal oftentimes though.  Just put yourself in this mindset  Youve completed s of trades and negotiations....  Youve sunk s of hours and dollars into your collection.  YEARS of your life.  This game is the only thing between you and completion.  This game..  ...and the only thing between you and this game is a few grand.  When youve invested so much in a set a few grand doesnt seem that crazy.Now for me...  I own speed racer.  I own mountain bike rally.  I dont need or want speed racermountain bike rally for what it costs.  If someone gave it to me sure Id go nuts and cherish it but when it comes to cash money I seriously would spend maybe  bucks on it.  Thats how motivated I am to throw money at that game for the sake of having it.Its all in mindset.  For some they want to be done and will drop virtually any amount of money to make even a small step in progress.  For me...  Ive reached a place where I dont want these ridiculouslypriced carts and dont care if people claim my collection is only  complete when Im done.  ...but I get spending that amount of money on one game.  When its the final capstone on your collection pyramid... ...you really wanna complete that pyramid.,gamecollecting,cgu80mp,5,t5_2s8fe

805637,0,t3_23cnvn,I disagree with the commonly espoused sentiment amongst collectors that we are currently experiencing a bubble in pricing.  As much as I would like the bubble to burst and pricing to come down I do not think it ever will and here are a few reason whyFact is the supply of games is finite.  Collectors have been snapping up the supply of older games so there are fewer games available in the marketplace  hence driving up the costs.  Only rarely do you see a collector part with their games and even worse they know the value of what they are selling.  The demand for quality games far outstrips the number of games found at garage sales or at thrift shops replenishing the supply in circulation.  Worse yet many more are being lost to the ravages of time and carelessness.  The supply is only ever going to go down.In addition the people who are into older games are typically people who played the games when younger.  As these individuals get older their purchasing power and disposable income tends to grow.  This coupled with rising scarcity drives prices up.The internet has made it fantastically easier for collectors to meet up with potential sellers.  However this is also a doubleedged sword as it has also made it drastically easy for sellers go quickly gauge what their item is worth.  In some cases this leads to a drastic overvaluation of the item being sold.I dont ever see prices coming down.  The drastic rise in the value of games may lessen but I do not see the bubble bursting with suddenly many collectors andor resellers dumping their lots for pennies on the dollar.This is one reason why Ive been trying to target some of the highervalued games to add to my collection.  The values are climbing at an insane rate and I just dont see it stopping.  Id rather pay  for a game now than  down the road a few years.,gamecollecting,cgvus73,7,t5_2s8fe

She sent me a bunch of pictures of all of these games in a CD case. I knew the Gamecube games right from the start were worth something somehow I knew Futurama goes for a bunch and I was surprised to see she had a lot of complete series like the Silent Hills Metal Gear Solids and Resident Evils. I am not a big horror fan and had no idea what Fatal Frame was but after checking it and was pleasantly surprised. Just because the majority of the games were loose I still wasnt incredibly interested but I offered her  because I knew at least the Gamecube games loose were worth that much. There was no counter or anything she just agreed and met up. I was kinda surprised because when I met her she knew Fatal Frame was a unique and pretty rare PS game that was worth a little bit and knew basically what everything was worth but she said she was done with gaming and didnt want to deal with any of it anymore so figured she would give someone who was still into gaming to work with it and do what they want with it.,gamecollecting,ci4gn5n,1,t5_2s8fe

1271533,0,t3_28nptr,Ask over in rcadeHere is my advice I own a  slot neogeo MVS and a Dual Monitor Playchoice . The neo geo should have a service menu its activated by a button usually found behind the coin door. Go through all the screens here itll help you check each speaker buttons color on the monitor etc.  Smell it! Odor can be difficult to remove from an arcade cabinet. It its stinky you may want to leave it in a garage for a while.  Buttons and Joystick are cheap and easy to replace  The monitor should be bright and clear. Arcade monitors can be costly and hard to find. Repairs are cheap but you have to know what youre doing. Open it up and look inside. The back should have a removable panel. Make sure its and MVS should have a very obvious cart coming out of the main board and that someone didnt convert it to a dedicated cabinet. Bring a screw driver and flashlight with you just in case he doesnt have one. Test the coin slot Check the lights. If the top marquee doesnt light up of the coin slot buttons dont light up youll probably need new bulbs. They are cheap so dont worry too much.  Look for any broken wiring. Inspect the wiring harness the best you can If you do buy it Id recommend blowing out the inside with an air compressor. Its amazing how much dust can be in these old cabinets. Also blow out the power supply itll have a ton of dust and can be a fire hazard.  Be careful poking around the monitor. CRTs can hold a nasty charge and if you accidentally discharge this on yourself its bad news. You would probably be knocked to the ground and dazed for a fewbest case but the worst case scenario is death rare but can happen.,gamecollecting,cicnxmm,6,t5_2s8fe

1364011,0,t1_cin8jp2,Theres a guide to printing out the covers on the coverproject forums so for a detailed explanation you can check that out.The short version is that you go to your local StaplesKinkosprinting business and have them print out the covers on legal .x paper. If you try to print on normal paper .x the cover will be a tiny bit too small. They have really nice printers and the result will be pristine. I have a paper trimmer that I use to cut the covers down to size but I think they can do it for you with a large cutter for an extra fee.Now its technically violating copyright laws to print out these covers and some employees will tell you that they cant make the copies for you. Ive had that happen once and I just left. But what you want to do is try to not get a manager or senior copy employee to print for you. They have their photos on the wall or on a placard on the counter. Dont get help from those people since theyre obligated to tell you no. The newer or lower rung employees dont seem to care or know its wrong and print them no problem. Ive done this multiple times. ,gamecollecting,cin9o1n,1,t5_2s8fe

He says hes got a system  controllers and  games. He wants  and leaves his number. I texted him right away and casually said send me some pics ill see if im interested I get a series of pics back containing all that. I agreed to make the deal at  no haggling just that I couldnt be there for  more hours work he agrees.When we meet up this afternoon he starts off by telling me its been up at his garage sale everytime for like  or  and noones even looked twice at the lot. He said someone came by after spoke in the morning and offered him  twice his asking rate when he asked the potential buyer why he said he clearly tried to BS him and told them they were already sold. But when we met he asked if I knew why. Guilty conscience and all I came clean and told him the scoop on the whole lot. The guy said well its all good man I appreciate the honesty and handed over the whole bag.

Maybe if they get a squad car roll up and have the cop ask about the games their attitude will change really quickly. Sometimes just the idea of legal action is enough.

But when the package arrived I discovered he had put it all in a box all of it. together. then put that box surrounded by newspaper in to another larger box. That was it. That was the protection. As a result nearly all of the cases were damaged. Some of the lucky ones merely had some cracks and a broken hinge or two but many of the cases were just straight up shattered.It was a pretty devastating way to receive a package that I had been so excited to receive. He refunded a good portion of my money and I got to keep everything so Im not too salty. Obviously he didnt intend for everything to get obliterated like that but still... how does that even happen? What goes through a persons mind to make them think that kind of packaging would work?Anyways I guess the point of this post is... I feels ya bro.,gamecollecting,cjizv2o,1,t5_2s8fe

1762912,0,t3_2enlo7,Youre not crazy for thinking it.  Having s and thousands of games really honestly does take up a lot of space.  If you honestly have no emotional attachment to them anymore I dont think it is wrong to let them go ESPECIALLY if you can sell them at a decent price to someone who you think might give them a good home.  Now obviously you may not be able to gauge who would resell your games and who would take them home to appreciate them but it would be great to think someone young could have them to appreciate them similar to how you may have once grew up on certain games.Another factor you need to think about AND WE ALL SHOULD THINK ABOUT is that these games are most likely not going to last for decades upon decades.  Me personally the memories of the games I own and want to preserve mean more to me then cashing them out even if they eventually turn out to be worthless and unplayable.It wouldnt hurt either to invest in something that would allow you to emulate the games without having to hoard several thousand games.,gamecollecting,ck1de19,2,t5_2s8fe

So I emailed them and asked for a picture or at the very least a list of what was in the lot. She promptly replied back with a photo and a list of the games. I felt it was a good deal so we tried to schedule a time to meet up. It took us three weeks to finally meet up but yesterday I picked it all up. Wish I would of had some of this for Retropalooza last weekend to trade but Im glad to finally have some good games for my Gamecube collection.

2298246,0,t1_clvpewq,Having the public create your database is an excellent way to get falsified data though.Even with multiple confirmations youll still get toxic data. For example say you require at least  confirmations of a single datapoint for it to be accepted into the site. All it takes is a single circlejerk on a single topic in any forum for that data to become infected. I can go to say Imagine Babyz page and have  people say Developer Jesus Publisher God Rating .What you could do to fight this though is add some user metrics into the mix. Add a points system and favor older accounts e.g. a  year old account counts as  entries and add a flagging system. If a previously inactive game becomes active then it automatically gets flagged for moderation approval. You can also reward users with points and favor those with more points e.g.  points user counts as  data entries wheras  points user counts as  data entry.Using both you can do stuff like this. Favor a year old account with  points the most Favor a year old account with  points lesser than above. Favor a year old account with  points lesser than above. Favor a year old account with  points lesser than above. Favor a week old account with  points lesser than above. Favor a day old account with  points lesser than above.You can even throw in an account flagging system for accounts that went dead and suddenly are active again.,gamecollecting,clvs242,2,t5_2s8fe

2471956,0,t3_2nv88c,For general cleaning you can wipe it down with a rag and rubbing alcohol be careful around logos such as on the NES cart lid. The alcohol can rub that off. For more thorough cleaning you can take it apart remove all the electronic and metal components then clean the plastic shell with soap and water I think some people might even use a dishwasher but Id turn off heated dry. Make sure all the crevices are completely dry before putting it back together. Id refrain from using a hair dryer excessively too as this can gently warp the plastic sometimes particular on the cart slots due to the pressure from the springs.Some scuff marks can come out from general cleaning if they were left by paint from whatever scraped up against them but if the plastic is actually scratched then your options are much more limited to my knowledge. You can use a Mr Clean Magic Eraser but I wouldnt recommend it in most scenarios. It acts like very very fine sand paper so using it lightly can potentially help. However it will dull glossy plastic and make textured plastic noticeable smoother in the area you used it on if you use it very much. It should definitely be a last resort rather than a first step in cleaning as Ive seen some people do.If your system is clean you can use Pledge furniture polish to give it a little extra shine. I just spray a little on a paper towel then rub it in on the system.,gamecollecting,cmh8dpq,4,t5_2s8fe

Collectors want limited edition complete collections of very in demand things. They want them cheap. Flippers want to make a living. Everyone collects their own way and people can be free to buysell their own way.

It was in the middle of nowhere so I thought there was a chance. Guy goes to check the back for me so I browse the gaming section to see if they have a Zelda DS OG or XL because I missed out on those too. I notice this gleaming box instead and purchase it for retail price .  tax. Funny thing is I had dismissed this bundle when it first released as a cheap gimmick like the Wii Play  Wiimote bundle. I was too busy for a new Zelda game at that time anyway. Since buying the Luigi Wiimote this summer Ive been kicking myself that I let this Zelda Wiimote pass me by.

Theres a lot of buried gold waiting to be discovered in the piles of shovelware and with some games like Sonic and the Secret of the Rings the true quality doesnt come through until you dump them into Dolphin and replace the waggle with real controls.Glad to see you have Speed Racer. Thats one of the best kept racing secrets of the generation and IMO roughly the generations equivalent to Burning Road and Explosive Racing.

3229406,0,t1_cownpgs,From ebaygt If youre returning an item because it isnt as described in the listing the seller is responsible for return shipping charges regardless of the sellers return policy.  If the item is fake go to the item order details and go through the returns process and select counterfeit. I like to mention it in advance for fake games as chances are the sellers will just say keep it. Its not actually worth them paying for the postage back.I typically dont have problems once referring them to that page.Get the cheapest tracked or signed postage you can but make sure its at least signed for. Make sure you keep the receipt.If they dont pay the postage or the return then dont close the call and get an agent involved.Waste no time once you get the item and keep an eye on the ticket end date. I have had sellers say things like we can sort it out between us outside of the mediation or not responding in the last few days in the hope that I disappear they are trying to get you to close the ticket or let it expire so they can then just ignore you.,gamecollecting,cowqeaa,1,t5_2s8fe

I had a similar scenario took place I had a few sealed PS games I took in I still have them Shadow of the Colossus Ico God of War God of War  and Metal Gear Solid  again all sealed.  I took them in to get a quote and the guy said something very similar... these are old games that nobody wants... it makes no difference if they are sealed or not like seriously dude? and these are games that really arent worth my time.  Best I can offer you is probably  dollars a piece.  They probably have certain scumbag phrases they naively use on unsuspecting customers because that would be the best way to make the most profit.  But they also dont realize that by doing stuff like that they have officially lost a customer in me by talking to me like that.  I just responded back You know what I will just hold onto them for a few years and sell them when there is a much higher interest in them.

4013407,0,t3_36g7l9,You need a lot of money and a lot of patience. Like all businesses the first  years are the worst and a lot of them dont make it. A game store is like running a business in hard mode. The reason being is that for retro titles its all random. You cant call up Nintendo and say can you ship me  more titles of Super Smash for the ? It doesnt work that way.   The game store I worked at was started with the owners own personal collection. It eventually developed into a stable business where he gets interesting trades even with the internet still around. He gets really cool things from the thrift storesyard salesetc as well but the majority of his inventory is from trades.   Ive also seen a lot of gamestores go under really quick. The main reason is because they have a lackluster inventory and they price their good stuff too low. A lot of people here like to complain that brick and mortar stores suck for charging as much as eBay or more but the harsh reality is that if you want to have a storefront pay a couple people to be there and get paid yourself you need to stay competitive and make a profit on almost everything you get. If that means buying Earthbounds for  and selling them for  so be it.   I would suggest doing what other game stores do host LAN parties for a fee sell new merchandise that you can order wholesale nintendo themed drinks trinkets etc. Also be competitive in your trade in values. The one thing my boss did was he paid handsomely for rarepopular games. Granted it wasnt a lot but he did make it worth the persons while. It was worth it to him to be known as the store that had everything then to be the high priced boutique game store that only had Madden . ,gamecollecting,crdrcj0,3,t5_2s8fe

That said Ive always felt sore that SMRPG was in the works but was cancelled iirc maybe it was just in concept and instead of that we get a kiddy version of an rpg backtracking from complexity of SMRPG with graphics that feel like a copout to me. I swear they did it because of the low storage on an N cart and it ended up pleasing people so they stuck with it. I do enjoy the ML games though as they feel more like SMRPG to me.

However in practice Daikatana is a  year old title and a notably unsuccessful one. It doesnt register much on peoples radars these days even to the current IP owners. Romero himself even released an earlier prototype of his own volition to the public with no ill effect. He definitely did not receive full permission from the rights holders involved but its such a small and harmless matter that a blind eye is turned if they ever were aware of it. A recent higher profile case of a similar event occurring was someone releasing a HalfLife alpha disc right here on Reddit. This made major headlines on gaming news websites and Valve did not act upon it.Nonetheless if you feel any doubt at all you are well within your right to leave well enough be.,gamecollecting,csnfjnr,1,t5_2s8fe

So I went to another local game store looking for a gamebit to take apart an SNES cartridge as part of a pending trade with uepicfamilydecals sorry still no luck   While Im looking through their stock this guy and his girl walk in wa trash bag full of something.As they walk up to the counter they notice a sign stating No more tradeins for the dayI hear the guy mutter under his breath See I knew I should have gone to the pawn shop.So him and his girlfriend ask the guy behind the counter if the sign is right  at this point Im like right next to them and I can see the imprint of SNES games in the bag  the guy behind the counter asks the other girl working and she confirms. Yeah were out of cash after taking a bunch of tradeins earlier and taking more tradeins at a recent gamecon. We can take store credit though. The guy wthe bag declines store credit asks one more time and again the salesperson declines I need to emphasize this the salesperson never even asked to look in the bag.At this point I figure Im in the clear I dont want to be a dick and steal their trade but if theyre gonna decline it twice I cant let him just walk away wo asking.So I wait for him to leave follow him out and ask him if he minds if I look. First game I see is a Red Cartridge...and its Doom. Okay a decent start. Next game I see is..Fuck...no way...its Demons Crest! I ask the guy what how much hes looking for. He says hes basically looking for anything. I offer him  he agrees and we have a deal!We shook hands and parted ways. The carts have some crud on them but all of the  games have nice labels.

4853085,0,t1_cu5d95o,I think the reality of it all was that people really got into reselling items second hand during and after the Great Recession especially here in the US to make a little extra money.  Look at all the shows on tv that became popular at that time Pawn Stars Hardcore Pawn and all the Auction reselling shows.  I switched over to playing and collecting old games right around  because I could not afford  dollar brand new games and I came to realize that games at second hand stores were literally  cents a piece.  Once people started buying up items to resell is when it started to get rough and its been rough since about .  I saw it transition big time for yard sales too.   I just found tons and tons of video games.  Now its no secret that games resell very well and they are fairly easy to ship if you sell them online through Ebay.  Watch some youtube shows of people who flip items for profit and you will see and hear their main goal is not to collect and enjoy but to buy low and sell high anything they can make profit off of.  And it just so happens video games are a very high top priority for them as well.

A community shares the bad times and the good times. They dont constantly share the good times because there is no such thing in life as always good days.

If the seller just wants the stuff gone it would win you the sale.

My view is despite them being a pain at times they still play a role in the overall movement of games in the market. I think its safe to say that the majority of retro game consumers are either trying to play a game from childhood or looking to collect on a low scale with no intention of going to greater lengths to get more games i.e. craigslist garage sales etc.. So for them resellers are great because they keep the supply up and keep prices down. Also the majority of the games I sell either go to very rural areas or to cities with a higher cost of living. The gamers in those areas usually would not come across games on the regularat a reasonable price ever been to a game store in NYC? Complete waste of time and ebay is usually their best bet. Perhaps things have changed recently but I dont think the majority of people playing retro games really collect as we do. Maybe Im wrong here I dunno.,gamecollecting,cweigyu,1,t5_2s8fe

Seconded by N boxes that i gingerly wrapped in bubble wrapped.Games are easiest just make sure you dont put to many in a box or the weight is ridiculous. So basically lots of bubble wrap and since i worked a job at retail i grabbed some of the double walled boxes for them which worked out well.

Because the former is a dime a dozen these days. What would you offer that others cantdont. If the latter ... damn thats a deep rabbit hole. But its one I think could have a lot of value for people.As an example take Working Designs. Its easy to find a list of their published games Wikipedia. Its a bit harder to find all their disc art variants. Ive yet to find a consolidated source of all their variants. When you do find them on ancient webpages in the Wayback Machine you then start encountering misinformation. A lot of people think the Hikaru variant of Magic Knight Rayearth is the rarest. It isnt. The variants were made in more or less equal amounts. But the Hikaru art is more desirable so it fetches a slightly higher price leading people to think its rare even though its no harder to find than the Fuu artwork.But disc art variants are the easy part. After that you have the esoterica. Ive never seen all variants of the Arc the Lad pocket?watch preorder bonus. Im not sure which games of theirs hadcame with promotional pins Ive got Dragon Force Iron Storm and RayCrisis but I know Lunar exists. Which of their games had maps? Just how many different Arc the Lad mousepads are out there? The list goes on and on.And thats just one company with around  games. Ganted Working Designs is an extreme example but they arent the only publisher like that.I think its too much work for one person.

7528800,0,t1_d2xhvyd,I trade most of the games I will never play again back to gamestop or the bad ones. For instance I got  back during a deal they had for getting rid of SSF since it was an unfinished pos. I did not have to deal with a shitty craigslist ass hat for only  more. The other thing is the trade credit is not taxable so in my area that is getting a new game with trade credit for a bit cheaper as well. I like the convenience and as long as you are not trying to sell back a game that would net you way more other places or just a shitty sports title that no one wants after the first few weeks it is not a bad place to go. Also they give way more than any of the other used game stores in my area. I mean I know a shop that would give you  for the a model  Genesis and try and sell it for . The other plus is that I have one across the street  min walk from the place I work. I just dont get the hate yeah they do not give you as much as if you were to sell it privately but you also do not have to wait on shitty meet ups in public and the fear of getting robbed for like  more and you do not waste your time my time is worth more than the loss in money. They are a business and giving you exact what you can sell it for is stupid. Also think that they gamble on buying your game maybe that shitty ass copy of cod butt storm  special dog humper edition might not sell bec  just came out for instance. They still do things I hate like taking discs out of rare games and putting them in shitty paper disc sleeves if it is the only copy or pre orders though I usually do pre order so I am part of the prob or the shitty magazine. In the end they are not that bad compared to many other options. Also Amazon has a hard time getting me games on day one since ontrac is the only carrier they use in my area for day one games. Ontrac will sometimes choose to wait until the nd or rd day as they are under staffed in my area and the support just sucks. Also I am aware ebay exists but again my time is worth more.  ,gamecollecting,d2xzkln,5,t5_2s8fe

Not sure what the general consensus is on the N but in my opinion there are only about  games worth playing.  Getting those  will only run you  on eBay.If your goal is to collect all of the things like it is mine and a lot of folks on this thread creativity is your friend.  I maintain reaching out to friends family work colleagues etc. to see if they are willing to givesell you their old games is THE best way to advance your collection for under FMV.Thrifting is obsolete.  Sellers generally know the value of what they are selling it is their business to know.  You may occasionally find something but it hasnt been worth my time for a couple years now.If you are in a densely populated area but not a city garage sales can still be fruitful.

Super Potato had an amazing selection but everything is priced for tourist which makes it tough to want to buy anything.I ended off my trip at a HardOff in the outskirts of Tokyo Hanakoganei and let me tell you I was definitely glad I brought an empty suitcase with me because it was full to the brim on my way home. The selection there was patchy but there was an amazing volume of gamessystems and the prices were great. I spent about  CND at that HardOff and came back with  consoles  controllers and  games. There were other purchases along the way but this is where I got the most stuff.I wish I could go back but even if I could justify paying the price to go again I doubt I could find someone who want to shell out the money to come with me.,gamecollecting,d3t4ql6,4,t5_2s8fe

8944205,0,t1_d7mxdlv,The Japanese ones with a box that looks like OPs are not knockoffs. I have three of them and I paid between  for all three new in box. Unlike the one OP shows in the picture none of the three I bought came shrinkwrapped oddly enough but the controller had sticky protective plastic over it and blue plastic and a twist tie over the wire in a very Nintendotrademark sort of way. I personally wouldnt be afraid of ordering a Japanese one. Just ensure that the one youre ordering says Nintendo Super Famicom on it and you can be reasonably sure its legit. Bootleggers usually leave out the logos.As far as making your own goes the circuit board in the Wii version is the only major difference between the two hence why you can swap it into an American controller shell for purple Freedom Buttons but it makes it impossible to make your own  the standard Classic Controller uses a completely different circuit board that would never fit. Simply replacing the wire wouldnt make it work because itd still be speaking SNES when the real board is speaking Wii Classic Controller.The only way youd be able to make one yourself would be with a microcontroller between the SNES controllers board and the Wii Remote translating all the button presses from SNES to Wii. Building one yourself and especially installing it inside the controllers shell would be very impractical but this exists ,gamecollecting,d7mymr7,1,t5_2s8fe

Last time I checked printer manufacturers test their ink cartridges against some ASTM standard for how many pages the cartridge can print.  So with some research you can get a cost per page estimate.If anything Id recommend going for a printer that has a black cartridge and several individual color cartridges.  Some printers just have a black and then a color cartridge.  If you end up using all the yellow you have to replace the entire color cartridge.  Mine has black magenta cyan and yellow.Only other recommendation is to use ink from the manufacturer and not generic ink.  Ive had problems using generic ink on my Kodak and on my Epson as both inks would smear.Currently Im using a Brother printer which seems to work well enough.

This time the games are the critically acclaimed Firewatch for PS and Oddworld Strangers Wrath HD for the PS Vita.Considering how fast our last Oddworld series release on Vita went I would not recommend waiting to pick this up that previous release is now going for three to four times our original price.Both games will be available at www.limitedrungames.com.As with all of our releases these are  official releases manufactured by Sony. Theyre as much a part of the official PlayStation  and Vita collections as any other games! I dont know how many times we got questions like how come Sony doesnt sue you while we were at PSX. Our releases arent homebrew or repros! Theyre certified by Sony and manufactured in the same facility as all PlayStation games.Sorry for the tangent there!

10098152,0,t3_5kfurp,No!Their rating system doesnt make any sense. Bad sellers get good ratings no matter what. Heres why...They punish buyers for leaving poor feedback but sellers get a point for mailing an item. So making a poor sale nets the seller a positive rating! This is a very important point.Doesnt matter if its the right item is in the condition they said. If the buyer gets an item thats not in the condition described and they leave anything but positive feedback THE BUYER GETS PUNISHED. so there is no reason a buyer would ever leave anything but positive feedback or no feedback at all. As a buyer I was forced to keep quiet when I got ripped off. This creates a system where sellers can list things in any condition they want and they wont ever get negative feedback.  is actually terrible there. Instead of trusting what vgpc says their rating is Id look at their sales and if a suspicious amount didnt provide feedback Id steer clear! Ebay and Amazon have much better ways of determining how good a seller is.,gamecollecting,dbnsxv9,6,t5_2s8fe

Its also possible that Limp Bizkit was not the only one to sign Dreamcasts for concert goers to win for trying out games or as a contest prize. Limp Bizkit was the headliner and was obviously so popular at the time and they got the most promotional exposure The other people on that tour Filter Mobb Deep Method Man and Redman the Crystal Method Primus Staind DMX.

If there is any residue left on the box try taking the sticker you just removed and dabbing the residue with the sticky side.  Its a simple trick I have used many times.  Often that last bit of residue will just stick to the sticker and come up pretty easy.  On a paper box I would be wary of using goo gone as it is oil based and very likely will stain the box if you dont get it off quickly.  ,gamecollecting,dcufe7j,1,t5_2s8fe

The second generation is incredibly inexpensive to collect for mainly because most of the games came out on all three consoles. I think theres a handful of exceptions Diner the sequel to Burger Time is an intellivision exclusive  The only real drawback to the intellivision is the overlays required to play the games. They are rarely found with loose games however there are cover project type sites that have the scans of them so you can print them off and play. ,gamecollecting,ddkr46b,1,t5_2s8fe

10959754,0,t1_dea7bpr,Nintendont isnt an emulator. The Wii U is basically like two Wiis put together so when you run on Nintendont it is just like running a gamecube game on a Wii. Nintendont on the Wii U is the same program as the one on the Wii and it works because of the Wii Us Wii compatibility mode.The problem with using the Wii or Wii U is lack of ability to use the Gameboy player. That is when the GCVideo comes in. However there isnt yet a mass produced GCVideo.

Went to the Switch section and it was basically all empty for what I was looking for. So I went to the cashier in front and asked if they had any other Switch accessories perhaps in the back when he directed me to the customer servicepick up desk and to ask there. I arrive at the customer service desk and ask if they had any Amiibos or screen protectors when the lady showed me some extra joy cons and Amiibos no Guardian unfortunately.
