6197100,0,t3_3wq6xa,I would like to say thank you to everyone who has participated so far.  I am sending an update that I will be ending the survey on February st so if you have not participated yet and would still like to do please do so.  There havent been as many participants as expected so that chances are still pretty good of getting a gift card especially if you do both the initial and the one month follow up.  Also after review the data so far it looks like the average time is  minutes.  Also if the survey gives you a  minute wait period and doesnt continue just click the button anyway that hasnt been working correctly for some users and there doesnt appear to be any clear pattern as to why.    ,GamePhysics,cyu1lk9,1,t5_2viau
