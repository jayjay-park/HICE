If you push something it moves for every action there is a reaction. Just realize that you are part of something bigger and its not all about you. I hope Im conveying this correctly!,Sober,d44ldie,3,t5_2s8rw
9205217,0,t3_568ya1,I know exactly how you feel! Ive been sober today! SOBER OCTOBER!!!And plan on keeping it up. I know it seems impossible to have fun when your young. My best advice is to stay away from it awhile. You CAN have a good time not high or drunk or whatever. If your looking in here chances are you know deep down you have a problem. Keep it up and youll be that cool friend that doesnt partake. Chances are youll need to meet new people but thats fun too! You can do it!,Sober,d8itw6t,1,t5_2s8rw
