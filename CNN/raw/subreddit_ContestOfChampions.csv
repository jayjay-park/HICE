3394459,0,t1_cpf694f,It will as confirmed by the devs have a very big role in the future of the alliance feature namely the base piece and include a new awarding feature based on alliance rating.Aside from that Just like anything else people wanna be the best. Having a higher alliance rating is more prestigious in the eyes of some. Also the higher the players rating the more active they are. Granted someone with a lower rating can be just as active but someone with a higher rating is making it obvious theyre active and thus you can rely on that more. I see a lot of people on here complaining about alliances having requirements and Im not even a gamer myself but I can totally understand the desire to have the highest possible team rating.

3529758,0,t1_cpuk0n6,well kinda sorta. First off  champs give a certain multiplier in base arena points. For instance each fight will get you anywhere from    points which means if you win all  fights you get like    points. However  champions have an even higher base arena point value. I think its x the  So its something like    points per fight. This makes it add up MUCH faster than having only s. If groups are still going on and you are relatively new the cutoff at least for Dr. Strange not sure anymore was like top  people get  champion. But since there were a lot of new people in that group their point expectation is much lower which was something around K   million. However there is a group of people who have been playing since around DecemberJanuary. That group has had pretty much the same cutoff as before groups started which was typically at least . million for top  places to get the  champion. To get to that point if you dont have enough strong champions or s to get those nice points you will need to use units to recharge. From what I have heard there is someone in my alliance that consistently gets placed in the  arena and he says that he uses around  units per arena. To be honest you gain quite a bit of units from just playing the arenas and getting milestones and opening up the arena crystal. Then you can put in another  or so to get the rest of the units you need to do that. So  over a span of  days is a lot more cost effective than spending the  for  units for a  crystal. Its an investment in time too though if you really go hard on that you wont be putting the phone down.

Ultron Marvels Visions HulkAbomFixit Black Bolt Dont pair him against them. Even if it means you cant get class advantages from your champs. They dont really matter. Stack up your fatigue and land poison from his second special. Wait  seconds the match will end. If it doesnt repeat .Antman is fine against willpower people just need to play better with him. If you find yourself paired against a team that has three poison immune characters you may have trouble but even then you can still win. Just make sure to use the second special to clear the poison if it stacks up and rely on heavier hits so you arent hitting as frequently.For those that arent aware the poison he lands does have a heal reduction built into it aside from the damage it does. With just  stacks it completely negates the healing from willpower and melts them away as well. You should be able to chain it onto them after you land it once at it lasts a very long time. ,ContestOfChampions,cw44jqg,2,t5_333zp

5718725,0,t3_3tgnj1,Basically everyone can get to fight  obviously you use your low level champs to start.Fights  you sandbag which is using two strong champs and one weak. Youre essentially throwing one of the three matches to get a better chance at winning the other two. Fights  you want to try and stay below k total PI.Fights  amp  you want to stay as close to  total PI but with champs you can win with. Dr. Strange with his low PI is ideal. Fight  is the hardest and most crucial. So if after seeing your opponents if you feel like the champs you chose for fight  are too weak use a boost.After that fights  you need to stay above .k and after fight  stay above k. Somewhere between fights  it drops one more time to .k but Im not sure when and I just continue to stay above k for the duration of the arena.,ContestOfChampions,cx5ypos,3,t5_333zp

5833093,0,t3_3v4dki,I follow a very simple method. A  hit combo i.e. a MLLL can generate enough power for him to use his level ....Thats it lol.Just keep up the  hit combo till he dies or timeout. He will keep attacking or using his specials. The other things you have to take care of are that if he isnt using his specials you have to hold your ground literally not the mastery and wait for him to charge you. As soon as hes about to hit you just dodge back. Repeat twice and he will use his special guaranteed. Other than that if hes being defensive be defensive as well. No need to poke the bear while he sleeps. Keep doing this and youll take  timeout but eventually youll kill him in the next round. The most important thing is that you have to be patient. There is absolutely no need to rush that fight. You have to be patient you have to wait for your openings and you have to evade every time he charges or parry if it suits your fancy but if you parry him he is less likely to use his specials,ContestOfChampions,cxk8ucz,9,t5_333zp

Ultron can trigger Willpower too with his tiny bleeds but at least you can cauterize them. Antman needs a way to do this as well. It would also make a lot of sense to convert the Fatigue to stun when you hit your L or L kind of like Cap. ,ContestOfChampions,cyq5l4h,4,t5_333zp

My example was more of a discussion down the rabbit hole if you will to give a potential reason why some people may believe that opening more at a time increases your odds.Multiple dupes of the same character would be entirely possible when you consider the number of champs and the quantity of them that would need to be available at any given time for everyone playing the game. So in that hat with pieces of paper with numbers  say there are  s  s etc. That obviously skews the odds if the number available of each champ is there but I figured the simpler  example would be a little easier for people to wrap their head around.,ContestOfChampions,cze3msm,1,t5_333zp
6381380,0,t3_431um1,I disagree. He is a beast. Unfortunately most of weak champions  considered as weak because of their attack and being slow in killing. However its not true. Magneto has very unique skills. He inflicts bleed with heal block he can survive from an L attack of venom with  k attack etc.. Its pain in the ass to kill a nonbleeding champion with magneto yes but his abilities and perfect block makes him a great champion. He is my  mutant champion by far. Another example is the vision. He is a bad champion as a killer but he has a full power burn skill and he has double immunity. I can take down any opponent with him. Slowly and securely.,ContestOfChampions,czezt8k,1,t5_333zp

6532730,0,t3_453jk6,IMHO AQ is more difficult than AQ because of the lanes being more difficult. Each player has to be able to take down the lane and bring decent heroes for the job.Example Electro on a  health node takes down most heroes without needing to hit them once. But with BW he becomes manageable. I have a duped Colossus so I get the left lanes bleed. I fight  Black Widows each run and then Spiderman. Even with zero hits I take lots of damage if I missjudge parries and block instead. or miss an evade coz miss BW tends to ignore parryTheres also lots of heal block  this being the biggest obstacle. I had to respec to the parry build and gave up DE and Coagulate in order to finish my lanes.So  Unstoppable Colossus is easier than Juggernaut. Easier to bait easier to parry. But AQ overall is more difficult if you ask me.,ContestOfChampions,czv1bhm,4,t5_333zp

Ive never done the alpha cause my alliance gets them like candy but I do the T basic every time and it costs k gold per match. Jut get the k battle chips ahead of time and save up around k gold it shouldnt cost you k gold but if you cant do the infinite steak it might cost up around there. As an example I can currently get the .mill milestone in the T Basic arena in  matches with out doing refreshes.A good place to test your ability to perform in a catalyst arena is during the Crystal Cornucopia on Sunday since it is the same type of arena style where all champs are available. See how long it takes you and how difficult it is to get to k or atleast get to a rhythm and pace that you think you could do it once you get that down just use those teams in the Alpha arena.,ContestOfChampions,d05e9ba,1,t5_333zp

From there I started attacking him. Degen is unaffected by willpower damn it I got hit a few times he can cause armor break which is good for those with willpower. Once I figured Id done enough damage I unleashed my L. Well it wasnt enough unfortunately. So I kept hitting him until I died. He had about  left so I subbed in my   Iron Fist also unduped.

When I have recruits asking to join I have to cull on the basis of the champs on their profile before even considering whether they are skilled enough. Do they have the right  champs ranked to rank  and some rank s? No well moving on.Its now at the point where starting prestige must clear  to ensure a Gifted promotion from  map  clears. That is not possible with only rank s.Skill is not enough and I dont care how good you say you are at the UC boss. Hawkeye as your profile picture with no rank s means youre a liability.

7465524,0,t1_d2qq18e,So essentially a shell alliance is an alliance that is in the opposite tier that your in during the same week. For example lets say my alliance is in the gifted tier which right now this week needs about  starting prestige and needs to score  million points to get the ranked rewards the elusive class cat crystal and your alliance is in the tier above super human which unless you have a ton of s in your group you cant score high enough to get a class cat from ranked rewards so your alliance would get a basic T and go back down to the gifted tier. Still with me? Now lets say you have  really good players in your alliance and I have  really good players every week my  players and your  players would join whichever alliance was in the gifted tier and kick ass in AQ and get class cats. Some alliances work in a rotation so its not the same players every week getting class cats. But its a win win for both groups because it allows the lower players within the group to get a basic t every week and continue to rank and grow their champs along with allowing the higher players to get their class cats. This system prevents lower prestige players from holding back the higher prestige players. With the way the scoring system Kabam has in place now its really the only way you can get class cats every week. Like I said earlier Kabam has made the champs you have more important than how well you use them. I hate to burst bubbles but at this stage in the game the sad reality is if your in an alliance that doesnt have any rank  champs you wont ever get the ranked rewards from the gifted tier. The starting prestige has climbed so high that you have to have rank s in order to score high enough. Thats why the shell alliance has become a method for those players who dont have rank s to still get class cats.  players without rank s mesh into an alliance of  players that do which will compensate for the  players lack of prestige. I hope that helps out a little. ,ContestOfChampions,d2qs8bf,3,t5_333zp

Duped BW is fantastic in every aspect of the game but probably isnt your best choice. If you are at all interested in joining an alliance that gets tc through AQ you need and I mean NEED to rank by base prestige only. I have  rs and precisely  are used in AQ. I have had my awakening stone for a while now and am in no hurry to use it.

7588241,0,t1_d347i0o,I would say yes to your first question.  What I think is broken  about the structure is that the amplification of base statistics puts some matches automatically out of reach with nodes like thorns I do not see why a  million alliance of the absolute best players in the game should not be able to defeat a  million alliance of mediocre players.  There should at least be reasonable chance but the expert map really does make that impossible. I think most people who complain like me want to see skill more heavily weighted than it currently is.  Im a k in a M ally and feel awful watching the lower alliances that get paired with us get smashed on nodes  and  preventing all further progress.  So what would be better?  No thorns.  WP effects based on base rating of champs and then scaled up in a diminishing way.  The option to select a range of rating of possible opponents and to see rewards adjusted to match relative difficulty maybe.  The option to forfeit and at least retrieve champs from a hopeless situation the other team can continue and get all the exploration they want and no new wars started until the end.  Or gasp what about nodes that dont AMPLIFY stats at all?  Longer paths and much shorter recharge times so skill figures much more strongly?  There are a gazillion ways to reward skill better.,ContestOfChampions,d34qv25,1,t5_333zp

I contacted Kabam but they want screenshots of the event screen and the event is obviously off of the finished tab by now. So I am not betting anything on that. Maybe I misunderstood how Summoner Advancement works but arent you supposed to get rewards as long as you participate? Or does the alliance itself have to get a certain amount of points for any rewards at all to be issued? Because I have never had this happen so the only explanation I can think of is that somehow the alliance as a whole underperformed and didnt earn rewards. ,ContestOfChampions,d4fwr8z,1,t5_333zp

Yours is obvious that it was most likely a cheater since a  couldnt physically take down a  with nodes before a timeout. Situations where its physically impossible to do yes good chance theyre cheating and thats fine to speak up.

Also now since the nerf champs that only stack one debuff are trash in comparison to champs that stack multiple ones. Willpower is whatever yeah it was overpowered but people who complained couldnt fight. It made me better fighting people wth WP.

Some people have managed to complete it while keeping dexterity  for me it was easier to remove.I needed to redo my masteries and remove dexterity temporarily to really to get through this quest. Swiping back activates dexterity which gives you a permanent critical boost buff until landing your next clean hit. This buff automatically activates power gain and the opponents have their special  activated. . No Dr. Strange Scarlet Witch or Wolverine.You cant use these champions for the most part. Any champion who has any buff furry regeneration armor etc will activate immediate power gain and then before you know it  S youre dead. . Vision is a life saver.I didnt find this out until the very last part of chapter four. Vision is the key to the Iron Man boss. I used my  maxed original vision. I beat up iron man with my main champions until just before he would activate arc overload and regeneration. Then I died switched to my Vision and as soon as his regen started I used his special  which activates heal block and canceled out the entire thing. Such a life saver.. Parry Specials.Since you cant evade specials youre going to half to block them. However if you time them right you can parry a majority of the opponents specials to reduce the damage taken significantly. I parried Iron Mans L and L every time with Captain America and took  damage from it. . Reduce Enemy Evade.If youre lucky enough to have a duped Black Widow or Agent Venom  use them. These champions reduce enemy evasion by a significant amount. This comes in handy against Black Widow and Miles Morales SpiderMan. . Duped Thor is almost useless.Every enemy champion has a global node called safeguard. This node prevents any damage higher than  of the enemys health to be taken in a single hit. That means duped Thors magical armor break stack and special  will do  damage maximum.. Pause and Restart  Free DoOver.If youre about to die quickly pause the fight. From there you can restart your application  when you log back in youll be back to the health from before the fight started. Its a free doover. On iOS just double click and slide the app up to force close it Good Luck! I used about  revives total.  team revives  or so level  single champion revives and  level  single revives.

8653857,0,t1_d6msnk5,I agree with you on that its because people only have  or  weeks to complete these things that forces them to revive their way through it rather than plan out a strategy get the champs and tackle it later.I managed to beat RoL with Wolverine after the removal of Block Proficiency. I had been preparing for ages before that change  it took me a while to get him up to Rank  and get a team that gave him good synergies. Learned how to use Wolverine keep his power bar full to heal and only use specials if I was on full health. When the change came I wasnt too worried since my strat didnt rely on block prof anyway.Then I waited and eventually pulled a  Guillotine that I ranked up to deal with the RoL Wolverine. Took a couple of tries and I beat RoL.Now I think Im a decent enough player that with time and preparation I could tackle Ming Nas too. I have a Hawkeye Black Panther and Vision AoU all at .

But on the flip side some of it comes down to champ selection and some of it comes down to amazingly strong nodes in AW You keep mentioning fighting Cyke with WW. Of course you are going to time out a fight with WW against a Cyke in AQ. Youre using a guy with near perfect block but relatively low attack. If you are worried about time outs then one option for you would be just to use a guy like SL SW or Thor that could end the fight in  minutes. Is it a dick move timing out fights in AW? perhaps. But its also the way the game is set up. If you are in danger of dying or the opponent has an L is it not better to pause and time out than be forced to use itemsunitsmoney? ,ContestOfChampions,d9gp0jt,1,t5_333zp

I did it with no potions or revive.

Ranking up your  will be a bit more expensive but it is definitely recommended  a single maxed  can get you through a good deal of story and event quests without any difficulty.    ISO comes from questing and duping champs gold comes from arena crystals and catalysts come from the daily event quests at least for now but its going to be a long time before you need any T cats.

If you are doing well in each and dont really need them then hang on to your awakening gems.  Me personally I am holding a generic and a cosmic for SL and Thor when I finally pull them.  I also have collected over  signature stones for each.  ,ContestOfChampions,dbrpd0m,2,t5_333zp

The odds not being clearly displayed and what heroes you can possibly get would get them out of this mess but they dont seem to want to divulge what your odds actually are. I assume its either not random in that something about your hero list or via kabam limits what you get or that the rare chance is so miniscule that it would stop people from buying their crystals.

10183293,0,t1_dby79af,So how is it easy mode if they have nodes that makes it more challenging to use her? Like I said just because shes god tier doesnt mean people use her for everything. They already have nodes that counter hers so just because she can plow through some content doesnt mean she can easily go through all and that goes for many champs thats just how it is so no I wouldnt call it easy mode if you have her. LoL counters many abilities that many champs have  example SL yet people still use him. They want to make content more challenging obviously and theyll continue to but it doesnt prevent a player from using specific champs. p.s  I hope that makes sense because Im seriously so freakin tired lol.

You could look up my game profile Professor Skill and use it as reference to measure your own chances at having sufficient team PI to not trigger death matches... I also did EXTENSIVE testing on using TWO MAXED OUT STARS while maintaining a  streak. I always combined them with at least a  star or a  star   matches in a row none of them were death matches.

10828466,0,t3_5uu610,Theres several things in the post that are well hidden I feel I need to point out Additionally one of the biggest changes that will affect many Champions is that Regeneration effects are all changed to be calculated off of base health rather than modified health. This will prevent Champions like Wolverine or Ultron from being unbeatable when they have a large modified amount of health such as in Alliance Wars from buff nodes. This isnt the only change coming with .. As the rift between The Collector and the Grandmaster starts to widen other aspects of the Contest start to twist and change shape such as the introduction of a revamped Arena system that includes more options for Arenas to compete in. More information on this will be available soon. We have made no secret about the fact that we have plans ready until the year  but that is not the end. We are continuing to plan more and more content to go far beyond that. This change will help ensure that we can continue to provide you with new and exciting content for years to come. The first of which is not far off. The clash between the The Grandmaster and The Collector is just beginning and YOU will play a key part. All will slowly be revealed beginning in the first Chapter of Act V coming just  week after the launch of version .. While these changes themselves wont have any effect on the abilities of Champions we are taking this opportunity to make one big change. We will be removing Ranks from Abilities and instead applying the max rank of that Ability to all Ranks and Rarities. This means that instead of having different ranks of Fury Fury Fury II Fury V or Armor Break as you rank up your Champion their abilities will always match the highest possible ability of that Champion. Alliance Quests will start  days earlier so as to not coincide with the new patch release. This means the next round of Alliance Quests will start tomorrow Feb rd. Alliance Quests and Alliance Wars will be offline for one week following the introduction of the . patch. This will give players time to adjust and experiment before getting back into the competition. Alliance Quests will return on March th and Alliance Wars will return on March th. No Alliance Combat mode based events will run during this adjustment period. This includes Node Removal Alliance Brawl and Alliance Quest Completion since neither Alliance Quests and Alliance Wars will be available. We will be introducing a hour Level Up solo event on March nd that repeats until March st and features x the rewards.The main champions who suffer from this update are Thor Only one stack of armor break and Scarlet witch Massive nerfs across the board shes dead,ContestOfChampions,ddwvoki,20,t5_333zp

Both my X and Wolverine are dupe but neither are rank  and mutant the only class where I dont have at least  tcc unless I derank someone for mutant tcc. But they do seem like the best option right now since they both can regen and end fights fast with bleeds.Also with BW getting the nerf bat Im kind of worried about miniboss Spiderman on Map . If he touches you once its pretty much light outs and now with her getting nerf its going to cost a lot more pots. As of right now its pretty easy to push him to sp because you can manage his meter by stopping right before sp and hit him to sp on next combo. But with BW getting her sig nerf if he evades mid combo and stops at sp then thats a problem since it does a ton of chip damage and trying to evade it is super risky.,ContestOfChampions,de1sy9r,2,t5_333zp

11021501,0,t3_5xdpsw,Excerpt  This is just another rant of disappointment to kabam. I am one of the leaders of a top alliance lgn and I am speaking out on behalf of many of the top players in this game. The new update has been a huge slap in the face for everyone in the game but more particularly to the top spenders in this game that spend thousands per week or per month. I know many players that with a single account have spent figures. As it stands right now none of these players will spend to any measurable magnitude until proper game and champ revisions come into effect to benefit the community of players that pay your wages. I am having trouble understanding why it was so important to nerf all the champs we paid so much time and money to acquire. If the certain champs need to be balanced maybe it would be wise to improve the lower tiered champs to come in closer balance to the better champs in the game. Instead you have decided to take away all the benefits and abilities that made the better champs great. The community of players and spenders look at this method as stealing from us as we paid dearly with our time and money to achieve these champs and their respective abilities. It is very clear to me that Kabams strategy has always been throw it at the wall and see what sticks and with every change kabam will make a surplus of money while the community of gamers try to figure it out. This is actually a great strategy and it has proven to work over time with MCOC but what you have failed to realize is this only works with adding content and not taking away all the aspects of the game that we enjoy and are willing to pay for. I am also willing to bet that kabam is trying to use the strategy of making all these crazy changes so that they can quickly change some back to make it seem like they met on middle ground with the community but in reality this was the plan since before the rollout occurred and kabam will actually achieve exactly what they intended on in the first place. I would call this the art of Trump negotiations. Unfortunately for kabam the community of MCOC gamers is smarter than you think and each time you try to make these terrible changes we will as a community continue to give  ratings and we will continue to ask for refunds which will disrupt your relationship with apple and google and we will ask seek legal council in attempts to regain what we feel has been stolen from us. Your new update will not fix your ratings as we all are ready to submit new  ratings and we will continue to close our wallets and leave the game. These are not threats but this is the reality and future you have created by making poor decisions. How do you fix this? Listen to the MCOC community that pays your salary or you will be looking for a new job and I think many of us actually hope kabam fails and many of these decision makers lose their jobs. We would actually at least feel some justice for everything we believe you have stole from us.I will suggest creating a panel of users from all the top alliances to speak for the community directly to kabam to help resolve the recent changes and how to find a positive solution before this game sinks any further.Sincerelyexpert,ContestOfChampions,deh998x,26,t5_333zp

Kabam is able to see units spent on solo arenas champ arenas signature stones amp Tcc offers. Blanket compensation for k players was an utter insult.This cycle of baiting and switching needs to cease.   They heralded the changes in content over  months ago. That means they were fully cognizant of these changes before they offered these pricey deals to bolster these camps. They were cognizant that there are not equitable champs to spend the unjust compensation on.  The compensation offered by Kabam is nowhere close to the near  spent by baited customers to compete in the game.  Listed are the  avenues I posted  weeks ago to seek recompense amp force Kabam to rethink their thieveryStep    Contact Bill Rosemann of Marvel games at brosemannmarvel.com amp on Twitter at BillRosemann amp LinkedIn at  He is also on Facebook.

Please use Reddit and Discord to gather voices and support.  When our numbers swell lets contact an attorney and forge a class action lawsuit.  Step   Never give up on fighting for fair treatment by Kabam.  An organized and united opposition cannot be turned back.   Progress may be tedious but in the end we will win!

Of course they are going to see things differently than us middle tier champs.  Id love to get my signature stones back.  The problem right now is if I got them what would I use them on? With the state of the game high sig levels probably wont help in the high tier fights.  In middle tier fights they wont be needed.  Hell of a mess.

Save up your units to unlock the masteries Parry and Dexterity evade.  I would only work on maxing out a  star champ if its one that has solid end game use but thats just me.  Watch youtube videos to try and improve your gameplay.  Some people are really hardcore and will continually make new accounts until they pull a solid  star or even a  star champ from the first few crystals but thats too hardcore for me.

Find a champ that inflicts lots of debuffs max despair and try to nullify the regen that way. Symb spidey can stack long armour breaks but hes probably too squishy to last long enough.

11627113,0,t1_dgdxhiy,Cut the condescension. I didnt say I didnt like it. When I said for the worse I specifically limited that statement to the difficulty which I think is pretty objective. I dont have a problem with a difficult boss in and of itself. Im simply saying theres no good counter to Dormammu on the level of the best Kangkillers. That said if the rumors hold and Iceman does replace Spidey on map  I will be rolling my eyes because then its clear Kabam thought they werent making enough money off map . Its possible to enjoy challenges and be skeptical of changes to difficult content at the same time. ,ContestOfChampions,dgdy1u2,1,t5_333zp

However players later discovered that synergies do affect the timer either Miike like most of the times was not fully aware of the details or it was a bug which they decided not to fix since many had finished the Labrynth in its bugged stateYou get an extended timer if your base attack without boosts or masteries is above k.

11687463,0,t3_66r18r,This is the most condescending general statement Ive ever read from Miike. Its an insult to active members of all competitive alliances and completely disregards why tcc alliances save their resources biweekly and hes not taking any responsibility on the companys behalf for the situation theyve created. Alliances should always be pushing their hardest is a blanket statement which in between the lines translates to paying more AQ costs and spending more units. Excuse me. If youve never ran a real alliance dont give us advice. Were playing with the cards weve been dealt sir. Now we see why they bunched alliances together in  tiers. Push every week people. Stress out. Burn out. Lose leadership. Disband. Such a slap in the face. Another AQ season and another disappointment. Glory is a gimmick and an even better boycott is around the corner. You would think theyd be smarter by now or at least follow through with trying to earn our trust back. Hes supposed to be the messenger but he apparently has no PR education or filter to prevent the executives and game developers from being exposed.

11731302,0,t3_67e6fg,Im not in an upper tier alliance and Im constrained on TBs.The problem is not that TB is harder to get.  It is that TB is usually the bottleneck.  Thats not the same thing.  Consider it takes three TB to upgrade from  to .  Even if you have zero TCC you still need TB.  If you are one of those players that just doesnt get any significant amount of TCC your bottleneck is getting enough TB to rank up your  to .  You dont have the TCC to get to  but thats not the most obvious progress bottleneck.Conversely when you start getting TCC even shards to assemble them it takes three TCC to get to  but still also  TB.  If youve been spending them to rank your  up to  where are those  TBs going to come from?Where ever you are in the game above a certain level TB shortages are always the most obvious ones.  If you dont have TCC you can still use TB and you never have enough.  If you do have TCC you still need TB just to use the TCC and once again you tend to not have enough.Either way TB is the obvious bottleneck.,ContestOfChampions,dgpruvn,9,t5_333zp

11790120,0,t1_dgvyway,If you are thinking of attempting LOL I would privilege BP over HE. HE power drain is a double edged sword the negative part for LOL for eg. against falcon war machine where it would be easier to dodge their sp than sp. One can say to use HEs sp instead but that would render the argument that his advantage of his power drain sp meaningless. Then he loses that edge or advantage.Also BP bleed stacks insanely and cuts down enemies with lots of hp more quickly than HE whose bleed doesnt stack.
