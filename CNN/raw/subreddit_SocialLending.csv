2381926,0,t3_2mlbax,I spent some time a couple years ago trying to wade through all of the data but I felt like this was not good use of my spare time and that I was getting played by professional who had much better tools at their disposal.  I lived in a state where I had to buy them on foliofn and I think this cut into my profit quite a bit.   I had a a numbers loans go south really quick and decided it was probably not a good idea to try use my own methods to try to price them especially when buying them second hand.   So I stopped investing.  They sent me an email yesterday offering their direct share program. Im wondering if the CounterpartyEthereum platform isnt going to take away from Lending Club or if they are going to embrace this and use their position to stay out in front of the technology. ,SocialLending,cm6449x,1,t5_2tb03

4509592,0,t1_csyvtng,Good question  it did concern me. I technically used different funds for the LC investment and did use the borrowed funds for what I had listed in my borrowing request. Net result is the same but I was able to sleep at night.,SocialLending,csz2zj7,2,t5_2tb03
