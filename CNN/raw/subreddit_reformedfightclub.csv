616651,0,t1_cga6bk2,gtAny argument you can use for synergistic discipleship  sanctification you can apply to salvation. Only true if one fails to distinguish between LEGAL and ETHICAL sanctification.  Since the former is monergistic and required for our eternal salvation whereas the latter is synergistic and not eternally salvific but required for our temporal wellbeing and growing in grace the distinction allows for our eternal salvation to remain utterly monergistic while at the same time allowing that our acts of righteousness in this life are synergistic.   gtBut we know that it is God who sanctifies by his grace.  Thessalonians And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. I Thes   Do you believe that any person is so utterly sanctified in their personal conduct in discipleship that they can be regarded as wholly sanctified?  If you do then you are teaching the doctrine of sinless perfection.  The undeniable reality of remaining sin makes it perfectly clear that Pauls reference is to ones LEGAL sanctification in Christ.  Indeed is this not precisely what is meant by Jehovah Tsidkenu  the Lord our righteousness?  This notion that we somehow are wholly sanctified in our obedience is a denial that Christ is our righteousness through imputation.  Clearly one of the outworkings of that LEGAL work of sanctification is that we are exhorted unto obedient discipleship.   Consider this  if Jesus Christ taught monergistic salvation and that salvation was impossible with men what did Peter have in mind when he told men to save themselves from this untoward generation?  Is Peter telling them they need to DO SOMETHING in order to obtain ETERNAL salvation?   gtLouis Berkhof in his Systematic Theology . Conspicuous in its absence is the very next sentence of that quote It is essentially a work of God though in so far as He employs means MAN CAN AND IS EXPECTED TO COOPERATE BY THE PROPER USE OF THESE MEANS.  Thats synergism.  His reference to essentially a work of God is similar to what others have said in this discussion about sanctification having a monergistic source but this is true of everything given the doctrine of monergistic creation.  Berkhof can see the can of worms that hes potentially opening up and is attempting to hedge his bets.  None the less such hedging does not prevent him from exploring the synergistic realities of sanctification. Further on under Section  of the section titled The Nature of Sanctification Berkhof says IT IS A WORK OF GOD IN WHICH BELIEVERS COOPERATE. When it is said that man takes part in the work of sanctication this does not mean that man is an independent agent in the work so as to make it partly the work of God and partly the work of man but merely that God effects the work in part through the instrumentality of man as a rational being BY REQUIRING OF HIM PRAYERFUL AND INTELLIGENT COOPERATION WITH THE SPIRIT. THAT MAN MUST COOPERATE WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD FOLLOWS a from the repeated warnings against evils and temptations WHICH CLEARLY IMPLY THAT MAN MUST BE ACTIVE IN AVOIDING THE PITFALLS OF LIFE Rom.  I Cor.  Gal.  and b FRO THE CONSTANT EXHORTATIONS TO HOLY LIVING. These imply that THE BELIEVER MUST BE DILIGENT in the employment of the means AT HIS COMMAND for the moral and spiritual improvement of his life Micah  John  Rom.   Gal. .  Brother that is the very definition of synergism that I provided  cooperation active  this is the unavoidable language of synergism.  In the first paragraph of his statement on the characteristics of sanctification Berkhof says Nevertheless it sanctification differs from regeneration in that MAN CAN  and is in duty bound to STRIVE for everincreasing sanctication BY USING the means which God has placed AT HIS DISPOSAL.  If this work is a monergistic work then such usable means are clearly not at his disposal.  Another strong affirmation of synergism.  Your attempt to rally Berkhof in support of your cause leaves a lot to be desired IMHO.  ,reformedfightclub,cgad4no,-1,t5_2z0r1
621916,0,t1_cgax9pb,I think Sproul is inconsistent in his theology here. And I agree with Kevin DeYoung  the terms are not well suited in either case because people have their own ideas about what they mean.,reformedfightclub,cgaynon,1,t5_2z0r1

806275,0,t1_cgvx6p2,gt At this time there are very few people whos consciences are compromised on the issue. You really have fully convinced strong Christians on both sides who feign the victim and hold their brother brothers liberty hostage misusing passages such as Romans .There is certainly a lot of that which goes around. But thats not something that Im doing. I am not telling you what to do or what to believe but trying to convince you from wisdom and scripture.gt Either you eat food to idols and thats bad or its not bad. The fact of the matter is that its not an internal sin such as lust. Paul wasnt even addressing an internal sin he was addressing something thats externalIt was internal though. This wasnt merely eating food or meat but about eating food that was offered to idols. You can be sure there were similar people on each side of the issue some convinced that eating food offered to idols was sinful some convinced that it was a fine thing to do. Had one who was convinced that it was wrong partaken of the food it most certainly wouldve been sinful.gt Nobody is suggesting that someone should lust after bikini clad women. Even allowing the wearing of bikinis does not allow for lust. It might be applicable if that was the point.No disagreement here. Likewise idolatry is not acceptable even if they were eating the meat.,reformedfightclub,cgvxegt,0,t5_2z0r1
1564411,0,t1_cjcd0sp,What difference does it make who quotes the scripture? There is nothing grey about Gods word. It is abundantly clear that God does choose who He will save. What does the word elect mean to you? Or Whosoever John ? does that imply that everyone will believe? Of course not. Either God is sovereign or He is not. Their is no in between. And using foul language does not help your case at all.,reformedfightclub,cjcde67,3,t5_2z0r1
1726910,0,t3_2e3trt,I think theres a problem whenever you create an extrabiblical system rather than focusing on the biblical principles involved.  Can you establish patriarchy from Scripture? Yes.  Can you establish the importance of guarding your heart from Scripture? Yes.  Can you establish the importance of purity from Scripture? Yes.  Can you establish the importance of choosing a Godfearing spouse from Scripture? Yes.  Can you accomplish all these things and call it dating? Yes.  Can you fail to do these things within the constraints of traditional courtship? Yes.  Rules dont change the heart.,reformedfightclub,cjwub9p,4,t5_2z0r1
2593995,0,t1_cmx555x,Assume the worst?  No I researched it and find much pointing to the worst.  When this first came up I had a much more open view on them.  It is only through some hours of research that I came to my conclusion.gtAnd you have not heard the other side of the story.Im using every bit of information that they have chosen to give.  Id hope thats a pretty good side of the story.  Its not like Im just looking at things from their detractors Im using their own materials.  There is more than enough information to make a decision I think.  It would take a full release of a program of study and analysis by an outside group to give sufficient reason to doubt their status.Given how much time the school and White spend to try to convince you that it is legit they clearly are feeling the heat.  It wouldnt be hard to belay the suspicion but they dont do much more than say Trust us!.  Give me reason to trust you....,reformedfightclub,cmx67md,2,t5_2z0r1

3110577,0,t1_cokecz8,I would probably be inclined to see that more in the category of extreme handraising. However if that started to take away from the lyrics and the meaning of the words being sung then I would think it to be a problem. ,reformedfightclub,cokery6,1,t5_2z0r1
3345192,0,t3_2ye4fu,It is often asserted that they were Christophanies but it is impossible to prove. Where Scripture doesnt stipulate I dare not speculate. If the Lord had wanted us to believe it was a theophany of the Second Person and not the One God He would have ordained that such information was discernable from the Word of God. I think that the Christophany speculation because thats all it really is is reflective of a school of thinking that moves too close to Polytheism IMHO. There is one God. He revealed Himself at a Theophany. There is no need to assume that it was a single person of the Trinity. ,reformedfightclub,cp9krv3,2,t5_2z0r1

4752499,0,t1_cttjuc3,gtNo salvation is not offered to the demons. I agree. I would further concur with usoladeogloria that eternal salvation is not offered to anyone. gt Scripture doesnt say explicitly why salvation is not offered to the demons teth but presumably because Christ did not die for the demons. If salvation is offered as most here incorrectly affirm and it cannot be offered to the demons because Christ did not die for them as you correctly assert then it is impossible to sincerely offer eternal salvation to the nonelect for the selfsame reason  because Christ did not die for them. gtThe atonement accomplishes only what Jesus and the Father intended it to accomplish  which is a whole lot. I agree. But since by your own admission it does not accomplish the eternal salvation of the nonelect because Christ did not die for the nonelect then at a bare minimum the gospel cannot be a wellmeant offer of salvation to the nonelect. It is therefore not a wellmeant offer of salvation to all of humanity because Christ did not die for all of humanity.  It is for this reason that the gospel is not an offer but a proclamation of the finished effectual work of Christ on behalf of his people John  Romans  I Corinthians  Matthew .,reformedfightclub,cttlivc,-1,t5_2z0r1
