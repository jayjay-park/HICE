354742,0,t3_1y5ha1,The dam on Kuykendahl is a good place to catch catfish especially after that little creek floods after a big rainstorm. Im pretty sure youre not allowed to fish there anymore so I wouldnt park your car nearby. I havent been home in a while so dont quote me on that. Luckily I just have to hop a couple fences from my parents house and hike down there. Definitely worth a shot if youre looking for catfish.,thewoodlands,cfhjar2,6,t5_2sazj

861535,0,t3_1wueyq,Ive lived in the Woodlands since  and Im actually hating all of this. I remember when woodlands parkway was one way in and one way out. It used to be so peaceful here and now its blowing up. Ill be moving out of here within the next few years to find a quieter place. Something like it was  years ago if there is such a place.,thewoodlands,ch27n2f,1,t5_2sazj

4107221,1,t3_37n168,This is sort of thinking is a real problem with our leadership gtThe ultimate goal of the master plan is to guide the development of...bike lanes...to provide connections to all adjacent communities...Does our leadership know of the crime in communities around us? I dont want to provide them connections into our community at all. Making it easier for criminals to get in and out of The Woodlands is clearly one of the leaderships long term goals since they just tried to do this with the Road Bond. ,thewoodlands,crog5rd,3,t5_2sazj

9112756,0,t3_54usu5,From what I have read from Gordy Bunchs Facebook page they plan to do a referendum to officially incorporate. They wanted to do it later but with the whole road initiatives and bond issues with the county they have been left with no choice but to accelerate incorporation. By incorporating it would make The Woodlands the largest city in Montgomery county at  people approximately giving it a voice in matters rather then just be pushed around because they are not a real city yet.,thewoodlands,d877f2p,1,t5_2sazj

10775733,0,t1_ddqvsja,I work with some of these people at my current job. They closings have already happened. Some were either offered jobs at the Woodlands hospital or others had as needed jobs lined up. The woodlands facility and Conroe facility were close as of last Saturday. They just walked in and told them to pack up their personal belongings and leave without any warning. They were promised jobs to be lined up for them also a lie. They were told repeatedly over the past couple months they would not loose their jobs. They were last told they were being shut down because their labs was no following proper protocol all things to cover up more lies. Big corporations are big machines just looking out for their money. Always be prepared in case of an out of a blue shut down. ,thewoodlands,ddrftis,6,t5_2sazj
10806229,0,t1_ddrio30,Ive only been here a little over a year so forgive my ignorance. Why are people opposed to the Woodlands Parkway extension? Because it would add more traffic?  ,thewoodlands,ddul4gk,1,t5_2sazj
10807001,0,t1_ddul4gk,The reason for opposition is because Montgomery County has transportation mobility plans in place to improve the flow of traffic in the County. This plan includes plans to connect towns and subdivisions outside of The Woodlands that are trying to get to the  by running them to roads in The Woodlands like Research Forest and Woodlands Parkway. They also want to extend roads north to south by connecting them to Gosling Rd Kuykendahl Rd Branch Crossing etc. All that will create excess traffic that will over time require them to widen the existing  lane roads into  lane roads. This would add even more traffic more noise more congestion more pollution more tree cutting more concrete more ugly signs billboards being built more strip malls etc. in turn make them into multiple FMs and destroy the quiet forested ambiance that is The Woodlands.There was a bond initiative sent to voters in past November that included funding for Woodlands Parkway extension voters in The Woodlands successfully voted it down. The County went back and struck the extension off the bond and sent it back to voters and it passed. Meaning the people of The Woodlands do not want the extension or any extension that runs thru The Woodlands. Since TW isnt an actual city  yet the County doesnt have to listen to TW pop.  and listen to actual cities like Magnolia pop. . The only way to rectify this problem is by incorporating into a city which in turn would make TW the largest city in Montgomery County and no longer able to be pushed around.,thewoodlands,ddunzox,3,t5_2sazj
