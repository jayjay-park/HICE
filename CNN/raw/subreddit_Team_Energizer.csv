11242565,0,t3_6003v4,Im super late to this so IDK if anyone will see this but HI EVERYONE!!!Im  female and  ft  in. I started out at  and now weigh around ! My goal weight is  with a reassessment to determine if I should lose more when I get there so Im less than  away!!! SO EXCITING.Ive been involved with  challenge in the past but I wasnt very active in part because I hadnt quite gotten to the point in my weight loss journey where I was taking it seriously. I was doing it really halfassed focusing more on the exercise aspect which I love rather than the food aspect which is harder for me. And as we all know weight loss is made in the kitchen!!Anyway nowadays I eat about  calories depending on how I feel that day and on weekends I usually do a cheat day on Saturdays. That means I lose slower but honestly Im ok with it because it keeps me on track the rest of the days. My biggest struggle thus far has been learning to find balance and forgiveness. I used to engage in some pretty serious bingerestrict cycles that left me feeling very shameful and guilty. Now Im trying to learn to allow myself to continue to enjoy food while not overdoing it.ANYWAY. Im on myfitnesspal FitBit and Instagram Add me on any of those social media outlets and Ill addfollow you back!  Cant wait to start this challenge and complete the rest of my fitness journey!!,Team_Energizer,df6btpm,2,t5_3jkfh
11281935,0,t3_6003v4,Hello Team Energizer! This is my first Loseit challenge and Im very excited to be here. F .  . CW  . ChallengeGW  . Im a student from Bristol UK graduating later this year. Currently working as a waitress but will be finished there by the start of the challenge hoping this will help me to meet my goals since no more tasty free food to tempt me!. Im a keen cyclist and gymgoer find me on Polar  or Strava Following a HCLF vegan lifestyle but need to start considering CICO too if Im gonna really attack this weight so logging consistently in cronometer is a goal for the challenge. Other nonscale goals include managing chinups and pullups.,Team_Energizer,dfash4b,3,t5_3jkfh
11335011,0,t1_dfgg09g,TDEE is your Total Daily Energy Expenditure or the amount of calories that you burn every day. Its based on a bunch of factors like your height weight and activity level. In order to lose weight you need to eat under your TDEE which means you need to eat fewer calories than you burn.Eating  calories less than your TDEE will burn lb a week and  calories under will burn lbs a week which is generally considered the highest amount you can safely lose in a week.,Team_Energizer,dfgsy0b,2,t5_3jkfh
11337264,0,t3_61sovf,I weigh throughout the week but Mondays are my official weighin days. This is the first Monday in several months that my weight didnt go down. My calories this week were exactly where they should have been so I know I lost fat and will probably see a drop in a day or two but still. Its silly how much the scale can mess with your mind despite the logic.,Team_Energizer,dfh253f,3,t5_3jkfh
