5218147,0,t1_cvewaq6,gtMost of everything written about growth hackingToo true but thats because marketers only know one thing grab the latest buzzword and replace the previous buzzword used in all standard advice. But the thing is growth hacking is its own separate thing from marketing in general. Its a specific focus on joining psychology combined with methods to get the word out. I wouldnt care so much about how much blogspam there is here if it was all REALLY about growth hacking. Instead its the same tired rehashing of build a mailing list spam LinkedIn blah blah influencer blah. FFS there has been some intelligent conversation on the topic. I wish the mods here kept it focused on that. ,GrowthHacking,cvez97q,1,t5_2vpgj
