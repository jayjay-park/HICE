2038321,0,t1_ckxozti,The OP of this post and myself are going to play Palo Alto muni this Sunday afternoon at  if you want to join. Its a bit of a hike and the course is just about to undergo a major renovation its currently a bit wonky and only a par  I believe. I totally understand if thats not worth the trek down from SF for you and we cant try for a different weekend. ,GolfGTG,ckywzjy,1,t5_2uejq
