2748129,0,t1_cndtym8,Sorry for the slow reply. Xbox Live support contacted me and we tried a bunch of stuff.

I did try this once before but for some reason it didnt work the first time. It may help to do a full restart of the console after changing the settings to child.,XboxOneHelp,cngg8l6,1,t5_2zg6i
