253073,0,t3_1wyxmk,Id recommend Marcs blogs from the perspective of someone who has done it as well. Hes very open and honest about what it really takes.If you have any interest in talking with a manufacturer who works with startups let me know. I can provide you with some input for a different perspective i.e. many of the mistakes we see startups make because they dont know what they dont know.You can send me a direct message and we can connect from there.,hwstartups,cf6zhjy,1,t5_2ukge

The unfortunate thing is that I really enjoyed the challenge and the amount that I learned in the process.  It is very easy for me to forget about all of the frustration and akwardness after I had a board do what was requested of it.I guess it is a lot like labor for women.  They forget how rough it was when the next opportunity arises.The main issue that I have is figuring out payment.  I completely understand the requirement for staying cheap for the startup but at the same time I need to make sure that I am able to maintain a company and not fold.  This is definately the difficult task.,hwstartups,cw2bs73,1,t5_2ukge

At . cm per part you can pack a lot of these into an SLS printer.Our favorite SLS shop DPRINTUK charges . per cm. Youll have to space them . mm apart from each other so youre looking at . cm per part which is a big increase but still super affordable.DPRINTUK does have a per part minimum though but you can overcome that by either connecting the parts to each other with a thin sprue or if they allow this wrapping the separated parts in a perforated enclosure. I know there are other SLS printing shops that allow the enclosure.Therefore youre looking at probably less than  in production costs. CNC milling is easily x that and injection molding requiring a slide in this case is easily x. Laser cutting something this small and thick isnt ideal unless you dont care about wall draft and in any case laser cutting in two ops is a major hassle that should be avoided at any cost.,hwstartups,dfpdk8k,3,t5_2ukge
