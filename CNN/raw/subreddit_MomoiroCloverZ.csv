This could mean more exposure in overseas countries as well which is definitely positive!,MomoiroCloverZ,cm5db6k,1,t5_32wmw

A personal favourite of mine and the first full concert I ever saw would be their spring concert at the National Olympic Stadium. Its called Haru no Ichidaiji . Its a huge concert and it was really significant for them. They had a goal to perform there but were convinced they wouldnt get to do it in time for when it would be renovated to prepare for the  Olympics. But they got to perform there as the first allgirl group ever. The theme of the concert is their journey from their humble beginnings performing on the street to the legendary Olympic Stadium.The energy from the girls and the fans is great the setlist is fantastic. Its a great introductory concert Id say.,MomoiroCloverZ,dgbwkr8,3,t5_32wmw
