5103849,0,t3_3kvcrc,The Consortium welcomes diplomatic discussions with its neighbor and dispatches a vessel from the diplomatic corps with Ambassador Dahlia McAlister aboard. The sleek indigo craft exited the wormhole into Reich space and immediately began broadcasting its diplomatic credentials to government authorities.With the credentials broadcast the ambassador also sent a visual message her feet anchored to stickpads in front of the crest of the Consortium. She smiled graciously and spoke in a clear friendly tone Greetings to you from the Ariadne Consortium. It is my honor to meet with you and plant the seeds of what we hope will be a mutually beneficial arangement of trade and travel between our two peoples.The vessel powered away from the wormhole slowly angling itself toward the rendezvous point with Reich officials.,ScienceFictionPowers,cv17ct3,1,t5_39q8e

6787392,0,t1_d0lmjef,A moment of time passes before you hear the voice of Prendota Kniaziewicz himself.Yes Im told you wished to speak with me?  Is this in regards to my forces preventing all travel from the Coronian Consulate in the OP Commonwealth?  Im sorry but unfortunately I must stay firm in this.  Im sure you have an embassy in either your own sector or the OP Commonwealths sectors speak with your diplomats there.  For right now that warp gate is a war zone and as Im sorry to say youre smack dab in the middle of it.  Id suggest backing off.He smiled visibly over the holo recording appearing to turn away before doubling back on himself.One... one more thing.  We Arkonans are rather notorious for recording a lot of things.  Theres a sense of diplomatic clout I believe in the international community.  Right now you are in suspicion of detonating a nuclear device in neutral territory.  You are also accused of pirating trade lanes of Arkona and the Caitans.  These trade lanes are connected directly to the OP Commonwealth supported and recognized colony hosted jointly by Arkona and the Caitan Federation in HJ AB.  I will not take kindly to threats of trying to accuse us of nonexistant war crimes and I highly doubt the rest of the international community would believe your obviously forged claims if and when you make them.  As far as Im concerned this white flag ship is containing nuclear weapons.  I will personally give the order to fire if you move even a mere meter closer.  I verify that I am Prendota Kniaziewicz and I will not take demands or dictations from anyone.  Pull back your disguised warship in the guise of a diplomatic mission or be fired upon.,ScienceFictionPowers,d0ln03b,1,t5_39q8e

8474638,0,t1_d60v6gj,Uxria felt lost as Maria seemed to run through her own process of understanding making references to concepts and groups far beyond what she could understand. When she finally finished Uxria remained quiet for a time.Unfortunately I do not know. I came to investigate this signal and to understand what other life was in the Void around us. But finding something like yourself is beyond what the KriThalax knows. But from the way you speak there is much in the Void that we do not know. So to put it simply a way to understand just who and what you are would likely be the best course of action.,ScienceFictionPowers,d60vdf0,1,t5_39q8e
