5590365,0,t3_3rk6hr,Actually anyone who even considers voting for this guy is a fool. He has zero political experience and cant even give out a detailed presidential plan that would work.His ideas are ridiculous. This is him on climate changeAnd actually weve had times where the weather wasnt working out so they changed it to extreme weather and they have all different names you know so that it fits the bill. But the problem we have and if you look at our energy costs and all of the things that were doing to solve a problem that I dont think in any major fashion exists. I mean Obama thinks its the number one problem of the world today. And I think its very low on the list. So I am not a believer and I will unless somebody can prove something to me I believe theres weather. I believe theres change and I believe it goes up and it goes down and it goes up again. And it changes depending on years and centuries but I am not a believer and we have much bigger problems.This is not even debated. Climate change has already been proven to exist and pose as a major problem many times. We cant have a president who ignores a real and relevant threat. It may be more comfortable walking outside in New England after some global warming but the Gulf Coast can easily be devastated with rising sea levels.This is what he said about vaccines a while backYou take this little beautiful baby and you pump  it looks just like its meant for a horse.Weve had so many instances ... a child went to have the vaccine got very very sick and now is autistic.This is so misinformed that I am not even going to address it.In addition he cant even answer real presidential questions. He had no idea what he was saying in that interview.This is what he said about the American Dream.Look. We can bring the American Dream back. That I will tell you. Were bringing it back. Okay? And I understand what youre saying. And I get that from so many people. Is the American Dream dead? And the American Dream is in trouble. That I can tell you. Okay? Its in trouble. But were going to get it back and do some real jobs. How about that man with that beautiful red hat. Stand up! Stand up! What a hat!What is he even saying here? He gave NO specifics and he didnt even explain how the American Dream is in trouble. We cant have a president who cannot even express a specific plan let alone a good one.Also we are not losing to every country in trade. The US GDP is still a good  higher than that of China which has four times the population.Despite his slight lead over Ben Carson in the polls that are still more people who dont like him than do. Even if he does win the nomination which is a possibility he would get crushed in the electoral college do to his unpopularity among Hispanics in key swing states.Donald Trumps supporters are some of the most bigoted people in the country. Some time ago  of his supporters were birthers. . Obamas place of birth is not even questionable many of the Republicans are such sore  losers that they cant even accept his presidential win back in . And actually even Trump himself revealed that he questioned the birth certificate of Obama in an interview with Anderson Cooper. One more thing is that many of Trumps supporters believe that Obama is Muslim. This is preposterous. President Obama has always been a devout Christian and performs many acts that the Islamic faith prohibits. Even if he were Muslim there would still be nothing wrong with it.Donald Trump does have some plans though yet they are still unreasonable. No you cannot deport over  million people and separate them from their families. No building a wall will not keep out all the drugs crime...rapists. No the country will not be better off with massive tax cuts on the rich. His foreign policy is just as bad. His arrogance and temper will get the US in many more conflicts than it needs to and we dont want another disaster like the war in Iraq.WHY should we vote for him? What plans of his will actually work and how? How is he better than all the other candidates who actually know how to work in politics?The American voters will eventually realise how daft this guy is.At least hes better than Carson and Cruz.,VoteTrumpYouLoser,cwq1cp6,-1,t5_39hos
