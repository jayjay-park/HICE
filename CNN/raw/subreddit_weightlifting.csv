119223,0,t3_1vgapk,Alright people.  a few things I have addressed in comments below but I will  put it all in one comment and leave it at that.   He suffered a compression fracture.  It happened when the bar landed on the top of the spine as hit butt hit the floor.  Between the bar floor and spine something had to give.  The accident was not caused by the bar rebounding on the plates behind him.  In fact if you watch the video the bar never actually rebounds into him.  He lays back onto the bar which pushes it back.  You can see the moment the spine breaks because his body instantly goes rigid and draws the hands back onto itself.  This is called posturing in the EMS world.  It is a sort of defense mechanism.  This happens as the bar strikes the top of his shoulders before the bar ever hits the ground.  Kevin was an excellent lifter who knew what he was doing.  I personally have seen him snatch well into the s.  I have no idea why he dropped that bar the way he did but experience and bad form was not it.  I know we like to say things like My guess his technical failures start at a much lower weight or He should learn technique first or other things that make us feel better about lifting weights but experience and technique was not his issue.  Video of him high hang snatching x  So him holding onto a  a little too long isnt so ridiculous.  What was the issue? I dont know.  as I said below The way he dropped the lift is what is strangest to me. Almost as if he blacked out. He just lets go of the bar and sits on his butt with no attempt to bail forward or backward.  I assume we will never know. Finally Kevin is a good guy and has done more for the fitness world than many of us will. I have been competing with him for several years around Colorado.  In fact he helped walk me through my first competition. He is uninsured although he was recently approved for medicaid so if you feel the need to help out a fellow weightlifting enthusiast go to  to make a donation to his many years of surgery and rehab.,weightlifting,ces09n0,71,t5_2rlwc

292172,0,t3_1xg4kz,as said by others without video its pretty hard to say. if its during the first pull you can try changing your starting position a bit more upright however that may or may not help with this. if its while you receive a snatch or a clean it may be that the bar is too much in front i.e. youre not finishing your pull or mobility. ,weightlifting,cfb1qvt,1,t5_2rlwc
324539,0,t1_cfe1gxl,You are right. If your feet is no longer on the platform you cant deliver power anymore. But once youre fully extended and completely finished your nd pull theres nothing else left to give from your legs anyway. At this point the goal is to get under the bar as fast as possible and you cant do that if your feet is on the platform. If you just do an air squat right now and try to get from standing to ATG as FAST AS POSSIBLE youd want to momentarily lift your feet off the floor.EDIT Check out this article by Coach Takano  Another issue that is not often remarked upon is that the speed of the drop under the bar is increased by the movement of the feet from pulling stance to squatting stance shuffle the feet outward. ,weightlifting,cfeeqjz,1,t5_2rlwc

390824,0,t1_cfl7vh1,Its not everyone who will get pain but if you have a propensity for problems in that area this is a very common contributor. Its similar to what happens if you consistently catch cleans low on the chest.,weightlifting,cfl9we9,1,t5_2rlwc
391681,0,t1_cflb1eh,If youre catching it low on your chest in a squat clean and not a power clean then its usually because the bar is forward andor its crashing on you.Exactly what is happening is hard to say. Youre probably right about being forward in the first pull. As the weight gets heavier its harder and harder to keep the back tight and the weight distributed across the whole foot. The bar then comes forward and the lifter tends to come upright earlier which causes the bar to go even further forward.It could also be that youre not following through with your grip on the turnover. This can be really difficult on a bar that doesnt spin well but its really important if you want to meet the bar and catch it with your elbows up. You should maintain a tight grip on the bar throughout its rotation right until the end of the third pull.Those are just guesses based on the most common problems. Given how far ahead it seems your front squat is from your clean you can probably make some significant progress on this in a relatively short time period if we can identify whats going on.,weightlifting,cfld3mn,1,t5_2rlwc

1047341,0,t3_262xr2,In my opinion and experience power versions of any lifts are easier than the lifts. When I started I could easily power as much or more in the case of my snatch than my full. This was due to when I would get in the hole I would just lose stability and drop the bar. But I think Im an amateur so correct me if Im wrong the clean allows for much more technical discrepancy than the snatch and the power clean even more so. Before I started lifting I was an extremely unathletic and out of shape and had little to no hand eye coordination and zero strength solid lb squat x when I started so learning how to snatch took a few months of strength building and technique work and Im still struggling with getting in the hole. Conversely my clean was looking decent with around  week of self coaching. As long as you understand the concept of staying on your heels and being able to pull and stay back and getting under the bar in my opinion decent form should come in a couple weeks with youtube help.

1249975,0,t3_28e94q,Start with your butt a little higher and your shoulders further over the bar. The bar shouldnt have to go around your knees on the way up. Shoulders further over the bar at the start makes it easier to get a straight bar path because you dont have to worry about the knees being in the way.Youre also not fully extending. It looks like youre doing a sort of jump and shrug but not fully extending the hip. Really explode once you get that bar up near your hipupper thigh area.Main things Id say to work on are starting with the shoulders more over the bar and really getting that hip to explode up and through. Kinda think of it like you want to throw the barbell through the roof with all of your power but dont actually throw it P.Couple of other things. Try not to throw your head back when you extend and when you land try to land in a nice solid partial front squat position. It can help to do a full front squat as soon as you catch it so you know youre catching it in a solid position.It takes some time to learn how to really be explosive but when you do it feels awesome. I was always very explosive and used to train BJJ and Muay Thai. Not sure what Martial Arts you do but the explosiveness and coordination would definitely help as you probably already know. They look pretty good for a beginner though.

This is because the knurling wears away over time when placed on a standrack.

Walk away as soon as its done and act like each lift is a good one even if youre unsure if you moved you elbow or such.  Acting like its a good lift can possibly sway a judges choice if they are on the fence about it.

The coaches lead you through what to look for and even a person with no experience can pass the.  Both the crossfit cert and the USAW cert are only to make sure you have a general understanding about the lifts but in no way do they make you qualified to coach immediately.  gtPeople who compete generally have pretty good technique The issue is this has nothing to do with coaching.  You can be great at lifting yourself and terrible at teaching another person to lift.  Being good at lifting alone does not prepare you to coach others look for issues correct problems or program workouts.  Ive seen people who are great at lifting themselves but couldnt teach a beginner at all.

Even after rewatching it I would never have called him on it from this anglegif.I dont think its really him absorbing the weight or that Gregor was right if he said the same thing. One or two slight rebends is normal. Three or four is not. In this gif he kinda goes one past normal where the bar is already steady and hes still sliiiightly rebending.

The ideal movement which is a straight line. No humans need be harmed in the execution of an equation defining physical work.. The ideal movement adjusted for the lifter which will vary but have various commonalities.. Thats it.An added source of hilarity is that every elite lifter in the world is doing something that makes a coachs eye twitch. Maybe thats the thing that is actually the ideal movement for them or perhaps its a bad habit theyve never broken.Theres no way to know and basing technique on cargo culting and hero worship is not going to take a lifter very far.,weightlifting,cmrbo6m,2,t5_2rlwc

2580953,0,t1_cmveh4t,Definitely agreed though I still think its still a good post. Its important to be able to set proper shortterm and mediumterm goals and not get hung up on numbers that take a career to reach if ever.To expand on the point you raised I dont think PEDs or even giving people every last little detail they need is what sets us so far behind. Even if Chinas government is literally going around picking kids based on anthropometrics for their sports the fact is theyre picking the best they can find out of a HUGE talent pool. And even when there isnt a statesponsored entity involved weightlifting is still very popular in the countries that are significantly ahead of us.Its NOT popular in the U.S. not yet and its not the fault of football or baseball or hockey or any other professional sport.Its our own fault.Its our fault that we havent spread the word far and wide that we havent built enough local or scholastic programs and that we havent recruited enough kids. Up until  or so years ago few people outside of the weightlifting community knew what a snatch or clean was. Over the net ten years we got universities and professional teams into it but still nobody else and those people were already dedicated to other sports at high levels.No it wasnt until the last five years or so that weightlifting started to become visible. And it had nothing to do with any changes in pro sports.Seriously guys like Chad and Kendrick came out of a talent pool of fewer than three thousand USAW members. Not  young kids or  active and serious athletes  total NGB membership. They are pretty freaking incredible athletes but theyre also big fish in a tiny pond.Most likely early next year were going to hit  members. Thats over six times as many people as we had half a decade ago and nearly all of them are way too new to have had enough time to develop near their potential. Our youth rate is growing but not fast enough because there were just so few of them before. And yet surprise the level of lifting in this country is surging ahead. Not yet too fast at the very top as expected but enough that your average collegiate athlete cant just mosey on into Nationals after a single local meet and enough to push up our expectations of Olympic slots.The difficult thing to accept is just how talented most of these top lifters really are. Ilya Ilyin is not a one in a thousand guy nor a one in a hundred thousand guy hes one in well over a million. We would need  times as many athletes before we should even hope to have someone with his genetic caliber and work ethic show up. Olympic medalists in this sport are at least one in a hundred thousand if not many hundreds of thousands and weve been trying to get there with a tiny fraction of that. It wasnt going to happen.There is probably nothing more helpful you I or any of us could do for the sport than trying to get more people in. This is the sole reason I ever even made this account on reddit.We should be aware that PEDs are being used and actively working to better the situation but theres much more corruption out there than were prepared to deal with. It would be better if we spent our time on things that were constructive than bitching about things outside of our control.,weightlifting,cmvguj7,24,t5_2rlwc
2594645,0,t3_2pjbvk,The problem is youre over pulling and then diving under. You need an active pull under the bar ie a better third pull..the cue that works for me on this is stay connected to the bar. After you finish instead of dropping under the bar and waiting for it to come down you should be using your arms to pull yourself TO the bar. Then the elbows come around in the rack position as the bar meets your chest.,weightlifting,cmx99og,2,t5_2rlwc

Write down the date you hit  if thats important to you. But rushing things to hit an arbitrary number at an arbitrary date wont help you out in the long run thats for certain.

2658641,0,t3_2qav2h,Id think that long femurs AND arms offset each other. If your femurs are long compared to your arms your hips will be high. If your arms are long compared to your femurs your hips will be low. The combination of both should offset.The only real issue would be if your radius and ulna bones are long compared to your humerus bones. Then youd have to take a wide grip on the barbell in the front rack. This is the case with me. In a stacked arm front rack position my fingers are over the tops of my shoulders which preclude a normal front rack. I need to take a wider grip which can be an issue because this produces a moment torque on the elbow in this position. Sometimes I get some tendonitis flaring up.,weightlifting,cn5m33w,1,t5_2rlwc

3440514,0,t3_2zn3o4,Generally pulling position and receiving position have different feet widths but like everything else in this sport there are exceptions. The point of nohookfeet lifts is to pull with the feet in the receiving position in a way that you dont pick up your feet very much. It forces you to pull the bar effectively and finish your pulls.

Klokov for examples dips kinda deep but Lidia Valentin dips shallow..Dip however deep you can maintain tightness and a straight back angle Id say. The Chinese exercise where they rack a massive amount of weights in the rack position Liao Hui does kg Xiaojun does kg is an excellent exercise to train remaining composed under a very high force on the shoulders and neck. Physics tell us when driving the bar upwards the force on your shoulder is the weight of the bar PLUS your acceleration.. So its one thing to be able to front squat your jerk PR but you also have to be able to comfortably control it in every moment of the lift.

A lot of people in this thread are going for the classic oh but its just human nature or its her fault tropes that perpetuate said attitudes. Some examples from this thread. At least Klokov can lift no homo. Ok shes a fine lifter. But shes not a competitive lifter on the international stage she is a best a good recreational lifterintermediate competitive lifter. translation she has no right to complain about people sexualizing her because its her only claim to fame. She has good points and frankly I cant imagine what its like to be a female celebrity of any kind and not have thick callused skin to absorb the ugly end of attention. translation she should get thicker skinits her fault for feeling offended. I just think this popular hyperequality endeavor has diminishing returns. Women are the holders of sexual capital in our species because of the way we evolved not because of sexism. Its going to take a looooong time for people to stop attaching physical attractiveness to a females identity in the same way that people attach resources to a males identity. translation its how we evolved we are not responsible for sexualizing women. Lets not bring this feministtard drivel in here. yup. All of paulypants comments which essentially state that she should not have a public IG account if she does not want to be sexualized and that sexual comments are basically human naturedoubling up on the its her fault trope.

Leering catcalling assault etc are all results of this attitude. Yes people who do this are assholes  lacking a filter. However the sexism part is the culture that allows this to continue  blames the victim for it happening  saying the woman should be grateful for the attention etc. People are attracted to other people and that is fine no changing that.

4225217,0,t3_3996hy,The two main things that I see are  Youre taking the bar around your knees. This is pulling you forward so when you extend the bar is rebounding off your body and bouncing out.Work to get your shins vertical while keeping your back angle relative to the floor static. This will build a solid foundation for your lift and you will be moving your legs around the bar instead of the other way around.  Once you clear your shins make sure youre covering the bar. This means your shoulders are fully over the bar and the bar isnt just hanging down. Practice this with controlled movements snatch grip DLs snatch pulls or just a bar warmup that retraces the path. The key to successfully covering the bar is lat engagement. While youre doing this make sure you feel the weight staying in the center of your feet. We dont want toes or heels up at anytime other than extension.Covering the bar will help keep it closer to your body and also help avoid that rebound youre getting after your pull.  and  together should help tighten things up for you since the whole point is to maximize efficiency as much as possible.

4358856,0,t3_3axnol,I have a bunch of them for my home gym. They are very very bouncy. I only have lb plates I dont even know if you can get kg and the s will bounce all the way back up to your waist if you drop them from overhead. They fit pretty snug and in fact are a little tough to get on and off of my Werksan bar sometimes especially the small ones as they just flex. If you plan to keep them in your garage then try and keep the inserts oiled just a little in order to keep them from getting tarnished and rusty. They will slide on and off your bar much easier that way anyway. I also use them as pulling blocks and they hold up well to that abuse as well. Because they are so thick they actually stack pretty high and I dont have to get out as many plates in order to reach the desired height. Im not sure how accurate the weight or diameter is but if I has to guess Id say that are a hair smaller in diameter than others. In the end if you are on a really tight budget and its the most you could afford then they are just fine but there are better options out there for a little bit extra money and if I had to do it all over again Id buy myself some higher quality plates. Thats not to say Im unhappy with them but nicer plates are nicer. Haha.Edit I forgot to mention I have had them for over  years and they have shown almost no sign of wear and tear. Even the inserts have held up well and none of them are loose. They are plenty durable for garage gym use.,weightlifting,csgz5gf,5,t5_2rlwc
4362572,0,t1_cshbw8u,It will take time.  Dont get discouraged The first time I had a serious bicep impingement it took me a good  months to get everything outta there and return to pain free full mobility and strength. Now when it does get inflamed it doesnt take over a few days to max of  weeks to return as I continually take care of it.  If you are still getting that burning sensation when lifting take some time off. It sucks but get your mobility first vs forcing your body to do stuff it cant handle.   Try increasing your subacromial space. Lacrosse ball in your armpit and just leave it there as you do flexion through the shoulder while squeezing the arm into your body as much as possible.    Other general tips Strengthen your external rotators your shoulders may already naturally be in internal rotation so that may be a contributing factor YTIs serratus anterior strengthening etc.    Stretch out your tension areas.

I really liked it but as another poster said it does take a while used to take me at least . hours per workout even without resting excessively.My tip for running this program would be to only increase the working weights once you can perform  good sets with a given weight  its easy to get greedy and move up next workout even though you missed one or two reps or had a couple of sketchy training makes amongst the good reps. Because youre going pretty heavy singles and doubles and its fairly high volume its easy to pick up little injuries if you push the weight too much which will only hold you back in the long run.  ,weightlifting,ct2pe9m,1,t5_2rlwc

4798766,0,t3_3gma37,Mostly good stuff man.  If you are nailing your knee the bar is traveling TOO close to the shin. For you I would recommend setting up with the bar a few centimeters away from your shin to provide a better trajectory that wont hit your knee.  The bar path would then travel slightly back towards you from the floor to the knee rather than a straight vertical line.  End result should be the same position above the knee but with no contact. In addition make sure you are sweeping your knees back which it looks like you are anyway. ,weightlifting,ctzf9gq,2,t5_2rlwc

The school essentially doesnt give anything to me other than time in the varsity weightroom to coach these people. If you have a weight room and the means to train the lifts there really isnt a reason for your school to get involved initially. What you need to do is take control of what you want organize training gather people make meetings program coach or find someone who is competent in those areas and create chatter at the school. Hold fundraiser competitions make tshirts. You can become a viable team without your schools involvement.

As a beginner almost everything is a weakness which is only natural but can be overwhelming. Especially when receiving new advice between reps. But I think it can still apply. If I visualize failure my chances of failing are so much higher. I always visualize the feeling of failure of the weight surprising me with how heavy it is and screwing up my pull.

6287467,0,t3_41oey5,gtDo you guys think that every world class lifter that havent been busted by WADA is on juice?So heres something to consider. WADA is the parent organization established by the International Olympic Committee. They set the rules standards and policies that are to be followed. Testing but enforcement is largely up to the affiliated organizations and National AntiDoping Organizations NADOs WADA does test the compliance of these affiliated organizations and can suspend or remove offending organizationsIts these offending organizations that are the point. NADOs can say whatever they want and its only if WADA comes in and finds theyre out of compliance that anything is publicly called into question. But in the cast of WADA suspending RUSADA that only came after an independent commisison launched an investigation and that IC investigation was only launched in response to the German broadcaster ARDs documentary The Secrets of Doping How Russia makes its winnersOverall I think USADA is performing its stated goal in a strict manner especially when you look at how poor most of our olympic athletes are. These are not people who can afford to bribe someone. Most of them work just enough to afford a roof over their head and food in their belly. They certainly arent receiving any support from the USOC who uses only about . of their total budget on direct athlete funding If this were to be distributed evenly across the  atheletes currently listed on Team USA that would be  per athelete per year. Now unless the USOC is using some part of the other . of their budget M to bribe USADA to let athletes dope its not happening.,weightlifting,cz4bbf1,4,t5_2rlwc

6954109,0,t3_4axdqz,As you know I was adamantly against using a belt for a long time but have since progressed to one on heavy pulls cleans and squats. My take away is that it provides a support structure that is very useful for the clean and jerk but wont make you weaker in the long run for beltless work. I really only use belts for heavy singles and heavy percentages on feel could be as low at  could be as high as  depending on how Im feeling that day. I can still do anything beltless I was able to do before but the belt has made a noticeable effect on my jerk. ,weightlifting,d14kxdd,4,t5_2rlwc

7026424,0,t1_d1csbk9,In the past few months of beta testers the feedback we have gotten has been great The zippers are robust yet when you wear the sleeves you do not feel them most popular concern  As you can see by the CRSBR data sheet CR has better hardness density elongation as well as teartensile strength. Those who compared to Rehband say it has more support although ours is currently mm and comparable to SBDs. However I want to point out that SBDs are undersized which most often times gives the illusion of tighter support. They also have more levels of sizes as well. They go from XS to XL  ELEVEN sizes in total compared to other brands of  maybe . So already you are comparing apples to oranges. All in all the bottom line is the zippers are absolutely more convenient to use daily in the gym without having to struggle each time and taking shoes off. As for support it is comparable in sizing with other brands. But the biggest difference is the quality of the material in terms of durability and performance. Cost difference and typical use should speak for itself. Theres absolutely a reason mousepad and beer koozie companies use SBR and medical device companies use CR. Rehband SBD Slingshot Rocktape TK etc  if the logo was not famous I guarantee you wouldnt be able to tell the difference between  and  that are all over alibaba.com. How? I have SEEN the same sleeves come off the assembly line one batch going to generic packages and another batch off the same line going to be stamped with the logo of a brand I just mentioned above.

7532337,0,t1_d2ybiid,Are you talking about Sinclair totals? There are some meets where winners are determined that way most notably the Arnold. But the Sinclair coefficient had nothing to do with the selection criteria for the Olympic team. USAW created three different paths to becoming part of the Olympic team. Jenny Arthur was selected through Path  and was locked onto the team before Trials. The two remaining spots on the womens team were determined at Trials through Path  which was based on what USAW calls an Ability to Medal Standard ATM. The USAW Athlete Selection Procedures for Rio states that the ATM Standard for each body weight category will be determined by averaging the third place totals in that body weight category from the  World Championships  Olympic Games  World Championships  World Championships and  World Championships. The two athletes who totaled the highest percentage of the ATM for their weight classes would be selected as part of the Olympic team. Sara Robles previously totaled . of the ATM for the  kilo class so even though she didnt post a total tonight if no ones ATM  was higher she would still have been ranked  on the team. Morghan King is a goddam champion and actually beat Robles ATM  with her  kilo total bumping Robles from second place to third. Mattie Rogers could have bumped Robles from the team entirely if she would have lifted  kilos which is precisely why she took a heroic  kg jump from  to  on her last lift. Unfortunately she wasnt able to clean that weight. Sorry for the long answer to a short question. ,weightlifting,d2ye1hq,15,t5_2rlwc

Repeating pure snatches and clean amp jerks are obviously important at this stage but for me I can rush through or forget different aspects of the lift. Complexes help me to execute said aspects with performance checkpoints hows my balance? Where on my foot is my weight concentrated? Is my chest up? Lays tight? Shoulder over the bar? Etc. Basically it helps me become less sloppy more disciplined. My coach programmed complexes as the only lift for the day repeated with heavier weights as needed. Helped me PR both lifts in the same week!In any case I love complexes. Theyre fun useful and do a great job of making you appear to know what youre doing. EDIT Heres the complexes my coach gave to meMiller Bar Complex I use this to warm up amp get reacquainted with the bar.

7633259,0,t1_d39ot21,The bar speed increases throughout the movement except for a very short portion which tends to be as the bar passes the lifters knees that was in other papers I believe hes written dont have it handy right now. In the case of the two graphs in the paper I linked that bar speed makes up about half of the maximum achieved speed. That is very significant.It has been said by some that relative peak speed can be used as a predictor of success or failure and also that the absolute bar speed a lifter can achieve can help predict that lifters potential. Its hard to back that up with sources but heres one The speed of the barbell diminishes proportional to the increase in its weight and correspondingly the relative height of the lift diminishes. So one of the most important tasks in lifting a limit weight is to achieve the necessary speed of movement and consequently sufficient height of the lift. ... Speed is of the highest importance for the snatch where the speed of the barbell reaches   . msec with limit weights. Speed is a little less important for the clean and jerk where the maximum barbell speed reaches .  . msec.As for selection bias I am not claiming that you personally have it. I am claiming your method of collecting data has it. Specifically its biased towards people who post their lifts from the blocks. A lifter who is not as good from the blocks is less likely to post their lifts from that position.What happened to all the elite lifters for whom you couldnt find video from the blocks? I cant find any for Lu Xiaojun for example nor can I think of any examples of Chinese lifters lifting more from the blocks than from the floor. Do you discard them from the sample? If so thats an absolute selection bias but I would argue given that they post their best lifts from the floor that if they dont post better lifts from the blocks then theyre not lifting better from the blocks.What about Kendrick Farris? I can find no videos of him lifting as much from the blocks as he has from the floor. What about the rest of the mens Pan Am Team? Norik Vardanian he snatched  in Armenia but did more from the floor at the time Caine Wilkes James Tatum Wes Kitts Travis Cooper and Donovan Ford? For how many of them can you find higher lifts off the blocks than they have done from the floor? What about the womens Olympic team? I believe Jenny Arthur can do more from the low blocks but not Sarah Robles or Morghan King. Sarah has cleaned at least  from the floor and Morghan at least  but I cant find any evidence theyve done anything like that from the blocks.There appear to be plenty of examples of lifters who almost certainly are better from the floor.,weightlifting,d39uytz,1,t5_2rlwc

As for the aforementioned restrictions I wouldnt expect the need to lower the bar into the rack position after a lift to affect the lift itself in any way.

L My daughter was  months old but I couldnt come home as I was preparing for the world championships and she only saw me through videos. There was so much I wanted to say express about how much I missed home. Reporter Did your family watch your performance on TV?L Yes they did live. My daughter sat right before the TV in front of my wife. As soon as I appeared she screamed Papa! Papa! and was mimicking me with her own bamboo stick Reporter With his daughter lifting  kg easily with him no wonder L Xiaojun appears the happiest hes ever been L It really has been a big change for me. Before  I was single. After  I got married had a daughter and established a family. Such a goal of human life was accomplished now comes the responsibility of how to support my family for them to live happier by the day and for my child to have a joyful upbringing. Reporter Last year a lot has changed and a lot has yet to change. Under the strong hands of his masseur we can see under his smile the more familiar L Xiaojun wincing in pain. L With regards to my family and my age my strength has not left me but I do take a while longer to recover. I have to deal preemptively with recovery. Others may take a month to recover while I take two months so I do have to make adjustments in training. Reporter Training has not changed much L lifts heavy barbells every day. What has changed is L training sharper and more attentively. Weightlifting like kung fu requires a savvy grasp of the discipline. Only few people can spend decades training two movements. The yearold L Xiaojun remains the master of  kg weightlifting. But even this master has experienced slipups as in last years world championships. L I train with great confidence with the conviction that I am number one in the  kg class. Even in competition I believe I am number one. But in competition I am facing a mental battle. In last years world championships we lost both myself and Tian Tao. Even Tian Tao lifted excellently in training and thought yeah yeah Im the best Im gonna go break that record whatever haha. Under the pressure of competition the result of our complacency was such. Reporter This Aprils national championships were also the Olympic trials. L Xiaojun wasted no energy. As long as he is focused it leaves his competition with little chance of winning. He even went on to break his own total record. L My mind was there from the moment I got out of bed. The only thing I thought about was weightlifting. If the mind is serious the bar will feel light. If not it will be very heavy.

8061218,0,t1_d4lg1py,Yes absolutely differs person to person. Some people you dont want or need them over thinking whats happening. They dont need all the details just an idea or cue to fix whats happening. Really depends on their learning style and what exactly the problem is in the moment that day.Is it that the athlete simply has no understanding of what theyre doing? maybe thats a good time to explain the concepts behind what youre trying to get them to accomplish. If they have a good understanding of the goal for instance in oly lifting it is to create the the straightest most efficient bar path. All your cues stem from helping make that bar path more efficient. i can speak from my experience that when Im personally being coached Im no longer in a place where I need an explanation of why im changing my start position I just need to know what the fault is knees too far forward and what the correct position is. ,weightlifting,d4m5n3g,1,t5_2rlwc

8278745,0,t3_4stixi,The thing with knee pain is it can come from so many different things. First and foremast replacing the weights under your heels with some real weightlifting shoes should help. Also make sure you are warming up your hamstrings quads hips calves and even lower back adequately as knee pain can originate from any of those. For warming up I suggest doing the couch stretch that Kelly Starrett likes that does wonders for my quads and plenty of foam rolling. Obviously diet plays a part in all of this too as well as hydration. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water!!! Fish oil glucosamine might help as well. Oh also make sure you are getting plenty of sleep and dont forget rest days!,weightlifting,d5ceh8d,2,t5_2rlwc

8283125,0,t3_4sug6s,As has been pointed out some Soviet coaches Roman for eg would shy away from pulls at least for beginners. But others Medvedyev for eg pencil them in from day . I think its just which book you read fromwhich legendary coach or better yet scientist is speaking. I do think its really a matter of preference so long as youre doing them with light enough weight to keep near perfect form and just as important mocking your lifting tempo. Theyre also very good for those that bend their arms during the pull excluding those who for some reason insist on hip cleaning teaching them to keep their arms extended throughout until the top of the pull. But if youre a newbie wanting to develop more pulling strength I think snatchclean deadlifts are far superior to pulls. Im no coach nor a biomechanist nor a kineseologist ... eg so please consult those experts but Im pretty sure the number one objective of beginnersintermediates is to perfect their technique while building strength is secondary. Hence as Boblaire says why not just spend more time on the lifts themselves? Why not do an extra  sets of snatches power or classical for eg instead of  sets of pulls? Especially when you not advanced enough to get the most out of them? If you have clear deficiencies that can be alleviated through the use of pulls then add them. Dont rush it youll be much happier in the end. Just my  cents.,weightlifting,d5cy7i5,1,t5_2rlwc

This is also okay.With heavy weight you would have to begin the pressing phase of the lift with your elbows below shoulder height.

When you are done with the removal of the rust there should be no rust on the bar. The next step is to prevent rust from attacking the bar in the future. This is where the in oil comes in. If you regularly clean the bar when you are done with your sessions with a heavy cleaner you may need to oil down the bar after the sanitation step you adding.

9146071,0,t1_d8b11oa,I know what you mean. Being able to lift like this in a commercial gym either way is pretty fortunate. My gym actually had a couple of trainers with great backgrounds one a great powerlifter the other a very accomplished football player and I made friends with them and they always supported me re other managers since they knew Im respectful and a decent human. Management wasnt good to them so they along with another trainer into bodybuilding moved to other gyms. Talented motivating people its a shame. Management usually doesnt bother me but when it happened only once so far in the couple years Ive been there it was a relatively new manager who took umbrage at someone doing something different  this person was later fired for other reasons shortly after. Apart from those trainers theres actually a good amount of powerlifters current and oldtimers that are there sometimes and we all like watching each other lift some of them even have Louie Simmons contact info because theyre buds and have lifted together. I like to think that if youve spent serious time in the weight room whatever your discipline the weights humble you into having two pretty good characteristics respecting the equipment and respecting others who put in that much effort into their discipline whatever it is. Its like the Eleiko saying on those shirts Set your bar high be kind and do more of what makes you stronger. Good things usually follow.,weightlifting,d8bbwix,2,t5_2rlwc

There are some pretty helpful stretches to get your back more neutral the easiest one is to simply lay on the floor with a foam roller at your lumbar region and tenserelax for several reps until your ass and shoulders are both touching the floor may take a few weeks or more.

IF youre  and never done these movements or anything even remotely close to them then you have to understand that youre not lifting to get strong at least at first but rather youre using the snatch and CampJ as remedial motions to improve your body mechanics movement patterns and mobility. Which means you need to train like someone whos starting from behind and having to work hard just to get to the starting line. DOnt jump in and start training the way athletes train if youre not an athlete. Olympic lifting requires ridiculous general physical preparedness and unless youve ever intentionally done GPP for these purposes then you dont have that preparedness and will need to work hard to get it. As a yearold mobility will be your first and only priority for probably  years. After that you may be able to start pushing some weight. IF you can stomach that go for it dude.

9945755,0,t3_5hxwa1,Hey guys I had a few people comment who were upset that I was lifting. I pulled  times that day and was recording a few videos that featured USAW former and current athletes. USAW gave me a pass to have access to the warm up room training hall and close to platforms so that I could record and create content as it further promotes the sport event and athletes. We were training on Saturday evening when most competitors were finished. I checked on the hall a few times throughout the day and there were definitely times where it would have been inappropriate to take up space. This was not one of them.

If they see any downward movement they will grab the bar and lift it up. In this video he dumps the bar before the spotters even have a chance to help. This is illegal in all powerlifting feds and worthy of disqualification.

10441684,0,t3_5pjj1i,Summary is As a crossfitter he prefers the Nike romaleo s with the soft sole insert because of its light weight and he does not like the higher heel of other shoes for functional fitnessNike romaleos  has mm heel mm up from IIsReebok Legacy have mm heelLeistung IIs have a  inch heel.The heaviest most stable shoe was found to be the Legacy and the lightest was the romaleos The romaleos were very similar to the adipowers so if you are a powerlifter or weightlifter he does not advise upgrading due to the only main difference being the weight of the shoeAdd on to the comments if I missed anything important but I feel like this review was x as long as it should have been and almost lacked any new ground breaking infoLoved the video footage of the shoes thoughOne thing I would add about the legacys is that the quality of material is very high and durable. I have had mine for a month and the laces dont ware easily the ankletsend of shoe lace things are a hard plastic and will not damage easily as opposed to the metcon laces that fell off within  months for me. The loop that the straps go through is metal which means it should last. The romaleos  someone said used plastic that seemed flimsy and would possibly break soon.Leistungs have the boa lace system and I have no idea how that worksOverall if you want a higher heel upgrade to legacy or leistungRomaleos s is mainly for looks imo,weightlifting,dcrn6xd,9,t5_2rlwc

10448495,0,t1_dcse2j4,I believe olympic weightlifting is more beneficial to any sport than powerlifting. Dont get me wrong powerlifting does have the same effect and will improve you at other sports but it doesnt build explosiveness like weightlifting.Weightlifting is an olympic sport for a reason and powerlifting is not even on an international scale like weightlifting otherwise countries and governments would be funding it.What I meant by easier was that weightlifting training compared to powerlifting training is much more complex. There are much more exercises involved with training the technical lifts rather than just pull or push this bar up and down with raw strength. Just because you are strong doesnt make you a good weightlifter but if you are strong chances are youll do okay at powerlifting.,weightlifting,dcsfgka,1,t5_2rlwc

Hence simply jumping onto a box from standstill partial or even full squat is not truly plyometric because there was no rapid loadingstretchingthencontracting.  For something where there is  a rapid loadingstretchingthencontracting series see this piece on the depth jumpOddly enough the guy giving the example is wearing a California Strength tshirt.  The idea is to spend as little time at the bottom as possible i.e. training a morerapid stretchthencontraction series or minimize the amortization period between loading and contraction.  Other plyometric exercises that might a big might have some application to increasing WL power are bounding one or two legs bounding up stairs hurdle hopping and so forth.,weightlifting,dd64u36,2,t5_2rlwc

Depending on the amount of weight on the bar and the bar used whip may be negligible. To say nothing of the fact that as soon as the weight has gone from static to moving upwards the difference no longer matters as there will be flex in the bar either way. If the point is to reinforce good positions that effect can be achieved from blocks or stairs or hang and only one of those puts you at risk of destroying your bar. ,weightlifting,de5zz0v,1,t5_2rlwc

11280760,0,t3_60zily,Rebend of the knees just before full extension or double knee bend is excellent technique. Seriously. Pretty much all elite lifters to varying degrees do it on both snatch and cleans. Not sure why you would think otherwise. Go check out hookgrips slow mo vids. In every lifter after the bar passes the knees as the hips move forwards and up the knees also shift forwards which causes this slight rebend before triple extension. If you dont have it then its a problem. However it should be a unconscious action you dont exactly consciously rebend it happens as a consequence of good body mechanics.Visually he looks like he has excellent technique great extension good contact with the bar everything. And the huge amount he is lifting backs that up as well as being an Olympic gold medalist.There are some lifters who lift heavy with very odd technique but this guy isnt one of them.,weightlifting,dfanop1,1,t5_2rlwc

I finish it with cardio everyday and core every other day. Whats great is that it prioritizes strength training because its the first thing you do then later on with a metcon it becomes all about work capacity.
