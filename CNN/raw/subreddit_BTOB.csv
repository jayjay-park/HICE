9519142,0,t3_5b7cz9,What am I most excited about? Ummm everything tbh.

Imma buy it and not regret it for an INSTANT.,BTOB,d9mfqpq,3,t5_35wyu
9707897,0,t3_5e4u05,Oh yay ok this is a nice thing for Mondays!This week is Thanksgiving here which is nice because we get some time off and  lbr any time I dont have to work a full week is great.The only downside though is though I dont know an exact delivery date because I dont have a package tracking number my copy of New Men should be arriving soonish and I just realized delivery might be delayed because of the holiday weekend. ....I am bad at patience I want to get my grubby little hands on it now.Anyway. BTOB continue to be THE BEST KIDS it sounds hyperbolic to say everything they do is amazing but....everything they do is amazing what can I say. Sometimes I think back on the time when I thought I didnt want or need to get into BTOB aka The Biggest Mistake I Have Ever Made In My Entire Life its a good thing I saw the error of my ways and made it here. THE BEST KIDS!!!!!! ,BTOB,da9pg7r,4,t5_35wyu
11015609,0,t1_deezluy,Im still not sold on the green. Its better here than on the album cover for sure probably because they took the green of one photoshoot and the photos of another. The colours of these ones were chosen and edited to compliment the green but the others were all neutral tones. Dont mix them guys seriouslyyy.Deep green is ambition jealous and greed but the photos are going for a whimisical Alice in Wonderland thing it doesnt add up.Theres this dissonance between the concept and colour theory. I guess they were kind of going with that billiard table shade of green for old money vintage decadence? But then the costuming and styling doesnt reflect that! It just leaves me confused about what theyre trying to tell me!,BTOB,degl6w7,1,t5_35wyu

11429336,0,t1_dfr6n1j,Yeah I totally get that I dont watch the really long streams either. Ive watched one or two back in Pray time but now I cant justify that expense of time. Oh man! Im gonna wait for all the episodes to be subbed and then binge the shit out of Peniel and Sungjaes stint. I love how they always pull background music from the artists that came along! They did it when Changsub went to Mongolia too. ,BTOB,dfri4ag,2,t5_35wyu
11461265,0,t1_dfusgyz,Thanks! Im going to Spain Im very excited. I always wanted to travel more but never actually made it happen but now I decided enough is enough Im going. Travel and kpop is what my spending money goes to recently.,BTOB,dfv4l4a,1,t5_35wyu
