280795,0,t1_cf9uyea,I must not understand your question. You asked Why do some people prefer the DC model? Prefer it to what? A manual safety?,ruger,cf9v8g6,2,t5_2sv6i
920793,0,t1_ch8xy5x,yeah theyve got me oncall now and this isnt the safest of towns. still theyve been awesome to me not gonna complain that they want me to be safe,ruger,ch8y7qe,1,t5_2sv6i
1001092,0,t1_chi2hq8,The camo is called Kryptek and I assumed you did it yourself. Thats not factory right?! I dont see it on the Ruger site but on a side note this one  is. Kinda odd. But love the Kryptec.,ruger,chi2yq3,1,t5_2sv6i
1225626,0,t3_284267,Bersa Thunder. Period. Check it out.,ruger,ci7i1v8,3,t5_2sv6i
1275957,0,t1_chix4yq,Turners down here has the  SS GP for .  I feel like thats a rip off.,ruger,cid5v4j,1,t5_2sv6i
1823855,0,t3_2e4jiu,Yep purchased one about a week ago and have fired about  rounds through it. I absolutely love the new trigger system and it being striker fired. My local gun shop had me test the LC against the LCs and its an amazing improvement in my opinion. I would definitely pick one up if I were you.,ruger,ck8yq63,1,t5_2sv6i
1870910,0,t1_ckehv5r,I agree.  I read nothing but amazing things about those sr.  I want one.  I saw a while back there were some going for  shipped.  A heck of a deal.  I am a little wary about the MIM parts present but I think for the price and a couple upgrades over time it would be a bulletproof pistol.  It definitely beats the crap out of the Tisa RIA which are nice enough and even the Remington. ,ruger,ckemz85,2,t5_2sv6i
2013524,0,t3_2hsnlm,I kinda like it if I wasnt saving for an SR right now Id totally buy one,ruger,ckvtrbw,2,t5_2sv6i
2217331,0,t3_2kiqdc,For the LCP or SR purchased since August I believe. ,ruger,clloce6,3,t5_2sv6i
2325748,0,t1_clyqevg,I got a GP I want to put a kit in. However a full trigger job requires polishing by someone that knows that theyre doing. Let me tell you though shooting a revolver doubleaction is a bit different than shooting a semiauto. Your trigger control is gonna get a workout. It took me forever to get where I am now on my factory trigger and I still slow as fuck. But at least Im accurate and consistent.  ,ruger,clz6cjx,1,t5_2sv6i
2489137,0,t1_cmjgpd7,Yeah its starting to feel like cleaning my vote is doing nothing at all.. The NC is an auto on and off model. I hate that with out the optic cover I cant turn it off. Its also self adjusting so I can not choose the brightness. Battery dies fairly fast. Sometimes doesnt hold it zero. And the dot is pretty blurryskewed. Fine for general targeting but not very precise at all. Have an aimpoint pro on my DDM and this thing feels like a toy next to that. Haha. Get what you pay for...,ruger,cmjgvjq,1,t5_2sv6i
2628069,0,t3_2pzvnv,Well executed mods not my cup of tea but still well done.  ,ruger,cn1mh46,7,t5_2sv6i
2687236,0,t1_cn8z6df,Im read about the hogue grip some how much thicker does it make the gun?,ruger,cn9cazm,1,t5_2sv6i
2693324,0,t1_cmjebrk,Above you mention that its best with high bolt thrust from the suppressor and below that you havent replaced the extractor spring. It sounds like your extractor isnt getting a good bite on the rim causing it to slip and mess up the cycling. Try this.,ruger,cna4xmw,1,t5_2sv6i
2751124,0,t3_2qz2dc,Sweet! Black coffee tho. I have the Ruger LCs. Wheres the lettering on your slide? Nice pic.,ruger,cngsi40,1,t5_2sv6i

3175731,0,t3_2we1x1,Great gun.  Shoots well shoots anything never had a single misfeed.,ruger,cor5w94,2,t5_2sv6i

5933687,0,t1_cxwa6mr,I forgot to post an update!So I called Ruger and they had us send in the gun along with all the mags. I shipped it on a Monday they got it Wednesday morning they shipped it back Wednesday afternoon we got it back on Friday with the problem resolved.What is weird is that on the service performed slip they showed repairing one magazine and replacing the barrel. We had the problem with a total of three different magazines. All Ruger OEM mags. So I dont know if maybe the mag that shipped with it somehow damaged the mag release and they didnt list that on the service slip or what but the problem is pretty much fixed.It still takes the right pressure point but we can get the mags to drop from the well reliably now.,ruger,cxxfqi1,1,t5_2sv6i
6272858,0,t1_cyvrm82,I have a sightmark branded version of yours although red only. Works awesome on my buckmark. ,ruger,cz2niwk,1,t5_2sv6i
6580531,0,t3_41va06,My wife is looking at a LCS. I was talking to a Gander Mountain employee today and they said they have been having a lot of issues lately. Any feedback on the pistol?,ruger,czzzbab,1,t5_2sv6i
8771531,0,t1_d70s8ai,Yes I really like the simplicity and clean lines. No frills dependable supposedly accurate as hell. And its not really too heavy....  oz I think. A little less than an SR which was another consideration.,ruger,d723v5s,1,t5_2sv6i
10517754,0,t3_5qlrln,Great review. I carry mine every day. It took a couple years to realize it isnt the kick its the muzzle flip that is a pain. Really holding it tight helps control the flip. ,ruger,dd0au7y,1,t5_2sv6i
10870530,0,t1_de119sw,Oh nice! Good find,ruger,de17uiw,2,t5_2sv6i
10903262,0,t3_5vsmua,Depends where you are in relation to them but Ive seen Ruger American Rifles come back in under a week.  Go out on monday and be back by like thursday.,ruger,de4le54,1,t5_2sv6i
10937445,0,t1_de7wn22,Personally I think going with the bolt action as a first rifle is smart. Learning on a bolt teaches you to make your shots count and theres something immensely satisfying about working one. ,ruger,de84d0d,2,t5_2sv6i
11430377,0,t3_635d5m,All semiauto handguns do that. The magazines follower is designed to keep the slide stop pushed up when the mag is empty so the slide will stay back. Youll probably notice too that when you release the slide stop with an empty magazine its much harder to do. That is also normal. ,ruger,dfrmdff,2,t5_2sv6i
11449054,0,t3_63f19o,Are the magazines significantly longer than needed for .? Does the magazine well have extra space or a block to shorten it?If the answer is no to both questions then a short action rifle mag will never fit into that lower. ,ruger,dftqo99,2,t5_2sv6i
