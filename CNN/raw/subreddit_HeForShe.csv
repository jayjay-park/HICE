2066910,0,t3_2igm8k,I agree completely. I joined this movement and this subreddit so that my views and solutions could be heard critisized and worked on to create something better. All it seems to be is a debate about the movement. We need to stop arguing about how we are going about it and actually try and make some change. One of the major issues seems to be the word Feminism Men are feeling hurt scared fearful marginalized and unequal all because of that word and how it has been used. On a literal standpoint there is nothing wrong with the word but the way it is viewed and used is wrong. I guess the main question is what can we do to make it a better word what can we do to stop the negative image it holds?I always thought this subreddit was for members of heforshe to get together and explore ideas and options to make gender equality feasable. Instead I find myself having to defend the movement and try and explain the good behind it. Personally my solution for this subreddit would be more rules of posting. Deleting posts that blatently attack feminism and the members of HeforShe. Focusing more on what we can do as a community. What we can do to expand out small community with active members that have a passion for gender equality. Maybe as a community we shouldnt be getting dragged into the pits of hate speaches everyone gives to our name but instead forcus on doing positive things to gender equality to show that its not all bad and we are doing something good. Instead of just arguing over it just showing them the good we want to achieve.,HeForShe,cl2jt59,2,t5_33o7v
