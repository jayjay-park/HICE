263592,0,t1_cf82f1j,Backdoor into the server itself to modify the code or XSSCSRF attack?  The actual code is backed into an SVN server and svnsynced to a secondary server.  If there were any changes to the framework a new update would appear in the log and using diff the changes are easily caught.However to even modify the code which even the webserver has no write access to the framework a privileged user access is required.  If the server was hacked with privileged userroot access I doubt any service has any great protection against that beyond preventative measures.  If a hacker had full access and was not after the Bitcoins they could modify the code and steal messages for a short period of time.However if an administrator allowed the server to be compromised to that extent it wouldnt make a difference if you used AutoPGP or not.  Even without AutoPGP if a server was hacked with that level of access the hacker could easily take control of the accounts change all the public keys to ones they have private keys to then send a message to members telling them they changed their public keys.If this is the case there is no such market with a message system that is  protected.  At least in my case all past messages are encrypted.  A member doesnt have to think back and wonder if a purchase they made three weeks ago may get them arrested.  This is called risk analysis and mitigation.I ask you now how does any marketserver prevent impersonation if it was compromised at the privileged userroot level?If you have time please email me at BlackBankmailtor.com as I would like to further discuss security and ways to improve the system.,BlackBank,cf82wtj,1,t5_306hx

3977339,0,t3_35muy4,Calis product is very good especially considering the price. I have never used any other BB vendor for LSD besides them but the two times I have ordered from Cali the product has arrived exactly  days after I placed the order. The time for accepting the order was on the first order one day and on the second order two days.,BlackBank,cr9nf3b,1,t5_306hx

4103895,0,t3_376mfu,MrDoe  As best I can tell there is still a positive balance in my bitcoin wallet.  Since you work for MDParity isnt there someone you can contact to determine if he is alright?  He could be ill dead arrested or worse?  The DarkMarket community has for the most part shown support for Blackbank and its efforts.  Even a quick note would be appreciated.  Thanks...,BlackBank,cro2hqb,1,t5_306hx
