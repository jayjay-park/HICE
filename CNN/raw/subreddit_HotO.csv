At least they were sympathetic enough to her to promise not to tell the authorities about her. She walked down to a tavern by the docks that she had heard was frequented by pirates. maybe they go to the same place? She didnt want her people to go into a life of crime but it was still safer than staying in Dasso.   A glass of water please. She sat at the bar with her head low both to hide her face and because she was feeling down on herself. Thankfully water was free here. She had two glasses before she felt a shiver up her spine.   Has anyone noticed Ive been moistening my skin? she thought.   She glanced behind her and went to a booth further back closer to the exit. If she was being watched she would notice them following her.,HotO,dd3epn5,1,t5_2yr0r
