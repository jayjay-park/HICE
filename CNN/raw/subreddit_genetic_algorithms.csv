1318814,0,t1_cihuckn,Haha excellent. I love being wrong because it just generated two ideas. I get what you mean now. I remember seeing some of that in the Karl Sims videos. Just bookmarked the link. Totally watching this. Thanks dude!,genetic_algorithms,cihzf1v,1,t5_2qpmn

6601010,0,t1_d021p56,yes! I cant give a detailed answer now I will tonight but. I start with an initial fitness at .. When I start with . initial fitness it takes about  generations to get to . at  bit length and  pop.. I dont know what rate is.. The best parents are fitted together e.g. A amp B C amp D E amp F etc. Each parent pair produces  children. So a pop of   killed  remain. The  survivors produce  children so pop goes back to .I will try the zipper method you mentioned tonight.,genetic_algorithms,d023k8y,1,t5_2qpmn
7638069,0,t3_4izc7j,The exact term you are looking is estimation of distribution algorithms or  more generally modelbased search methods and they are currently one of the most important and actively studied areas in the research community. The bestknown examples are the covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy CMAES the Bayesian optimization algorithm BOA and learnable evolution models LEM which is based on decision trees.,genetic_algorithms,d3aem4w,2,t5_2qpmn
8424148,0,t3_4v03nr,Genetic algorithm is an optimisation algo. Its not a crystal ball. A Naive Bayes classifier would do just fine or any other classifier or a recommendation algo. Theres no sin in applying the appropriate algo for the task.,genetic_algorithms,d5uk6dt,6,t5_2qpmn
8426065,0,t3_4v03nr,You mean you would give someones exam result into an algorithm and the algorithm decides if the person is to  to pursue a degree?I dont think you would be able to achieve this with genetic algorithms if that was your question. ,genetic_algorithms,d5ussmv,2,t5_2qpmn
10254437,0,t1_dc45lpr,actually that is a good idea! if i have a chance i would love too and also... should i start learning python or some other programming? i already learned some basic html but nothing else,genetic_algorithms,dc6eaae,2,t5_2qpmn
