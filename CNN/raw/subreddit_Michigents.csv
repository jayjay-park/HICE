2360982,0,t3_2memed,Wow you werent kidding. Weedmaps shows barely anything in SW MI I guess that shows the difference between the SE and SW sides of the state. Over here theres a ton of dispensaries.Good luck on your hunt.,Michigents,cm3j0ov,1,t5_2tnu7

4349084,0,t1_csfip3b,Yeah no kidding. It looks like Class C local and Class B state misdemeanors in Michigan have a maximum  fine andor  days in jail with amounts ultimately decided by the judge at sentencing. I cant find anything that provides guidance on typical sentences except that a common sentence for firsttime DUI is a day jail sentence that is fully suspended as long as the accused completes all other terms DUI classes dont get arrested for a year pay your fines etc. If DUI gets a suspended  days I cant imagine that marijuana possession in a decriminalized municipality would garner much of a jail sentence if any but I guess theres nothing literally preventing the full day sentence. Hmm. Certainly food for thought and fodder for future legislative action.,Michigents,csfvgvt,1,t5_2tnu7

9034288,0,t3_53z3gv,Is it stated anywhere how many licenses will be issued for growing dispensaries etc? Eg.  per county or  for the whole state? Those numbers are arbitrary.,Michigents,d7xs14o,3,t5_2tnu7
9245828,0,t1_d8nymc2,You didnt need to remove your post Im sorry if I implied that. There has been quite a few subs shut down over the years for a few different reasons. I highly highly doubt theyd come after a sub with less than k subscribers but I dont want to put the sub or the general publics ability to view the sub at risk.,Michigents,d8nz5hg,1,t5_2tnu7
9310318,0,t3_57z5wa,Well to grow in the state you need a Michigan Marijuana card which lets you have a maximum of  plants and have   oz. of weed.  You can be a caregiver and grow  plants for each patient.  You can have  patients but I still wouldnt count of not getting busted unless you are very very discreet. If you live in a weed friendly area such as Ann Arbor you are better off.,Michigents,d8w5g5v,5,t5_2tnu7

11255082,0,t1_df7fwhb,I just dont want to go around Detroit. Im right in between the two. As far as that big post it was made over a year ago and a lot of the pricing has changed and a lot of places have been shut down. They seemed to recommend natures Answer in wensdays specifically. ,Michigents,df7qvw8,0,t5_2tnu7
11475591,0,t1_dfwqgh7,Haha clearly..... Im looking for real events not something that would be shutdown by police. Like a medical cannabis cup for example but that isnt until June. ,Michigents,dfwr5er,2,t5_2tnu7
