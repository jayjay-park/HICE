The nurse walks by and says oh shes wet. She handed me a diaper and walked away. Babies are pretty resilent so try not to be too afraid to drive in and care for your child. You also should talk with your wife about your feelings because you shouldnt hold this in just to yourself. ,Dads,dcyhym7,1,t5_2r5qi
