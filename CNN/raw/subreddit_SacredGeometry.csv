3097364,0,t3_2vmfd9,Nature uses it because its the most productive way with the least effort. A tree grows its branches within these ratios to allow it to grow amazingly high and still be stable. Flowers use it to fit the most amount if petals and still capture as much sunlight as possible with each. Animals such as nautilus shells and big horn sheep also use it to stay balanced and not have to learn to re balance as they grow. As you can see Nature uses it for a reason its the Devine blue print. Beyond that we humans tend to find these proportions as beautiful. The Greeks are known for their beautiful sculptures and architecture and thats due to the knowledge they had in these proportions. Music also uses it to great effect. Were now discovering that the universe uses it to in the way planets rotate around the suns  and the spirals of galaxys. Sacred geometry is important because you can use it to create things of beauty if youre into art. You can use it to create highly efficient and proportionate things if youre an engineer. You can also use it to understand how other things in nature work or were created and this fix them maybe in medicine. Either way there is a strong emphasis on the word create it creation. But heres the TLDR. Its  a way for a creation of any form to be both highly efficient and beautiful. The Devine CREATOR uses it for a reason and maybe we as reflections of it should use it more.Edit.

5556902,0,t1_cwlv6sd,OK I understood most of what you wrote. I am working on a d platformer game called Fibonacci Mountain  very early build ignore the crazy textures lol. You have to climb to the top back to the bottom and solve stuff along the way. The mountain is literally the Fibonacci sequence. The top is roughly  feet  UnityD units above the start.,SacredGeometry,cwlvv1t,2,t5_2s60u
5807709,0,t1_cxgy65v,Same here bud Im still undecided whether or not the patterns and ratios which have been turned into symbols and given mythological importance are actually such. But I think the duality that is inherent to sacred geometry the idea that unplanned nature is composed of such precise and particular patterns so perfectly embodies one of the most essential parts of being alive balancing yourself and your place in everything. So keeping that in mind is more of what I am getting at than even putting little patterns into random aspects of your life. You are no more and no less than anyone else and if you live your life that way you will have a good one ,SacredGeometry,cxh0203,2,t5_2s60u
6361695,0,t1_czcqlo5,If I showed you the ability to derive mass from considerations of the vacuum energy density alone via an information style approach that works on both hadronic particles and cosmological black holes what then?gtThe question of the nature of absolute and relative frames of space time and motion forms the basis of Newtons work in The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy as the opening discussion of the book. This question is also relevant to Einsteins theories of motion occurring at or close to the speed of light hence the appellation relative in relativity theory. As we have seen Newton described a fundamentally absolute frame of space and time in which an objects motion was absolute or independent of its orientation relative to other objects.gtgtNewton illustrated this concept in the Principia with an example of a bucket filled with water and suspended by a rope from the ceiling. If the rope were to be turned until it was sufficiently twisted and then released the rapid spinning motion of the bucket would impart to the water a centrifugal force that would cause it to pull away from the center of the axis of rotation imparting a concave curve to the surface. Newton asserted that this motion of the water would be completely independent of any other bodies apart from the bucket the rope and the water  it was a closed system. Ernst Mach a th century physicist and philosopher pointed out that it was not a closed system as the Earths gravitational force on the water and the bucket were certainly important factors and hence the motion of the water could never be considered independently of the other objects around it.gtgtIndeed Mach asserted that the waters motion could only be defined relative to all other objects in the Universe. This has since become known as the Bucket argument and Machs principle. Machs principle first stated by George Berkeley nearly  years before Mach is the assertion that the inertial reaction forces experienced by massive objects when they are accelerated by external forces are generated by the action of chiefly the most distant matter in the cosmos. Since the only known force with universal coupling to mass is gravity it is natural to assume that if the principle is correct the gravitational interaction is the source of inertial reaction forces. This is in fact true in general relativity theory for the class of cosmological models thought to encompass our reality. Machs principle was in fact a major influence on the work of Einstein and even modern day physicists for if we apply Machs principle to the effect of matter on space and time then it will be seen that matter curves spacetime much like the water in the bucket due to the force of spin a fact elucidating the equivalence of gravitational forces with acceleration and hence space and time are not independent of the matter occupying it.gtgtHowever the work of the physicist and mathematician Kurt Gdel in  in which he introduced a new solution to Einsteins equations showed that Machs principle was not completely incorporated into the theory of general relativity. Kurt Gdel introduced a model in which the Universe was rotating and contained timelike curves that loop back on themselves essentially allowing for travel back in time. A rotating Universe does define a preferred direction of motion and hence the motion of objects within the Universe are not entirely relative only to other objects as there is now a kind of absolute frame of reference although they are still relative to the observers motion.gtgtEven with a rotating Universe it appears that Newtons conception of an absolute space must be forgone as the latest measurements from experiments such as Gravity Probe B have demonstrated the validity of a theory known as the LenseThirring effect also known as framedragging or gravitomagnetism. Gravity Probe B demonstrated that as the Earth rotates it twists or drags the local vicinity of spacetime along with it and as such the motions of objects in the vicinity of Earth will be influenced by the Earths spin. An amazing example of this is in the vicinity of a black hole. Black holes must have an incredible rate of spin which produces what is known as an ergosphere around the black hole. Within the ergosphere the LenseThirring effect causes such a high degree of torque that spacetime is dragged in the direction of the spin of the black hole at a velocity greater than the local speed of light relative to the rest of the Universe. This means that in order for an object within the ergosphere to appear at rest to an external observer it would have to travel in the opposite direction of the framedragging at a velocity greater than the speed of light.,SacredGeometry,czcr5ls,-1,t5_2s60u

I discussed how i could get such a piece done though multiple sessions and this tattoo was the result  hours later. Ill be sure to give an update when i get more work on it. ,SacredGeometry,ddxx5t7,2,t5_2s60u
