6234177,0,t1_cyy71bs,Olivers arrogance quickly turned into panic. The Hyper Mega launcher did not work like expected and now it was broken making sure he could try again. Well the launcher is the biggest threat I have so it makes sense for them to take it out of commission. Oliver wouldve stepped back to think up a new plan but the chainsaw that appeared out of nowhere took priority. SHIT! Where did he pull that from!? As Oliver threw the ruined Mega Launcher in the path of the immediate threat the Zetas sensors picked up the Astray moving around to a flanking position. The ground his greatest ally in other suits was becoming a hell of teeth and fire. I need to get in the air. Oliver fired his vulcans at the cloaked suits cameras and boosted backwards and up pulling away from the treeline. ,BFS_RP,cyy9aua,1,t5_3bdqq

6444452,0,t1_czlsa06,Well thats was clever. Ezekiel saw the extra beam saber before it was anywhere near him. Though noticing Alicias shrilled cry. He didnt try to dodge. Most people would have lost here. So I will do the same. BATTLE ENDEDYou got me Alicia! Nice work! Ezekiel laughs. That was very clever. I should have been able to dodge it. You really surprised me there. Ezekiel looks towards the professor. Looks like she is going to stop us here soon. Lets take a break and cool off.,BFS_RP,czlwa1x,1,t5_3bdqq
6469107,0,t1_czog3lb,The confidence.. I cant tell if she is underestimating me or if she really doesnt want to battle. Awesome. Ezekiels face lit up due to the acceptance of his challenge. They proceeded to walk over the simulator. Well since I offered the challenge you can set up the damage level and map.,BFS_RP,czog9lt,1,t5_3bdqq

6513727,0,t1_czt1vsu,The Astray stood its ground and blade pulled backwards ready to swing with everything it had. The moment the Nu got in range she swung. The blade was longer then the combat knife and it now had both arms supporting it. The swing was swift as a flash as the eyes of the Astray and its pilot lit up once more. Static clouded both fighters view. But she knew what would happen. The skill gap was too obvious even for her arrogant pride.Im sorry Lufia. We arent good enough. Im sorry. A smirk showed on her face But at least we had fun right? A single tear fell from her right eye as the light faded from it. The static was gone from her head. She was silent.,BFS_RP,czt2jfm,1,t5_3bdqq
6550430,0,t1_czwrpb6,Lufia stood there for a moment as she collected herself. She stood like a statue for almost a full minute before taking off her scarf and hat throwing them casually on the ground near Ezekiel. She then took and unzipped the blue jacket and dropped it on top of her hat and scarf. Underneath was a simple black sleeveless shirt.Gimme a second. Lufia let out a deep breath as she dropped down and started doing pushups. Sorry about this. This is the fastest way for me to get calmed down. She continued until she had done  reps and then she jumped up and punched the air in front of her. Well I feel better now! Sorry about blowing up back there I didnt hurt her feelings did I? She was your friend right?,BFS_RP,czwv9tv,1,t5_3bdqq
7040282,0,t1_d1eajj5,Gunia hummed a tune as he kept piloting his gunpla through the debris field using them as a cover little did he know his enemy had formed a plan with his allies. Lacking knowledge on it he still gazed backwards to see if it is keeping up it was but at a slower pace. The equipment he had carried for heavy concordances had more mass in space thus making him a bit slower.He doesnt even seem like hes trying...? Gunia idly stated to himself as he looked forward ahead of himself and then he took note of another ally Overburden heading down in his general direction. What th?His cockpit immediately brightens with a yellow and warning signs. OH SHIT! He looked around to locate the source of the danger Leo. He gazed behind him seeing that Kai already proceeded to fire his explosives. A trap!? His brain fired so many thoughts and clicked into place. Time to get serious! He gripped his grill and slammed it down. His face completely shadowed allowing his optics to flare green.BOOM!A sonic boom of Plavsky particles emerged as God Buster jettisoned forward dancing around the debris barely crashing into them with incredible speed. His cockpit turned alive with the crosshair blaring loudly as it moved back and forth indicating the locations of debris in the next few nanosecond just enough for him to dodge. And then his cockpit blared loudly as OverBurden got into his sights he tackled OverBurden and whizzed away orange bloom of giant explosion occured behind him and exponentially rose in size. Flames and debris licking away at God Busters feet as it drew closer and then it finally came to a halt and slowly died down.Ill get us to a safe location hang on! He told the pilot within OverBurden as he continued to zip through the debris field with incredible speed. He immediately picked up his sword alongside the way and then hovered near a giant debris giant enough to hold few gunplas. God Buster pivoted his body forward to land on it and then lets go of OverBurden.Okay clearly we need to work together.... got any ideas? He asked as he pats on his armor attempting to cool down his hot armor to preserve it. His cockpit finally died down as Gunia cuts the system early to preserve the remaining energy. Once doing so he examines his sword seeing that it is moderately damaged from the explosion earlier.,BFS_RP,d1edfg6,1,t5_3bdqq
7046347,0,t1_d1f1k0g,The Resonances particles grew more intense and bright as the two struggled. Interesting though not good enough. The palm of the black and white Gundam made headway. Cracks began to show on the arm of the Adamant before it shattered completely.,BFS_RP,d1f27yd,1,t5_3bdqq
7109813,0,t1_d1lof4p,Alright lets see what we can do about those beam cannons on the arms first Muro thought to himself. As the beams came darting around he dodged with swift rolling movements until he was about a few inches away from the FA Hazel G. Now to start the show Muro thought to himself as he activated the Self Imagine system. He then made a phantom plavsky clone of the CrystalSelf in his current position then immediately backed up a bit midway through his fast approach toward the enemy Mobile Suit. He then boosted upwards into the air whilst keeping an eye on the plavsky clone. The beams then connected with the facade of the CrystalSelf and Muro in response made it look like it the beams had destroyed his machine by imagining the plavsky phantom blowing up and the Self Imagine SI system responded likewise. The FA Hazel G then lowered its defenses confused from what happened. Looks like he may have taken the bait Muro thought as he quickly and discreetly boosted around to the backside of the FA Hazel G.,BFS_RP,d1ma1i2,1,t5_3bdqq
7528981,0,t1_d2xzs9n,Low music played as Fang and Alicia sat inside the Dominari hall space. He sat in a comfortable leather chair nippers gently clicking as they sliced through the thin polystyrene gates. She replaced on a lounging chair eyes closed as the curious sounds of the Gorillazs first  album gently throbbed through oversized headphones. The pair had swiftly become good acquaintances upon the formation of a team and Fangs relatively roomy dormitory room seemed luxurious in comparison to the somewhat dingy spaces of the Meijins Mark. The two were so engrossed in their music infact that they didnt react as the sirens blared out overhead. Wordlessly they continued on in their leisurely activities Alicia flicking over to Clint Eastwood as the album continued. Whilst gunfire flashed and smoke arose through the building it was almost as if the pair were in another world. But soon they were wrenched out as Alicias phone began to vibrate.Text Alert.. she murmered reading the words on screen. Shelter in dorm.. Gunman currently occupying.. Oh shit man.. Fang. Look at this. Fear scarred itself over Jackdaws face as she held the message upwards to her friend. Is this a joke? Are they.. Oh God. With her headphones removed Alicia could tell that this was no joke. The occasional morose bang sounded in the distance. Gunfire? Explosions?Well.. Weve gotta stay here. Thats what the message says. the purplehaired builder said though horror was swiftly taking its hold in her throat. What would people raid an Academy for? Let alone one for Gunpla Builders. Maybe the Plavsky Particles.. There was a knock at the door. Bang. Bang. Bang.,BFS_RP,d2y0bay,2,t5_3bdqq
7751901,0,t1_d3nau64,Alarms in Ezekiels cockpit blared loudly. Beam rounds flew towards the Apex as it reached the edge of the blizzard. The sun seeming to refresh the suit. The blue sky a welcome sight compared to the whiteness of the snowy wind. Ezekiel wasnt the only one to reach the edge however. A Kyrios Raider and Zeta Gundam all in their transformed modes flew out of the blizzard leaving a trail of white behind them.,BFS_RP,d3nc0ij,1,t5_3bdqq

Requesting permission to retreat. He let out a deep breath and stood his Zaku up Yeah Mercer our job here is done well grab the trailer and head back to  base. As he made his way back to the trailer he was smiling as he thought about his new recruits first mission and how well she had performed he flicked on the radio one more time to call out to the young girl behind him You did good on your first sortie Mercer Im glad to have you in the nd.,BFS_RP,d4p7rxt,1,t5_3bdqq
8590742,0,t1_d6fcner,Johannes turned his head. His GM Raids sensors detected three mobile suits entering the area. Theres some Minovsky interference though its not too strong. Is there a Gaw? Lieutenant Stark this is Johannes. Theres three blips nearby in addition to a likely Gaw. Im going to investigate. Johannes moved quickly his machine much more agile and wellequipped for this terrain than his old Spartan. He put a hand to his waist where he had mounted the heat sword dropped by the Efreet as the intelligence division had called it. As he moved behind a rock formation he raised his shotgun readying it as he caught sight of the three blue suits. He stopped for a second. That suit I recognize it. The lines are different than they were back then but its totally the same machine. Did they release an upgraded version?,BFS_RP,d6ffkzs,1,t5_3bdqq
8794694,0,t1_d74zbub,Not exactly. Johannes had a stoic look on his face. Apparently the situation in America is getting worse while the situation here is getting a bit better. Because of that theyve decided to shift military personnel away from the North African theater to reinforce the North American theater. And long story short theyre sending me Harper and Browning to Canada.,BFS_RP,d7504hm,1,t5_3bdqq
8887608,0,t1_d7g50pp,Silver was quite surprised as her target failed to appear where she had been expecting him. She looked around bewildered as to where he had gone before the unmistakable noise of destruction came blasting through her cockpits speakers. She looked around quickly not wanting to be caught unawares and quickly saw the cause. A small hole had been blown through the building behind where she was standing and risking a peek into the hole her eyes widened at the sight in front of her.It seemed that in an attempt to end their chase Jet had tried to shoot straight through the building but didnt QUITE have the power to make it happen. She quickly retreated deciding to continue the chase rather than keep looking through the hole like an idiot.Jeez...must be desperate to burn an attack like that without knowing itd work or not...,BFS_RP,d7g5y1d,2,t5_3bdqq
10571659,0,t1_dd60nnz,This was proving quite the tricky battle the enemy flitting about everywhere like an overcharged hummingbird. Momiji could only hold the shield up looking for an opening any opening. She got it soon enough when the GNM moved for an overhead attack letting her block only for it to suddenly turn the blunt end hurtling for her chest. She tried smashing down the shield hoping to slash away as it crashed into the MkII.As it recoiled from the hit it tried to stabilise by planting its feet on the ground and falling a little offbalance from her missing left foot. Before she could stumble its mighty thrusters burned harder than ever before shooting it straight into the sky Momiji seizing an opporrtunity to slash at Micah as she flew.,BFS_RP,dd6dtrq,1,t5_3bdqq
10718777,0,t1_ddkd1d8,No need for hesitation the ace said wallking over to a nearby bench and sitting down Youre free to do what you please.DaYeong nodded moving over to Clara who had a rather wide selection of clothes for her by that point.Here Luv the raven haired woman said as soon as she noticed her from behind the veritable mountain of clothes she was carrying There are some changing rooms over there lets see how these sit on you.DaYeong nodded and followed the woman to the aforementioned changing rooms where Clara immediately had her begin to try on sets clothes after clothes.At first she really couldnt understand the point what was there to be gained by all these? None of them really had much of an effect beyond looking different that is and it seemed like it would just never end. However as she reached what must have been the thousandth set of clothes she realized she had been thinking wrong  what if there really wasnt any actual reason to it? She had to admit of course that as they looked at the various strange and outlandish styles that Clara had her try on they had shared a few giggles a few laughs sometimes even to the point of Clara doubling over with laughter  leaving DaYeong with only the heat of her blushing and apprehension before looking into the mirror and joining her.,BFS_RP,ddlk99n,1,t5_3bdqq
10967683,0,t1_de9ystd,Damn! Micah cursed as her spear broke. Part of her plan had been to hang on to it for a bit longer and keep a bit more distance in this fight but Rays ability to move in and out of range would make the long weapon mostly useless. Instead of backing away the Chariotte grasped the two parts of its broken weapon and drove the metal rods into the Gerwulfs torso as the machine prepared its followup attack.,BFS_RP,deb8m6y,1,t5_3bdqq
11437075,0,t1_dfsab02,With his opponent beaten Dan breathed a sigh of relief allowing a small smile to creep up on his face. It was a difficult battle but it was probably the most fun hed had in a while! Still there was the rest of his team to worry about. Off in the distance he heard the sounds of gunshots being fired off in the direction of Davids Graze. However instead of charging in blindly Dan took a deep breath and took note of the area and caught a flash of something on his sensors. Frowning he zoomed in and caught sight of a small floating object.A drone...? he muttered frowning.So thats how the Deathscythe had been able to fool him. It made sense if the Deathscythe employed tricks like that it made sense that the other enemies would too. Now that he knew what to look for it wasnt long before he found other ones as well. Moving into the forest to find some cover he leveled his Beam Smartgun and sniped at what drones he could find lances of pinkish white energy streaking through the forest to hit their intended targets.One.Two.Three.Four.A thought had occurred to him after hed fired his shots and tentatively tried the comms again.Doppelt this is Jaeger do you read me over?,BFS_RP,dfsdqnc,1,t5_3bdqq
11736457,0,t1_dgq883q,For once Samuel didnt have a damned thing to say. This was the path that he had chosen and it was the one he was going to follow to the end. He hadnt had the balls to put in his team coat instead he wore and expensive blue shirt unbuttoned to about mid chest and black dress pants. His long black hair had been tied back for once and propped up inside his helmet. Samuel tried not to think about it too much. What was happening right in front of him would play out in one of two way. Either he helped Alicia in what she needed to do and smash out the supports that Build Fighters had elevated itself with these past few years. The game would become darker and more about tactics and trench fighting and hoping not to catch a stray bullet. That was all well and good. Until the Gunpla that he held in his hands at that very moment he hadnt built anything that Mr. Rigby would have frowned upon. This Gundam had been built for a very specific reason and he would be damned if he didnt break it out at least once.On the other hand maybe the other teams would unite and succeed in stopping them. Nothing would change and everyone but Neo Nemesis got to have that feel good moment. It was certainly more boring. Sam ended up liking the idea of being plunged back down into ground level combat so he amped himself up and placed his Gunpla.Duality Gundam. Lets dance!The Mobile suit launched from the tunnel and fell into positing right behind Alicias own Suit. The triple GN drives glowed with a black light on the back of his suit and they carried him with ease keeping pace with the incredible output of Sparrows psycho thrusters.,BFS_RP,dgqcv80,1,t5_3bdqq

11798681,0,t1_dgwywam,Hm? You make it sound like it wont be an easy task... Kyle frowned when he lowered his hand to his hips as he watches him walk off to meet with someone in another department. He turned to the rest of his squad mates and then finally broke the ice So who is into some metal songs? He took out a recorder presumably that plays the song for him. Anyone? No? Not even a bit? He frowns once more as he watches his comrades disperse to gather their things for their first deployment. He lets out a light sigh and pockets his recorder into his pocket One day... Ill find someone who would love same songs as I do. He muttered to himself as he walked off toward his station.ampnbspAt the moment when he arrived he looked upwardly toward his mobile suit. A recently customized Zaku III. It is colored in black and white upon his request. It carried the standard issue of arsenal that is provided for every Zaku III minus sub arm for a shotgun. It also contained two extra propellant tanks for extended flight within air or space travel. I hope you can hold out as well as I did in the simulation... a lot of folks told me that simulation is like an actual battle... not even close...ampnbspHe looked to his left as a mechanic had floated down to meet with him he gave them a short nod Shes ready? He got a validating gesture from the mechanic for a goahead. He bent his knees slightly and kicked off the ground as he floated toward his monochromatic ZakuIII.,BFS_RP,dgxf64r,1,t5_3bdqq
