1551725,0,t1_cjarxqw,wonders what the stadium toilets were like just after the gameI feel like an undeserved beer.  Hmm.Best I attend to this want.  Perhaps have a game of eight ball too.Did gardening today shovel and wheelbarrow work not as a feeble attempt to justify having a beer more like a random brain malfunction which drove me outdoors.  Is a good day.  Still sore from gym last night trainer has us outside on an oval doing boot camp.  I am the weakest link.  Its cold and dark at pm when we start the grass wet and we go crawling over it pretend commando style.I prefer the cosiness of a gym.  Or a pub.  Although publicans get worried when you crawl around the floor.Enough of my jibber jabber.  To The Terminus I proceed to brave horrors unknown.  Cheers. ,newscape,cjas686,2,t5_2z6ih
