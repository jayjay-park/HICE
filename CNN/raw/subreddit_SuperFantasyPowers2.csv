3309903,0,t1_cp5gxl0,Then war should be defined in a way that there is no doubt about it complete with an example what is war and what isnt. Could perhaps divide it into aggressive events like raids if the nation utilises them and conflict the actual wars. Id personally suggest the following in terms of what defines a war which is somewhat based on my own perception of fair combined with some influence from CK Casus Belli There must be a valid Casus Belli to attack other nations and start a war the nation that declared war that does not have a valid CB loses Karma a currency of sorts which Ill talk about in a bit and the CB is considered to be Causeless War. The following CBs exist  Preemptive strike CB Nation A uses an obvious act of aggression on Nation B like Groldun did on Boldon even if it was through trickery Nation B declares Preemptive strike CB.  Alliance CB Nation A is allied with nation B nation B is attacked by nation C so nation A declares war on nation B. Note that this means Nation A is now war leader of the AB alliance so A decides when to surrenderforce C to formally submit. More on war leader later.         This is the only CB that can be used if an ally wishes to join their ally in their war note that this also means that the alliance must be publically known to actually use this CB.          Note that to use this CB when the ally is the agressor the alliance document must state that an ally can join regardless of whether one is the agressor or the defender.  Spoilsofwar CB Nation A is not allied with nation B nation B is attacked by nation C. Nation B sends a call to nearby nations to join him this will allow Nation A to answer Nation Bs call to war without being allied. Nation B loses Karma because of this regardless of the outcome. Nation B becomes war leader however nation A is allowed to pull out at every moment.         Note that nation C can also call forth nearby nations to join him and the same will apply nation C the caller will lose karma but if nation A answers the agressive call they automatically lose karma as well. Nation C becomes war leader however nation A is allowed to pull out at every moment.  Causeless CB Nation A has no reason to attack Nation B but does so regardless due to lack of reason why the war started Nation A has no right to call their allies forward even if the alliance includes agressive support nation A will also lose karma regardless of outcome.          other nations are allowed to join Nation A but like Nation A they will lose Karma.           Nations that support Nation B the nation that was attacked without reason as well as nation B themselves will gain Karma regardless of the end result.  ClaimbyTreaty CB Nation A and nation B both desire the same thing and have done so publically for example they both claim the same piece of land. Because of this nation A attacks nation B to force them to give up their claim. No karma is gained unless the defender wins.       This CB does not allow the winner to annex lands or demand anything else that has nothing to do with the treaty.       Note that the winner can force the signing of a new treaty on the loser if the loser agrees. Not signing a new treaty means the CB remains applicable until either a new treaty is signed or the treaty is considered invalid.       This CB does not apply to nations that have more than four ? provinces within the claimed area the Nation must have atleast eight provinces in total for this CB to be applicable.       Any nation that exists only within the borders of an official claimed expansion is immune to this CB to aid new nations or nations that wish to remain small.  Holy War CB Nation A is a nation wellknown for its fervent believe in its religion nation B is a nation that holds a different religion than Nation A. Nation A declares a holy war on nation B to save the minorities of the true faith within nation B. No karma is gained unless the defender wins.       can not be used by atheistic nations.       both nations must share a common border or be only a single water tile away and the provinces fought over must be along this border.       annexation that follows from this can not exceed a total of three provinces or more than k in population unless its a single province.       only nations with a similar faith can join on the attackers side no nations with a similar faith as the attacker can join nation B.       Crusaders can eventually exist maybe?And some more CBs like Embargo LowKarma Protector amp Reclaim exist as well but Im getting tired and Ill probably type this all out for nothing since its probably too complicated.  Peace treaties Terms are limited to what the CB claims or allows you cant force the other nation to convert to your religion or culture if you used a ClaimbyTreaty CB for example or annex an enemy provinces if using an Embargo CB. Additional terms added cost additional karma which are initially taken away from the karma gained by the winner but since additional terms will quite quickly outweigh the gained karma from war you will eventually find yourself losing karma you had before you were considered having won the war.  Ceasefire Once a war has been fought the nations involved whether they were the initial nations or joined in have a ceasefire with the other side. This CF will last four years  weeks the only way the nations involved might end up fighting oneanother again is if both end up supporting a different side in a war neither have started. It is impossible to not have a CF after a war.  Exodus A nation might opt to flee rather than fight regardless of the wars intention this will put the nation into a state of refuge a large portion of the nations population and events will be lost forever but a part of them will escape either with help of nearby nations like what happened with Couverne or they flee to new lands nearby. Will have to work out the range somehow though. Note that depending on the CB nations can also force another nation into Exodus.  Karma a currency of sorts that is given to a player nation if they do certain things like win wars with the proper CB gaining glory or remain in peace for a certain amount of time or through an event however the mods decide how much Karma to give or take regardless of actioneventwhatever and keep track of the total karma all players have. It. allows the player to give to other players or buy a small boon for themselves for the right amount of Karma including        a forced reroll for small events like single spectacle fights the best one counts raids etc.. Battles between armies are not applicable.       a single additional event in the week.       the Gods Grace CB which allows the conquest of a single province or up to k population in provinces.       a rank increase for the population of a province up to the k rank.       cultural conversion of a single province       and many more things that I cant think of but are all smallflavoralfair.  Warleader if all nations would force their demands during peace negotiations it would become a chaotic affair. As such the first two nations the attacker and defender respectively that were part of the conflict are considered the Warleaders they are the ones whom negotiate for the ultimate peace other nations that have joined may advice their Warleader or ask a term to be added to the peace agreement but it are the Warleaders that ultimately accept the proposal. A warleader can make a different nation on their side Warleader if they wish but are in no obligation to do so.I probably spend way too much time on this.,SuperFantasyPowers2,cp5k1g6,2,t5_37a62
