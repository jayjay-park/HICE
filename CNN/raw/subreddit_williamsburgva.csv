7286153,0,t3_4f39i7,Roads are in good shape. People drive slowly downtown but at  mph on nearby i. Yes there is a weekly farmers market as well as random craft markets around Aromas.Id say the Sentara medical network might be the top employer for your wife Ive visited a few of their campi. Nice little system they have.My internet provider is Cox and the quality is excellent.Its telling that I havent even thought about parks because the whole city Williamsburg proper that is is very leafy green and pedestrian friendly. For example there are walking trails just outside our apartment and walking to the grocery storepost officelibrary is pleasant. If you have a bike you might not even have to drive much.I went to the college ten years ago and decided to move back because the area is really nice.,williamsburgva,d26dxkk,2,t5_2wet7
