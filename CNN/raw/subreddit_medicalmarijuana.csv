If you actually have Rhabdomyolysis it can cause kidney damage and eventually kidney failure especially if you have any other health issues or are dehydrated. I actually just saw an episode about Rhabdomyolysis on The Doctors last week and it can kill people if left untreated.  Heres a link to the clip from The Doctors Amy Purdys New Health Scare Heres a link to a People clip about it Amy Purdy Hospitalized After Developing Very Serious Condition Rhabdomyolysis Listen to Your Body,medicalmarijuana,ddbo6zj,5,t5_2rld3
