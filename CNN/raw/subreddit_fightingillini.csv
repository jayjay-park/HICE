1650862,0,t1_cjn7cf1,I was predicting that too but now Im starting to fear that the offense will struggle with the QB transition and the defense wont improve much at all. We could end up about the same as last year.Then again everything may click and the team could pull out some wins that nobody expects. I do think last years team had a lot of heart and toughness. They never gave up on games or the season. That attitude will be helpful in gutting out some wins.,fightingillini,cjn96hk,0,t5_2tgju
