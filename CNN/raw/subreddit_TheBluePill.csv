96138,0,t3_1v6s5d,The whole issue with your post is that your perception about human interaction and maletofemale interaction is very skewed.gt We are human we make mistakes and we get disqualified for traps setThe thing you have to understand is that every human male or female has expectations and standards and will look for them in the partner and will try to figure out if they meet those expectations prior to investing too much time and effort with them. This is not unique to women dude. If I was a crazy bitch in the dating phase of my relationship you think my boyfriend would be with me? Some failures of displaying key standards are forgivable and some are not. And what was forgivable yesterday may not be tomorrow or may not be with Person B even though it was for Person A. Human behavior is highly complex. People are just trying to do the best they can given that they dont know the future. Sometimes they get it right and sometimes theyre wrong but at least they are trying.The other thing you seem to ignore is that rejection is a part of dating and women do get rejected also. Men have standards too. It is not the end of the world. To get so caught up on being rejected means that you are insecure and dont see the value in yourself. I know I am a valuable person and have security and confidence in that and still understand that not every single male on this planet will go out with me. Its ok to be rejected.gt Youve made us at your will to do your bidding because you know our strong desire to procreate is the primary motivation in our life.This is just warped. First off sex is the most naturally pleasurable thing that both men and women can do and sex drives exist in both. So both have motivations to find a partner to have sex with. But most healthy adjusted people have other motivations in life as well and dont let their entire world center on when their private parts will meet someone elses private parts. Perhaps you are confusing being nice and bonding with doing bidding and thats your problem. In reality both partners attract each other and form a twoway bond and both do things for each other to show affection. If you find this difficultwork then the issue is with you. Its really not hard for the average person male or female.gt It wasnt like every women was engaging in healthy sexual relationships with men and then trp just showed upThats because shitty people exist. But the thing you are ignoring is the potential for men to be shitty as well. You think most women here or anywhere havent dated a really really shitty or several shitty guys? I have. And yet here I am not hating all of malekind.Dude life is shitty and unfair. Not due to women but thats just how life is. People get screwed over. If you are a weak person you succumb to these events. If youre not you have your moment of ragedepression and then pick yourself up and move on. For every TRP who got screwed over by a woman there is a woman who got screwed over by a man. TRP just chose to deal with in an unhealthy way that keeps them from moving forward. Thats on them.gt women started using sex to control men men started using techniques to avoid submission.What youre describing there isnt the average relationship. If this is the norm for you I have to question what youre doing wrong or what kind of partners you keep choosing because something is off.Maybe you see being nice to someone as workeffort that deserves an end prize. Dude niceness is an average human trait. Ive met thousands of nice people. I dont need to fuck every single one of them just because they are nice. You have to stop looking at bondingnicenessattention as means to an end. They are enjoyable in their own right and shouldnt be work. Perhaps if you stop treating them as such you would realize that women arent actually trying to control you through their vagina. That maybe simply they have tastespreferences that you cant always meet just by being nice.gt where the older woman was talking about how she was hot and hated on and now shes old and undesirable and wish she had not been foolish.If there is one thing to take away from my response its dont let confirmation bias rule you. Read a bunch of scenarios rather than ones that agree with your preexisting beliefs.gt How could we ever learn to value you as a human being love and cherish all your positive qualities a d have a deep concern about our futures together if you hold sex over our head like a carrot to a bunnyHow could you ever truly love or value someone if you see any effort exerted to be nice to them as a gateway to their pussy?Heres another tip women have a radar. You know how TRP says supplicating betas dont get women? Desperate men dont get women? This is absolutely true but not because of what TRP says. Its because we dont trust desperate men. Because desperate men will saydo anything to get what they want and we dont trust them to truly care about us. We trust them to use us and then to later realize they never liked us all along. So we avoid wasting our time.gt For wanting to do something theyre body is telling them to do pretty much all day. Again women want to fuck too. You have to understand that. Women feel attraction and physical attraction too. Women crave sex too. gt We have one test you have a cunt? Passed the test. And thats the problem. If all Im good for you is that I have a vagina then you dont really care about ME. What differentiates me from the millions of other women who also have vaginas? Nothing. Meaning you are really not at all invested in me but rather vaginas.Meaning any time a new vagina comes along what stops you from leaving me? If all you see me for is a vagina I am replaceable.And tell me why would I invest my time and energy with someone who sees me as replaceable when there are many men who will not only like my vagina but my personality and will actively choose to be with me based on my personality and have the vagina as a bonus?See my paragraphs above about desperate men and why women wont date them.,TheBluePill,cepdilo,2,t5_2vzvv

112600,0,t3_1vdh6d,Okay more anthropology science checking here. I dont have much of a problem with the core point of the book this comes fromthat there is a mythological notion of a noble savage which doesnt accord with the facts. But when the data is extrapolated back to make statements about modern society I think you run into problems. In particular I think a crosscomparison between Europe and the US to specific societies in Amazonia or Papua New Guinea obscures a lot about thcentury society. Leaving aside the reliability of some of the data in the chart Im hoping the data on the Yanomami doesnt come from Napoleon Chagnon for example but I suspect it does theres just the complexity of the question of what the social and political causes of mass death are. For example war communism  policies and the threat of external attack contributed to policies in the Soviet Union in the s and s that lead to very high death rates including at least one event thats controversially considered a genocide in the Ukraine. Those deaths were chiefly by famine which might be argued to be rare in huntergatherer societies but they had military roots. Moreover if you look at the death rates during WWII you do get rates that are entirely comparable with the figures here for that period. If Im recalling correctly somewhere in the neighborhood of  of the German male population died during WWII. Thats a period of five years never mind what you would get for lifetime incidence of violent death in combat. In general the axis powers had high rates of male deaths because most of the people who died were combatants. A number of other countries Poland China come to mind were literally decimated  or more of the entire population was killed. These countries had more even distributions across gender because they were invaded and large numbers of those killed were noncombatant women and children. Also by convention the figures Im using dont include the Holocaust or people who died in forced labor camps. Moreover shocking as it is to say American death rates in WWII were essentially negligable compared to places like Poland so that is another thing to keep in mind.   I dont know what numbers you would get for the Korean or Vietnam War or IranIraq but theyre probably comparable. I think the Korean War killed something like  of the population of Korea and  of the population was internally displaced. In short people tend to underestimate how horrible WWII was  the demography of war is pretty complicated and while the idea that men die in war is also a myth there are limited senses in which it is true. ,TheBluePill,cer9304,17,t5_2vzvv

135177,0,t3_1vmeqn,To be fair this was originally posted in offmychest so this guy likely wasnt posting a story about how horrible women are but instead telling a story about some people who treated him badly.As far as some of the points of the story goIt didnt sound like he was doing anything other than paying.  If he had been involved with any of the planning or invitations he could have voiced concerns along the way.  Still I think its reasonable to expect to be on the wedding invite with mom and biodad and for his list of  people to have been invited.  I think its perfectly fair for the person paying to have some amount of control.However I think it was unreasonable for him to expect the menu to be totally allergy free for him unless he has a severe contact reaction.  So long as there are things he could eat that do not contain the offending foods he shouldnt expect the entire menu to be for him.  I have vegetarians coming to my wedding that my bf and I are paying for and Im not keeping the menu entirely meat free.  There will be vegetarian foods for them but also roast beef for everybody else.  Its also silly for him to be offended that his stepdaughter wanted her biodad to walk her down the aisle and dance the fatherdaughter dance with her.  I can sympathize if he was a bit hurt by it but his reaction was way overblown.He also expressed his frustrations in the worst way possible and everyone there probably thinks hes a massive tool.Still I hope that this guy would still be very annoyed that TRP is using his story for their woman hating masturbation session.,TheBluePill,cettrh1,8,t5_2vzvv

I mean the other day I acknowledged a cisgendered male friend of mine likely had an X and a Y chromosome and a group of feminists appeared and beat me mercilessly while shouting There is no difference between men and women! None! Not at all!And the reason nobody likes evopsych is because a it is impossible to prove and b the entire premise assumes it can change. If women are say sexually submissive because alfalfa peen was all they got when they were so oppressed in their relatively unsexist tribal community and women became used to being oppressed...  well that kind of implies the ability to change doesnt it?

294258,0,t3_1xgm0m,That entire post has potential to cause so much harm to mens sexual behaviours and attitudes. This guys entire rant is basically putting the brunt of the responsibility on women. This is so fucking irresponsible I cant even make fun of it. His list especially detailing why men instinctively hate sluts is so stupidly flawed I cannot fathom why anyone would lend credence to it.These in particular really got me gt Women are more likely to get a STD.We could also phrase this as men are more likely to transmit an STD. Vaginal intercourse has a higher risk for a woman than a man.gt  Women are too stupid to get checked for STDs but go to the doctor more often. zomg Im an angel I cant possibly have an infection from sucking that guys dick it was only for a minute it doesnt count teehee!Men are too stupid to go to the doctor as frequently often resulting in catching preventable diseases at late stages. I work in a medical lab. I hear similar sentiments within the medical community all the damned time. But you dont simply call a person stupid for not getting regularly checked for diseases. Its more complicated than that. There are a hell of a lot of factors ranging from the it doesnt happen to people like me mindset to lack of STI education and fear of positive diagnosis that commonly stand in the way of persons getting tested. By the way I read the link he pulled that info from. That part about women being too stupid to get tested...he just pulled it out of his ass. Apparently that was all he could conclude from the fact that though women get more check ups they are more likely to have an STI. No fucker. Truth women with asymptomatic STIs are more likely to be diagnosed and earlier than men because women get checked more often.gt STDs negatively affects child birth I think he means here that an STI infection can result in infertility or complications like ectopic pregnancies. Nothing about the effect of STI on actual child birth is mentioned. Very smart. gt Your so called reformed slutthe one can end up killing your beautiful sondaughter or give them brain damage blindness and deafness.Hey guess what...A man more than likely gave her that STI ! Why the fuck is the man who gave her the STI not also responsible? This is mind blowing. A lot of women who are not sluts have gotten STIs from trusted partners. And the most amazing part? The promiscuous lifestyle promoted by TRP means that an Alpha is going to be high risk for STIs. So yes follow TRPs advice. Rape Fuck all the women. Then you go settle down with your clean virgin. gt HPV the most common infection like really high numbers that nearly all sluts will have can cause cervical cancer. Have fun watching her lose her hair and paying ridiculous parking fees.I guess you didnt read the second part of that point. The part which explained that HPV is also very common in men. That men usually develop no complications from HPV. Kinda reminds me of another point you made gt Women are who have chlamydia and gonorrhea are less likely to show symptomsBut its ok when the one without symptoms passing on the disease is the man? What a terrifying interpretation of  a femaleoriented fact sheet. If anything it should have served to emphasize the need for both men and woman to be more selective of their partners practice safer sex and get tested regularly.gt If you have a slut as a long term partner and youre thinking about having children or marriage she is most likely is infected.No. She really isnt.gt Why do we like sluts for sex?gt We thristy brah dem ass dem titties. Condoms  medical treatment are easily available and we are more likely to see our STDs. We are also less likely to get STDs as well.Ignorancefueled rationalisation of why its perfectly fine for men to do do everything they condemn women for. Hypocrisy at its finest.gt Condoms  medical treatment are easily available and we are more likely to see our STDs. We are also less likely to get STDs as well.gt     Condoms  medical treatment are easily available and we are more likely to see our STDs.

I am willing to wager that the kind of cooking for your family that Henry Hill does at the end of Goodfellas does not make him look beta or effeminate to your typical redpillian for example. On the other hand they would probably scoff at a woman doing the stereotypical garden grill thing throwing huge steaks over open flames dousing them with beer etc.Cooking for your family is not really stereotypically feminine it is something that is stereotypically done in a stereotypically feminine way.

315356,0,t3_1xpll8,So I know this video doesnt have much to do with the red pill specifically but I still thought youd find it an interesting watch.I for one think its total bullshit and like one of those fancy academic sounding catch phrases that make people think I know more about what Im talking about than I do... what is it this time.... uhm...OH! A false equivalency!So one thing is that it would be the same to treat a man the way we treat women. Thats just wrong because men arent women! The way we treat women is a product of like evolution. Its just like an undeniable fact that theyre emotional immature weak submissive babyhaving succubi. Its our duty and right as men to treat them like crap to keep them in line. To treat men the same way is basically a violation of human nature! Dare I call it a genocide of masculinity. Secondly did you see how that guy was treated! That was fucking nice. I dont know about you but I would love it if more women were all over me like that. I mean theyd be worthless whores for doing so and basically subhuman but sex and sexual attention is a basic human need Maslow didnt know shit if he thinks you can survive without getting your dick wet. Still can you imagine how nice it would be to get all that sexual attention? It would just make me feel attractive! Women should be flattered to get that kind of attention.Also Id just like to comment on that shot with the woman walking down the dark street by herself. What was that even supposed to mean? I mean I thought it was ridiculous she was able to walk down that street all self assured like someone wasnt about to pop out the bushes and kidnap or rape her. Its just reasonable to expect thats a likely outcome of stupid slutty behavior like that. I mean in my opinion if youre dumb enough to do that you basically deserve to get treated badly and its not rape when you deserve it. sReally I know this isnt about trp specifically but I did think you guys would appreciate it and I thought it was interesting thinking about how a mens rights activist of the trp andor thinlyveiledmisogyny variety might react to it.Also there is what I interpreted as a gang rape scene and while its not very graphic it was to me well done and triggered some feelings I wasnt necessarily expecting when I started watching.

Shes fucking nobody shes just a chick with a pair of tits and an ass and you are BETTER than her.Not putting someone on a pedestal doesnt mean considering it lower than dirt. It just means accepting her as human. Something TRP never seems to be able to do.Also yeah the comment addition that OP mentionedgtLesson  the reason that there is often so much bitterness but once embraced and understood can be the source of your greatest power and bargaining tool stoicism To her you are ultimately disposable and replaceable... but so is she.Such loving. So romance. Much wow.Anyway... My advice to anyone is if you feel so worthless that you are completely disposable in a relationship find the cause and fix it. If it is your partner making you feel this way talk to them. If they dont stop after some warning leaving is an option you may need to exercise. If it is coming from you understand why and work for bettering it.,TheBluePill,cfqg3et,13,t5_2vzvv

If youre someone who is really fat or really skinny and start hitting the gym start eating right and start dressing well great things will happen when it comes to woman. I lived with a basketball player from my university. He was as dull as a box of rocks and rarely even spoke but he had a different girl in the apartment every single night cooking him dinner cleaning his laundry and had some very loud sex that I try to forget about. Did I tell you he had a long distance girlfriend who he was dating for a year while all this was happening. The dude truly had the body of an adonnis though and wasnt scared to show if off. Also wasnt scared to tell you he was a basketball player. Ill never forget all of the beautiful woman I got to be around by proxy. So in my experience it absolutely helps.

Well everyone has said something in private that they wouldnt want getting out. gt But if someone overheard them saying that stuff IRL it would definitely kick up shitMaybe. Depends on who heard it.

She knows I kicked my last wife out in three days and ended my marriage by text so she behaves. I dont play that shit and a girlfriend is far easier to next than a wife. The fact she knows I have been fucking five other women lets her know I am the desired one with many options not her.And yet Im sure the moment she cheats on him and if she doesnt she should shell be nexted.

Shit we dont do that for really any medical condition. If people show symptoms or have risk factors then they are tested. Mass testing for something that affects only a few people is a very inefficient use of resources.gtMany of the policies people including myself would love to see would change the way we all livelearning about gender identity in schools genderneutral toilets changing forms new legislation etc. No it isnt foolish at allbecause we dont just make rules for the majority. We accommodate the minorities too.These dont solely benefit trans folks. Tons of people benefit from undermining cisheteronormativity even cishet folks who say dont have a traditional gender presentation.gtSo youre telling me that at least  of the population is affected by this and doesnt necessarily know it and it is foolish to implement a paternity testing program? Doesnt these people deserve to know what medical problems they might be predisposed to?This wouldnt even tell them what medical problems they would be predisposed to! Only paternity testing that confirms the child is the fathers would help with that at all.

616270,0,t3_2177u1,Usually when I say yeah right like that happened what I really mean is that the way the guy telling the story is seeing it is probably not in line with reality. Like my comments in this post were more referring to the OPs perceptions of how other people at the party were viewing him. After being told by a woman that she objected to the use of the word bitch he argued his point in what he felt was an eloquent fashion. The womans response was that her jaw dropped. While the OP believed that her jaw had dropped because of an inability to formulate a decent argument I think its more likely that it was actually due to disbelief that anyone could be that big of a douche. I also have trouble believing that a woman he offended so much actually asked him for his phone number. And at the end of the story he claims that his bitch aka his girlfriend said I cant believe you did that! in amazement at his boldness but I would not be surprised if she was actually saying it out of frustration and embarrassment. ,TheBluePill,cgabkm6,13,t5_2vzvv

684254,0,t1_cgi1omw,gtId be interested to hear more about your definition of conservativism thoughNot sure if it is the best subreddit for it. Basically it is the recognition of the problem of the ego. Basically it comes from the recognition that premodern people generally understood that having a small ego is a good thing. This takes limitation discipline all sorts of things. You live in a tightknit community you have prescribed duties to live for and it is better for you than a life of unlimited choice because it reduces your ego it teaches you humility and therein lies happiness. There is no greater happiness than service than forgetting about your own self and feeling the pride that you fulfilled your duty and it gives your life meaning that you do what you are born for and you dont have this nagging doubt we moderns have to what the hell even to do with our lives. However modern people seem to think that if you are entirely free to pursue your desire and you are never made to feel smaller than anyone or anything it is somehow good for you. For example if you look at the slogan of Portuguese and Hungarian conservatives it is god homeland family So it is to be seen as goals bigger than your than your own self or desires so  living for something else not your own self. Similarly  the US Conservapedia defines it as personal responsibility moral virtue limited government again here the first two are to be seen as ideals to live for. Now you contrast it with the slogans of progress like liberty equality franernity and it sounds like something you should get it is way to ensure you can comfortably pursue your own desire and selfactualization. So it is about you  it is about desiring and getting not duty and serving. This is the difference.Now if we contrast this view to todays views of course on the liberal side who think all this duty and prescribed community role stuff is oppressive evil but on the other hand the RPObjectivist type conservatives who are not conservatives actually they too openly say they dont want any duty or role they want to be as free as possible to be selfish. Funny how these two groups hate each other they are very very similar they are both under the illusion that more freedom is somehow more happiness.This why Western politics is so weird because it is basically just two different kinds of individualist egocentric liberalism somehow thinking they are the whole spectrum. Liberals accuse conservatives with being egotistical about money true conservatives accuse liberals being egotisticalhedonistic about sex true and in reality they are both so just focusing on different things.One very good book is After Virtue from Alasdair MacIntyre.

725931,0,t1_cgmraou,We are discussing here at rTheBluePill.  This is the capacity in which I believe it should be discussed.  Engaging with them as if their ideas are equal to our own is wrong because their ideas are not equal to our own.  If you enter into the conversation with the assumption that there is a debate to be had then you will never arrive at the truth because your premise is false.As for those who subscribe to TRP ideology they deserve to feel the full brunt of the mockery and scorn that well should be heaped upon any member of a bigoted hate group.  When a student is wrong the teacher does not debate them they educate them.  But TeRPers arent just misunderstanding the Pythagorean Theorem they literally think women are not people.  You dont correct such an error by saying yes but...  People need to be made to understand that such a belief is unacceptable incompatible with modern society.  They must be made to understand that theyre not just factually but morally in the wrong.  You cant do that by getting down on one knee and explaining it to them gently as if you are equals.  Never ever ever forget that these are grown adults who think that women are not people!I simply lack the capacity to engage with that idea as if it is the same as the tastes of a friend who likes a different kind of music than I.  I simply lack the capacity to engage with people who believe that rape is no biggie while simultaneously teaching unwitting young men how to rape women.  I simply lack the capacity to engage with people who believe that women must submit to their men or face punishment.  I simply lack the capacity to engage with people who believe women must be disciplined like dogs.  I simply lack the capacity to engage with people who believe that a womans only value is in the pleasure she can give to a man.Please understand me when I say this I loathe every single one of them and the only way I could stand to be in ones presence is if I was mocking them viciously.,TheBluePill,cgmsiuj,6,t5_2vzvv

You cant do that by getting down on one knee and explaining it to them gently as if you are equals.I was going to make a reply to everything you said but Ill stick with this. If in this scenario youre the teacher and they are not your equals then youre doing the educating wrong. An educator explains why the student is wrong they do not mock them viciously. I understand the sentiment for hating what they believe. I also think that discussion is constructive. It shows why people believe what they do how they reached their conclusions and why those beliefs are appealing to them. Debate then allows an examination of those beliefs. It may not be something youre capable of doing due to your loathing and I understand why you feel that way but I think discussion among those that can discuss is important. ,TheBluePill,cgmt6ac,6,t5_2vzvv

Im with a group of friends from high school mostly girls who had NEVER viewed me as anything but a beta. But when my adrenaline was pumping I was barking out orders because I needed to get to the hospital. My asshole friend who was just trying to get home to get pussy kept whining claiming I was fine as blood poured from my face. As I completely eviscerated the guy worse than I ever have to probably anyone I saw a spark in every single one of those girls eyes. His GF later commented WHILE HE WAS THERE that I looked really hot despite the fact that my nose was obviously broken. Even the other guys sensed it as one of the my friends refused to leave his plate alone with me. This girl was legitimately begging to stay with me that night.gtPoint is girls love violence dominance and men who can keep a clear head under intense pressure.Soooo he was at his worst and alfalfest when he threw a tantrum trying to get his uninterested friend to take him to the hospital because somebody had beaten him up?

749070,0,t3_22qm35,TRP can be as much of a confidence booster as any other resource. Thing is you have to consider whether its a healthy resource. Dont let natural skepticism get sucked under by confirmation bias and group mentality. Examine what TRP really says about women and men!  I dont have any linksquotes handy at the moment but a few of the regulars here can provide you with some  and seriously think about whether you want to live a life based on that.Also try talking to some of the people who frequent TBP who are in relationships. You might be surprised at their insight. Men and women can and do form relationships outside of TRPs strict and often unhealthy ideals and are generally the happier for it.Googling around for a bit should lead you to other more realistic sources for both selfconfidence and dating than TRP is but you can make the final call for yourself. I do encourage you to look into alternatives. Its odd how TRP so often ties confidence to sexualromantic relationships  sure the first helps you get the second but they arent inextricable interwoven or anything.

Indeed a large part of their success is predicated upon brushing off failure as if it doesnt happen. Only a few days ago here on TBP there was a thread entitled If you dont acknowledge rejection TRP works  of the timeFurthermore the idea as you put it that they cangtpredict the actions of a very specific type of personis patently flawed when it comes to women. The division in the RP model is twofold into has sex with me and doesnt have sex with me quite clearly posthoc reasoning.

When a gay man views a female ass in contrast his feelings are moved from his lower brain to his upper brain. In a bisexual man his feelings move in both directions and collide between the lower and upper brain  producing fissile plutonium.  EDIT someone mad,TheBluePill,ch5i95d,43,t5_2vzvv

That seems to be the source of their hatred for fat people they hate that they spend all their time eating well and working out when they might not feel like doing either yet quite a few people would rather have a fat person with a good personality over a hot guy with a shitty misogynistic attitude.I understand that people dont like how some can get things without effort. But thats kind of the point being fit wont guarantee you a relationship. People keep healthy because they want to not because they expect things from other people in return.

He suffers from BDD and as such thinks hes ugly.  He doesnt take his meds and there is NOTHING I can do about that.  This leads him to stay in but he remains convinced its his looks that keep him from meeting women.He looks for answers but denies the ones hes given by his friends family and therapist.  He gets the confirmation bias hes seeking from TRP right now... But he visits PUAhate periodically.   He claims because it makes him feel better about his own shitty situation and I can only hope hes telling the truth.Im the last person qualified to talk someone out of believing TRP bullshit so I have no idea how to help him. ,TheBluePill,chuu28q,10,t5_2vzvv

Similar terms are dumb blonde and valley girlgtThe term was originally used in the United States as early as  for an unintelligent or brutish male.gtThe stereotypical bimbo appearance has become that of an attractive woman often blonde and with a curvaceous figure and large breasts possibly wearing heavy makeup and revealing clothing. However none of these traits are strictly needed for a person to be considered a bimbo. The common inclusion of blonde hair is due to the widely held European belief that blonde hair is beautiful. It is sometimes associated with women who dye their hair blonde indicating that physical attractiveness is more important to them than other nonphysical traits  and as an extension to the dumb blonde stereotype. gtInteresting Bimbos  Club | Grupo Bimbo | Bimbo Fleischer Studios | Bimbo Bakeries USA Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcielo oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecielo.

Tell me wouldnt you feel sickened and disgusted if victims of human trafficking in this game were fullyclothed?Problem is not with a breast or two or three like in Total Recall but in the simple fact that nudity and sexualization always only affects female characters and NPCs. If we rarely see naked male NPC its often done for laughs. AFAIC there were no naked male trafficking victims in the Watch Dogs. So yes there are high chances that this wasnt only made for a shock value but for a male gaze as well. After all its a typical damsel in distress situation and nobody is getting particularly offended is damsels are sexualised or seminaked.And dont forget that some other gamers may see the situation in a go from point a to point b see some kewl boobies along the way shoot some mooks.

1429404,0,t1_civexw4,Thank you for your reply. A lot of stuff here and i am afraid i wont be able to tackle your points adequately i have a hard time talking about these things in my first language honestly.gt Ill always expand out hidden child comments on reddit because as often as not it provided insight. This made me smile. I do this as well.gtWhy? Is it because you disagree with everything they say or that if you find yourself with a TRP label you will be very loosely socially castigated by an online community?This is a good question. I am open for discussion but i expect a certain quality. Now if others identify me as part of group X they have a predefined set of reactions. Its not because i am overly afraid of the label but because that label limits the range of probable reactions from others. Its the same reason i dont wear dreadlocks any more not because of the judgment but because i think i cant expect everybody to be openminded in the face of dreadlocks. This would mean expecting too much. I would deprive myself of opportunities to meet people. Regardind TRP i noticed these posts that talk about accountability. I always assume they are coming from older guys with more experience. When i look at the TRP frontpage i see a majority of posts that is not interested in learning and understanding. Instead they repeat the same old narrow ideas over and over again. I dont want to be a part of this and i dont want others to think i am for the reasons stated above. I guess i am used to sitting on the fence but still long for some acceptance. Here is an example of me navigating the rocky seas of gender discussion gtwhich leads onto a dehumanising effect for whoever is in the Them category. Its my view that this kind of thinking is what allows genocide and cultural cleansing to persist.I totally agree. Them vs. US is at the core of many problems. Still there are some things i just cant accept.Anyway all this tends to grow over my head. Gender questions are somewhat personal to me and i have yet to find a place to discuss my observations.

1570304,0,t3_2c8fuf,So this guy started being Red Pill a month ago. Changes to his behavior include I no longer try explain logically or try change her mind. Now I state my view and the conversation is over if she questions me I say ignore or say no. I make all decisions instead of asking her to decide or give her two options ect. Thinking wife talking about her coworker is a shit test responds by consciously ignoring her and changing the subject.So basically swallowing the red pill means that this guy doesnt listen to anything his wife says makes decisions without asking for her opinion refuses to answer questions she has and basically doesnt allow her to have any input. But hey the sex has improved! Of course if hes taken his new wife has no say in anything philosophy to the bedroom sex probably better from his perspective because he no longer bothers with taking her wantsneeds into consideration. No word yet on how the wife feels about all this.Going on the info provided in this post I think we have a couple of possibilities here. Wife has made a new friend at work. Shes excited about this and sharing her happiness at having a new friend with her husband. Because you know most people like to tell their partners about stuff going on in their lives.. Wife has noticed that her husband has lost interest in her opinions on things. She is now finding emotional fulfillment from her work friend who is interested in the same things that she is and actually enjoys spending time with and talking to her. Despite what TRP says about women theyre actual human beings who need approval and emotional support from other humans for good mental health. . Wife is dropping hints at husband because shes noticed that he no longer listens to anything she says. Maybe if she talks about how much she enjoys spending time with this other man who is interested in her as a person not just a subordinate sex thinghousekeeper husband will notice and step up. She might prefer to just have a frank discussion with her husband about how she is feeling unfulfilled with their relationship but since taking the red pill he has refused to hear her thoughts on anything at all.. All of the above plus the wife is considering or already is sleeping with this guy since her husband is a Terper douche who no longer makes an effort to fulfill her emotional and sexual needs. I sort of doubt that this is the case since its supposedly only been a month that OP has been behaving like this the friend is apparently happily married and the wife is being pretty open about her friendship with this guy.I think the obvious answer to the problem would be for OP to stop his bullshit and start communicating with his wife again. But of course TRP knows better than that! The obvious answer is Suggest a couples dinner so that OP can size up his new rival while also placing his wife in the position of meeting the other wife thus making her feel guilty for having the audacity to have an opposite gender friend. Mention the plank challenge that has been going on between OPs wife and her coworker so that coworkers wife will be angry. Because obviously all women are jealous bitches who would be offended by things like workplace physical fitness challenges.  Dread game. Be even less communicative than before and refuse to acknowledge that wife has a new friend. Spend less time with her. Start wearing cologne. Dont answer her calls. The obvious outcome of this is that shell think youre seeing other women and will respond by transforming into the perfect Red Pill Woman.htThis is clearly the only correct response to OPs situation. He should absolutely double down on the behavior that got him into this situation in the first place refusing to listen to take his wifes thoughts and feelings into consideration by withdrawing from her even more to the point that she thinks hes cheating on her. This plan is foolproof and cannot possibly backfire. Women who believe that their husbands are cheating definitely dont do things like turn to their new physically fit work friends for emotional support. And theyd never think of getting revenge by doing something like escalating what had previously been an innocent workplace attraction into a fullblown affair. And no woman has ever responded to her husbands complete emotional withdrawal by doing something like leaving him. Trust but verify and dont fear any of that muh privacy bullshit. Not a contradictory statement at all. Trust her but back up that trust by snooping. If she gets mad that you violated her privacy dont worry about it. Youre just checking up on what shes doing because you trust her so much! You wouldnt get upset if she snooped into your life. In fact dont stop at just reading her texts and emails. Hire a private investigator. Have her followed. Get photos of her hanging out with her coworker. Because you trust her so much.The Red Pill is definitely the place to go for healthy relationship advice. Stonewalling snooping playing mind games and ignoring your partners wants and needs are all you need for perfect marital bliss. ,TheBluePill,cjd40gp,47,t5_2vzvv

Also the logic of slut shaming makes no sense. Having sex with lots of guys is not the same as cheating.  If a woman has sex with men while not being in a relationship  shes just having sex. Its no different than a man looking for casual sex while not in a relationship.

They are usually followed by seek work orders where an appropriate wage can be imputed. Domestic violence is considered as a factor with regard to both custody and support. The statutes are gender neutral.I get annoyed when I hear divorce law favors women in the United States. If someone has a current statute that creates any presumptions based on gender I would like to see it. I certainly have not read them all. But the modern trend is to actually broaden rights by incorporating domestic partnerships into the language.That being said Im sure some judges being human are biased in favor of a particular gender just like some judges are biased in favor of a particular race religion profession etc. I just havent seen it personally. Family law judges tend to perform guideline calculations when it comes to money and focus on the wellbeing of the children when it comes to custody.

What opinion am I asserting? Were evidence to appear for any of the aforementioned claims I would examine it with the same critical eye. Just because Im finding no evidence for something doesnt mean that couldnt change. Its saying that the jury is still out until something tangible surfaces. I fail to see how this is a belief and it damn sure isnt a religion as many assert. Look I dont like the assholes in ratheism either. They act like immature twats. But I also dont like being told that I subscribe to a belief to which I dont subscribe. At present there is no evidence to warrant a belief in any of the thousands of deities from any of the thousands of religions humans have created throughout their history. There is also no evidence to warrant a belief in homeopathy but no one accuses me of belonging to the church of ahomeopathy. Its only because the godgoddess belief is so entrenched in some human minds that it is treated differently. Feel free to argue all you want but telling me that I lack a belief is bullshitty nonsense is not going to get me to adopt a belief nor is it going to get me to change my stance that lacking a belief in deities is the same as lacking a belief in any other untestedunproven idea. ,TheBluePill,ck9vkl5,3,t5_2vzvv

1840488,0,t1_ckaz3qi,ampampampSection . Mating reproduction and development of article  Spotted hyena sfw gtThe spotted hyena is a nonseasonal breeder though a birth peak does occur during the wet season Females are polyestrus with an estrus period lasting two weeks.  Like many felid species the spotted hyena is promiscuous and no enduring pair bonds are formed. Members of both sexes may copulate with several mates over the course of several years.  Males will show submissive behaviour when approaching females in heat even if the male outweighs his partner.  Females usually favour younger males born or joined into the clan after they were born. Older females show a similar preference with the addition of preferring males with whom they have had long and friendly prior relationships.  Passive males tend to have greater success in courting females than aggressive ones.  Copulation in spotted hyenas is a relatively short affair  lasting  minutes  and typically only occurs at night with no other hyenas present.  The mating process is complicated as the males penis enters and exits the females reproductive tract through her pseudopenis rather than directly through the vagina which is blocked by the false scrotum and testes. These unusual traits make mating more laborious for the male than in other mammals while also ensuring that rape is physically impossible.   Once the female retracts her clitoris the male enters the female by sliding beneath her an operation facilitated by the peniss upward angle. Once this is accomplished a typical mammalian mating posture is adopted.  gtInteresting Spotted hyenas in Harar | Clitoris | Hyena | Lion Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckazj oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckazj.

Maybe this isnt the place for it but i feel like a lot of rp men are pretty much where i was a few years back. Coming out of an abusive relationship seeing only the shitty side of the opposite sex and really looking for any reason to not fall into another abusive and being used situation. I feel like many of these rp like me bought into hate and anger and decided do unto others would be a great idea. For me i got through that phase pretty quickly and came to the decision that shitty people are shitty people regardless of gender or orientation. No matter what social level income level local or situation in life you are always going to run into users and horrible people. And we get zero life training sometimes in the simple art of not allowing ourselves to be doormats. That is the good where i think rp makes a mistake is not allowing themselves to get over the anger and going far overboard into wanting revenge via making others into their own doormats.  ,TheBluePill,ckd8lxm,4,t5_2vzvv

They dont believe anyone who tells them that there are in fact many people who defy their categories.

This thread much like their comments in the original is not only disgusting but also a major misrepresentation of the actual situation being discussed.RP assertion OP is suddenly fat and lazy and  months postchildbirth is plenty of time to get back in shapeOriginal post At  and  pounds OP is back to her prepregnancy weight and has been for  months already because she worked hard to lose the extra weightRP assertion Husband is openly telling her he doesnt want her because she is so gross and she is hamstering with denial and excuses  Original post Husband told a mutual friend behind her back that he didnt feel attracted to her anymore and she saw the convo by accident. When they talked about it together he revealed that he wishes she spent more time toning up at the gym but he still loves her and isnt going anywhere.RP assertion OP wants to be a whale who sits around eating bonbons all day while longsuffering sexless hubby does everything AND lifts  Original post OP is  and weighs  pounds. She and her husband are raising a newborn baby. They are still having frequent sex and she was not aware of any problems until she saw the abovementioned conversationRP assertion OP is dragging hubby into counseling because she is so irresponsible  Original post Newlywed young couple with newborn baby had a communication breakdown and decided together to go to counselingRP assertion OP just wants to be lazy weve been through this  Original post OP is a new mother who already lost weight and is busy and stressed out. She feels that because her health is good and she is not overweight toning her body to perfection would require time away from things she feels are higher priorities at the moment. She also never said at all that she was opposed to going to the gym in any way only that spending hours a week on it just isnt going to happen right now.They are working themselves into a fucking lather to defend this womans husband from imaginary attacks based on scenarios they have completely fabricated. There are two legitimately bothersome things in the OPs story One is that hubby never even mentioned his concerns be they what they are to his wife and she found out through a third party which must have been very hurtful and two is that her kneejerk reaction was welp guess were divorcing. But theyre young with a new baby and big life changes always have adjustment periods and attraction in a longterm relationship always waxes and wanes. It sounds like exactly the kind of situation that counseling is designed forthey can get some help communicating better and they can rebuild whatever trust has been broken. These guys are fucking clueless when it comes to basically anything related to women. They have no idea what women weigh or how much work it is to breastfeed and drop baby weight. They also seem to think either that hubbys real problem is OPs misshapen stretchedout postchildbirth vagina OR they think kegels are something that magically give women tighter butts and perkier boobs. And they do goddamn shit like this jumping all over a womans story about her own fucking life to replace it with their own paranoid selfish narrative end result being the woman gets a bunch of terrible advice and the terpers jack each other off to new euphoric highs over the obvious activism and selfimprovement theyve just demonstrated by defending men everywhere by burning a straw woman in effigy.I mean... fuuuuuuuuuuck.,TheBluePill,cmv7fq5,55,t5_2vzvv

Being proud to be black in America  being specifically proud to be AfricanAmerican  means being proud of the new culture and heritage that slaves and free blacks throughout America built after white people stripped them of everything they possibly could.  It means standing together against an oppressive culture which saw every black person in America as inferior solely because of the color of their skin.  Black people can and should be proud of those accomplishments of their ancestors especially since the fight for equality and a society free of racism is still going on.  White people?

2673762,0,t1_cn7i6it,gtYoure asking the wrong people. This is like going up to a group of white people and asking Why do black people like big rims so much? You can sit and theorize all day but you probably wont get the right answer.Uh.. Nice stereotyping. Anyways Im absolutely asking the right people. Theyre watching this from the outside theyre not deep in to the echo chamber. You can accurately describe a psychological phenomenon without experiencing it yourself even though that might make it easier to understand it.gtTheyre raised thinking that you have to be nice and polite to get attention from women.Being nice and polite is such a basic thing though. I dont want to talk in terms of jocks and nerds because its not all that black and white. Ive read things similar to what you just wrote before and it always contains those words. Heres what I think happens in real life they see a guy being successful with women feel jealous because he is more popular and decide hes an asshole to make themselves feel better.  Being nice is simply not hurting somebodys feelings in some way. You can tease someone insult them playfully just be polite be a bit standoffish all these behaviors can qualify as nice. But being nice alone wont get you anywhere if you have nothing else to offer. This is why I think many of them might be socially awkward. If someone isnt interested in you complimenting them helping them with homework holding the door for them wont change that. Its nice yes but its not going to make them consider dating you. If you think that then again the fault lies within you.Also arent you sort of taking away their agency with that argument? Theres a lot of stupid beliefs within our culture but by living and examining them you find out whether theyre sensible or not. Like if you grow up watching movies where the guy always gets the girl in the end that shouldnt stay as your world view throughout your life. You realize how it works in real life.gtThey have no idea why the prettiest girl in the class has a crush on the guy that trips her on the playground when they just helped her get up.You literally just made up some scenario thats supposed to prove your beliefs somehow. How is anyone supposed to argue against this? I know nothing of the situation Ive never witnessed that myself. Even if someone has seen it in real life its not evidence that girls only go for douche bags. She might be interested in the guy that trips her for a different reason kids arent fully developed so theyre weird.gtTheyre told that they just have to be themselves looks dont matter as much as personality doesLooks always matter in a way. If youre a cool person whos fun to hang with your looks arent going to stop you from having friends given that you take care of yourself and youre not a slob. In relationships looks do matter a bit more. Im sorry but isnt that just common sense? Fault lies within them.gtTRP is using common sense. If the attractive asshole gets pussy and the nice guy doesnt why not be the asshole or at least find a balance between the two?Going back for a bit to the things I wrote about niceness. Just because simply being nice doesnt work doesnt mean being an asshole is what you need to be. Just because assholes are getting laid doesnt mean no kind guys arent also getting laid. The last reason a guy isnt getting laid is because he is nice. It will never be the reason someone cant get laid.gtWe dont blame anyone but ourselves.The things you wrote before seem to put the blame on the culture these guys grew up with.gtFortunately it wasnt as bad for me because I had people to tell me that all that was bullshit but these other guys theyre taught that shit from birth. Theyre raised thinking that you have to be nice and polite to get attention from women. That the popular football player will peak in high school and that timid nerd will come out on top when hes  and hell be rich with the nice clothes and cars and bad bitches.You accepted the red pill becausegtAlso because the world started convincing me into believing shit that I was uncomfortable with. The same reason these other guys did. They blamed society and came to trp to have their beliefs reinforced. Then you state how women respond to game and how they get tired of you when youre too nice. Im thinking many of the guys didnt have much contact with women before I mean its all about what place the guy is coming from. If somebody didnt appear interesting to women at first and then started joking more or negging hed get a bigger reaction from the women he talks to now than before. Thatd be a success to him and then he could go and brag about how girls are totally into him in a field report.gtWhen shit like this happens you start to see a pattern. TRP explains why youre seeing the pattern youre seeing.There are two explanations I can think of. . Youre seeing the situation differently. The reason she likes you more when youre mean might be because you appear more interesting and into her not that shes thinking hes so mean I love that. You might be drawing the wrong conclusions. . Guys that have read up on the red pill have now learned about negging and other things and view their previous interactions with women in a different way.

It went on for a few months and it was always  drama all the time and we fought nonstop because you know I dont take kindly to being emotionally manipulated. He wanted the classic plate relationship with me...I was to be monogamous with him and he could sleep around. Except that I did not accept those terms and he didnt have other girls anyway just wanted to dread the situation to keep me compliant. My compliance never materialized instead we just fought bitterly all the time and even though he tried to do the abundance mentality thing I knew he was full of it which made me even more mad. He also tried to shame me for my age wed known each other as teens and he routinely called me out for being an embittered old hag compared to the wonderful young girl Id been. Again this just caused me to tell him to get bent and kick him out of my house after which he would email or call with these lengthy apologies that were not really apologies.Anyway the day I dumped him was a fine one indeed. He is still single years later and still trying to play the field without success because he wont commit to anybody. All the girls hes tried to cozy up to have kicked him to the curb once the whole you cant tie me down line comes out.Meanwhile I found an awesome dude in my early s no less!

Im sure it makes you feel better. Its a pretty common reaction actually seriously  cultural misunderstanding  is a common entry on racist bingo cards because racism is so icky that no one wants to believe they harbor any. American doesnt have a monopoly on racism but racism is part of the common parlance and people here are much more familiar with the tenets of antiracism. Europeans in my experience tend to see racism as an American issue and are blind to their own racist ideas even when theyre pretty damn obvious Stepping away from yourself and realizing that our attitudes ideas and yes desires are shaped by our culture and that yes our cultures promote racist ideas will help you separate Im racists and therefor BAD from I have unconsciously adopted racist ideas which are BAD and its my job to see them and stop perpetuating them.

3091755,0,t1_coib65u,gt The ratio of female dominents to male subs is such that there are a lot more males subs than female doms.I think that a lot of that has to do with how women are socialized  some women who are somewhat dominant or would like to try out some aspects of BDSM that are perceived as dominant are socialized out of it. Then theres the barrage of overenthusiastic male subs  and this is my experience  the majority and I mean gt of suggestions made by male subs are no holes barred  do anything you please Ill endure it just let me do X where X is something somewhat demure like lick your shoes. The problem with these kinds of suggestions is that theyre offputting to nontextbook sadistssociopaths. What Im looking for is someone who at least wants to try ABC  preferably someone who enjoys it instead of merely tolerates it.

3098133,0,t1_coh4wrw,gtIf were so into instincts why do you assume our instincts just so happen to match your idea of what is natural?Youve got it backwards my idea of what is natural is built on an understanding of our instincts not the other way around. Whether that understanding is correct is debateable but there is certainly evidence for it. gtIf we have all the same instincts as monkeysWe dont and I never said we did. We seem to share some but while we are no doubt related humans are still distinct enough not to share every given instinct. gtwhy dont we have the sexual sharing instincts of bonobos who confuse paternity deliberately to avoid sexual jealousy? And who use sex casually as a way to defray tensions? How do you know that that isnt our natural state?This is the theory found in Sex at Dawn. Personally I find it highly unlikely  if this is our natural state why is it almost nowhere to be seen not just in our culture but all over the world? If agriculture and private property created the need to own a womans reproductive capacity and this was in opposition to our nature how come things like paternity testing contraception abortion ect. havent returned us to our natural state of sexual openess? And if these instincts towards sexual jealousy really are new arising as a consequence of agriculture then doesnt their dependence on our larger more advanced civilization render going backwards to our real nature an impossibility and undesirable anyway and so what is the difference? gtAnd since this is such an unavoidable instinct what about the men thay dont feel the way that you insist they do?Sexual jealousy and mate guarding are human universals theyre found in all men throughout the world. This does not mean that every single individual man feels this way but that does not disprove the general statement.

The specific comment that got my Twerpradar beeping was about how SPOILERS Clair left him because he wouldnt dominate her sexually... She was comfortable being second fiddle to him if he proved to be dominant enough but when he didnt she could no longer submit. So no TRP buzz words but the general idea that she was shit testing him and he failed and thats why she left jumped out at me.... Which was frightening because I think it means Ive internalized some TRP....shiver.The general consensus from non Alfalfas seems to be that this season sucks because Clair and Frank are acting so out of character though thus proving that even in fiction Twerps ideas of believable human patterns of behavior are warped.,TheBluePill,cp7lx0g,6,t5_2vzvv

I went on a night out with them once and it was weird.We had predrinks which consisted of boasting about sexual exploits including miming out crass actions. The boasts normally consisted of I dont care about her pleasure Im selfish as fuck and they love that. Its just in out and done ASAP. The bitch can fuck off if she thinks I care. followed by miming it out and pig squeals hey I said it was weird. My friends little brother about  at the time then told his mum to fuck off cslur when she asked us to please keep the noise down.The entire time every one of them boasted about how great they were at seducing women. By this point I have to admit that I was morbidly curious about what those techniques were I mean going by the past  hours I had come to the conclusion that these were awful people. When we went out it was described more than once as lets go out to rape some bitches. We went to the club where they expressly said their plan was to wait around drinking until it was dying down to find the really drunk girls. That was their seduction technique. Pretty much rape or as close to it as possible. I feel a bit sick just writing this bit to be honest. Im pleased to say that every one of them went home alone. I have no idea what would have happened otherwise. I was ready to intervene if necessary but the fact is that theyd been laughing off my comments all evening and I probably would have lost a physical confrontation. The whole experience was excessively creepy from start to finish and I think my friend was suitably embarrassed  he has never invited me out with them again although I have no idea why the fuck he hangs out with them in the first place.

3417465,0,t1_cphqhc3,gt doubtful but more importantly what do you mean by derogatory. Well something like...gtbeing critical of real life behavior still doesnt equate to hating women. it offends you when red pillers say postwall women cant get alphas so they settle for betas and all that? or that girls who have been sluts in the past dont make for good long term relationships which just sounds like common sense to me? See that term gets thrown around a lot in your sub.  Are you somehow suggesting that it is not a derogatory term?  How about riding the cock carousel?  How about the fact that many people are using RP for onenight stands and STRs but its completely okay for a man to sleep with a million people right?  However if a woman sleeps with  shes suddenly a slut?  That would be the derogatory things Im talking about.gtand most people there would say those things but those generalizations dont exist to make you offended the language is blunt to get the point across to clueless men and the existence of these generalizations serves the purpose of sexual strategy alone it doesnt exist for the opportunity to be judgmental its only a valuable perspective in how much it can personally help us get what we want.I wish I could explain to you just how sexist your statements here are.  Maybe Ill try a different tact.Making sweeping generalizations about a certain subset of people simply because of their sexracereligion thats what people refer to as racistsexist.  These things are generally considered bad in our society.  For you to use the term slut to describe every woman sight unseen thats sexist.  Do you understand now?  If we changed your words around I could make it sound like the most racist thing said since the nword.  In fact I would substitute slut with the nword because thats where it fits.gt but what do you consider pressure? if I get up and say im going to leave now does that count as being manipulative? see I dont really believe you you claim I am using strawman arguments but clearly are disregarding the majority of what is posted on this sub. Your sub has a specific term for getting over lastminute hesitation on the part of the woman.  Yeah I suspect most people would consider that pressure.gtyou commonly see people here assume a redpiller talking about overcoming a girls hesitancy is automatically a rapist. if the girl had sex with him willingly and only him and her were there yet you all jump on the story as though it is evidence of rape happens all the time.Nope. I dont assume anything about you.  When you say rapey things however I will start to believe that.gt theres not all that much women hating at all honestly. I refer back to the link I posted earlier.gtbeing critical of a pattern of behavior is not inherently misogynistic and pointing out a pattern of behavior is far from anything resembling hate. I think Im finally getting to understand you guys.  You dont do things and rationalize them you actually truly believe that the terms and practices used in redpill are okay.  Theres nothing I can ever say to any one of you that will make any difference.gtyou find the terminology offensive but fail to recognize they are still based of valid povs. do you understand that using an objectifying pov as a tool for a goal is not mutually exclusive with also understanding that people are also people from a pov and generally should be treated as such but again those are both just points of view in one sense we are people and in another sense we all are objects....but you dont.You clearly treat women differently than you treat men.  Its quite obvious.  And even then you treat specific types of women differently.  Fatties over here sluts over there s in another place.  You dont treat women as if they were actual people.  It boggles me how anyone can do that treat someone differently based on something they cant even control.,TheBluePill,cphtdc5,1,t5_2vzvv

3427593,0,t1_cpivtt2,Zero sum games suck. You should read Finite and Infinite Games.Heres a summary from the books wikipage. P.S. you suck at philosophyltPixiecutgtFinite games have a definite beginning and ending. They are played with the goal of winning. A finite game is resolved within the context of its rules with a winner of the contest being declared and receiving a victory. The rules exist to ensure the game is finite. Examples are debates sports receiving a degree from an educational institution belonging to a society or engaging in war. Beginning to participate in a finite game requires conscious thought and is voluntary continued participation in a round of the game is involuntary. Even exiting the game early must be provided for by the rules. This may be likened to a zerosum game though not all finite games are literally zero sum in that the sum of positive outcomes can vary.gtInfinite games on the other hand do not have a knowable beginning or ending. They are played with the goal of continuing play and sometimes with a purpose of bringing more players into the game. An infinite game continues play for the sake of play. If the game is approaching resolution because of the rules of play the rules must be changed to allow continued play. The rules exist to ensure the game is infinite. The only known example is life. Beginning to participate in an infinite game may be involuntary in that it doesnt require conscious thought. Continuing participation in the current round of gameplay is voluntary. It is an invariable principle of all play finite and infinite that whoever plays plays freely p. .,TheBluePill,cpiyyxh,8,t5_2vzvv

When I was  and in college I felt like there was a subset of women who wanted to be treated more like children than adults that were equal with the men on campus.EDIT As an example at the time in my state Plan B needed to be obtained by asking a pharmacist.  There was no pharmacy at Student Health Services.  Most people got their prescriptions filled in town and I walked down to the town every month for my birth control and allergy pills. The feminist group at my college went around very aggressively with petitions for Plan B on campus and I remember the rhetoricfilled speech that the spokeswoman gave at the Student Government meeting.  Her main point was that it was not fair to make Plan B not available on campus because it was embarrassing and inconvenient to go into town for the pills. Yeah I guess walking into town is way too inconvenient when theres a possible pregnancy on the line because were little kids right?

3907371,0,t1_cr1k31a,Well argumentum ad Webster is a pretty low form of trying to define something especially a term loaded with research and theory.But even the Wikipedia definition would have been a good place to start looking.If youre actually interested though patriarchy theory is in a very brief thumbnail view the idea that society and culture is generally organized around the belief in gender roles with men being seen as superior and women inferior.However this isnt just defined along sex and gender  men who are seen as masculine are seen as better than men who are seen as feminine and women who are seen as feminine are seen as better than women who are seen as masculine and even though being masculine is seen as better in general feminine women are often seen as better than more masculine women because they are in their place which is the same issue with feminine men.If men are seen as feminine enough they can even be seen as inferior to suitably feminine women although that really depends on the specific subcultures to which they belong. For example a more feminine gay man would be seen as inferior to an appropriately feminine woman in a more Traditionalist Christian subculture.These gender norms and gender roles then begin to intersect with race issues and class issues so its never as clearcut as man good woman bad and many subcultures have their own twists on these various intersecting norms and expectations.However few people suggest any of this is a truly conscious process. Rather many of these norms are conditioned into people from an early age since to a large extent all these different intersecting norms are modern culture. There are obviously many others and they vary from place to place and group to group but many hold constant as a baseline.So with this incredibly general and abbreviated background uadminbeast is suggesting that showing emotion is often seen as a feminine trait a feminine trait which is stigmatized in men and its this stigma keeping them from showing their sensitive side. This is changing but there is still a general badness associated with men too open or free about their feelingsa harmful gender role conditioned into people by our patriarchal system and a harmful gender role against which feminism is actively fighting.Even if someone is actively going their own way they are still largely going to be indoctrinated into this culturethe conscious rejection of one part of society doesnt make it much easier to reject the much deeper and more insidious conditioning especially when its enforced by largely everyone around them.And remember patriarchy theory does not suggest all men get together to make these conscious decisions or that theres a shadowy cabal of patriarchs but that everyone is conditioned into this system to some extent or another and most people police and uphold the system largely unconsciously.So just because its called the patriarchy does not mean anyone is suggesting all men are bad or even at fault more than anyone else who is a part of society or that women cannot perpetuate these same harmful systems because they totally can and often do.Sorry for the massive rant though.tldr the patriarchy is a system of interconnected gender norms conditioned into everyone and subconsciously enforced by society and culture. These norms hurt everyone in different ways and can stigmatize people who try and break out of the norms eg. men showing emotion when its largely seen as a more feminine trait.,TheBluePill,cr1ob0e,9,t5_2vzvv

They go on and on about guys who have hurt them in the past and belabor the point about how not easy they are.  They think that by unloading all their baggage on the first date that they will ward off guys only interested in getting laid and be more attractive to good guys.  Instead it has the opposite effect.  A guy whos decent and looking for a serious relationship is turned off because shes clearly insecure and has a lot of issues she needs to work through before she can be a healthy partner.

4228369,1,t3_39btv3,I dont have the time yet to respond in full. I apologize for being brief.gtWe will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to harass individuals when moderators dont take action.The target of this harassment is women. It most certainly spreads from TRP and does not stay there. Does anyone remember the woman who posted to Ask Men about being  having a doctoral degree and was finding it hard to find dates? We made a thread about it I hope one of you can find it.The berated. They brigaded. They sent her awful PMs. The definition of harassment and breaking of Reddits  rules. She is one of hundreds of such stories.gtFrom what little I know fatpeoplehate got shut down for not following the rules. Its not like now that fatpeoplehate got taken down all those subscribers had their hate suddenly lifted from them.Part of TRP culture is making a TRP only name so that you can go out and harass people in other subs. They dont use that word of course but that isnt a hard thing to find said over and over by ECs and Mods over there. That is intentional rule breaking.Im asking those willing to follow shitty comments in default subs about women to their submissions tab. Then go through a few lines ControlFing for TRP. Youll find so many more TRP posters doing this than you can imagine. Each one evidence that TRP is not playing by the rules. This is especially true for any post they link to another section of Reddit. Every single screen shot perma link etc from when theyve invaded Relationships? I think that counts for something.gtNot sure silencing them is the best approach to proving how incorrect and backwards they are. Theres no need to use force to win an argument they stand no chance of winning in the end. I will def not participate in this I may not post here much but I read this sub all the time. Silencing someone never works as a means to exterminate the actual issue.I dont want to change hearts and minds. I want to stop  year old men who dont know better from going in there and fucking up horribly because they dont see what TRP is until its too late. Older Bloopers can attest to the fact that I was in TRP and I didnt know beware posts are very frequently posted here. Are all of them sincere? Doubtful. Are some of them? Without a doubt.gtWouldnt you destroy your own sub in the process? I mean this sub pretty much exists to serve as a counterpoint to TRP. Im not endorsing those guys one bit but what use is your sub if there is no counterargument?I understand how dramatic this can sound but I believe in my heart that for every  people who join up in TRP one of them wouldnt do something awful to a woman if they hadnt. Im trying to stop the counter from going up and decompress the echo chamber. If when they go somewhere else? It wont be one of the top  sites on the internet.Every kid we save from going in there? Thats a victory to me.TLDRThey are brigrading and always have to the point that Ask Men Relationships and other such subs are constantly drowned in the fuckers. Ask Creepy PMs mods if they brigade sometime they literally have a rule against saying the name because of how often it summons the fuckwits. I want to stop TRP not because itll change anything for the people in it but the people yet to find it and no matter where they go?

I have no idea what this is supposed to accomplish besides being fucking obnoxious?Anyway there have been lots of situations where this would happen and I would just flip them off. And similar situations where men would catcall me or try to pick me up in their cars or something stupid like that. And being tired of it I just flip them off if theyre far away or tell them to fuck off or look at them and say what? if theyre staring at me because I enjoy the surprise and accompanying shame when they get called out on their b.s..But Ive been very lucky.

But what the hell I feel spicy so Ill respond to some of this lunacyUp to this point literally everyone has lied to defrauded and deceived you about the sexual marketplace about women about what is attractive to women and the datingmarriage scene.Having been raised with an older brother and being a notorious sneak I can tell you this isnt true. Teenaged dudes who do well with the ladies crow about what they think works. Also by  and youre still deluded enough to think that the words of a soft rejection are really true advice then you really are a box of rocks. Its not up to girls who are trying to let you down gently to tell you how to win in love I personally got the exact same speech when shot down and you know what? It hurt but I sure as hell didnt take it as gospel because I knew it was just an effort to make me feel better. Yeah anyway get some fucking friends and ask them what works theyll be honest...When you point this out you are told that there are lots of nice girls out there for a nice guy like you and that you will make a nice girl really happy someday! just not meAgain look to someone other than the girl who is rejecting you for advice. They are simply trying to spare your feelings. Dress better dont be a self pitying man child take some time to figure you out before chasing love...yeah no girl whos shooting you down is going to say these things it would come across as needlessly cruel.You are constantly evaluated tested and put up against other men to see how you measure up. Every waking minute you know that someone somewhere is constantly putting you in the scales and evaluating you against other men. Life is constant relentless competition. You MUST prove yourself every single minute of every single day. There is never ever any respite from this.Ummm ok buddy try being a woman then. You will find that there is constant pressure to be pretty pleasant innocent. If youre smart cynical or ambitious people will cut you down. Such is life everyones got a full bucket and there are loads of unfair expectations on everyone. Find some people who like you and hang with them just allowing the goofy to flow and youll realize that some competition matters but most of its rubbish.Because of the relentless competition and evaluation rejection is a fact of your life. You will get rejected  times out of . At least one of those is a nuclear rejection. You must MUST learn to steel yourself against rejection.Yeah we all face rejection and it sucks. We all learn to cope with it or laugh in its face. Also rejection is an opportunity to learn and seek out new options. Door closes window opens and all that. Plus I am firmly of the belief that you cannot lose that which truly belongs to you.  May sound like new agey hogwash but it helps when youre upset that you didnt get what you wanted.You are virtually invisible to nearly all women. Women will not tell you this but the primary reason they are expressing interest in you is not because they like YOU or because they want YOU or because they are interested in YOU. Womens interest in an average  year old man is in his Beta BucksThis is a symptom of someone who doesnt want anyone but the hot cheerleader or whatever and will not consider any woman as significant than the hottest girls around who like hot men do ignore a lot of people because its impossible to pay equal attnetion to all possible suitors. Most women even those who are not attracted to a man do not ignore them. Anyway this is just rage crying now. And guess what most women are looking for love were mostly not calculating gold digger asswipes anyone who sees women this way is making shit up and attributing thoughts to others that they have zero proof for.After she marries you you have a better than  chance she will divorce you or you will have serious marital problems.Seriously? Not aware that the divorce rate has been declining for  years? You will go through grinding excruciating sexual dry spells both in and out of marriage.Ummmm yeah no. And even if so life does not owe you sex. Also this trp trope about the sex withholding wife is just astonishing to me...sure sex might get less frequent than daily  but most people are not in dead bedrooms  especially if they work to prevent it instead of embracing a poor me and my dry cock attitude.And as for the fired for harassment and false rape thing...dude PLEASE. Women at work topically tolerate a lot of sexism and actual repercussions are so rare as to be less than a drop in the bucket.

4417241,0,t1_csnjawp,Agree with this.This is the way Ive learned to look at relationships if you are not with someone who is stoked to be with you you are always depriving  people minimum with finite lives from having a relationship that is the most awesome possible Theres you who are not that great to this person.  Theres the person who WOULD think you are freaking great who is still out there maybe in the same lame situation you are as we speak or just plain lonely and wishing she could meet someone like you. Theres the girl youre dating who is not that into you I.E. not that stoked about the things you committed to doing and thinking about I.E. not very compatible. Theres the person she would be interested in who is still out there again the butterfly effect of them having a lame relationship or lonely.Im going to go out on a limb and guess youre either young or otherwise newish to dating. People dont appreciate you later They fundamentally stay the same person and will never be thaaaat stoked about you and honestly you were never as stoked as you could be about them.The best relationship is the one where you are super excited this person exists on the planet and they feel the same way.Since that is possible why are you cheating yourself? Why are you effing up others getting the most out of their lives by clinging to the wrong person? If you look at the effect of dating the wrong person and how far that ripple goes it doesnt make logical sense to date the people who are not emphatically excited you exist and are in their lives.Once I got very clear on this and committed to finding it or bust I found that person for myself. Anything less than that is fluff and you could be doing something better with your time I say as I feed my reddit addiction...but yes. You get what Im saying.I somewhat doubt this advice is going to be what you want to hear or are inclined to follow through with but I hope it may have made sense and gotten through to you. There are plenty of books and videos targeted at women saying get any guy you want! Catch him and keep him! Women get the same terrible advice to try to do social skill jedi voodoo and try to constantly use formulatic nonsense to trick people into barely staying that is a LOT of work and it is simply not how compatibility works will not escape the problem Ive outlined and will not make anyone particularly happy.

Finally start asking yourself how you want to feel in your ideal relationship and not for a description of what your ideal person will be like. Change your focus Is this how you want to feel? No it is not. Make a definitive list of how you want to feel in the relationship you want to experience before you inevitably die and look for those feelings. Good luck.,TheBluePill,csnk2zm,14,t5_2vzvv

She needs few day periods between PIV sex when we tried to have it daily it would desensitize her to the point where she would not be able to get off from this type of sex.

4479279,0,t1_csv7zya,gtPointing out things bluntly ! ridicule.Men that let women walk all over them deserve ridicule. Id want my friends to call me out if I ever did that.gtas soon as they stop being so sensitive about their n count or penis sizeI couldnt care less about either. Interesting you brought up penis size tho. As if to shame.gtOh early high school. K.Completely failing to take in to account that men have been forcefed this lie from birth.gtTheres validity in any belief system use... Not true if one applies criticial enquiry. TRP stands up to scrutiny and has predictive capabilty ie it is a rational theory. it appears I am the one to have to break this to you both men and women act on the basis of both conscious and unconscious motivators. TRP is an attempt to bring these unconscious motivators out for both genders so they can be examined.gtbut only to the believer. Its prone to confirmation bias and creating blind spots.If a theory is internally consistent then it is plausible ie it may be true. if we test TRP theory it explains and predicts way more frequently than can be accounted for by conf bias.gtIf the women youre with are doing this shit the best coarse of action is to back the fuck off. I agree which is what I said. I have no time for games. Often tho calling their bluff seems to make them reverse their decision. it is not just me that has observed this.gtFind someone who enjoys their sexuality and enjoys you enough that theres no hesitation. I havent had an issue in this department... If you are gonna pretend that shit tests are not real then there is no point continuing this line of discussion. It doesnt always happen tho by any means.gtkinda interesting TRPs keep running into LMR.I think you spoke about confirmation bias yourself earlier. How do you know that TRPs run in to this at a higher frequency? Maybe they just talk about it honestly whereas others dont.gtSex is great. So is masturbation. Theres plenty of priests and monks that manage. Id rather pay a prostitute than deal with the tactics TRP employs. Its also cheaper in terms of  time and emotions to pay a prostitute or buy a fleshlight than to carry out relationships you have to manipulate into working for you.Perhaps there really are celibate men that are happy to wet their sheets and be done with it. Im not sure what goes on in private. As for masturbation and prostitution  theres no substitute for knowing you are sexually capable. It is deeply embedded in to a mans pysche. I fail to see how a man being honest about his rights needs and masculinity is being manipulative. Is a woman who wears a pushup bra and makeup being manipulative? The whole sexual market place dynamic involves each gender presenting their best face.gtIf you need to believe women are all the same brainless helpless emotiondriven creatures in order to have the fortitude to leave a relationship youve got issues.I look at facts. My mother is extremely rationally and emotionally competent. The internal examiner for my PhD Dame Jean Thomas is perhaps the most knowledgeable biochemist I have ever met it is my field so Ive met many. I could go on. The point is this neurophysiologically men and women have the same capacity. But without development this capacity atrophies. Women have a choice men do not to live off the work of a man. I avoid such women or just have sex with them. Women that work hard to develop themselves  women that have their own passions  these women I would consider for LTR. In other words I hold all people myself included to the same standards. However  let us not pretend that evolutionary legacy has no effect on human behaviour. We are still monkeys and we are still subject to emotional cues. Put bluntly humans dont have a sex drive  we have a reproductive drive. For a man the two are essentially the same. For a woman living in a cave precivilisation  not so much. There is huge cost associated with reproduction and any woman that did not act hypergamously simply did not leave progeny.  We are now very late in the game M years. Only the horniest of our male ancestors and the pickiest of our female ancesters left their DNA within us. Of course this has an effect on us now even though society tells us we are completely free to make our own choices. Human consciousness is strongly flavoured by gender. Acceptance is the first step to freedom. We carry hugely potent evolutionary sexual motivators within us and it is pointless to pretend otherwise.EDIT Cleaned up spelling.,TheBluePill,csva4tw,1,t5_2vzvv

4497931,0,t1_csxkrpl,First of all you have to control for where each source of statistics are coming from. Are they saying that  of REPORTED domestic abuse are by women? Because that would make sense seeing as how men report they are being abused and negligible levels  as you mentioned. Not only that men are often not believed to be abused by women and women  being on the favored side of the law in ALL things  are able to very easily inflict self harm and blame it on their partner and many women often do threaten their husbands with this to keep them in line. There is no benefit of the doubt for men  one of the reasons men receive harsher punishments for crime regardless of whether or not a woman committed the exact same offense.More than  of domestic violence victims are men!LOS ANGELES Sep.    October is domestic violence awareness month. In May  the Centers for Disease Control CDC published its latest study which found almost onefourth of relationships had violence about half of which was reciprocal and the researchers were surprised to find that in nonreciprocally violent relationships women were the perpetrators in more than  percent of the cases and men incurred significant injuries!gtI think all victims of abuse should be treated equally I think its an absolute shame when anyone doesnt get the help they could get. I will admit that I am sceptical towards a lot of statistics  and towards people who are quick to point out that men are victims too as there was no real need to point that out. I appreciate your thoughts!No  male victims of abuse will never be treated the same for the very reason you and others are skeptical of anyone proclaiming that men are victims too. Women are literally the most protected and sheltered members of society with vast funding and laws setup to favor them while men literally have none of these things for their own protection and zero benefit of the doubt. So  no  men will never be on an equal playing field. Men will always be demonized told they need to man up or simply dismissed as has been the case throughout history and culture. ,TheBluePill,csxmbk3,2,t5_2vzvv
4498940,0,t3_3cn9cw,As someone who was at the inception  TRP began as a more realistic alternative to PUA.  The seduction community had two types of followers those that believed superficial game trumped personality game and those that believed personality game made up for everything else which was the traditional belief and the majority.  Eventually the first group splintered off because their beliefs were irreconcilable and became TRP.

4548513,1,t1_ct3x3f6,gtIt wasnt an attack. I dont care who you are but you seem to be parroting red pill nonsense. Just because Im not a RedPill doesnt mean Im not going to tell you youre wrong when youre wrong. gtSo you agree they are having the same amount of sex.No I do not. gtThe distribution is simply differentThat is not the correct conclusion to draw from those data. gtSo vagina is scarce to some guys specifically but not others.Yes. gtIt doesnt make sense to claim that it is scarce when according to you some guys must be having boatloads.If  of ten men get  women and the th man gets all  women vagina being plentiful for  man does not outweigh vagina being scarce for the other ....gtI never said anything about unique partners but good job putting words in my mouth.You stated men and women are having the same amount of sex because anytime  woman has sex  man must necessarily also have sex. This statement becomes valueless and nonsensical if you remove the concept of unique partners else  man could service all . billion women and the statement remains true. The only value your statement has which of you meant to convey regardless how you attempt to backpedal now was that anytime a unique woman is having sex a unique men is also having sex and therefore the distribution of sex is mathematically equal.I demonstrated how this is mathematically untrue. gt men each having sex with  women is still ... Uh units I guess.. of sex. Men as a whole are having just as much sex as women. This is just as true as if it were  men and  women.No its not. You are fundamentally not understanding how ratios or math work. If you have  rich people making  billion dollars a year and  poor people making  an hour waiting tables do you have a healthy economy? No because the ratio of extreme wealth is damaging vs the ratio of poverty. You require a middle class. Few men are very successful. Many men are generally unsuccessful. Nearly all women are generally successful. Some women are VERY successful. Im not sure how you came to the conclusion this equal as its the mathematical definition of not equal. gtBecause they statement doesnt make sense when talking about groups on the aggregate. It only makes sense for the individual.No. The phrase vagina is scarce would make sense for the general collective of men because the general collective of men have few sexual partners andor at least fewer sexual partners than they desire or wish to have access to. It wouldnt ring true for the  of  men who are drowning with pussy. Those men are exceptions. Why would the  not be able to say vagina is scarce because its not for the other ?

So theyve attempted to fit sluts into this paradigm in two ways . shes trying to get pregnant with alpha genes . shes a hopelessly broken woman because shes not being selective.Now youll notice that those are basically incompatible. If shes evolved to bone lots of hot guys until she lands an alpha fetus how is she also a broken person who will be an awful mother? Additionally women riding the CC are being selective  they dont fuck betas after all.They havent managed to come up with an explanation for how beta genes have persisted if betas just get cuckolded with alphas. The closest would be claiming that society betafies boys. How on earth could it possibly benefit women to betafy their sons if betas never get laid and reproduce?

I find it humorous that his title claims that he was called a jerk and THEN got laid when it actually happened the other way around originally. I dont particularly buy that she said she never banged her exboyfriend especially if shes trying to claim women dont only just want jerks. Even if it was true lets say then why would she not just lie and said that she did have sex with him to help make her point? Women lie right? AWALT? Except when theyre not. You know if youre inclined to believe that much of this post happened to begin with.Edit Oh and the basic gist of it that I can believe is at least for sure this much that an RP doofus had sex with a girl after which he was called a jerk for any of a hundred reasons. After that its varying degrees of plausibility starting with probably making her say nice guys finish last as he fucks her a second time as LEAST likely to have happened ever to sending her a I didnt rape you text as MOST likely to have happened .,TheBluePill,cu5r4pl,6,t5_2vzvv

The most amicable breakup I had still turned both of us into strange people not behaving like we normally do for a few months and that was a relationship that just fizzled out after  years and we are great friends now.TRP stops you moving past the initial I am REALLY angry phase it reinforces your angerbetrayalwhatever while claiming to do the opposite.,TheBluePill,cvfmvkb,5,t5_2vzvv

They are conflating an enjoyment of housewifey things with yearning for a time when they literally had no rights outside that domestic sphere. Theyre going through the motions of being what they think is traditional and feminine and again like the guys of TRP they are driving away most of polite sane society in the process. Deep down though I dont think many RPW really believe what theyre preaching. They realize that the RP lifestyle is a losing gambit for them and they admittedly dont want RP guys.

5488350,0,t3_3q4m9a,I have an ex who I think would qualify. I dated him for about a year a few years ago. I was  and he was . Im  now. This relationship is a lot closer to how MRP is than TRP though he and I werent married now that I think on it but Ill let the others in this thread decide. First off he was one of those new to kink misogynistic dudes who thinks men are inherently Dominants and women submissive. He first messaged me looking to get to know me and see if I would submit to him while he was in a relationship. Im not polyamorous so I turned him down. Apparently the relationship he was in wasnt going to last and I basically talked him through leaving his ex respectfully. Im honestly unsure if he followed my advice. So about a month after he and I first started chatting he breaks up with the woman and starts actively pursuing me. At that point in my life I was recovering from a mental breakdown and was going through some serious sub frenzy. For those who arent kinky due frenzy is when a submissive goes through a time where they want a relationship or kinky sex either out of newness or desperation while single. My case is the second. Within another month I was dating him much to the chagrin to some friends. He saw himself as  Master and I was his slave but not really yet. It started out with him basically stating that I had to prove that I was willing to do whatever he said even though I had only known him maybe a couple months and most of it was online. He started setting rules testing my ability to follow his directions and if I wouldnt I would have to accept his punishment. Most of his rules were about humiliating and degrading me with emphasis on how I was to worship him. He was an atheist who bragged about wanting to find a way to make it appear he caught fire upon entering any church. I think that was connected to his father being a pastor and how he spent a few years in military school. He would spend hours talking about how what he was putting me through wasnt as bad as his military school experience. His rules changed a few months into the relationship as he decided I was to stop seeing myself as his equal in the relationship as my views on Domsub relationships is that their is a symbiosis. This lead to rules where I was to diet and start referring to myself in third person. I started counting calories and he had access to watching my diet on an app he insisted I use. At this time he started working out and lifting weights more. This regimen lasted a few months before it escalated as he wanted me to know I was replaceable and no better than a dog. He wasnt the most animal friendly person. So he started really getting into hypnosis play with me. He wanted to change me from being monogamous into a dog or toy for his amusement where he could try and manipulate me into doing sex acts with him I wouldnt normally consent to. One of his fantasies was to get me to have sex with a dog for his amusement. Thankfully that never happened as his hypnosis wasnt really working on me because I was growing fearful of his lack of personal limits. He would express concern that I had any sort of limits because he didnt have any and I was his slave so I should have the same limits as him. He and I began to argue more at this point.While I was in a diet and exercise regimen of his design at some point I moved in with him. My relationship with my parents wasnt going well and I was being groomed to rely heavily on him. So I moved in and dropped out of school. He seemed to like this. Once I moved in the diet and exercise regimen grew more taxing. I was limited to eating a food of his own design called dog cum which was oatmeal protein powder and a dash of salt. Im lucky he actually told me what was in it. Eventually that was my primary source of food while living with him. He also checked my weight several times a day and would punish me if I gained over  lbs. All I will say on the punishments is that they were all physical and even when I was allowed a safe word he was no longer listening to them when I used them at this point. I started binging and purging while eating less than  calories a day to please him. I struggled internally a lot at this point in the relationship.  He had decided that all my money was his and had ensured I got on food stamps to cover the food for our household while I wasnt working which he liked or going to school to achieve more in my life. This went on for months with him treating me less and less like I was a human being. He actually had me so referring to myself in third person. I was to refer to myself as slave or it. He and I still argued occasionally but I had to bring my concerns to him in a feminine and submissive manner or else he wouldnt listen andor I would be punished. He wanted me to be open to MFF threesomes and to do anal more. These were not things I was open to and he was already making me plenty uncomfortable with his other demands. I started sleeping in a dog cage or on the couch as punishment more and more often. And I was feeling less interested in the sex he demanded every day. I now realize that nearly all the sex I had with him was nonconsensual and abusive after the first few months of the relationship. During this time near the end of the relationship I ended up babysitting for a friend I met through him. She was struggling to pay me but it didnt really matter because he had decided any income I earned went straight to him. So I didnt have a car and had to take the bus everywhere and he gave me money for a monthly bus pass. What ended the relationship was what happened when I got punished for spending the money on food while babysitting instead of a bus pass. I felt bad eating the food that the woman I was babysitting for had since she was low income with a toddler so I got something for myself from Walmart without his permission. He was so angry he stewed on it for  days and I had to sleep on the couch. I was terrified. So a few days after the infraction as I was babysitting he texted me telling me I had to arrive home and follow his instructions for my punishment. He texted me the instructions. When I got back I followed them and was left naked blindfolded and waiting for him to punish me. He then assaulted me with a knife and forced me to say that my life meant nothing and that he could kill me and it wouldnt matter.It took me three days to leave after that with help from the woman I was babysitting for. I dont know if he was TRP or just another abusive ass hiding in the kink community. What I do know is he still identifies as kinky and a Master and that I couldnt get the cops to take me seriously when I reported him. Thank you to all who made it through the teal deer. ,TheBluePill,cwd6r0r,4,t5_2vzvv

5578902,0,t1_cwnlhk1,idk i can actually really sympathize with this woman mainly cause im one of those people who express affection through doing things for the other person. i really feel the best when i get to do things for my boyfriend or family. i also like to clean sometimes. it destresses me and its just nice when everything is neat and tidy.now if my boyf were to physically stop me from doing the things i want to do and tried to change that part of me told me to stop it you freaking bet id get depressed. one reason why he and i just get along great is cause hes so so appreciative of everything i do and he says thank you for every little thing.is the RPWOP a little hard on herself? yes of course. i have days when i just cant be bothered to do anything for anyone and thats normal. but to say that it isnt her authentic self or that shes trying to be a sexbutler is a little harsh. she wanted to express her affection to him in her own way and he didnt understand that at all. instead he told her to stop. i think they should have had a talk about this to let each other know where theyre coming from but now that all is apparently said and done i just feel sad for this relationship and i hope she can ease up on herself a little and maybe find someone who understands her gestures of love.,TheBluePill,cwom51y,3,t5_2vzvv

5671626,0,t1_cx01os4,Cultural norms that dictate that men must initiate romantic relationships and the ease with which a guy can copypaste the same message and send it to dozens of women. The more messages guys collectively send to women on online dating sites the less chance of success each message ultimately has. But the fact that its super easy to draft one message and scattersend it to lots of women still makes that tactic worth it. Think about it you could draft one meaningful message and send it to one woman or you could draft that same meaningful message and send it to  women. That way even if the one woman you had originally intended it for doesnt respond you still have a decent chance of getting a date with one of the other . And the message doesnt even have to be that generic. If you like dogs and star wars for example you can find women that have the same tastes through a quick metadata filter. Those ladies will each get what looks like a personalized message referring to their love of dogs and star wars making it look like you drafted that message just for them when really youre still playing the numbers game.,TheBluePill,cx04dkn,26,t5_2vzvv

I thought Oh God Ive offended this guy I wrote something off the cuff without clearly thinking and of course I would do it to the exact person whose voice Id want most here... which Ive realized too late. My reallife clumsiness spilling over into reddit. And contrarily I bet Ive probably given too much time and research to those who arent at all interested in my answers. Knowing me Im sure of it! But hey now youre here I have someone to do the good work for me... and judging by your reasons behind your strategic POV Im heartened to know that youre doing it way more intelligently than I ever could. You exhibit a level of understanding of human behaviour that is striking. Others must have observed this and told you this already? In real life I mean. I was so green when I first came to this set of pill subs about six months ago. Initially I embraced this preconceived notion where everyone could stroll into PPD and have a discussion and it would be somewhat evenhanded or I could at least put forth something to indicate that my name my person and my flair really means hey guys were all just humans fuddling along etc  anything to get them out of that cage of believing AWALT etc in retrospect how naive this was! Clumsy Bekazzled strikes again. Because I truly believe MRP and RP encourage an end result that is not just contrary to the initially stated intention but dangerous to the individual members and those around them. Thats not an aspect of society I want to see growing. Reading what happened to guys on rexredpill was particularly upsetting for me. I am also very shaken when I see wives whove discovered their husbands are using MRP tactics on them and they are utterly lost  and crushed further when they post on MRP hoping for understanding.Oh and re hypnotism... Im interested in your opinion on the topic but thats probably a PM topic? I did not really believe in hypnosis until it was happening to me I fairly swiftly recognized that I had lost contact with self had a panic attack and pulled myself out of the moment. I was there in that state for a moment though. gt If I want to help then Id better do a good job yes?Yes. ,TheBluePill,cx4pkzp,2,t5_2vzvv

5756765,0,t1_cxakc1q,Great response I hugely appreciate your insights.To clarify why I believe they will face impairment I believe the idolization of narcissm or actuality of it for them is a comorbidity. Im suspicious that many of them have untreated developmental disabilities and I say this with no implied exaggeration of the degree and not as an insult. They are undiagnosed because they functioned reasonably well.However if you do have any sort of cognitive delay or impairment you immediately find yourself at odds with your environment learning systems social settings adult guidance all of these are essentially designed for a person that is not you. This can build up a lot of resentment. I have seen indications that there is a trend of cognitive disorder and that is the initial stress factor at least this is the theory I am convinced has legitimacy after lurking over there and PPD. Especially so for the younger ones whose brains are still growing and developing coping strategies. I think they are trying to help thenselves without grasping what is going wrong.Add onto this the definition of normal in our cultures idea of masculinity and you get this over compensatory need to succeed at being acceptable. I think many of them have  subtle but significant cognitive challenges that they have not had any language to deal with in a healthy way.,TheBluePill,cxaojll,6,t5_2vzvv

Im a man just like you. Im a man who throughout the years really struggled with many personal insecurities. The whole gauntlet. I was never good enough. Academically socially financially physically. Sexually too. I was a failure especially compared to others. I had incredibly poor confidence and very low selfesteem. I hated myself.Someone like me? Hes ripe for the picking. Insecure. Lonely. Selfloathing. An emotional mess a social failure. Hes an easy target for TRP and other similar online communities. What does a cult have to offer after all? Community? Selfimprovement so called at least? A promise for a brighter future?An enemy. Women.TRP members hate women. After hating themselves for so long it must be nice for them to finally hate somethingsomeone else. They feel that need to strike out against the Other. And for them its all justified. AWALT after all.Youre going through a tough time. But you need to be very careful not to fall back into that toxic mindset. Talk to your girlfriend. She isnt a special snowflake obviously. Nobody is. Not her not you not me. Shes human just like you. So talk with her as one human to another. Judge your relationship with her on your terms not on the terms of a misogynistic online cult. Are you happy with her? Are your needs being met? Socially? Emotionally? Physically and sexually?If you feel that your insecurities will sabotage your relationship then you need to take a step back. Breathe. If youre not happy then you can always walk away. Please remember you have that option. Youre not trapped. Youre not a worthless beta bitch. Youre an individual with agency. You control your own fate. Live your life see what it has to offer. And by all means focus on improving yourself. Exercise eat healthy meet new people try out new hobbies and activities.

Its welldeserved derision not bullying to point out how absurd it is for your to think your wife cant handle a simple conversation because she has lady parts.gtIm going to them for advice because when I grow up and get married I dont want to be cuckolded because my wife sees some really attractive guy and loses respect for me when she realizes how weak I am.Your problem is that you cant imagine that you can trust a women enough to be faithful within the confines of your relationship.

6150821,0,t1_cyoc02s,The big names always come in and hamster their way into stating that it is never ever TRPs fault. Hubby didnt do it right or he did it right and its the womans fault hurray!A few of them have mentioned they do not consider his wife to be a cunt then change the topic. Im assuming this is from members who can recall they slammed the dude in the first place for doing it wrong and dont want to be called out on this later. Because everyone else seems to have a very short attention span  what theyre saying now you go guy! is at odds with their initial response to him you fucked up.What did they think was going to happen? Why is divorce considered to be a failure and bad option? As a child of finallydivorced parents who argued incessantly I wish theyd done it a LOT sooner. My youngest sibling is probably the best adjusted because her memories of my parents being together are vague. But whenever a guy posts on MRP about having been divorced and saying he feels free and that there is an alternative solution to MRP not only is he heavily downvoted for having his own perspective he is insulted. He is told that his freedom will disappear hell never get to see his kids whom he has posted about sharing custody with that another woman will screw him over while his exwife continues to screw him over until the end of time. And Im putting it the polite way.So much for interpret MRP your own way that apparently is allowed on the board but in reality isnt. Their lack of accountability is one of the most repugnant aspects of the sub and thats saying something given the content. The like analogies so heres oneImagine subs were rooms filled with real people. A lurking merper bides his time in the rooms called rrelationships and rdeadbedrooms sees someone theyd like to recruit and quickly tells the guy come over to MRP and well give you real help I promise! before the MRPer is kicked out of the roombanned.The merper leads the new guy into the MRP room where theres a gun on the table. Most of society frowns upon the use of this gun because its known to frequently have negative consequences the gun has the potential to control the users mind it is inconsistent in terms of when it goes off and its trigger is enticing because its mere existence reduces the individuals cognitive dissonance and justifies his anger. The merper leaves the new guy alone in the room with this awesome forbidden new gun with the parting shot that the guy can use the guy however he likes but sometimes it takes years for this gun to work properly. New guy picks up the gun gets overly excited about all its unique features has the assurance of a large group of men behind him about using it quelling moral fears feels like hes seen the light and his life becomes entirely about using this gun. Then a few months later he realizes his wife doesnt like the gun. Hes been practicing using it on her. Hes using it on her often and wont explain to her where he got the gun. His partner is of course confused about why this mysterious gun has all the power now. Shes not allowed to look at the gun properly because the power of this gun is only allowed to be used by men no women are allowed in the MRP room or to use this gun let alone acknowledge its existence. A few months on the guy finds the MRPer who originally introduced him into the MRP room and points out that the gun seems faulty. The new guy says the gun is making his partner grow distant which is weird because the gun is supposed to make her love him more. Thats why hes been using the gun excessively since he obtained it he has a right to use it it will fix everything in his life and since he sees his partner as a problem hes been using it mostly on her. Ahhh sighs the MRP guy. You used it too often and too quickly. Thats on you.But the new guy says You said this gun would fix all my problems.MRP returns with I also mentioned that theres a small instruction booklet you should read. It sounds like you didnt read it. You have to wait a while to use the gun.The new guy reacts with impatience For your information Im halfway through reading the instruction guide but the gun totally connected with me as soon as I had it in my hands and you told me I could do whatever I liked with it. I did what felt right.MRP guy I told you it would take years to work. I didnt think youd go on a shooting rampage.New guy You said it takes years to work for SOME people. For me it spoke to me straight away and fixed all my emotions. Are you saying I shouldnt use the gun on my wife at all? Isnt that the point of this gun in the first place?MRPer Well yeah.... but Im also saying you need to use it at the right time and place.New guy What is the right time and place?MRPer Thats up to you but come to think of it... youre using it wrong so you need to stop using the gun for a while. Take a step back drop the gun and think about it for a bit.New guy more impatiently But the gun is the point of the whole thing. The gun told me Im the most powerful and correct person in my social group. Why shouldnt I use it?MRP guy Well use it but.... where is your wife now?New guy Shes staying with family and says Ive changed for the worse.MRP guy You should have used the gun on her differently. Your situation isnt my fault.New guy But you encouraged me to use it!etc etc etc....... conversation goes nowhere helps no one lack of accountability annoys the new guy but he knows his gun is the best thing that ever happened to him and this MRP guy is wrong. Hell use it when the hell he wants because that was written in the instruction manual too the part that he read. If hes not in control of the gun and leaves it lying around the house indefinitely his wife or someone else might pick it up or notice it. So he keeps it on his person at all times and uses what it tells him to make decisions. At the end no one is held publicly accountable except for the guy who naively jumped at the gun that someone encouraged him to use. In reality its not just the guys fault. Its also the fault of every guy whos encouraged him to use it. And the guy who introduced it to him in the first place.See BP can do parables too!PS Any MRP member who fails to acknowledge that the teachings and misapplication of these teachings has nothing to do with them is like Tom Cruise endorsing Scientology all the while acting like Scientologys lessthanadmirable behaviour Operation Freakout brainwashing separating families labeling the rest of society as less intelligent than the Scientologist ignoring cases of abuse leading to death doesnt exist. ,TheBluePill,cyos8mp,12,t5_2vzvv

A couple of us encouraged her to post more. Through some PMs it became clear that she was trying to understand what her husband was doing and why and that she was not a fan of the Red Pill. I and a couple of others asked her several times to post her own story then asked her to get her husband on for his side of the story.    ampnbsp    Thats not troll behavior. It is a couple who had a hard time communicating until now. Their problems preceded the red pill. His attempts to apply red pill ideas added a new set of problems. Theyre moving past it now and I honestly think theyll be stronger for it. ,TheBluePill,cypw1wv,2,t5_2vzvv

For all its flaws as far as I know childfree limits itself mainly to just a hatred of children.That is a pretty big flaw though. Rampant sexism and misogyny on MGTOW is bad certainly since as I often say so many of them seem like one bad day away from going Elliot Rodgers but a lot of childfree people seem like villains from a Roald Dahl story.

Meanwhile Dear Leader Mao was living in a walledoff palace having sex with hundreds of virgins and mass murdering on an epic scale an estimated  million people were purged in China during his reign. That sounds a lot more like Hell than Utopia and yet people never fully woke up. Thats how powerful the Blue Pill can be.Ah yes great comparison. clearly all this feminist propaganda about teaching men that the vagina doesnt get stretched out from sex is going to lead to mass murders. gtAt the Red Pill we note that women prefer Alpha males who have strong mental Frames and access to abundant resources. The Blue Pillers however decide that this facet of reality is mean since it suggests some men lose out and women like being submissive and therefore try to Progress away from it by going deeper into their feelings about how things ought to be.Women like a confident guy who can take care of himself. Does anyone ever argue this? I feel like its always MGTOW and Incels that complain that women have these standards not blue pillers. Also insisting all women like to be submissive is pretty fucking dumb.gtYou can be a Blue Pill beta who campaigns for equality all you want  women will never be turned on by you.I doubt any man here expects women to throw themselves at them because they believe in equality.

8786591,0,t1_d73bp1w,While I believe youre trying to take a nonbiased approach to this issue I had to downvote you due to overall disagreement and some issues with your claims.Perhaps my response to your comment can clear things up.gtWomen are very catty to each other.And they are also very good to each other. Studies show often that women tend to keep strong social networks and close friends confiding in each other often in later life more than men which is actually one reason men tend to commit suicide more often comparative lack of emotional support.My point?In all honesty Im pretty irritated by statements such these cuz especially the way youve phrased it cuz they totally ignore all the good female friendships and all the positives of female friendship that male friendships may not have. Women CAN be very to catty to each other is very much true and would probably be a much more accurate statement but you seem to be making it out as if thats all they are to each other which I think is very dishonest and actually kinda offensive. Its very black and white.And while Im aware there are plenty of catty women that are mean to others  believe me Ive seen them  its not as ugly as the multitude of violent crimes and wars being done against people...by men. Most men are killed and raped by other men. The statistics and data show it. Is that not ugly as hell?One could just as easily say men are very cruel to each other I mean think about it. Am I wrong?Its not like men are much better at all on the whole. gt I fully believe they do it as much as men do. I certainly dont think they do it more than men I presume you agree more or less with this notion?Also the study that I believe youre referring to if its what I think youre talking about is pretty flawed. For starters its difficult to say just what percentage of the Twitter users that received the misogynistic Tweets were female themselves. Twitter which does not ask users to identify their gender when they sign up for an account is very unreliable when it comes to providing analytics about how its userbase breaks down according to gender.When youre talking about misogynist harassment its very important to center the targets of that harassment mostly women and hold the perpetrators accountable for their own behavior. The idea that misogyny is worse when coming from women fails to hold harassers accountable and fails to center targets of misogynist harassment.Describing misogyny as people tweeting slut and whore at you is akin to saying that misogyny is really just calling people nasty names. From a woman herself men specifically have harassed several dozen women I know personally by threatening them with death and rape and by making their hidden identities public to enable more harassment by more bad actors also almost always men.While slurs and pejoratives are undoubtedly a problem its difficult to say whether a study that doesnt account for the most vicious kinds of attacks that women regularly experience online is really all that reflective of reality. In order to really understand where misogyny is coming from you have to cast a much wider more sophisticated net.There has been no solid evidence at all that most misogynists are women as guys like to claim online or offline. tldr  To suddenly shift all this blame onto women absolves sexist men. gtPeople are critical of each other.Very true Im in total agreement with you on that one.,TheBluePill,d73zwm6,0,t5_2vzvv

But this guy seems like a complete loser so if this actually happened which I highly doubt and she got safe consensual sex out of it  thats just a net positive. Even if she had a ONS stand with him I highly doubt she would be sweating for a relationship with some creepy loser who desperately needs validation from other losers on a hate group forum so she came out the winner in terms of twerp economics in this exchange.

I can guarantee the only socalled feminists youve ever spoken to are either tumblr idiots or youre getting your information that two drunk married people having sex is rape from your incel forums. Feminists dont think thats rape. When someone is so drunk theyre incapable of making decisions thats rape. The law says its sexual assault to touch someone inappropriately without permission your opinion doesnt matter. Let me guess you wont trust anything that goes against your opinion? Sure the BBC is warped in a variety of ways but its a lot harder to fake a documentary than it is to write a bullshit article. Heres your whole argument I dont read much about it or look for any evidence therefore it must not be true. Do your research before you come here and claim feminists do this and do that whilst society does different. Holocaust jokes are prevalent. Do you even go outside? Dark humour is everywhere. And yes yes it is. Media is a massive part of our society we learn from media we shape opinions from media. When you have people joking about raping people online it becomes seen as a joke and that its tolerable to threaten to rape someone. Lets threaten a victim until shes too scared to go to court and ignore that the president elect may have raped her whilst she was . Our society treats rape and its potential victims very seriously right? Any google search is just words. By that theory you cant exactly believe almost everyone you see on the internet. Yet your views on feminism and rape seem to be very much in line with the average misogynistic you see on TRP MGTOW and incels. You go by reported rapes most reported rapes are from people the victim knew. Its blatantly obvious that theres a lot of unreported rape. Your argument isnt that at all. There are NFL players which have been done for sexual assault which have been accused of rape and theyre still loved. A recent footballer in the U.K. was done with rape a few years ago and still people were claiming the girl was a liar and stating how she ruined his life. But sure we hate rapists. Youve brought absolutely nothing to the table apart from the most cliched arguments which are in line with the uninformed views of feminism.

10327593,0,t3_5nu75r,Well personally Im not especially attracted to her but.  This article is racist as fuck.. Attraction is subjective. Like I think Lady Gaga and M.I.A. and Porcelain Black are friggin gorgeous. My friend Arjun is more of an Emma Watson guy. My friend Nick has the hots for the professional wrestler Rosemary. And evidently the Finnish judges are attracted to the new Miss Helsinki. Contrary to what twerps would have you believe its not all biotroofs.. This article is racist as fuck.. Most people arent especially attractive in Finland and around the world. If you think only hotties can be true Finns then youre gonna disqualify most of the population.. RoK seems to be linking Miss Helsinkis African heritage to her purported lack of attractiveness. And thats bullshit. Like even if Im not attracted to Miss Helsinki...have you seen Rihanna? Or Lupita Nyongo? Or Lil Kim before all her facelifts? Or even the super lightskinned but still halfblack Natalia Kills? They can get it. They can all get it. But hey what can I say?

10349712,0,t3_5o73n7,Let me preface this by saying Im honestly furious right now.  If this comes across as too strong I apologise.  Now on to the mockery!  Its not mockery actually.  Its just straight up rage.gtLong story short... went to bedroom wife was reading started seducing her. You know when people are reading they usually want to be left alone.  So they can you know continue READING!gtShe stated very firmly no Im reading and I want to read. Indeed.  This of course is the end of the story?  No means no after all.  Anything after this point is assault.gtI STFU and continue. ... Well congratulations dear youre in the process of committing a felony.gtNow she states very strictly and seriouslyWhat are you doing? How dare you just ignore that I dont want to have sex!? No MEANS no.  Surely NOW you stop?gtI hesitated for a split second. So you are in possession of some small bit of conscience!  Good.  This of course is the end of it?gtNo means no right? Yes.  Yes it does!  This is good.  Stop now and youll have avoided raping your wife.gtThats what weve been told over and over again... However I giggle and continue. So youre going to rape your wife?  Youre going to actually FUCKING RAPE YOUR FUCKING WIFE?  While fucking GIGGLING?gtFew minutes later we are having sex.Few minutes later youre raping your wife you piece of shit!  Youve committed a violent CRIME!  Youre a criminal!  People go to jail FOR FUCKING YEARS for the shit you just pulled!gtA day later Im watching a movie she goes to bed with a book saying goodnight. Oh shit theres more.gtI say ohh... so youll be reading again I come in a minute. Youre disgusting you know that?  Youre actually FUCKING well DISGUSTING!gtShe laughed but said quite seriously no Im going to read. Please tell me you listened.  That you didnt actually rape your wife two days in a row?gtSo I go to bed shes already turned off the light. Please?  Could you just... not be THAT fucking EVIL?gtI start touching her and again No I want to sleep. ... Fucking hell you are that fucking evil.gtI ignore and continue. Yeah youre good at that.  Of course basic human decency completely escapes you but hey!  You got your dick wet!  Thats all that matters right?gtAgain shes quite seriously upset how I disregard her. Well its not like rape is a pleasant experience!gtVery serious tone. Then fucking LISTEN shit for brains!  Why wont you fucking LISTEN!gtAgain I ignore and a few minutes later we are having sex.You raped your wife two nights in a row.  Youve committed two acts of rape.  AT LEAST!  And against the woman you promised to love and cherish for the rest of your life!  That woman!  THAT WOMAN!gtHuh. Fuck you.gtSo thats what a shit test is? No thats what a rape is.  Shit tests unlike rape arent fucking REAL!gtThis was no LMR was way more serious. Actually LMR isnt real either.  Its just another way of avoiding the truth.  When someone doesnt want to fuck you and you fuck them anyway?  Its called RAPE!  Rape you turd!gtIn some countries that would be basically called a rape rest assured it was NOT a rape.This is rape in EVERY country that recognises marital rape as a crime.  Hell in the spirit of honesty this is rape by even the strictest most backwards genderspecific statute of rape you could POSSIBLY think of!  You raped your wife you disgusting creep!  Youre a fucking RAPIST!gtHave I not watched bluepills profs videos a few weeks back I would have missed it. As if I needed more proof that TRP fucking NEEDS to be booted THE FUCK off Reddit.gtBut even after reading the books etc when I saw his video describing how women dress slutty and then tell you to fuck off when you approach them and thats basically a shit test... woha... Shit tests arent real.  Women dont dress slutty.  Because theres no such thing as sluts.  If a woman has dressed up in whatever way you deem slutty thats for reasons you dont know nor do you need to know.  Maybe she wanted to attract a man.  Maybe not.  If she turns down your advances rest assured she DID NOT want to attract YOU.  Because shes not fucking attracted to you!  Fucking get it through your thick fucking skull you shitstain shes NOT fucking ATTRACTED to you!gtAll my life Ive been a shitty man.And now you can add rapist to that.  Things just keep getting better for you dont they?gtI believe there is a real cognitive dissonance in a woman though. I believe youre hamstering to avoid facing up to the fact that youve recently raped your wife.  Twice.  At least.gtI believe she really kinda wants to say no but a man who ignores that is what makes her wet. A woman getting wet is roughly as meaningless as a man getting an erection.  Slick does not imply consent.  Youre going to hamster harder than that Im afraid.gtKinda also explains all the rape fantasies over at rsex.The key word here is fantasy dipshit.  In reality rape is a felony.  Its a serious violent crime that people get years in jail for committing.  Hell go back a few centuries and rape would have landed you a date with the hangmans noose!  Rape isnt fucking sexy!  Women dont want to be raped!gtHowever doesnt that mean that we as a society are basically screwed? No its just you hamstering again dear.  Most people listen to and respect their spouses thank you very much!gtThe average joe out there will go out of his way to please a woman and as a result she is only going to be disgusted by him. The average joe understands the concept of no very well.  As do you dear.  You just chose to ignore it thats all.  Congratulations!  Youll always be a rapist now!  Always!  Go you!gtOn the other hand TRPMRP is on a very thin ice and a woman could easily set a trap and call it a rape after the fact...Oh dont worry.  There are no traps here.  You raped your wife.  You did that.  Youre a disgusting creep who raped your wife.  Thats the whole story.  Fuck you MRPer.  You have no value as a human being.May your shoes forever pinch and may your underwear forever wedgie.QED.,TheBluePill,dch77dg,41,t5_2vzvv

There are a zillion selfhelp modalities out there based on those same three things. Red Pill certainly wasnt the first time theyd encountered these ideas. I mean shit Im pretty sure abundance mentality is from a Stephen Covey book. They only reason they latched onto this one instead of the others was because none of the others resonated with their wack ideas about women and dating. Red pill finally validated the misogyny that has always lived inside them and so the motivation to stop being a socially inept slob followed.

Its easy to get sucked up into the machine because it presents a facade as a cureall for loneliness and low selfesteem. They dont think about the harm theyre causing others because the machine has convinced them that they themselves are all that matters.If anything you should hate the machine.And yes some of them are narcissistic or sociopathic assholes you shouldnt care for them.

Also I hope you folks dont mind because Im going to summon the guy who wrote the above comment because its directed at folks like him. uUltramegasaurusThe debate over women in tech is a complicated one. Some say there is so much sexism in the idustry that of course it turns away women other say that women just arent cut out for it. Now in a vacuum it would be difficult to tell which is the case but luckily for us we dont live in  a vacuum and we have other countires to compare ourselves to. Lets do that shall we?This article talks about women in the European tech industry and it discovered a pretty interesting correlation. The more women in tech a nation has the healthier its economy. This goes across the board pretty much you can almost gauge how good a nations economy is by looking at the amount of women in tech they have. This isnt some random coincidence either this a finding thats backed by economic theory too. More women in techgtMore women in high paying jobsgtMore people with money to sparegthealthy economy.The real talking point here I want to bring up is that none of these countries tech fields are suffering either. There is even tons of speculation that the future is in European tech Now lets get back to the old sexism vs. Women cant do STEM argument. By now I hope Ive convinced you that the latter argument has been thoroughly debunked. You know that thing that Sherlock Holmes said?

11569018,0,t1_dg7cfav,Thats a good question. It varies. I personally find Terps pretty dull. Most of them are kids. I told a girl in a bar Im a strong independent male who dont need to buy no drinks for females will she go home with me?.... Nope. Its all pretty childish even if some of it is very very dark. Merps are more interesting to me. Most of them arent liferwoman haters. Those types dont tend to marry in the first place. So at one point they did see a future that involved a partnership with a woman then.... something happened. My conclusion so far is that that something is usually horrific reasons for getting married in the first place shes hot and I want guaranteed sex My family expected it I thought I was supposed to do it I wanted unconditional adoration to make me feel whole etc. CRASHING into the real life work of being a team with another human. But the reason I say the number varies is because the sub gets positively infested with trolls. Many of them come from the regular Red Pill side where they are antimarriage to the extreme because they believe if women can get married they will be less likely to get their free sexslave mommy maid brood marestay at home dependent unmarried baby momma they can put out door the second she displeases them. They are right. No woman who didnt hate herself would submit to building a partnership contingent on blackmail if she knew a contract existed that could offer her SOME stability. Anyway I digress. You want to discourage marriage so you can hopefully get a sex slave. Whats a good way to prevent men who reads Reddit from getting married? Pop on over to the married sub and make up some horror story. I was a good boy and instead of giving me my tendies my wifemommy cheated on me with Chad oh noz!! Never marry guys! She took ALL my legos in the divorce settlement and the judge called me a cuck!... Or something. But yeah. This is actually why I quit reading the sub semiregularly. Troll infestation.

They just have a bit of entitlement that its all going to go their way. My brother in law observed years ago that lots of guys say theyll only settle for a supermodel but the reality is rather different. They havent really had a reality check being that theyre in uni being taken care of by Mum and Dad. They havent even moved out of home yet.,TheBluePill,dg7gh8i,3,t5_2vzvv

11585055,0,t3_659q06,gt Mind you in a LTR there will be times when she legitimately doesnt want PIV sex at a given moment because reasons. In a healthy relationship shell offer alternatives andor conspicuously make up for it soon.I genuinely think that most men do not understand what it means to be penetrated.  It can be painful and take time to work up to it can be an unpleasant feeling and it can also be connected to feelings of being taken advantage of being degraded etc.  The men on TRP in particular because theyre typically only interested in assplay with them doing it to women just have no concept of how or why a partner might not feel like being penetrated at a particular moment.  They dress it up as women naturally being the penetrated partner and its unnatural for men so conveniently they never have to learn what it feels like or deal with icky feelings about what penetration can mean.So Ive got vaginismus dont do PIV dont want to either and I am so so tired of the idea that PIV or penetrative anal sex is the only way that sex counts.  If it really is a form of affection connection bonding then there should be lots of ways that sexuality can be expressed.  If your partner has to literally pushslap your hands away and its not a dynamic youve established as actual play maybe you should be reevaluating the way you interact with them.  Someone who feels that they have to defend themselves from your advances is unlikely to be like yay sex! later.gtI got a speech from my girlfriend about when we go to the cinema I go to watch the film we are not going to the back and there will not be any making out.  Back then I believed that if she accepted the title of girlfriend it would mean she would behave like a girlfriend. Lesson learned.  Silly cow should have jerked me off in the back row  Id have fallen in love and married her instead of staying single finding TRP spinning plates and having an independent and free life.  So yeah I really should thank her some day. I bet Id get the Ive missed you so much while banging Chad and I always recently wished I could get your money together with you someday.Uh nice fantasy bro.  Im sure thats exactly what would happen.,TheBluePill,dg968mw,15,t5_2vzvv
