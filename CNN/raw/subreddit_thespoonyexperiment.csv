9285012,0,t1_d8sp4la,I want to say its possibly to do with content? Im not sure about this anymore because for example pumpkinhead and ultima he sidnt play he just used someone elses footage. Also since he is radio silent we cant ask him ourselves.,thespoonyexperiment,d8sxxtz,1,t5_2t2hs

9342689,0,t1_d908h9u,Yeah but anything thats not good by his definition he spends  hours complaining about it. Its not even entertaining by the  minute mark. Not only that but spoony bitches about EVERYTHING. Very infrequently does he speak positively in regards to something unless its actually dogshit and he tries to act like its so bad its good.,thespoonyexperiment,d909436,2,t5_2t2hs
9471661,0,t1_d9g0wbm,Yeah I understand that and I agree that Spoony should at least have mentioned it. Still they could have gone with various alternatives such as having the Avatar suffer from memory loss or just picking a completely new avatar what with the last Avatar doing such a good job in Ultima .  Then again I have never played Ultima  so maybe that is exactly what they did and Spoony failed to mention it ? ,thespoonyexperiment,d9gl5g5,2,t5_2t2hs
9547247,0,t1_d9ptssy,Dunno how factual this is so Take this with a grain of salt.I heard that they almost got kicked out because of that incident and got banned from E as well. That Angry Joe had to practically beg to be allowed back to E,thespoonyexperiment,d9pw8mq,2,t5_2t2hs
9743048,0,t1_daca6ae,He kind of does hate everything though. He even made a joke about it himself in...I think it was the final Ultima review. Im just gonna stick to movies and games I DO like! Like...like...........shit...goes back to playing ,thespoonyexperiment,dae1jzv,1,t5_2t2hs

10017227,0,t3_5izox2,Spoony attacks Trump Trump supporters Hillary supporters and third party voters. Im not even joking.

10059948,0,t3_5jtfha,Its amazing how much of a shameless suck up he is. I saw a video on youtube where someone cant remember who was discussing spoonys history when jackson commented that he was not impressed by what he heard. All that guy seems to do is digitally toss spoonys salad. Thats exactly what spoony DOESNT need sycophants who encourage his behaviour. Scarlett started this crap and thats when many of us believe spoonys downfall began.,thespoonyexperiment,dbiu39r,5,t5_2t2hs

10765468,0,t3_5tw8lx,He streamed it and got salty as fuck because he kept dying. He is basically the new darksydephil mimus the continuous streaming. He was also playing SOTFS which is the remixed harder version so the advice people were giving him was also bad. So people would tell him to go somewhere to locate something it wouldnt be there he would throw a temper tantrum then get bitch slapped and die.He also went to the harder path so again his own fault. All while playing he was insulting the storyline that is in the game so he was pissing  off the DaS  community and doing his best DarkSydePhil impression without realizing it. He continues to get stomped in the game and hitching and eventually rage quit at the end of his stream all the while everyone told him what to do.,thespoonyexperiment,ddqdmhi,6,t5_2t2hs

11623177,0,t1_dgdcmze,He has switched from Mountain Dew to beer? You know if hes drinking all the time that would really explain his behavior. I know April says they dont drink but shes a goddamned bald faced liar because weve WATCHED THEM DRINK IN VIDEOS with the most notorious for me being Breaking Dawn . Im pretty sure he was getting his drink on in Breaking Dawn  as well...that was such a long Vlog that I never rewatched it. I do remember that Bored Volturi idea though. That was a good idea. Seriously though maybe it all boils down to him being a mean useless alcoholic. Would explain his deteriorating health and appearance too. ,thespoonyexperiment,dgdhy7b,4,t5_2t2hs
