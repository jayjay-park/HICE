9477777,0,t3_5alb51,Wait till the jeep is cold and shake the exhaust. The only thing to rattle is the exhaust brackets or heat shielding. Theres nothing in a exhaust to destroy with raw exhaust. Its just metal and in some cases fiberglass to further dampen the noise. Id say a bad install is more likely to blame.,WranglerYJ,d9hc9ba,5,t5_38uop

11377944,0,t1_dflc8y4,yes and no     While the spring perches are on the bottom like a YJ They arent in the right position and will pull your springs inward if you try to fit the axle. This will wear out your bushings in your spring eye and your shackle. If youre alright with that then sure its a very easy swap. ,WranglerYJ,dflo5zl,1,t5_38uop
11613358,0,t1_dgc5tya,It might just be a blown head gasket which would be fairly straightforward to fix. Drain the coolant and oil take off the valve cover undo hoses connected to the top of motor undo intake and exhaust manifolds undo head bolts. While the head is off either inspect it yourself or bring it into a local machine shop to take a look at. You should be able to get a gasket either online or you local parts store then put the new gasket on and do all the steps in reverse. If there is something wrong with the head first step is figuring out if it carborated or injected you should be able to tell by looking at it.  If its carborated it should have an air cleaner right on top on the right side of the engine. If its fuel injected getting a new head is easy any . head from a Cherokee Grand Cherokee should work. Finding a carborated head would be a bit harder.,WranglerYJ,dgcdu3z,5,t5_38uop
11673506,0,t3_66jxnz,You can get some new portals but they dont work on leaf springs so you are going to have to downgrade to coil springs. Which would make  a sad YJ. ,WranglerYJ,dgj7i3r,0,t5_38uop
