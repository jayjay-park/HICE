11353039,0,t1_dfitxp0,Yep! Im still way jealous of you as well and wouldnt hesitate to buy one.  I test drove a new  STI when it first hit the dealer and was blown away. That was a pretty raw aggressive car. The not so impressive audio system didnt matter because you couldnt hear it anyway. The new ones seem much more civil but still just as powerful. ,subaruimpreza,dfiugqd,1,t5_32wyb

11496684,0,t3_63zzla,Its just the Boxer rumble. Not really a rumble on the Impreza just sorta noisy to start since it idles high to warm up. The Forester does the same thing. ,subaruimpreza,dfz5cxs,4,t5_32wyb

11572557,0,t1_dg7gov9,The cruise control will use the EyeSight sensors to maintain a constant distance at X speed from the vehicle in front of you. So if you set it for  and you come up to a car in front of you going  your car will slow down on its own and match the car in front at . When it moves out of the way or you change lanes around it the car will then speed up to  again. Likewise if that car in front drops from  to  the car will match it. If that car in front comes to a complete stop so will your car. By the way the following distance decreases as speeds decrease.At a complete stop the system will stay on for like five seconds before beeping at you to prompt you to take over. But if the halt is very short like just a couple seconds it does stay engaged.But just like every other cruise control system if you apply brakes yourself at all it disengages entirely. But if you apply your own acceleration the system will stay engaged and take over again if you use it to pass another vehicle.If its a question of how to set it theres a little button on the righthand side of the controls on the steering wheel. Just press it and youll see an indicator turn green on the indash screen. From there you use the updown button on that right side to adjust speed.For what its worth Ive found it to be awesome for rushhour traffic. It really relieves a lot of fatigue. Get on the highway find your lane then just set it.,subaruimpreza,dg7r7ck,1,t5_32wyb

11642211,0,t3_6630qr,Hey jaws which trimoptions are you looking for?  I picked up my premium weyesight for less than invoice but heres my advice for you.  First Id see if you can get an ambassador coupon from a Subaru ambassador.   I believe you can find them in forums on facebook...   not sure where else but that saves you  and since this is your first Subaru youre a perfect candidate.  Second Id get a quote from Heuberger Subaru out of Colorado   I believe theyre the highest throughput dealership so they give great prices.   Since youre out of region you have to pay an additional  but it could still save you overall.   I prefer to deal with dealers locally in case I run into any issues.  For me due to past experiences the closer the better   I used Costco pricing which is supposed to be  over invoice and then they texted me saying theyd sell for a lower price.   If you PM me Ill send you the specifics as far as who Ive dealt with any my thoughts.  Good luck!  ,subaruimpreza,dgfnpfl,1,t5_32wyb
11654097,0,t1_dggyn71,Yeah thats been my issue. I use microfiber for everything but it doesnt work at all on the soft touch leather stuff with how sticky it is.,subaruimpreza,dgh08os,1,t5_32wyb
11751956,0,t1_dgrvi0e,I got behind a BRZ or FRS once that had a set of flaps but they really did flap like even without going very fast. But to each their own! I was talking about just a straight up rear end pic so you can see the flaps and the entirety of the car is all.,subaruimpreza,dgs43r0,1,t5_32wyb
