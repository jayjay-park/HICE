2856066,0,t3_2sprd6,I started cruising when I was around . I live in NYC but have stopped. Anyway squirt.org has all the basic places in NYC. Ill rank the places from the most attractive men to the...lesser attractive crowd.. Grand Hyatt Hotel Businessmen type and were generally healthy and not morbidly obese but if you dont blend in you might run into trouble with the staff. . Columbus Circle Hipstery types and generally younger guys but one security guard was constantly on watch and creeping from stalls last I saw. I had overall the best quality of encounters there but the security risk I heard about made me not come back.. Central Park behind the boat house Well I mean you got a mix of everything here but a lot of old dudes. I had a few nice encounters here but there was a lot of old guys hanging around and being very obvious.. Grand Central This was my first encounter but this place is consistently flooded with a lot of old dudes and usually the same ones over and over. I think I only remember like  instances of young guys being here. There was also a VERY old Hasidic Jewish guy that would sit there with one eye coming from the stalls. You also cant do much here but check each other out. This place is next to the Grand Hyatt so you can go back and forth. . Macys Fulton Mall This place had it going on but it was just grimy. I dont mean to be racist but the majority of dudes here were black which I didnt mind but they were quite obvious and very fat. I think anyone who knew nothing about cruising would immediately feel uncomfortable with the amount of largely unattractive men lingering around not even hiding what they were doing. The neighborhood isnt great. Other stuff Gyms? Never saw anything happening and was too afraid to really Start something myself. Penn station? Never saw anything either and the bathroom was difficult to find every time. Prospect park? Better off going to Central Park due to safety.,gaycruising,cnsqgym,2,t5_2uida

4702442,0,t1_cth9fwc,Squirt is a great resource for finding cruise locations but I find its less helpful beyond that. But location is a lot of it. Anyway for your city there are  listings of varying qualitythat should be a good starting point.Or are you looking for a more general howto kind of guide?,gaycruising,ctna46b,2,t5_2uida
5243928,0,t3_3mknq9,mine had to be one day I was just off campus and had an older guy offer to suck me. I let him but then had a younger guy walk up and unzip. I just leaned over and sucked. We were like  a  guy daisy chain. I came first and then the other came flooded my mouth. A good time was had by all ,gaycruising,cvi2zej,4,t5_2uida
