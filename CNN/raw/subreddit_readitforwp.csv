161071,0,t3_1vxpbg,When designing Readit we chose to have a proper preview image because the thumbnails you usually see in Reddit apps are way too small to be effective. They might as well not be there since you cant tell what is in the image when its made to such small size. Also the feedback what we have received has been predominantly about increasing the font sizes across the app. I have a feeling that on a p devices things should be handles differently. I think I have to get my hands on one of those as soon as possible.,readitforwp,cews1zv,1,t5_2xg2g
