7099900,0,t3_4cs5zz,Your post will be downvoted because this subreddit gets similar questions a lot. Nevertheless of course you can be admitted. There are graduate students from all over the world here many of them from small or unknown universities.  You need more than just GPA and GREs. A good application comes from not only getting as much relevant experience as possible but cultivating good relationships with mentors that will write your outstanding letters of recommendation. Understand the work you did with them as deeply as you can. Take any chance to write about it or present it. Use that to write clearly and insightfully in your application. The letters and your personal statements are the major points of evaluation.  Most of all use this time to think about whether you really need to go to graduate school. Masters programs are expensive. Computer Science is one of the fields least obsessed with education level and more concerned with skills and ability. A company may pay for your Masters once youre hired. A Ph.D is an entirely different ballpark. By the way DO NOT PAY FOR A PHD. Only apply to programs where they provide you a full stipend. It will be researchbased. You have to figure out whether you like this type of work. If you dont you probably dont need a phd and should not do it just for the prestige. Either way dont get hung up on where youre coming from. I know from the outside Harvard seems like some higher plane where all the greatest minds come to convene but its just a place like anywhere else. Focus on doing good work following subjects that engage you and learning as much as you can. It may lead you here or it may lead you somewhere even better. Good luck!,Harvard,d1l58ai,11,t5_2qkkm

7321806,0,t1_d2a7jts,Why do people automatically associate swords with autism? I have a vast sword collection mostly Asian and Old Norse blades which seem to be the main issues and I dont understand how this makes me autistic. Im a virgin yes but swords actually make me MORE likely to get laid. I have had countless conversations with cute cute girls in my classes about the weapons I own. I have been able to speak to women for the first time because they want to know about my Viking Sword or my latest Bamboo handled Katana. I dream of meeting a girl called Anya so I can say I own a Katana but I want a cute Anya that is when I will lose my virginity. But Im not autistic. I buy these swords to use as often as I can. I have many friends.,Harvard,d2aftd5,7,t5_2qkkm

9821346,0,t3_5fvxvj,Parking around Cambridge Common the park not the bar is probably the most readily available parking on a daily basis. It is metered parking  hours max but Ive been able to run out and switch spots between obligations on campus.OR.... park on one of the free parking streets in Allston like Western Ave. Portsmouth Street  Franklin Street etc. and walk  mins.OR... park in Watertown and take the  trollybus  minsGood LuckEDIT If you need permanent parking there are places where you can rent a pretty cheap spot in Watertown like  month compared to  month in Cambridge. The only streets I know you can park everyday for an unlimited amount of time are Portsmouth and Lincoln Streets in Allston but there are a few more in the Lower Allston area aka the area north of I in Allston. Ive parked on Portsmouth street for a month without moving my car. Furthermore watch out for street cleaning signs AprilNovember. Your car will be towed if you forget to move it for street cleaning.Also snow.... prepare for snow. During and after some storms you simply cannot drive. If youre not used to driving in snow and on ice try to have a local friend show you in a parking lot or something. Finally I am originally from Florida and Ive driven in every state east of M.I.M.A.L.. There is no comparison to the level of douchebagery you will find driving in the Boston area. There are reasons why people up here are called MassHoles. Its not all drivers fault though. The fair commonwealth of Massachusetts has built some of the most illogical road networks in the country and some of the most dangerous interchanges. There is a noticeable lack of directional road signs to tell you where youre going and road work will close roads at a moments notice... actually without any notice whatsoever. They pave highways with graham crackers light streets with matches and actively despise turn signals to be fair people in Florida forget to signal too. People are either going  miles under the speed limit or  over and will block hell and creation to make an illegal left turn particularly where JFK st. meets Memorial Drive. Sorry rant over.Like I saidGood Luck,Harvard,danqnzz,3,t5_2qkkm
