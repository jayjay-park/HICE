880416,0,t1_ch47zmj,A registration card is not a title. Your biggest problem right now is going to be getting it registered under your name. Make sure you do that before you spend a dime on fixing it. At this point you have zero evidence that you legally own this vehicle. I honestly dont even know how you will be able to get a title without putting a lien on it. Also keep in mind that if it hasnt been registered in years youre going to owe several hundred potentially thousand dollars in back fees to the DMV. ,BayRiders,ch4cukb,1,t5_2tdan
1187113,0,t1_ci35w29,Definitely down for a ride once I get a bike. I was down in SJ yesterday and amazed at the temperature difference from SF to SJ. You hit the nail on the head. The bikes I like dont tend to be very pillion friendly. That Bonneville does look nice and might be a good compromise.I could see a Grom being fucking amazing in the city and possibly a threat to my future California license. ha,BayRiders,ci363ei,2,t5_2tdan
