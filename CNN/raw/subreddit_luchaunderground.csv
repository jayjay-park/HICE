4687453,0,t1_ctiart7,His acrobatics are nice and usually pretty clean. The back handspring double elbow from the ropes was a little sloppy in its most recent use but hey. Hes also just an underdog story. I dont think anybody expected him to start winning matches and then be a trios champion after his start jobbing to the lower card.,luchaunderground,ctlebgg,1,t5_34ek9

4803859,0,t1_cu00q10,Yeah its not an easy tradeoff its blown me away being introduced to all this talent Id never heard of before but are obscure outside of Mexico names going to bring in new viewers? I dont want to see them paying top dollar for declining exWWE big names but do wonder if thats what its going to take to sustain multiple future seasons. Ultima Lucha might have been better than most of the Wrestlemanias of the last decade but it doesnt mean shit if LU isnt getting numbers. ,luchaunderground,cu02eed,1,t5_34ek9

6467515,0,t1_cznsu8e,I actually really really liked it.  It was awkward but realistically so.  Like knowing the history of everyone involved and their current situations I think the commentary was spoton.,luchaunderground,czoac1p,5,t5_34ek9

7093103,0,t1_d1k9wsj,But he doesnt look powerful as fuck and he hasnt shown any particular agility yet. Having been possessed by a god for that long makes it all the more unbelievable hed have the build he has. Hes like Taz with the moveset and mannerisms of Babyface McBigdumps. Taz was a great wrestler but not with those types of moves. It just doesnt work.I already said he doesnt need to be some  VKM monster. Simply not being dwarfed by the biggest two existing guys would have been enough.,luchaunderground,d1kdepw,-2,t5_34ek9

7261927,0,t1_d22zy01,Yeah Mundos been written kinda oddly this season.  His heel turn in season  was believable and while hed fight dirty hed still at least fight.  It seems like this season they look for any excuse possible for him to run and hide its weird.Granted Id run and hide if Cage were pissed off at me but still.,luchaunderground,d23moug,1,t5_34ek9

7582033,0,t1_d33g292,Yeah but they have shown that Mil is beatable and theyve at least given us reason to believe that Matanza isnt invincible.,luchaunderground,d341g9f,1,t5_34ek9
7648054,0,t3_4jzzov,Kobra Moon is just... I dunno. She just doesnt do anything for me. That first vignette of hers got me really interested. It put the idea in my head that shed be this badass adult version of Gothams Selina Kyle if that makes any sense but then she debuted and shes just this like snake lady. I know its weird to gripe about it in a show with a literal dragon and his timetravelling spaceman best friend but I cant really get into the character. Now that shes getting her own devoted storyline maybe Ill come around. Who knows.,luchaunderground,d3bjijw,5,t5_34ek9
7650917,0,t3_4jzzov,Just finished the episode this morning... Awesome. Lots of story line progression amp the ending was pretty intense too. Daga is quickly becoming one of my favorites the guy can just go amp Im looking forward to them doing a lot more with the guy. Personally a CageMatanza title match would be really good Cage is on a roll amp I dont see any reason why they wouldnt set that match up. Cannot wait to watch next week either.. I love this promotion ,luchaunderground,d3bv7ok,1,t5_34ek9

9417046,0,t3_56z8lk,I literally just started watching it a few weeks ago I love it! Much better than WWE and its good that they have intergender matches. I actually went back and watched all the old seasons. The athleticism puts people like RVD to shame never see Masata a  lb guy doing a moonsault before,luchaunderground,d99ocfn,1,t5_34ek9
9515112,0,t1_d9lxnw4,If they dont mind a bit of blood show them pentagon vs vampiro. Thats my go to deathmatch now for showing newbies deathmatch stuff without freaking them. Mainly because its story driven and looks professional.,luchaunderground,d9lxv3f,3,t5_34ek9

9676221,0,t1_da53rlp,Sexy Star is very much middle of the pack in terms of women in LU but in terms of plot its an even greater thumb in the eye of Dario having this character he hates have the belt. Reigns would eat a finisher go LOL Spear and win. Sexy ate finishers and was given minutes to recover because Mil wanted to beat her to death with tables and chairs instead of just beat her. So next week we have Mundo who Dario hates cashing in the Gift of the Gods vs Sexy Star who Dario HAAAATES that has what he views as Matanzas and by extension his belt.But hey Matanza left AW pissed and shoved Dario out of the way maybe Dario has bigger concerns than Mundo and Sexy Star right now.,luchaunderground,da5spv0,4,t5_34ek9
9819036,0,t3_5ftux6,I wont tell my other grievances but someone who has been spoiled or seen live please tell me the Pentagon storyline gets better.

10111510,0,t3_5jus51,Posted about my fanboy feelings for him a little while ago.
