Im a couple of episodes back Ive only seen  of the  that are currently out but its taken some CRAZY turns that I absolutely did not see coming. But seriously it is frickin unbelievable.McConaughey has been killing it lately. Hes quickly become one of my favorite actors after being such a fluff guy earlier in his career. Mud The Dallas Buyers Club Wolf of Wall Street Magic Mike I know I know the fiancee made me watch it but it was actually a pretty good movie besides all the naked dudes The Lincoln Lawyer and now True Detective.
