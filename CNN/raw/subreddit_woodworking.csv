332140,0,t3_1xw8yj,I would probably recommend moving your router to a separate table for a few reasons. You wont be able to assemble on that table while using it as a router table. The table is freaking huge which will make it hard to make accurate miter slotsfence for the router table. The table will sag too much for accurate routing. Kind of regardless of where your router is mounted get a switch for it to mount on a table leg. Kreg makes a  switch that allows for the router and a shopvac to plug in to be able to control dust as well. To me it just doesnt seem practical or very safe to have a router mounted dead center in your workbench. The workbench on its own looks quite nice though.,woodworking,cff73ms,6,t5_2qlqp

If you use glue alone assuming that you glue it up right get both surfaces flat use even clamping pressure etc. then the glue line is stronger than the wood itself.

Didnt know about scribing to the wall but that sounds really fascinating. Have you done it? As for the middle shelf its  pine not MDF but I like your MDF shelf ideas and unexposed brackets. I wanted to get it set up fast so nailing brackets seemed quicker than dadoing all those shelves plus gave me something to nail the trim into.

I offered to pay the subs cash.  yes cash.  why?  because the building trades are like the mafia.  if your not on their list they will skip you if something better comes along.  you cant blame them for this and I have a couple of friends who are still in the trades and they will admit this is how things work if they are honest.  not knocking anybody because of this but boy they will line up  your door for cash.my price is high but it had to match the house style and siding... the list goes on my wifes part there.  it is what it is.

You cant really use a  film building finish because they dont like getting wet ALL the time but you also have drastic humidity changes daily. I like to finish with watco teak oil. Its not teak oil at all.Its a long oil varnish blend formulated to outdoor applications. Its meant to be refreshed often quarterly is fineConifers are very soft so it will dentdeform easily. If you want to dry it quick cut it into smaller pieces and microwave it. weigh it before and after each trip in the microwave. When it stops loosing weight you are good.

L is roughly  gallons which to me hints that this is most likely not above a HP compressor also meaning that it probably makes somewhere in the neighborhood of  cfm. What is the RPM on the motor.   is ideal but alot of compressors today are coming out with  screamers. EDIT  Reread the post.  Tell me the brand and Ill tell you how much to offer in USD.

You could eat an entire cutting board that has been treated with mineral oil and it wouldnt impart any laxative properties. Ive never heard of a linseed oil allergy. However linseed oil is a poor choice. It is food safe when cured  but you wouldnt want to ingest it before it has cured. Raw linseed oil takes months to cure. Boiled linseed oil linseed oil that has Japan driers added takes several weeks to fully cure.

The only thing that immediately comes to mind is when people use those super thick pour on finishes that leave like an  or  inch coating for a bar or table top. Even then Im sure an Exacto knife or something could easily clean up the recesses to get everything fitting correctly. TLDR Put finish on first then hardware.

Anyone that rents is probably not going to be allowed to rewire their place.  For others it may be cost prohibitive.Im not renting but my house isnt particularly new the breaker box has no room in it and is at its rated capacity even if it had the physical space for more breakers.  Furthermore theres no doing it yourself with electrical work where I live even if you do everything to code the city wont allow it. You have to pay one of the few electricians that have properly bribed the city for the city license and those electricians know they have the towns residents by the short hairs.  So for me to put a v saw in my shop Im first looking at a k bill by the time I pay for the city permit a replacement box breakers wiring and the electricians fees.  Oh and you have to buy all the materials from the electricians at their prices  they refuse to do the work if you buy the materials even if what you buy is exactly what they would show up with.  All for something that I can  and have  done myself in a different town for a few hundred dollars in materials from lowes or home depot a weekend of work and  minutes of the city inspectors time to sign off on the work meeting code.  Then I can consider the cost of the saw.When faced with bullshit regulations the citys licensing crap not general code requirements which Im perfectly ok with designed to protect a corrupt system that  v cabinet saw makes a hell of a lot more financial sense than a cheaper v saw.,woodworking,chn5j6l,2,t5_2qlqp

I ask because right now I do stuff with mostly power tools and what not.  Id like to make the transition to using more hand tools.  And while the prospect of making your own handplane is definitely appealing it is also kinda intimidating.  Like Im already not very good with making the things out of wood Im just a beginner so I am worried that Ill try to make a hand plane it will suck and therefore the things that I try to make with it afterwards will suck.

That said Ive tried it briefly with as little blade as possible and it is cutting but poorly and it gets stuck often. Im not sure if this is due to the blade not being sharp enough which I wont discount.

If you do sand higher youll have to be a little more attentive with your finish since it will absorb a bit slower. Babysit it for a half hour or so after coats and make sure there is no puddling.

The outside you can carefully sand then refinish and it should be fine. Those deeper gouges or soemthing on the left side will be the biggest issue you have and it may be possibly to even that out by some more intensive sanding. That being said Im no expert so unless someone has better suggestions that may be the best bet.Unless you cared to snad down and smooth out rough spots fill in the deeper stuff and prime and paint the outside. Feel like that would ruin the look of the piece though.EDITJust noticed those gouges are where hinges would go for the top I think.

1394704,0,t1_ciqxo0v,gt it could be interesting if I can find some expert in my own neighborhood and pick up the skills quickly.I agree with you on this one theres definitely a potential for kind of a middle market level of classes that arent quite the high level of instruction youd get at Anderson Ranch but still would throw a bunch of helpful information to a newbie and by virtue of being local be more affordable.In terms of where to find potential instructors Ill comment more on the turning side of things since thats what Im most involved in. Just about every major city and some notsomajor ones is going to have a local chapter of the American Association of Woodturners. Heres a link you can visit to find chapters in your area. These informal groups usually hold meetings once a month and theyre likely full of the kinds of people youre looking for locals that are competent but not necessarily famous. Some of them even have listings of people that are willing to teach on their websites. Here for example is the resources page of one of the clubs Im familiar with Rocky Mountain Woodturners and if you scroll down youll see some offerings under classes. Note that two of these people David Nittman and Trent Bosch are toplevel pros. Thats one of the really cool things about the woodturning community a lot of the top players still hang out at their local meeting and youd never know for how down to earth most of them are that youre talking to a guy that just sold a sculpture or a bowl for thousands of dollars.As for how I got started I bought a house about  years ago and wanted a coffee table. I didnt like anything that I saw around and Ive always been pretty artistic so I remembered that my local community college Red Rocks had a fine woodworking program so I thought well Ill just go take a class and build my own! Long story short what had began as a onesemester only build a table and that was it kinda thing turned in to an obsession. I wound up taking about four or five years worth of classes over there just one or two at a time per semester in the evening! Ive also taken summer workshops at Anderson Ranch.So good luck on your effort! There is no replacement for handson classes so if you succeed in bringing that to more people I applaud you. The woodturning community in particular could really use an infusion of young people getting in to it. Im  and Im often the youngest person at any given woodturning event by  years.,woodworking,cir3v3q,1,t5_2qlqp

My coworker ran the shop and I adapted and assisted special needs students especially when it came to written tests they were better at the hands on stuff. I am not sure what degree you would need it would depend on your state but I had my shop background from jr. High and high school and my coworker was ultimately in charge of all shop tools and final decisions in the shop. So the fact that I had a teaching degree was good enough to at least be in there. I had to pass all my safety tests just like the kids. There were  lead teachers in our tech dept. And they did all have construction woodworking and welding backgrounds. So it varies....there are special charter tech and alternative schools too which focus on apprenticeship and skills work rather than all on academics so that might be a field to look into.

1448508,0,t3_2aqnh2,A pocket hole doesnt necessarily prevent splitting its just joinery method where the screws are semihidden. A pilot hole will definitely prevent splitting for the most part. A pilot hole  sizes smaller than the screw pretty much eliminates most splitting unless you happen to overtorque the screw.Thats if you dont mind visible screw heads. You could probably get away with it with black drywall screws and go for a rustic look.If youre comfortable you could dowel the pieces together. Drill  holes about  deep and use lots of wood glue.

I picked up general finishes armrseal and am mixing it with BLO and spirits. I know waterlox probably uses tung oil and not BLO...I do a similar ratio to your suggestion about equal parts of all  a bit less spirits as it seems armrseal is already cut to make it a wiping varnish.  But my current interest is making an oilvarnish blend for outdoors do you have a suggestion for a UV blocking varnish to add to this blend for outdoors?  My plan is to mix up a BLOspar varnish blend initially and maybe use tung oil in the mix in the future if that seems to be better outdoors heard the BLO can bring on mold but its cheap.

I use butcher block oil just because I had it on the workbench but I am sure other things would work. Basically when you are removing the rust by sanding or scribing you are exposing a new surface to air an since there is water present and air you are providing ideal conditions for new rust to form.

1659903,0,t1_cjnmwby,The saw looks like my old garden pruning saw although exactly this type is pictured in the Mechanic exercises so who knows? The teeth have to be of an equal height anyway no matter what. This means that if there is a single tooth shorter than its neighbors  youll have to grind all the teeth to this height. For a good glue up youll need to extract the tote without bruising or destroying it glue it up and then put back. This plane is most probably a fore plane therefore inspect the wear on a sole once again. If its just a wear on that particular corner probably leave it focus more on the planes nose and throat area. Same for the chipout right behind the iron  itll work with it dont touch it yet. Otherwise if the whole sole has hills and valleys plus skewed relatively to sides take some measures.Anyway work in iterations. Sharpen the blade and check shavings for thickness aim for about .. Then you might find a blade doesnt cut full with no matter how you adjust it its time to flatten the sole. Progress gradually remove the biggest areas first so its flat enough. Then check again and repeat until a full irons with is engaged. Then check the plane on the shooting board and go for that wear if you have to. The basic idea is that youre not aiming for a perfect tool but for a tool that works.  ,woodworking,cjoe699,2,t5_2qlqp

1671081,0,t1_cjpjalf,You can fake it with breadboard ends.  They can even be  degree mitred if you choose.  The small end piece has to not be attached to the larger end piece.  In your example you might choose to use a biscuit joiner or just glue to attach the small end piece to only the center board of the three boards that make up the nightstand top.  The longer end pieces will attach to the boards they adjoin but the  degree angle will be a touch fit not glued or attached in any way.In case of expansion all boards will swell and move outward.  The downside of this is that that  degree angle left unjoined will turn into a gap.  The upside is that the piece will not wrestle itself into cracking or splitting apart when it gets humid.These are gorgeous by the way.

To avoid this either season it for a year or two or utilise a consistent species.Alternatively fix your chevrons as a non structural element from underneath and surround it in a strong frame. The boards may expand and try to bend upwards but theyll be resisted by the lower fixing. The boards may shrink in which case retain a few extra bits as shims to patch it up as needed.

1824259,0,t1_ck8zong,Well... You will save some money on materials.  You basically cant buy real wood furniture commercially anymore at least without paying a ton for it.  Its all secondary woods with dark finishes or some sort of finish to hide what it really is.  Ive even seen some things specifically adversized as real popular as if that is something special.  Occationally you will see some maple though.  I can usually build the same piece in cherrywalnutmapleetc for right around the same price or a few hundred cheaper a painted finish or other finish that hidesmasks the wood I can save a lot more.  The last milk paint project I built I copied a commercial piece and saved .  This is mostly because Ive gotten better and better about picking out my lumber at the hardwood dealer and minimizing waste.  When I started Id say it was costing me a few hundred more.  The real issue is all the tools!  Even if I stopped buying them right now and fat chance of that it would take me about  years worth of projects just t break even on what I have into the hobby.  ,woodworking,ck90hgj,3,t5_2qlqp
1826596,0,t1_ck9aezo,Essentially yes. I suppose you could use some carpet tape or other heavy duty double sided tape to adhere it. But gosh that is getting into so much trouble. It just isnt the right tool for the job. When a board goes through the planer it its pinned down by rollers and covered by the housing of the planer. With a router sled youre much more exposed to the workpiece flying at you if something were to go wrong. This danger is magnified the smaller the workpiece is. This is why it is not recommended to route small pieces without a large jig that securely grips the piece. ,woodworking,ck9anqo,1,t5_2qlqp

Hold it flat and watch you domt rock side to side when you go forward and back in long fluid motions. When you are pulling it toward you a little extra pressure on the front end will keep the rear roller from digging in and vice versa. Think about your body position and movements so you can handle the tool with sufficient control and you dont get caught off balance. Check the top surface of the table by looking at the light reflected off it from different angles to look for areas that need more sanding. You can go diagonal to the grain but will have to go with the grain after that. Try it on a practice piece or the bottom first if you want to be cautious. ,woodworking,ckczodq,1,t5_2qlqp

1863571,0,t3_2fxoyf, A sealer the goto clear shellac Zinnser Seal Coat is fine for anything indoors. To color or not?  And there are several ways to color.  Liquid stains not that great an option in my opinion due to their penetrating nature once its in there its in there hard to undo.  Gel stains are more forgiving particularly when put over the top of a sealer.  Then theres dyes and tonerscolored shellacs.  A dye being a concentrated color applied directly to the top of the wood and a toner being a color mixed into another type of finish to give you a semitranslucent effect. Top coat either alone or after color.  Again several options.  An evaporative finish lacquers shellac or a conversion type finish that cures by chemical reaction oil based varnishes catalyzed finishes.Finish preferences and discussions can go on forever everyone likes and uses different things.  Personally I like oil varnishes over tonertype finishes for color in particular colored shellacs.  Colored shellac has a depth that is often seen in antiques that is not easily replicated with more modern finishes.  Other people might hate that look and prefer stains with lacquer on top instead.  And a third group of people might think that any color is blasphemy and the wood should never be anything but its natural color covered with a clear protective finish of some sort.  None of these are right or wrong its a matter of preference. The only universal truths are that you need to test your surface after sanding and before finishing.  Sand it get it to where you think its ready and coat it with alcohol and take a look.  That will show you rough spots without hurting anything the alcohol evaporates and goes away.  Once youre satisfied that youre ready to start applying your finish you need to vacuum wipe compressor nozzle and after you think its done...it isnt so then tack cloth it.  Surgery clean is what youre after and you need a clean environment to work in to keep it that way no window unit blowing dust or any other such thing.,woodworking,ckdr6qj,3,t5_2qlqp

1950318,0,t3_2gzy1z,Hafco quality varies as does Scheppach. You get what you pay for basically. Generally speaking Carbatec branded stuff is higher grade than Hafco but you can pay a lot extra for very little gain.Ive had a Scheppach sawbench which was awful but the Scheppach track saw I have its a rebadged Scheppach sold by Aldi is awesome.Warrantyservice wise theyre fairly good as far as I know.I have a Hafco drill press and its not great but now its tuned up it is at least accurate enough for my uses which includes pen turning so I need fairly accurate holes with some kits being pretty long. I wasnt willing to shell out double to get a higher quality machine with no extra capacityfeatures. Again you get what you pay for  theyre budget. In terms of the budget brands theyre probably a bit better unless youre specifically closer to another store because they have decent support.While Hafco do deliver be aware there will be extra charges for anything above kg because of OHampS requirements from the couriers. They may askrequire you to have a way to remove the machines from the truck. My drill press was kg and they had no problems but the BP is a bit heavier.As neither of those support riser blocks Id go for the BP.  Yes its more expensive but hp stronger motor ! and a little bit more resaw capacity is always nice.Are you anywhere near a Hafco store? Ive only been there once and a long time ago now but they do tend to have most of their machines setup on the floor so you could at least get a feel for the fit and finish.,woodworking,cko7u0x,1,t5_2qlqp

The mortise chisels are so beefy and blocky that when it comes to chopping anything I find myself gravitating toward them. They are REALLY good at transferring the pressure of each mallet strike right into the work. Of course a bench chisel would work just fine but I wouldnt say they work better.

I think a lot of people are lazy?  it is much harder to qsawn lumber.  set aside all the economics of the commercial lumber sense and part time sawyers just cant pull it off a lot of the time.take a step out of the commercial space and start looking for your lumber from craigs list and saw mills.  offer to pay cash for it and take it green.  you can get whatever you want but you will have to wait for it to dry.  sucks I know but Im a serious wood hoarder and its really the only way I have been able to get qsawn in the thickness Im looking .,woodworking,cljtxp2,2,t5_2qlqp

Lacquers are harder but more brittle so wont take knocks as well on a relatively soft substrate. Epoxy coatings are tougher but not cheap. So varnish is totally the finish of choice for those requirements.Traditionally one of the classic ways to finish a workbench was with one or more coats of linseed oil followed by a few coats of shellac.

That way you can assemble and glue the joint then wedge it by pounding in a conical plug while the epoxy is still wet. That will force all the pieces outward taking up any slack and making a very tight joint.I also think you might experiment with regular titebond wood glue modern glues make a joint that is usually stronger than the surrounding wood especially a softwood.

Men and women ought to do that for their partners every chance they get. It makes for a much deeper friendship.Dont worry about surprising him on Christmas morning either. If you arent sure what he wants within your budget simply ask him. Then get it wrap it and put it under the tree. Then get him to teach you how to use it. Who knows maybe the two of you will create fantastic pieces together!Meanwhile...Heres something every woodworker needs but many  especially if new to the craft  dont know they need but once they get one they will use it all the time. Its called a Japanese saw and it is one of the most precise and sharp tools a woodworker can ever hope to own. This one has replacement blades of various fineness of teeth.

2521652,0,t1_cmndrjj,Its really about as simple as it sounds molasses  water wait a day or so for it to get going in warm weather Ive never started it during colder months and then immerse your steel or iron into it and wait it out. The process is the slowest one going minimum is a couple of days but I usually wait at least a week before I check on things. Dont worry about leaving stuff in longer it comes to no harm even if you forget about it for a couple of months.Youre going to want to know about dilution ratio and there is a lot of conflicting information about it online but I think thats because it actually doesnt matter.People who have done  and  will get pretty much exactly the same effect Im certain. I eyeballed the dilution myself and it was way more dilute than  part in  and still worked probably a bit more slowly TBH but if I were in a rush Id be using a different method to begin with. I bought a large jar poured half into a large plastic container then added water until the level was about what it needed to be so I wouldnt get overflow when parts went in. As with other soakin rust removers it turns the red rust into this black sludge that mostly just rinses off the surface under a running tap but a bit of persuasion with an old toothbrush can help for stubborn bits. Where you had thick accretions of rust inside corners and other trouble spots there may be residual rust in which case I would usually soak again but you can treat those with a commercial ruststop if you prefer to get going. After rinsing you have to oil or wax to prevent flashrusting which happens fast. WD is good for the first quick coating but go with machine oil or paste wax for longterm protection.,woodworking,cmnpue8,1,t5_2qlqp

2560946,0,t3_2p2wwi,I dont have answers for everything but in short  Wood glue is generally stronger than the wood itself. Youll typically glue things together and clamp them while drying. Screws generally arent used unless the joint absolutely needs it.In most cases presanding before joining everything together is easier than sanding afterwards. Applying stainfinish before a glueup the actual final assembly isnt usually recommended since glue tends to not stick to most types of finish.For the gaps in wood people generally use what is called a jointer or hand planes to get a flat surface. With a proper jig you could also use a table saw or router table for jointing edges. making edges flat and square Two flat surfaces joined together with wood glue make an incredibly strong joint. For example most table tops are just boards squared up and glued together no screws or anything else. As far as your design goes Im having trouble picturing what youre trying to accomplish. Its common to see woodworkers using a program like SketchUp to layout their design first. Also pencil and paper I suppose. I cant draw a straight line with a ruler so that doesnt work for me.Hope this helps some. ,woodworking,cmsupjk,2,t5_2qlqp

2606687,0,t3_2ppkrc,Its less about the number of passes and more about how much material you remove which is a function of grit and time. For the lower grits I usually will lightly scribble all over the surface with a pencil then start sanding. When all of the pencil markings are gone I know Im done and can proceed to the next grit. For higher grits I sand half of the piece then use my fingers to feel how smooth it is in relation to the unsanded side until I decide its smooth enough to keep going. Theres no specific number of passes or seconds needed it varies by grit sander model the amount of pressure you apply the condition of the wood surface its species and grain characteristics and ambient conditions such as temperature and relative humidity.Sorry that doesnt directly answer your question but hopefully it was somewhat helpful.

Im a guy who uses a  pencil because I wanted a specific combination of lead size a built in sharpener color options blah blah blah. But to take your proverb this is like skinning a cat with a fork and paying x as much to do it. The more I look at it the more I think its not designed to solve the problem OP has. If this is actually intended for the purpose you claim then theyve entirely neglected the fact that your fence still needs to be straight.  To me it looks like the selling points are to reduce friction between your plane and the track and to eliminate or reduce the difficulty in applying consistent lateral pressure towards the material being shot. Again though the fence needs to be just as straight as the track so at best this gets you half way there.,woodworking,cmyy9j9,1,t5_2qlqp

2626307,0,t1_cn1cpg5,Thats definitely possible I dont totally buy that breadboard ends are capable of preventing cupping if the boards really want to but... the idea here is that if your start with a tight joint between boards in the panel when they expand they cannot expand laterally so they cup and when they contract they pull apart. Seems like you would also have to have a poor glue job or bad glue otherwise the boards would likely crack rather than the glue failing. And youd have to have glued this up in the right humidity to get both significant expansion and contraction from your starting point.,woodworking,cn1e7qf,1,t5_2qlqp

2630393,0,t1_cn1voo0,I didnt take any..was mostly flying by seat of pants. To give you an idea I started out planning to use dowels instead of screws. The hole spacing is very important. If you get that wrong it goes in the trash. I threw away a few pieces while building this because they werent bangon. I ganged the two top pieces together for drilling after walking out the hole centers with dividers. The other pieces all had stopped holes for threaded inserts so I made an extra piece with throughholes and used it to mark the centers for all of the holes. I think if I did it again I might try to gang those up too and then plug the holes afterwards. The hardware is brass  threaded inserts washers and screws. Basically whatever I could find at the local hardware store this morning. EDIT most importantly at the end you can adjust it by planing the two reference surfaces that hug the board. First focus on getting them parallel then focus on centering the marker. I spent an hour or so tuning it up.,woodworking,cn1xdfg,2,t5_2qlqp

2713583,0,t1_cnchktr,The looseness you have identified in how the adjusting knob engages with the yoke is called backlash. It is normal however it is much reduced in better planes. You can bend the yoke arms backwards and forwards respectively to reduce the amount of backlash present. Just be careful to not damage anything. Without having your plane in hand I cannot tell what the actual problem might be but it does sound like a badly formed chip breaker. If you need to pull the chip breaker back from the edge of the blade to get things to work that may just be the solution poor though it is. You should look into a replacement chip breakerblade combo or at least try another to see if your plane works with a different chip breakerblade combo. Sometimes the lower cost planes cost less for a reason. Sorry.,woodworking,cnciv2g,0,t5_2qlqp

2793297,0,t3_2s1w85,Woodworking is great because its one of those hobbies where the hobby itself allows you to create tools that improve the hobby. Its a bit of a self improving cycle if you know what I mean. Works with lots of hobbies from programming to blacksmithing and its a really satisfying aspect of any hobby.Being able to useenjoy tools that you created is truly a wonderful experience. Great work on the work table itll be useful Im sure A few things Ive found I like in a work benchtable like this Dont get too fancy with the top. Its nice to have it be easily replaceable so you can be hard on it without worries. You can easily just cut new plywood to replace it later. This is nice because it means getting glue on it or drilling through a workpiece into the top arent a big deal. Hooks along one side for hanging tools and cords. Depends on what kind of work youre doing but its nice to have somewhere to put things other than on the surface even if just temporarily. Power. I often will just fasten a typical power strip to the side. That way you can move the bench to wherever you want to use it and just plug the bench in. Then its much quickereasier to plugunplug tools as needed and you can have more than one plugged in at a time. You can also plugunplug them one handed if needed. A bit of overhang on the top is nice so you can get a clamp on it more easily. I find an inch or so is more than enough. Clamping points are indispensable on a table like this. Maybe something to keep in mind when its time to replace the top. Rounded corners. If you do add an overhang to the top at some point its nice to round the corners. I learned that one the hard way as sharp corners can be a bit dangerous and also just snag cords and clothing more easily.Anyway have fun with it.,woodworking,cnll5mj,3,t5_2qlqp

2805074,0,t3_2s7pkt,thats a tough one.  the split seems to have happened because the design is flawed.  I think if I were doing this I would salvage as much of the hardware and appearance panels as possible including the top hopefully and build a new frame.  It would worry me that if I didnt improve the design the existing flaw would rear its ugly head again soon.Since you dont have many tools your proposed repair might actually work  at least for a while.  and it would definitely be a lot cheaper and faster.  it wont be easy or even really possible to make that repair pretty though.  if youre cool with that I say give it a shot the way you came up with and see what happens.  a rebuild is still possible if option  doesnt work.  perhaps as an improvement on your idea add some countersunk bolts to the repair after everything is dry.  and maybe some steel plates in some spots to help reinforce.

Theres not much wood left by the time youve removed as much stock as in the original casting.  The round opening on the top will have just a bit of shortgrained wood connecting it to the base of the piece and could snap.  If you could find a piece of locust with curved grain approximating the shape it would be a bit more secure.  Thats why I suggested high quality plywood  the crossgrained plies will resist splitting in either direction.  Either material will be very challenging to carve.,woodworking,cnr2uon,2,t5_2qlqp

2862001,0,t3_2sf65z,Up until two years ago when we moved to Pennsylvania we heated exclusively with wood. We started with some indoor wood stoves but eventually made the jump to an outdoor woodstove. The stove looked like a small smokehouse. It was a firebox surrounded by a water case. The water was heated and pumped into the house and into a coil arrangement that fit into the electric furnace ductwork right above the electric heating coils. When heat was needed the furnace fan kicked in and blew air across those heated coils and that got distributed throughout the house. We could easily overheat the house. And some good points...no insects or dirt in the house you could burn almost anything in it since the flue was very short and extremely easy to clean. It would burn for about  hours when loaded up. Obviously there was no fire in the house for an indoor woodstove. Ours could heat two separate areas...the house and something else like a shop. They made some sort of heating unit for a shop so you didnt need a furnace or ductwork in there. One summer I pipe our  above ground swimming pool to it and heated the water there. I got it to  but it sure burned a lot of wood to do that. I would do an outdoor woodstove again no problem.,woodworking,cntet3q,1,t5_2qlqp

If you want some vague idea of how that pans out this is an excellent resource.The easiest ones in terms of conversation are to say block plane number  number  plough plane router plane scraper plane and jointer plane. That will get you by for  conversations.There are some other general terms like low angle but any plane described that way is an offshoot of the above. There are a lot of oddities in the conversation for instance Jack plane can refer to a number  or number  theres a   plane and smoother typically refers to a number  and as youve discovered no consistency on model numbering between manufacturers.But pretty much every model of plane that is likely to come up is some variation of the old StanleyBailey models. Hell if you look through marketing vomit on modern planes almost all of them will refer to the old StanleyBailey models. Theyll say things like Our XYZ bench plane is based on the original Stanley Sweetheart No  with yadda yadda yadda our planes make wood poop gold nuggets.So... if you went into a store and said Im looking for a new number  plane theyll be able to walk you over to whatever their planes are in that basic length and type.Hope that helps!

Soft maple pricing is only slightly more than poplar. Hard maple is a bit more but can be so smoothpalebeautiful when finished. Almost like ivory. And its stiff as hell which is somewhat relevant in this design.The obvious dark wood option is Walnut. Not cheap but dark and beautiful. Cherry will also make a nice contrast with a light colored wood.If this were going in my living room Id use Hard Maple  Walnut with maple for the uprights and the walnut for the topbottom.And I feel that its worth pointing out this project uses a very small amount of materialsmaking a lot of assumptions Im seeing bf.

Im a realist i know my cheapos wont work nearly as well even after hours of sharpeninghoning them since i have no idea what im doing at my current level but i know it can be done.Im not knocking the expensive hardware as with any other field expensive hardware usually has an edge over the cheapest stuff be it build quality lifespan time between sharpenings etc. Still would you say there are tools that are worth investing a bit more money into from the start? Say not to get the  circ saw and a decent blade but to get a  saw? just an example There are some tools especially electrical tools that id rather not buy SH in hope id be able to fixrecondition myself..,woodworking,co61km1,2,t5_2qlqp

At big lumber mils trees are sawn into boards within a few days of them being cut down.Cut them into slabs thicker than than the boards you want to work with. Youll lose some thickness as it dries and youll lose more when you flatten them.After that sticker them and let them dry. Treat the end grain with wax anchorseal or some latex paint.

3034056,0,t3_2ux45u,A lot of people are going to recommend french cleats. Theyre greatfrench cleats can support hundreds of pounds and are pretty much bulletproof. I think they are overkill for a small shelf like this especially since your cabinet has no back so the french cleat will be at least partially visible when youre done.Assuming your side pieces are thick enough they look it I would use one of these on each side.Same idea as a french cleat but much thinner and made of metal. If you want to mount the shelf flush to the wall recess it into the cabinet sides. I used one on one of my first projects If you scroll to the bottom where I talk about wallmounting you can see how the recess works.Unless you have conveniently placed studs you may be going into drywall.

Once you joint the skirt and bearers you should have a nice flat frame on which to screw the top down.  Screwing the top down to the frame should take out the majority of the twistcupping that the top xs have.

3116555,0,t3_2vqzcj,You have to consider that If the wood has survived  years it probably had some pretty damn good qualities to begin with.  Oldgrowth pine isnt the same as shitty Home Depot pine. This  wide piece of my bathroom door represents around  years of growth from the Douglas Fir tree it was milled from. With newgrowth lumber it would probably be  years or less and wouldnt be nearly as solid and durable. After  years it hasnt bent bowed cracked etc.  They generally built these barns out of any suitable wood they could source. In some parts of the country you will get yellow pine. In other areas you will have oak maple walnut hickory etc.  Wood is expensive. No matter where it comes from wood just is not cheap. BF is around the lowest pricing I find for Oak Maple Ash etc in my area. This means a board xx would be  for any hardwood. How many boards like that could you get out of a barn. Now factor in the posts and beams...

Next drill the other side starting at the outside piece until you have gone through  and half of the boards you now have the correct location one step in. Fan the outer most piece out of the way and continue working this way till you are through. This should get you close enough that a dowel and some sandpaper can get you all the way through. A little paste wax on the pipes and they will slide in a lot easier. You can also probably get away with leaving the pipes in during the glue up as it will keep things strait paste wax should keep the glue off.

I had a massive amount of  year old redwood posts and beams laying around my yard that I intended to use for a treeless tree fort I dont know what else to call it.  I must have been tripping over them for years and everyone made fun of me that by the time I built a tree fort my kids would be in college.  So I got to it!  Its two levels and the upper was meant to have a  tall x  round redwood water tank on it for an enclosed room.  Unfortunately the tank bottom was so rotted that I couldnt get an accurate trace on its dimensions.   I had to resort to another idea but didnt want a plain square house on top.  Sooooo I built an arch.  I got some ideas from online.  In general I built a big jig on my deck and bent pine boards on the flat not edge to fit the dimensions of the tree house.

It is rather expensive but a bag of blonde shellac flakes ina  or  pound cut number of pounds of flakes to a gallon of denatured alcohol applied well all over the exposed wood should stop the smell.

I dont let big defects make their way into finished product but Im definitely not doing clean work in the way that ucanadianww or ulanthorn do.Often the mistakes are underneath or on secondary surfaces. The plane cabinet has a spot where I didnt clean up some chatter marks on the back panel during smoothing. Its behind the plane tray so noone will ever see it. Theres a cardscraper tearout repair on the coffee table that likes to catch the raking light when the sun is going down that drives me nuts. The inside corners of the seatseat back on the stools are a little bit messy too. From across the room its invisible but if you stick your nose in it its there. There are also a few places in the stools where from some angle I can spot a slight asymmetry or discontinuity in one of the shaped parts.Lots of times the defects are in nondisplay areas like the undersides and thats why I decided to let them stay. If I were building pieces to sell Id put up with less of those compromises.Its not stuff that people really notice in normal use or that comes across in photos well but its all there and IMO its a large part of what separates my work from truly professionalgrade stuff.,woodworking,coupjvh,4,t5_2qlqp

If you give it a little bit of time to set up the glue will still be soft and easy to remove without any smearing.Im not sure how you attached the bottom of the box. I know it is considered more proper to use a dado to secure the bottom in place but I often just cut a piece that fits snugly in the base and glue it in. If you do that then apply the glue to the sides of the box and push the bottom piece in from the top.

3375219,0,t1_cpcuc0r,The plungeonly seems to have been something thats changed in the last decade or so. Wifes TAFE has only fixed base routers.Australian definition of what classifies as an actually hard hardwood varies compared to the US. Rockhard maple is considered on the hard side in the US whereas its about as hard as Tassie Oak one of the softest hardwoods readily available.And Australia is awful at naming things. Tassie Oak? Not actually an oak. It was just called that so people would think it was. Its a gum. Its actually three different gums. And Vic Ash? Yup two different species that... are two of the three in Tassie Oak. Sydney Blue Gum? Its red.While hobbyist shops will all have tablesaws in AU its more likely a commercial shop will have a panel saw than a tablesaw even if they dont focus on sheet goods.Dados are daydos in the US and here theyre dadohs.Parts of the US will call a circ saw a skil saw brand. Jointerssurface planers can also be called buzzers here. Ive had a few conversations where the owner of said buzzer didnt realise it was also known as anything else.Oh and in Australia we seem to think Stanley chisels are good ,woodworking,cpd009p,2,t5_2qlqp

3381514,0,t1_cpdkyuo,Walnut tends to acclimate to moisture a bit slower than something like soft maple or poplar but faster than oak. The thicker the slower as well. Though walnut tends to be less prone to warping.If you shop is climate controlled you can probably get away with a few weeks just be careful. If your shop is open air I would give it a bit more time.The only other thing to consider is how straight your grain is at that will make your board more prone to warping. If it is extremely straight and clear of knots you can be less cautious than something with irregular grain and knots.Sorry I cant give you an answer that is more clear but I hope this helps provide some guidance.,woodworking,cpdpv3u,1,t5_2qlqp

We people dont really have any way to know if something we put in our face brushed against a surface that had a thin layer of spoiled vegetable oil on it.

So you will first build the toe kicks level those then put the cabinet boxes on top of those. Assemble everything with pocket holes. Trust me they are plently strong. You need to decide if you want to do frameless or framed cabinets. I suggest ordering doors but that is up to you. doors take a lot of work and can be a pain.

This prevents moisture from escaping through the endgrain too quickly causing the wood to split.You could certainly buyrenthire someone with a portable sawmillalaska mill.

An excellent example is Missionstyle furniture.  The idea of peices with a bunch of finnicky identical parts grew up with machines.

With  casters youll need to add about  per side for a total of  of depth front to back. is kind of bare minimum so if youre looking for low profile that will get you there. But its not going to be secure if someone bumps into it.A better safer ratio is  and secures you from people knocking it over on accident.

I think most of us have used it for some or even a lot of things.  Dont let yourself be afraid to try using hardwoods though.  For most species they are so much more pleasant to work with that you will wonder why you waited.  The adaptations you make to deal with SPFs challenges wont really translate well to better wood.  Hardwoods have their own set of challenges that you wont get with SPF.  I would love to see SPF with any stain or other treatment that successfully mimics an expensive wood.  Hell I would love to see one that gets remotely close.  I have seen a lot of stained pine and it is always really easy to tell what it is Oh and just as a point of note  I dont know what you mean by treated hardwoods.

4105320,0,t1_cro4duz,generally speaking it will get through tougher situations more easily.  For example if you want to rip  oak in one pass the HP isnt going to have a very good time and will likely burn the wood if it can get through at all.  even the HP might struggle a bit but you should be able to adjust your feed rate to get through it without burning.  results will be better with a specifically designed rip blade.now  oak is a pretty extreme example.  in more common usage you might want to rip some  walnut without having to change the blade.  the HP will do that without any problems.  for most operations that arent so taxing the HP motor will take less strain than a HP so in theory it should last longer.

If someone is after the looks provided by oiling and the protection of a varnish topcoat why not use oil and then varnish rather than one of the various oilvarnish blends which you pay too much for?BTW if youre using an oilbased poly its worth doing a quick test panel with and without the oiling beforehand.

Get the biggest jointer you can afford and have room for  you cant make a jointer table magically bigger.Your other option and I say this as a heavy jointer user is to use a circular saw and jigguide to put a straight edge on it. Then you can stick it on your table saw. A planer is a very good investment before the jointer  you can get wider boards in one for cheap and you can always shim a board to send it through the planer and get a flat side.,woodworking,csn4e3d,0,t5_2qlqp

4419979,0,t3_3bnuxf,I always use hardwood dowels in softwood. My dowels are always hardwood because thats what they sell at lowes and HD. Either poplar or maple.Ive always been working with softwood materials like SPF and MDF. And I use dowels with them. Not just as a method of jointing or locating pieces but Ive used them in mechanical setups as the rotary shaft of sorts for a joints in a linkage. So this combo works for me. Vice versa might not be good if youre using it in a structural application. If were talking strength you must account for how good the strength is of all the components. One of the factors is the sheer strength of the material. Often the dowels will be used in cases where they have less cross sectional area than the rest of the piece. For example you build a rotary joint with dowels in a wide piece of wood with the drilled hole. The weakest point with the lowest strength always fails first. Which means dowels are the most likely failure point due to sheer load and its smallest cross sectional area. Hardwoods might stand up better in those cases if used as a dowel. It spreads the load to the other material. You want strength matching between dowel and the mating parts. So when you do hardwood part and softwood dowel this application might fail at the dowel location. Vice versa softwood part and hardwood dowel might be OK if you match the strength well. Hardwood part and hardwood dowel might be OK too but again dowel having smallest cross sectional area means it is the weakest spot. You basically need to determine if you part will fail due to the applied load. Also hardwoods are more durable than softwood.,woodworking,csnv7d1,2,t5_2qlqp

4437616,0,t3_3bvhf4,Ive had my table saw for about a month now and Ive found that its very important to wear safety glasses. Depending on what kind of wood you use parts may fly back and there is no time to react. First time I was using mine I was hit in the face by a piece of cheap oak that was glued on some multiplex drawer side. I was incredibly lucky as it just barely missed my eye. Second dont dick around. Maintain focus at all times. Think about how you will support your piece at the back end of the saw before you begin cutting. One thing that irks me about a lot of youtubers is that they commonly reach over their sawblade to pick up the pieces they have cut.Lastly dont operate when tired after drinking a beer or while having a kid or pet in the same room.Edit I forgot. Accidents can always happen. Have medical supplies nearby. Also take some time to think about how youre going to get the medical care you need in case of emergency. E.g. how will you get to the hospital if your SO took the car to get groceries? Something I personally prefer to use is good hearing protection and a high end dust mask. Some species oak and several tropical hardwoods for example cause nasal and lung cancer. Its a small investment to buy proper PPE but its worth it.,woodworking,csq1osv,1,t5_2qlqp

Its done to prevent over harvesting and exploitation which certainly makes sense. Its beginning to create a problem though.  Because there is no demand unprotected timber species essentially have no value.

You dont need to mask. Once the paint has fully hardened simply sand the surface bingo clean metal sitting above yellow paint in the recesses.

A terrible woodworker who is an excellent salesperson will make a huge amount more than an excellent woodworker that is a terrible salesperson. As far as skill figure out what you want to make and learn the best practices. Do research on tools safe use of said tools and where to get them on the cheap. Its best to decide what you are going to make generally speaking before buying a bunch of stuff. For example a musical instrument makers shop is going to look a lot different than a cabinet makers shop. Sure there will be overlap but get the best tool for the job.What would I do? Well Id like to change a lot of things I cant. Like choosing my space carefully. I hate my shop. Actually hate isnt a strong enough word. Its a big enough space but it has shortcomings I cannot fix without thousands of dollars contractors and a few months of storting tools elsewhere.The layout is OK but I should have ripped out all the makeshift benches and shelvings before moving everything in. They dont fit with my workflow and now I work around them instead of working with them.  I have no natural light. There isnt a single window. If I leave the garage doors open they cover the overhead lighting in key locations. This is OK when its sunny but on overcast days I need to partially close the doors. Never underestimate natural light.I have no HVAC. I have no insulation. Yesterday it was  degrees in the garage at pm. In the winter its been  below zero in the garage.

5106586,0,t3_3kyai3,So that DeWalt planer is pretty good should serve you well.  As far as circular saws go look for one which has the blade on the same side of the handle as your head when youre cutting that means the blade should be to the left of the handle if youre right handed.  This is so youre able to see the blade from a more natural position when cutting.  Given what I can infer about your budget you might want to start checking out craigslist its a great place to find used tools for prices that are a bit easier on the wallet.As far as tablesaws go I wrote up an intro to them and while you already have one my writeup goes over safety adjustment and a few other things so you may find it useful  Do you have a plan for jointing lumber?  It sounds like your cramped quarters may make the ideal tool a jointer a hard fit though it can be done with a custom router sled or by building a sled for lumber and using that in conjunction with your planer. Either of those routes is considerably more time but mostly I wanted to make sure youve got a plan as its an essential step in preparing your wood.  If youre not sure what I mean by jointing  is a good intro to the subject.That HF router is a bit scary to me.  Routers spin their bits at very high speeds and a bit coming loose and flying off or a motor coming apart and throwing chunks out through its housing is a real possibility.  I have heard of such things happening with HF tools FWIW.  There are HF tools Id buy but a router isnt one of them.Happy to answer any other questions I can just ask. ,woodworking,cv1j94g,2,t5_2qlqp

To do this you can put one of your thumbs fairly high up on the chisels handle when you sharpen which will help you feel the chisel tipping back and forth.

5317735,0,t1_cvqoodx,First of all fantastic work to both of you.On the cupping issue I may be able to offer something. I used to run a sawmill with a fairly large kiln drying operation. Kiln drying is always going to provide better results than air drying outside. This is simply because youre working with a controlled environment Im implying commercial grade kiln drying of course. The big difference between air drying and kiln drying is  You control the heat in a kiln as opposed to whatever the weather is doing that day  you add moisture back into the wood throughout the process.The best way to think about it is a sponge. If you had a soaking wet sponge and left it out in the air youd find that the outside of the sponge gets dry while the center does not. Youll slowly dry the centre through capillary action as the water migrates from inside to out but it will be an extremely long process. Also as the outside of the wood dries youre creating a dry shell around the wet centre. As the wood dries this shell will be shrinking at a rate far great than the centre which causes checking. A good kiln operator monitors this and slows down the drying process by adding moisture to the air to eliminate any checking.So in a kiln youre constantly adding moisture to the air so that the outside shell stays just moist enough to not check while allowing the centre to dry.When it comes to resawing kiln dried materials youre usually going to end up with cuppingbowingtwisting unless the wood was dried with the expectation that it will be opened up or the dimension is so small that it doesnt matter. My kiln guy would discuss with me what I planned to do with the wood after it was dry. If he knew I was going to resaw the x hed use a longer drying schedule and make adjustments to allow for the resawing. Without this kind of information a typical commercial operation is just going to dry the lumber in the fastest most economical way possible while creating a good result for the dimension it will be sold as.In the case of very thick lumber youll never dry it evenly enough to have perfect resawing results. For example x will not cut down to pc x with reliable results. In instances where you know what youll be doing with the wood after drying you should resaw it ahead of time while its green. This will allow you to dry the piece uniformly and hold it still while it dries.Another option is to resaw the wood and immediately restick it so that as the newly exposed centre of the wood dries it is held in place from moving. This works okay for bowing and cupping but not so great for crook.Theres a lot of science behind kiln drying but this should give you some insight into your issues. It gets more complicated with things like aspirated pits etc. If you have any questions Id be happy to help.,woodworking,cvreinw,2,t5_2qlqp

5343874,0,t3_3o4pw7,I spend a lot of time looking at wood and picking out combination options for theoretical projects.  So heres some personal opinions...  Maple  almost anything of a darker color.  White and black go with everything they say.  Maple  Cherry is a traditional combination.  Maple and Walnut is too but you need to be careful about balance because of contrast.  Ive seen it used with red oak nicely as well.  For stronger contrast wenge is almost black when oiled so it goes nicely too if used carefully.  Basically its a good first option when thinking about combining material.  Just be careful!  Cherry  Walnut is a traditional combination.    Oak and Walnut is a nice combo in ky opinion.  White oak is the typical choice but red oak is beautiful too.  Black locust seems like it would be a nice combination as well.  Padauk is beautiful and darkens into a vermilion color as it ages.  It goes well with darker woods like walnut as a slight contrast or with lighter woods like maple for a stronger contrast.  Just think lights and darks.  Amd when in doubt consult a color wheel!  Brown is actually a dark orange and lots of woods have distinct tints and shades that you can quantify and then approach formulaicly.

The tail stock has a standard MT Morse Taper  bore so anything that is is MT or is it MT? will work fine. Drive Center andor Chuck Again cheap on eBay.  You can use anything that has a  bore.

Ill pop the woodriver V iron I honed on the XF diamond  strop in my jack plane and you can work a piece of ash down to veneer its actually pretty fun. That does sound like fun. But Id want to do the stropping more on this below.gt I will gladly put my edge where my mouth is. I would too which is kinda where Im going.gtTrust me I hate waterstones. Literally hate them. I would do anything to avoid them but the edge an xf diamond  strop gives me is inferior enough for me to embrace the hate. Yeah I totally get that from what youve posted previously. What Im getting at is I think you need to do a better comparison with stropping. How you strop every aspect here holding the angle number of strokes alternation pressure the strop itself and the compound all together make a huge difference to results. From my own experiments I think the compound makes much more difference than is commonly suggested. Id argue after trying  different compounds I cant remember everything Ive tested any more that it makes a huge difference  same person me same hardness of strop same strop facing denim two different stropping compounds utterly different edge. They can even look the same with one being materially sharper than the other.So I think if you stropped differently the gulf youre experiencing wouldnt be so big. ,woodworking,cxb7d3x,1,t5_2qlqp

For someone like me with terrible posture I would put on a considerable load onto a single point.

5951039,0,t3_3wxkg8,Pine itself isnt bad. If its the only wood available to you  use it. Its better than not building anything at all. You just have to spend some extra time choosing your boards in the store. You have to look for knots grain patterns sawing etc. Sometimes youd better buy a x and rip it into two x. It will give you slightly nicer and more stable wood with no significant difference in price. If you take all this into consideration the only downfall left with pine is its softness. Generally you dont want to build a dining table or a workbench from pine. It will beat up pretty quickly. But something like a cupboard or a shelf or a picture frame  all this would work just fine.

6034690,0,t1_cyaf4sa,Part of your problem is that there is so much unsupported distance between the rails of your sled. This can allow sag in the middle. If the boards were thinner towards one rail that is definitely happening. Put your rails as close to your workpiece as you can  or  inches tops. To be sure your setup is level start with a known flat surface  I use a sheet of  mdf screwed to an ikea counter top. Then try to use something that you dont have to dimension perfectly for your rails  square steel tube long levels or mdf stacked flat side up so the sides you cut are vertical and the factory flat panel is horizontal. These will all be much more uniform than a board you rip on the table saw. If you must make your own rails from lumber you have to ss them perfectly. Also look up wood whisperer using a router sled to level his workbench top  he uses a pretty ingenious technique to make sure his rails are parallel. ,woodworking,cyanvpk,1,t5_2qlqp

The iron was also paper thin.As far as my research tells me the Handyman line was a continuation of Stanleys budget Defiance line.

6257654,0,t1_cyzvz7u,Thats why I said depends on the glue.  To simplify things for the sake of discussion epoxies and the like do best with some surface roughness for a more mechanical bond while titebond and the like rely on capillary action and tend to prefer a smooth surface.  Yes gaps are not the end of the world as long as they are filled with glue.  This is not a rule though as the application can play a significant role.  I used to build a lot of laminated longbows.  Gaps in a glue line almost always worked free with the stresses involved in a bending glueup.,woodworking,cz0xdce,1,t5_2qlqp

Until theyre pointing in the right direction together theyre potentially fighting your movement especially if youve rotated it in place.One trick Ive found that seems to work ok to get castor wheels oriented together well is to give the whole thing a little swirl to get all the wheels moving and realigning in a unit.

From the pictures it looks like there are already small cracks in the surface at other locations around the circumference of the log indicating that there is no more energy being released by the expansion of the large crack. Interestingly it looks like the tensile strength of concrete  psi fc is in the ballpark of the tensile strength of walnut perpindicular to the grain both being around  psi.This bowtie may serve another purpose and actually go into compression if multiple other large cracks form and the log decides it wants to close this original crack back up.,woodworking,czu8dwv,4,t5_2qlqp

6538421,0,t1_czv9wgj,Its hard to explain. I actually start with the table top height. The standard is  inches. Then I look at chairleg clearance. So to slide your legs and chair under the desk or table youll need at least  inches from the ground for clearance. . would be ideal. Then I worked my way back from there. I determined the center drawers height based on that. The desktop is  thick the center rail is  inch thich. The legs were . tall based on my friends request. So the desktop was . from the ground. So take . minus  top minus  stretcher minus  clearance for the chair. So the center drawer face is . in height. Then you subtract  of an inch for the top gap and  of an inch for the bottom gap between the drawer and face frame. This height is applied to all the drawers. For the width same rules apply. The overall width was  and I worked backwards from there.,woodworking,czvmji6,2,t5_2qlqp

6563013,0,t1_czy513g,Well youve got a spinning blade with high amounts of kinetic energy and breakable pieces going into it.  The best case scenario is that you end up jamming up the blade and potentially damaging the machine.  The much more likely scenario is that youve just created a projectile to be launched by the machine potentially towards you.  Another potential scenario is that it doesnt break asintended and your hand either gets yanked before it does break potentially spraining something or hurting you in another way or your hand gets pulled into the blade.  In the end there are tried and true methods for keeping your fingers safe that are MUCH more reliable than a contraption that hampers your dexterity and potentially has other issues too.tldr Just get some featherboards and push sticks and never have your hands within a couple feet of the blade in the first place.  KISS Keep it Super Simple the less things that can go wrong the better.  It might take a few more seconds to set up the featherboards and have them in the right spot but itll still be better than using clumsy extended hands.  Not to mention that the extra time to set up will improve safety in many ways anyways.,woodworking,czy6533,3,t5_2qlqp

But at the end of the day I can use vintage planes and modern planes interchangeably without hesitation. Oh and I paid  for my bedrock that needed nearly zero restoration.

This causes an inner struggle of dimensions to occur and the slab begins to split. This can be tamed somewhat by a slow controlled drying process. When so many layers of a tree are involved some splitting is inevitable. This can be tamed somewhat by binding the layers together.

7020585,0,t1_d1bgy9w,Yes but I really dont like his technique made my way it will be far more accurate.. I opted for hardboard because I needed to maximize my depth of cut I was cutting down  slabs. I also wanted my edge to follow any dips and sags in the panel I was cutting so having the saw guide be stiffer than the material being cut is bad and as a general rile the material I cut with it is  or greater so sagging isnt a big issue.. He used a table saw my method doesnt use one at all. I used the straight factory edge for the saw guide on top the shoe or plate of the saw guides on this I then cut a zero clearance edge by cutting off the excess it looked like he was just measuring the width and then using a very warp prone thin piece of wood to establish his straight edge I leave a good  of width on my guide strip so it will stay nice and straight on that axisEDIT I like this video better   He uses a bandsaw to make the original cut but as I said youll cut that edge off so freehanding isnt an issue. I would also note mark your factory edge before you cut! Get a pencil and write it right on the board because after all the cuts its not necessarily obvious which is the factory cut.,woodworking,d1c4tnb,1,t5_2qlqp

7066572,0,t3_4cdekb,You are not terrible at it you just need a few pointers.  First let me point out a problem with your sanding technique.  Looking at the picture I can see a lot of cross grain scratches and swirls.  This is because you used the orbit sander to make your final pass.  The best system for sanding a top is to first use the belt sander only to level the surface I actually use a large plane instead because I find it difficult to control the amount of material the belt sander removes.  Next use the random orbit sander to go through all of your smoothing grits except your final grit.  Your final grit should be done by hand using a sanding block sanding with the grain only.  That will remove all the cross grain scratches and swirl marks left by the orbit sander.  You dont want to sand to too fine a grit or the stain will have trouble penetrating the pores.  Depending on the top coat I plan on using I usually stop sanding at  to  grit I go to higher grits with top coats that dont build significantly like tung oil.  As for the stain application first let me point out that you have chosen what might be the most difficult type of wood to color well pine.  Pine absorbs very unevenly so if you were to use an oil or water based stain you would want to use a seal coat of dewaxed shellac first.  The shellac clogs up the pores so the stain cannot be sopped up too much.  Alternatively many people do what you did to solve the problem use a gel stain.  I usually dont like gel stains because the sit on the surface and obscure too much of the grain for my taste.  I have however used them as a glaze with good results.  To do this you seal the wood with dewaxed shellac scuff sand with the grain and then apply the stain gently wiping the excess off against the grain.  After that coat dries you simply add additional coats without sanding until it is dark enough.  Of course there are many other ways to deal with pine like colored wax but my post is long enough already.As for the knots usually the problem is that too much stain is absorbed around them.  That wasnt the case here which makes me think of a couple of possible culprits.  Did you seal the knots with something like epoxy?  If so the stain will not be able to penetrate it.  I think the more likely cause is that you may have sanded to too high a grit and the pores are either clogged or the surface is too smooth for the gel satin to bond did you sand beyond ?.It is always good practice to save some scraps to test your finish on before you apply to the rest of the project.  If you have some left over try some of the techniques I mentioned and see if your results improve.,woodworking,d1hcwwd,6,t5_2qlqp

7180107,0,t3_4dsxom,No matter how much compression you put on big pieces of lumber like this you will not be able to stop them from checking or moving. The amount of force they have stored up internally is orders of magnitude more than what you could apply with a wrench on a bolt.Your best bet is going to be to get really really old dry timbers that have finished moving. They will almost always have checked cracked but you can fill any voids with epoxy or keep searching until you find ones that look how you want. Then sand or plane to thickness.To achieve this style look I would laminate the top together then attach the feet  aprons in such a way as to allow wood movement  a glued dowel in the middle  two loose dowels at the edges clips or some other way.It is possible to use a blind mortise but you would want the mortise to be longer than the tenon by  on each side so the top has room to expand and contract. If your fit was even somewhat tight there wouldnt be any need for glue in such a fit. The dowel method I mentioned earlier would be way more simple much faster and definitely less finicky though.,woodworking,d1ubbka,1,t5_2qlqp

If so try using a pencil to mark your second piece and then work on leaving half the pencil line.  I find this approach much easier.  Quite simply saw a tiny bit more off.Another trick to find the problem tail is to rub the joint with a little something to mark the mating pieces.  Pencil chalk anything thatll rub and show you information.Dont stress too much.  You should see the dutch tool chest on my bench now.  One corner is pretty close to perfect maybe one tailpin could take a shaving or less shim.  The other corner which is the first Ive ever cut in aspen I swear to god it makes white pine look like oak is a horror show.  Blew past my baseline horribly on half of the pin board and I have one tail gap that is just huge.  Had to pare that one and went fullstupid probably like what youre talking about here.And the one time I carefully layout my dovetails I really mess up the symmetry.  One one corner I have a large pin in the middle.  On the other a large tail.  Oh well.  At the end of the day if the joint is strong those details dont matter.  Are most of the pins and tails tight?

7308407,0,t1_d28ueb1,Are NiCd tools still sold?Actually I think NiMH has the longest operable life NiMH will steadily decline over  years whereas Liion will sharply decline around the year mark. So just make sure you buy into a popular system where you can find new batteries in  years.Liion also keeps its charge while left unused on the shelf. NiCd and regular as opposed to low self discharge NiMH batteries loose their charge in a couple of months.And off course the energy density per volume nd per weight is a lot better in Lithium batteries.Ive only seen fake batteries for Makita Milwaukee Dewalt which suggest a more vibrant ecosystem but also ..

7362929,0,t3_4g6bya,It sounds like youre going to eventually assemble a proper workshop. If so then youre going to want a table saw miter saw and a router. I mostly make end tables night stands coat racks and other things for the house sounds like you want to do the same and I make most of my cuts with the miter saw. Most people would probably recommend a jigsaw and a orbital sander bit I survive without them. For clamps imagine the most number of clamps youll need then triple that number  Harbor Freight quick release bar clamps are a great value but avoid most of their other clamps. Of course youll want a variety of various tools like a drill measuring tapes squares etc. I dont think I could live without my pocket hole jig. At this point youre probably close to . But you dont need all those tools right away. I think you could get a laundry dresser together with only a table saw. You can substitute a circular saw but it can be tough for me to make good cuts with the circular saw. I recommend downloading sketchup free version to draw out your plans. Youll also need to find a good source of wood. In my area Menards has the best wood. Lowes has decent xs. Home Depot is worthless. In most places a lumberyard is your best bet or maybe a cabinet shop can help you. You might want to build a workbench before starting on your laundry dresser. Itll be a good chance to get all those rookie mistakes out of the way before starting a real project.,woodworking,d2f450h,2,t5_2qlqp

7505050,0,t3_4i5les,That sounds like a great log! Im assuming this tree came from an urban landscape. That means theres very likely to be nailsetc embedded in the trunk which is going to burn up a couple of the mills blades. This is normal but it will cost you for each blade that is dulled by the metal. Last time I had lumber milled it was blade.The biggest thing about the surface you choose to stack the lumber on is it needs to be stable. If your yard isnt going to sag under the weight or wash out and leave the stack unevenly supported then its fine to put it in the yard. Thats the route Id choose mostly because I wouldnt want to commit to a year or more of useless space in my garage.  Youll get a lot more air circulation in the yard just being outdoors gives a ton of air circ even if youre not getting crosswind etc and as long as you have a cover like you mention in  then it will dry much faster outside. If you keep it in the garage I would definitely run a dehumidifier more to prevent mold from the increased humidity than to help the wood dry.If you use stickers of another species you can sometimes get staining from one wood leeching into the other. Ive used pine stickers on oak before and it left crossmarks on my wood. Not really a problem since like weatheringfading it planes out. However since youre going to have a leftover  log you might consider cutting half of that into stickers so the species match and theres no uneven discoloration. Otherwise Id definitely just buy some construction lumber to rip down. You local yard might have a scrap bin or trash pile where you could find a cheaperfree source of stickers.I would go concrete blocktarpplywoodlumber to prevent moss from starting to grow on your stuff if you want. As long as you only dry this  years I would be surprised if the moss would become a problem for the wood. Good luck! I love getting lumber this way!,woodworking,d2vaaiq,1,t5_2qlqp

Sometimes water will mess with the wax in which case let it sit a few days and seeing it dries out.  If not remove the wax completely and reapply the wax most hardware stores sell it.. Your furniture is old and the finish is aging.  In this case there is a chance the water has only effected the top layer and you may be able to buff out the mark with some fine steel wool.

7602396,0,t3_4jge5d,So I was perusing and saw this jointer a few months ago listed for about k. Then  weeks ago I was looking for a jointer again and saw that he needed cash and listed this thing for . I immediately went to Harbor Freight bought a cherry picker and some lifting straps and drove the  miles with a trailer to pick it up. It weighs  lbs! The guy was a very nice guy who had heart problems and was slowing down in his old machinery restoration hobby. He was feverishly trying to replicate the shop he grew up working with his father for his son and grandson to work in. The very rare jointer they had used popped up on craigslist and he needed money to get it before it was gone. I think I got a great deal but he was so happy to get the jointer he wanted. This thing is fully restored down to the bolts brand new unpacked German bearings and knives all being brand new the pictures of the knifes looks a little rough but thats just a little surface rust from sitting in his garage they are razor sharp. The text from the add is below but so far in my research I havent found more than  of these in existence in the world. I dont know if I have room for it in my shop but I couldnt pass up this deal. Now that Ive gotten it home I am so torn as to what to do. It has a . hp motor which might make my house go dark everytime I fire it up and it is so big I might have to get rid of something to keep it. Let me know what you think! Cheers!  Text from previous owners advertismentThis is a RARE early  model with ball bearings supporting the head shaft ends. Nearly all jointers of this type were still Babbitt or brass bushings with oilers at the time  very desirable if you want one of these vintage brutes. TOWSLEY only used the best of everything  considered one of the top  if not THE TOP machine builder quality wise for his short time as a sole proprietor he was quickly bought out by Faye amp Egan or Crescent and kept on for his genius. Its  blade modern style cutter heads fresh ball bearings have been left with the bearing covers loose and the top grade packing supplied but left out so they can be inspected prior to packing or closing up  a  minute job  its nice to SEE the new bearings I think. Buyer is supplied with the highest grade packing available for the packing and closing up of the shaft ends. The head is the more modernsafe Cylindrical not clam shell design with new knives with fully intact gibs ampadjusters. This machine has crack free castings throughout of course. The fence is not shown with it it is one fitting of the time  well designed and built like a tank  about  tall and has been sand blasted resurfaced and correctly painted and aligned. The aircraft carrier top was so pristine that it would have been a shame to resurface it. It still has the  metal planer lines fore to aft and they are shiney metallic with an even distribution of mild darker patina but absolutely zero rust  you see mostly silvery steel. This is a HEAVY WELL BUILT MACHINE  the best  it outweighs a LONG BED Oliver by at least . All the hardware was beautifully intact already but nearly all nuts and bolts were replaced with new high grade ones anyway for safety reasons. The motor is  amp  hp at rpm three phase  direct drive or choose a remote belt drive with any single phase motor hp  .

7611640,0,t1_d371y1f,Like Milo says its about the squeeze out which is the amount of glue that gets squeezed out between the two pieces when clamped.  Assuming you put an equal amount of glue all along the two pieces being joined if you clamp in several places and see x amount of squeeze out where the clamps are but less in the areas between the clamps its time to add more clamps.  Another trick is to use cauls which are just long blocks of rigid wood with a straight edge that goes between the clamps and the workpiece youre gluing so that the cauls one on each side apply even pressure along the length of the workpiece.  If your workpiece doesnt have straight edges though the cauls wont work and even if they do have straight edges its a good idea to add several clamps anyway but if done right you wont need to add a clamp every inch of the workpiece where every inch is an exaggeration you just keep adding clamps until you see you have good squeeze out along the length of your joint.  Keep in mind that theres no need to clamp the pieces being joined as hard as you possibly can.  Too much squeeze out can lead to a starved joint which can be a weak joint.  Some people say thats not possible.  I say why risk it stop short of full force when clamping your work pieces.,woodworking,d37ejmi,3,t5_2qlqp

7791110,0,t3_4m1lyc,Here is my story I had the dewalt .hp thinking it would be more than enough for my needs.  months later found myself buying the .hp dewalt thinking it would be more than what I would need. Then I mounted the dewalt on a router table and the EVS kicked the bucket a known issue for that model with table mounting apparently. Then I got a replacement for the dewalt for handheld work and got a triton .hp for router table work. I still have all three routers because they each have their purpose. IF you dont plan on mounting it on a table the dewalt  is an excellent value with the plunge base. It is also a good balance between power and portability for handheld work. Anything smaller and youll likely be looking for something bigger in a couple of months. Btw dont underestimate the value of a router. If one of my router kicked the bucket Id go out and buy another one immediately because it is a tool that gets used often. ,woodworking,d3rs0cv,4,t5_2qlqp

8027335,0,t3_4p68ep,Short answer Anything you like that you are comfortable putting stuff in the drawing to scale.Long answerI use any of a number of programs including Photoshop and Illustrator for laying out a room. I personally prefer vector stuff because shape sizing is easy. I set up the artboard where my scale is  pixel  . So... if you have a x space the artboard is x. I draw shapes roughly the dimensions of the machines and stuff like cabinets and workbenches then move all of the shapes around.Once Ive got all of that together I put together a x box and make sure Ive got roughly that space around anything where a person would walk or stand. x is a standin for the person and gives you space and wiggle room to get around and between things.If youre trying to lay out say a wall and cabinets you can do the exact same thing for the front view to arrange that stuff.If you want to get all fancy you can use a program like Sketchup and completely draw out and move around all of the parts and pieces but Im able to be a lot more conceptual than that and dont need the headache of setting up a D model just to get crap into a box.,woodworking,d4icj1v,1,t5_2qlqp

8047122,0,t1_d4kk2k2, blade  definitely not. Even if you managed to get one on the arbor theres probably something underneath thatll hit when you start tilting and raisinglowering the blade. The fence isnt a huge deal many people have used round tube fences for years and Id suggest giving it a shot before you scrap it. As long as it locks and you can reliably set it parallel to the blade theres no reason not to use it. If you upgrade make it a good one like a Biesemeyer style fence you wont regret it and you can always take it off and use it on your next saw. The way I look at it if its something you want to use for a while youre going to pay somewhere. Youre getting a good deal on the saw the upgrades will be costly. You might be able to hold off on this one and find a deal on a good saw with a better fence. I was actually toying with replacing my old Craftsman and buying a new cabinet saw when I spotted a really good deal on a Jet contractor with an upgraded fence so I picked it up did a bit of work setting it up and now well just watch the video. ,woodworking,d4kkm72,1,t5_2qlqp

If you want one specifically for marking mortises Ill admit the Veritas is probably the best option as the crown gauge seems to have quality control issues. PlanesWhat kind of planes do you have? What kind do you need? I will advise that you do not get a shoulder plane as you may find you get limited use out of it. Do you have a jack plane? The low angle jack is pretty nice and can shoot miters. Honestly for  you can get any Vertias plane you want. Dont buy the dedicated miter plane though.or the hinge mortise planeor you know what just ignore the entire specialty plane section except maybe for the router plane theres a lot of planes that would see limited to no use.Sharpening like politics is an intensely debated topic that often involves a lot of personal opinions. You could blow all that  on diamond plates. You could blow all of it on water stones and accessories too. You could spend more than  on a tormek or Veritas Mk II sharpening system.

8187527,0,t3_4rf2sd,Nice work Im a fan of carved knots.Im not sure how easy this would be on the CNC mostly hand tools here but if you can bevel the strands back a bit more where they go under the other strand it visually looks better.  It looks like you just took one pass at the junctions with a V bit?  The sides of the crossings also have a bit of webbing that visually distracts a bit like in image  where the ring goes back under the strand on the right the webbing draws the eye back up and to the left a little which detracts from the flow of the line.Maybe  minutes with a fine riffler would be enough to clean up a lot of those areas..

I also tried replacements for many of them just in case I happened to get a bad one.  That wasnt the case.  And pertaining to the Bosch it wasnt just the slop which it did have.  They use a plastic mechanism for their detent system which allows way too much movement even while in the detent and it also had a lot of arbor runout.  When you add all three problems together it just wasnt close to being worth .  IMHO sliders are fine for construction work or if you build things that dont require light tight joints.

I took a woodworking class at his shop and his advice was that if you can tell him what angle your dovetails are then theyre the wrong angle. I think the argument is that if you look at old furniture you can find existing examples of just about any angle and they all tend to hold up fine.

8391964,0,t1_d5ph93x,UPDATE I am not a smart man...I went to work today and my boss happened to have a delta magnetic starter he took off his saw a while back but it had a different three prong plug. So he gave me a outlet to go along with it. When I got home I went to install the new outlet and noticed that I had a hot lead and the ground switched on the outlet...I rewired itcorrectly this time and tried my original magnetic starter and voila! It works!Someone even suggested earlier that I could have it wired wrong but since my multimeter was getting  out of two of the holes I assumed it was correct. Problem was one of those holesthe Lshaped one was the ground.Thanks to everybody who offered their help! Wish I wouldnt have wasted all that time taking apart the whole damn saw haha,woodworking,d5qjjwd,1,t5_2qlqp

Youll feel the difference. You can get all fancy with a little  jointer and hone them yourself... maybe put a nice secondary bevel on them for tough stuff like the bloodwood...  but a professionally sharpened jointer blade combined with the right feedrate on a properly tuned jointer should leave a nice surface or elseat least very consistent and shallow tear out which can be sanded fairly easily.I think that you have dullish blades and a low outfeed table but I cant be there in person to troubleshoot for you.,woodworking,d5tvubw,2,t5_2qlqp

8464599,0,t3_4vmlcd,Since its a single piece Im guessing the only real option is to replace it   Thats probably one of the reasons it was being sold.  Another option would be to make a new fence yourself using plywood with a flat part on the bottom that goes back and another piece attached to make a  degree L which would be the actual fence you put stuff up against and use the same mounting holes.  Doesnt have to look pretty just has to be straight.If you were really feeling frisky you could put some epoxy in the area where you know its low to build the area up and then methodically sandscrape it off and keep checking with your straightedge until its straight enough for you.

8703346,0,t1_d6ti9q8,Okay I used to use this same finish. I was never unhappy with it but here is what I did one day. I took  identical pieces of white oak and coated them all twice with different finishes. . Oil based poly cut  with mineral spirits. . Watco Danish Oil. Waterlox. Tung Oil. Tung Oil with one coat of gel polyI then poured water on them and allowed it to stand all day around eight hours. I then wiped the water off and allowed them all to dry. Number  was the only one that didnt have a stain. Three was easily fixed with a light scuff and another coat. Four was fixed by just applying another coat. The oil poly had a very light stain left and the danish oil had a big stain. Thats how I arrived to my go to finish. I do realize this isnt a super accurate test. No one would expect two coats of finish to stand up to that. In the past when I use oil based poly I do a  cut with mineral spirits for the first coat and really slather it on and let it soak in for  minutes or so then I wipe it all dry. Next coat is extra fine steel wool then a poly split next coat is XF steel wool then a poly split and I repeat that two to three times. Like I said I was never unhappy with that finish. The biggest difference I noticed was even when you let the poly soak in on the first coat I usually got  penetration on the uncoated edges. When I used tung oil first and cut it  I got a minimum of  penetrationdepending on wood and typically around . I use the gel poly to more or less seal it in and give it an extra bit of protection. Its probably overkill because Ive never had issues with just tung oil but Im a bit paranoid since Im selling and dont know how the customer will treat it. ,woodworking,d6tjvcw,1,t5_2qlqp

8765620,0,t1_d71bvli,Theres a few things that could be causing issues. Firstly you need to make sure you are starting with flat and square boards. If your boards arent square youre not going to be able to layout the joint properly. Good layout is also important. The best way to layout mortice and tenons is with a marking gauge and mortice gauge or just two marking gauge if you dont have a mortice gauge. Set one to mark out your shoulders and one to mark the cheeks. Use the cheek setting to mark out you mortice as well. If your layout is all good then I would look at how youre going about sawing and chiseling the tenon and mortise. Cut out the mortise first that way if you make a minor mistake to can alter the tenon a bit to fix it. Try your best to keep the chisel nice and square when chopping out the mortise. You could put a square down next where youre working to give you a visual reference. Now saw out your tenons .I like to cut the shoulders first but you can go tenon first its just a matter of preference. When you cut the shoulder use a chisel and the gauge line to make a knife wall that you can use to help keep the saw square. When cutting the tenon make sure you stay to the waste side of you line because you can always trim them later. Now you might have to do some trimming to get a good fit. You want a very sharp wide chisel for this. If the shoulders are off use the chisel to square them up by paring down into the cheek. If the cheek is too wide or out of square use the chisel to pair across the grain and fix it up. Make sure you check the tenon against the mortice to ensure you dont trim it too much.If you do happen to make the tenon too narrow you can glue a thin piece of wood onto the cheek and then retrim it as above to get a good fit. Your mortice should be about  deeper that your tenon. Getting a good fit on the bottom of the tenon wont really add any strength so its best to just cut it a bit deeper so you dont have to worry about the tenon bottoming out and leaving a gap in the shoulder.If you post of pictures it might give us a better idea of what specifically went wrong and how it could be fixed.,woodworking,d71d57h,3,t5_2qlqp

9048050,0,t1_d7yyj6t,Where on the table are you planning on mounting the monitor stand? Making a full frame shouldnt be necessary depending on how that ikea top is built. If its designed to have legs screwed into it then there must be a solid core somewhere even if its only a small area. Maybe Ikea was kind enough even to give you a few inches all the way around the outside of the table top which is not honeycomb cardboard and can be used to attach hardware. If thats the case I you may not need to reinforce at all. If theres just reinforced areas at the corners where they would expect legs or predrilled holes that arent where youd need them to mount the monitor stand then thats when youre going to want to add to the table top and you would only need to add a nice piece of wood that is attached to at least two solid points on the table  for example a piece spanning the length of the back  would be enough. That way the wood you attach would be less visible but you have to worry about the legs being different lengths if you install the legs to the wood brace to the table instead of just directly to the table. Otherwise if you go with a full rectangle frame the joints dont need to be strong because once its attached to the table thats going to be where the strength is. I would actually just attach the wood straight to the table at that point and skip metal brackets all together. ,woodworking,d7zfiz6,1,t5_2qlqp

9206085,0,t3_56euuv,Epoxy before you stain. Dont worry about the inside of the knot holes. I think it will look better if you tint the epoxy. I like alcohol based dyes for thisyou dont need much. I think for cherry I would use black not dark brown even moreso if youre staining it darker than natural.If you havent filled knotholes with epoxy before practice first on a scrap to get the process  tint right.Use high quality epoxy that dries waterwhite and bubble free. I like WEST  for this use. This stuff takes a long time to dry hours sometimes more. Expect to do multiple applications. I usually expect to spent  minutes per day dealing with the epoxy stuff for  days.The best tool for leveling epoxy is a card scraper. If you have a big blob protruding above the surface a paring chisel is ideal assuming you have one long enough to reach or even betterone with a crank neck. A bench chisel will work if you have the technique to use it without gouging. Sanding epoxy for the purpose of leveling is annoying slow and eats paper quickly.After using epoxy for defectfilling quite a few times Ive taken do doing it as early in the project as possible. I usually do it before milling the material. Its a fairly messy process so nice to get it out of the way while I can still work fastsloppy knowing that any mess I create will disappear in the planer. You wont have that luxury so be careful to preserve the integrity of the surface around the holes.I accept that there are some valid reasons to stain cherry examples you are mass producing kitchen cabinets and they need to be that super fake looking maroon color at the time of sale or youre matching another piece that will be nearby but if youre willing to let the piece age into its color naturally over the first year or two it will probably look better longterm to simply apply an oilbased finish to it and let it be the color it wants to be.,woodworking,d8ixuwt,1,t5_2qlqp

Some flat some round. Still need to choose the final . Open to suggestions. I took some more photos of the stones Im thinking about.

9829825,0,t3_5g1a71,What about making photocopies and then gluing them to the wood for a direct cut?I do realise you have large sheets and you might not have access to a large copying machine. Photocopying might be achieved by first drawing a bunch of diagonal lines cris crossing the entire paper.When you photocopy it in sections those diagonal lines help you align your sheets edges properly. You can see how it works here  Its not critical to have straight lines. Even hand drawn lines would work for this purpose. As long as you have lines running in perpendicular directions itll be easy to check your borders.You still need to ensure that the original sheet is as flat as possible when in the copier. Else the deformations will cause the edge of the print to be distorted and youd not be able to match them up nicely.,woodworking,daouj27,2,t5_2qlqp

9847764,0,t3_5garne,Due to the nature of the way that side grain moves more than long grain miter joints always open up.  I would use a bread board edge style top.  Alternatively and this would be more complicated you could angle the plane of the frame so that it leans towards the players.  This makes it more comfy for forearms but more importantly wood movement gets translated into minor angle changes rather than forcing open the miter joints.  The slats in the top will also undergo a lot of wood movement.  Use tongue and groove joints and let them float.  The way the legs mount to the table seems like the could become wobbly over time especially if the table gets dragged around.,woodworking,dar6pv6,1,t5_2qlqp

9906865,0,t3_5h9ndb,Never tried it but my intuitionengineering judgement says that if it is dry already you wont be stabilizing anything because the crack cant grow any more.  If it is still drying you will definitely induce tensile hoop stress elsewhere in the disc which may cause another crack to open.A disk like this doesnt need stabilization if you are fine with having a crack because the crack is self limiting it cant grow radially inward past the pith. Cracks on slabs otoh are capable of growing actually the whole length of the board hence why stabilization is useful.,woodworking,dayvz3r,1,t5_2qlqp

Didnt come out as nice and I think it was because when I first lapped the sole I used like  grit and it left far to deep of scratches that cant be lapped out I still managed to make it feel very smooth to the touch just kicking my self  years later but at least I can read off the reflection which is my goal lol. I think   is the magic number for speed of lapping and smoothness because those scratches can easily be taken care of with  grit.

9955459,0,t1_db5645o,gt Two of the three have sentimental value to meTwo of the Three are also really nice bikes so I dont blame you.  Put a few eye bolts a through bolt not a lag bolt in the area that you put the hooks in.  Cable through the frameswheels and through the eye bolt should be just as good or better than locking to your table saw.There are also a handful of commercial options that you could buy or replicate that are lockable.gtOne idea that I have right now is to build an x workbench that contains a miter saw on  long end....The only thing I would caution and this might just be personal opinion is trying to cram too many functions into one thing.  It seems like it will save space and be convenient but in the end I feel like it ends up being cumbersome and annoying.  I would personally think it better that everything is on its own cart or things are functionally combined i.e. the miter saw and planer it is useful to have long support tables on either side so you could feasibly design a table where all you have to do is take out your miter saw and drop in your planer and it can serve both purposes without being overly cumbersome.I also recommend not giving permanent space to anything that doesnt get used for almost every project.  Example I have a lathe and if I had infinite space It would have its own table in its own corner but now it gets stored against the wall when not in use and it gets clamped to my workbench when I need it.  If you think you would use a stationary sander every project than more power to you but it is also likely a tool depending on what kind of sander you mean that you can put on a shelf and pull out only when you need it.,woodworking,db57z6c,1,t5_2qlqp

Assuming you balance your clamping pressure bar clamps can deflect enough even over  that the glue up resembles a shallow sound wave. There are aluminum bar clamps on the market that have a fantastic resistance to bowing great clamping pressure and are about half the price of Irwin squeeze clamps of comparable size. ,woodworking,dbrq2gu,1,t5_2qlqp

10189739,0,t1_dbyv4mu,I totally understand that this is one of those situations where it starts to sound like a broken record but wood movement is such a fundamental thing that breadboard ends is a noteworthy comment in the sidebar. Sure a workbench is one of those first projects that we all learn on but it is certainly less frustrating if it actually holds together. Lag bolts through that end into construction grade lumber end grain would crack the shit out of the top as it dried out. Nothing an epoxy fill wouldnt cure but still...Good on OP for enlarging the holes and using wood that has been indoors for a long time.

10193464,0,t1_dbz8xvp,Self tapping screws are more commonly associated with plastics or metal especially sheet metal.  Wood screws seem to use the self drillingself tapping name interchangeably.  The terms do mean two different things but because of the nature of wood fibers the idea of cutting fixed internal threads is more of a concept than a reality.The threads are cut for sure but if you remove a screw and put it back in chances are high that the new threads are not the same as the old ones.  Unlike metal wood fibers compress easily.  A screw that is cross threaded in wood can cut new threads and compress old ones.  The screw would still pull in where in metal it would not.You can strip the internal threads from wood just like in metal.  That is a common problem even in metal when using self tapping screws.  One solution is to use slightly bigger self tapping screws when that happens.Can you use all the different screws in different materials?  Sure but they wont always work as designed.  You can screw sheet metal together with drywall screws if you want but they wont work as well or as effective as sheet metal screws.To confuse matters even more many woodworkers have discovered that wood threads can be tapped with a conventional metal tap.  Machine screws can then be used to fasten wood together or to fasten things to wood.  This is useful when something needs taken apart and put back together occasionally.  If it needs reassembled often then metal threaded inserts can be used  because wood threads are still prone to stripping out.The reason that screws threaded into endgrain are weaker is because the wood fibers are severed by the threads instead of wrapping around their sides.  Severed wood fibers are weak and since they are only as long as the distance between the threads they are even weaker.  When it comes to understanding wood screws its also important to understand how wood itself works.,woodworking,dbzhh7b,1,t5_2qlqp

10368820,0,t3_5ofbhs,Glad to see you put on your big boy pants. We all get discouraged from time to time. Some days you win some days you learn. To the current question if you have a table saw you can cut dados. As for finger joints they are not a joinery technique I use so Im not all that familiar with the process. If I had to I would use a lap joint. Easy to make one on a table saw and theyre plenty strong. Dados are pretty simple. Set the height of your blade and trace out the void you want to leave. Ensure the work piece is square and transfer the line all the way across the piece to the other side. This helps you see immediately if something isnt aligned properly and will allow you to slice strips out of the board until you have the dado you want. You can also use a dado stack but these tend to scare the shiat out of newbies and take some practice to use so start on some scrap pieces until you getnthe process down. ,woodworking,dcjd905,1,t5_2qlqp

10384567,0,t1_dcl4qg0,I just sharpened the blade. I dont recall how closely I checked the sole etc. I mostly put it to work and the results I was getting were great so I didnt over think it. I probably did a few test passes on some pine straight from the box but sharpened it before it touched any work pieces. My first sharpening setup was a  plane iron honing guide easy to find at woodcraft or amazon a  granite tile from Lowes and sandpaper. This worked fine for a couple projects but eventually I started to buy diamond stones. Theres a huge debate on best sharpening methods. Youll find what works best for you as you practice. Im still trying to find the fastest way to a sharp edge. Im fairly good at getting a sharp blade but there is always room for improvement. ,woodworking,dcl5l7i,1,t5_2qlqp

10465227,0,t3_5pt56h,Oh boy here we go. No guard gadget or safety device will prevent mishaps. Only help reduce the chances. Only good habits and sound techniques will keep you safe  of the time. Just like not trusting the safety on a gun. Nearly all stock guards are junk and get in your way creating an equally dangerous situation. I cant tell you not to use it but dont let anyone tell you that not using it means you WILL have an injury. The guards are thrown in the box for liability against the manufacturer and that is it. Besides basic ripping and some cross cutting any other setup on a table saw will require removal of the guard. Splittersriving knifes are good but again are not a  safety device. They just help. Kickback pawls are junk and should never be trusted for anything besides marring your work.

Now with the ironwood family I know nothing John Snow of African Ironwoods. Here is Ohio the wood ranges from a light cream to Grey when it is still wet.

10629235,0,t1_ddc3dju,If thats what he meant then he was wrong.   inches of walnut will expand and contract exactly the same amount  no matter if its  piece    pieces glued or    pieces glued.  The movement will be the same amount.The reason uProteus gave is much more valid however its not just to save thickness in your original dimensioning.  A  wide board will have a greater tendency to cup warp or twist  even after the table is built.  By ripping the board and regluing pieces it gives you the opportunity to flip the boards to alternate the growth rings gt  bark side up  bark side down  bark side up  etc.This will result in a flatter table top in the long run.  The worst case is that they may cup in opposite but alternating directions.If the board was quartersawn you dont need to worry about cupping much.  If it was plain sawn or rift sawn then alternating growth rings with narrower pieces is a common practice.,woodworking,ddcbpbz,6,t5_2qlqp
10636882,0,t1_ddd3yvi,The trick is to drill a hole in a block of wood and use that as a  degree guide. Even better if you can make the block the same thickness as your work piece and attach some guide rails on either side to perfectly center it. Make sure to draw the outline with pencil then score it with a sharp blade and then clean it all up with a chisel. Its not as hard as it seems you just need some helpers. Also use a bit thats a little smaller the goal with the drill is just to hog out a bunch of material not get it right on the line.Obviously if you have the press thats easier but not everybody has one so just trying to help those who cant justify it yet.Which press did you end up going with? How do you like it? Im still trying to find one that is cheap enough to be able to justify but accurate enough to be worth my time.

Level that x frame out and then just build your boxes and place them on top of the frames.

10668382,0,t1_ddg3vgm,I think people generally understand that Lee Valley is the company and Veritas is their line.Ive got the BU jointer plane as well. To be honest I dont use it all that much. It gets brought out when making endgrain cutting boards which I generally flatten by hand or for flattening table tops that are too big or too heavy to be done on the jointer. I have edge jointed with the jack but obviously a longer plane helps to make that easier. I dont have the optional fence and I really wish the jointer had flat sides like the jack so that it would be easier to potentially register off of. That being said I would be lying to you if I told you that I edge joint with any hand plane all that often. Most of the time I use the jointer I know I know....not a purist.I forgot to mention...the jack is far more versatile not only because the size is more manageable but because the sides of the plane are milledground square so you can use it for shooting as well.,woodworking,ddgd2eu,1,t5_2qlqp
10671004,0,t1_ddgao80,The details of the finish pieces might be subtle but a lot of work went into them and my customers loved them. In fact I sold all of them at a craft show in about  minutes and made around  profit after expenses. Ive also had a lot of requests for more.Let me fill you in on what you didnt see in the video. After removing the wood from the Harbor we went through each oak pilon to remove any misc. pieces of metal before running it through an industrial saw mill in order to rough cut it down to manageable slabs. . The rough milled boards were then palletized and put into storage to dry for about two years.. After checking moisture levels I culled through the material to find pieces that had some interested exterior textures.. From there a Jig was made to help hold the pieces in a set position while sending them through a band saw for further dimensioning. . Now that I had a relatively even surface I was able to send the lengths through the jointer to get an even glue surface.. Some stabilization of the material was necessary due to some cracks so I used some CA glue and band clamps for the smaller cracks and then some hidden splines to the underside of the material as they werent part of my design.. Each lamp was a unique shape so each piece of walnut for the inside layer was individually measured and cut with mitered ends in order to hide the end grain. The grain of the walnut continues almost seamlessly around three sides of the piece.. The red oak back plate was cut to size and an access hole was added for the wiring.. All of the pieces were then glued and clamped until set. A couple brads were added to the more stubborn pieces and then a mixture of wood glue and sawdust was mixed up to fill the holes.. The lamps were then sanded down to about  grit with the rough side getting a onceover with a stiff nylon brush to remove any dirt etc.. Finishing consisted of a coat of semigloss poly followed by two coats of matte poly with a rubdown of VF steel wool in between. . Wiring. Sticking the lightbulb on it.,woodworking,ddgmt0q,1,t5_2qlqp

The leave shape and bark pattern and color appear to match as well as the descrition of the leaves as being alternating pattern and the twigs being reddish green.

10924708,0,t1_de6cpds,Electrolysis FTW. Ive restored  bench planes a No  jointer a shoulder plane and  draw knifes with this technique. Theres no way better for removing rust in a way that doesnt promote it to return as an acid bath will do or lose finish and metal as sanding and sand blasting will do. Its remarkable how it almost reverses the effects of rust on the part.Basic formula dismantle plane and give everything a good clean using warm soapy water. Try to get any sap an oil off. use wire to suspend parts in a big bucket of water  gallon bucket works great. I like to give the wire a twist at each part so they dont slide around. add washing or baking soda to the water.  Tbsp per gallon. Give it a good stir. Put a large piece of steel or iron into the bucket. This is your anode and the larger the surface area the better. I had some bar stock lying around. Make sure the anode doesnt touch anything and is even distance from all the parts. The most important part to get right clamp black negative lead of a V battery charger to the wire holding the parts up and the red positive lead of the charger to the piece of steel or iron.  Turn the charger on and crank it up if you can. You should see it drawing current and bubbles should instantly start forming evenly from all metal surfaces.  Let this go for a while  longer for more rusted parts. I like to come out every  minutes or so and scrub the parts with a coarse brush. Seems to help things along.,woodworking,de6t2ur,4,t5_2qlqp
10930385,0,t1_de7d8ec,I think youre right but not exactly. You can feed a piece both ways on a router table they just have different uses kinda. So if youre using a particularly stubborn wood or going straight into the grain like that you might have this problem. Youre not using a fence in this photo cus its a bearing bit but do you have a fence? You could set the fence in a bit so you take off half the material with one pass then take the fence off and finish it. You could also do a climb cut which is to feed it from the other side without trying to get it alllllll the way cut just kinda skimming off some of the material. Youll find this problem a lot with certain woods more than others and the bigger or fancier the profile of the router bit the worse itll be. Safest solution is probably if you have a fence just make a couple passes. Disclaimer Im no professional and maybe I ought to keep my mouth shut when it comes to offering safe advice but I do use a router table a lot.,woodworking,de7e4qa,4,t5_2qlqp

10955286,0,t1_de9mspr,Sure. This was a small trunk maybe seven inches in diameter by twelve inches in length so it was relatively easy to handle. I should add that it had been drying for about two years before I started milling.I started by sawing down one side lengthwise keeping the cut as straight as possible which did not turn out very straight. That first cut gave me a relatively straight edge to work from. I clamped that to the apron of my kitchen table and used the oneinch overhang of the table top as a fence to make a second cut parallel to the first. Did that once more and I had two boards to work with. Then handplaned the hell out of them.Sawing and planing through hard knotty apple wood was a lot of work. It took a couple hours to get two small boards which are still not totally flat or square.

The first one is solid bloodwood and the second is veneered maple and bloodwood. the glue up for the veneer was a little stressful as there were so many pieces so use a long open time glue. the notched cauls kept everything centered and i did the inlays wider than the boards and then hand planed them down flush. the shavings from the multi color inlay were really cool theyd make good stuffing for gift boxes.,woodworking,deocql9,2,t5_2qlqp

Rather than trying to track something that fluctuates regularly how about just a rating on how expensive each place is as a whole along with a few other categories? An example could be saying that the Woodcraft near me gets high marks for wide selection and quality but its expensive compared to other yards in my area. Other yards may have less selection still good quality and lower prices but he has all rough sawn wood. Granted the rating would be subjective but it would give people who are looking for suppliers good information and a starting point for them to do a little legwork of their own.

I used t  for siding windows so I dont get depressed  insulation for heat and Soundproof and half inch plywood for interior Luckily the concrete was already nice and level in there. I painted the concrete a dark mocha color helps keep moisture outAdviceWhen you build your Shop have your table saw in mind the most important tool in the garage. Make sure you have  feet clearance in front of the blade if possible and  feet behind the blade. This way you can cut long lumber and  plywood. Dont paint your walls white paint them a offwhitetan. Bright led shop lights and white walls hurt my eyes at first. Also the true color of wood is not shown around all white Put smaller tools on a mobile stand the only thing mounted for me is my table saw and chopsaw.  Have lots of storage for wood and tools keep tools behind walls so that no dust builds up. Get a drum sander. This Dresser would be tough to build without my  Supermax drum sander.Most important is the Dust collection. I used a  hp harbor freight dust collector modified with an Oneida Super Dust Deputy YouTube it it is hooked up to my Table saw and Drum sander. Shop Vacuums are attached to smaller tools such as the chop saw and router table. save up and buy good tools. It is true better tools  better quality ,woodworking,deutkn9,2,t5_2qlqp

I have sprayed lacquer over vinyl lettering for a sign and had no issues placing the vinyl directly on the stained wood then spraying over the top. Also did the same thing with poly. In both cases I put about  coats and there was still a noticeable ridge at the edge of the vinyl.  Maybe brush on will cover more quickly or maybe the ridge wont matter.Another option would be to pour on epoxy as you could do a thicker coat and it would sort of self level itself to the point you could get a dead flat surface.,woodworking,dezufgg,2,t5_2qlqp

I got one that was messed up a little in that if I took a  inch board and did a sliding cut half way through then a vertical cut for the other half they would not meet by about .  They should match no matter the angle of the cut.I called Bosch and after some discussion not even arguing just explaining that I bought a top of the line saw and expected top of the line accuracy. they sent me a new saw and a return label for the old one.,woodworking,df3nawp,2,t5_2qlqp

If you mean the scientific terms hardwood and softwood those dont actually have anything to do with how physically hard or soft a species is but rather biological features that woodworkers dont generally need to worry about. But for easy reference Softwood any tree with long thin needles usually evergreen. Pine spruce etc. Hardwood any tree with broad flat leaves that drop in the fall and regrow in spring maple alder oak basswood etc. There are one or two exceptions to these rules but those arent species most woodworkers are likely to get a hold of anyway.,woodworking,dfdbhcb,5,t5_2qlqp

We live right outside of portage which to any of you who are familiar with Columbia county WI thats right about where that knot is in state. Found a nice piece of hickory in my grandfathers barn and decided r would make a nice plaqe. The only reason we didnt do a European style mount was because he actually shot the deer right between the antlers and shattered the skull. It made it really really hard to get correct antler placement but it worked out. The lighting from our ceiling made the little spot on the wall line up almost exactly where we live in the state which is where we hunt. All in all I think it turned out okay.

Danish oil might provide a bit more protection and still look good. Wipe on polyurethane would also provide some protection and keep the wood looking natural the nice thing about wipe on poly is that it goes on in really thin coats so you can just put a few coats on and avoid the plasticy feel of brush on polyurethane.

The way your image shows will require a lot less repositioning although it might have marginally more waste. Either way theyre working a quarter of the log.Of course that website doesnt have their terminology quite consistent anyway. If you look at this page youll see that both the text and the two photographs describe riftsawn using the modern convention of offangle wood with straight grain but no ray fleck. . . but that the drawing at the bottom left clearly shows the traditional riven log with the grain meticulously drawn at a perfect  angle.,woodworking,dgkeh5d,0,t5_2qlqp

11751377,0,t3_67oxso,a track saw will always struggle your cuts are as accurate as your measurements and placement of the track.  it could be dead on or not... having an accurate Tsquare helps but there are many opportunities for error.a table saw eliminates some of those opportunities. you can be sure to achieve parallel sides but no promises that you wont still end up with a parallelogram.  a sledmiter fence can index for  degrees if your work piece fits on one.  Otherwise your back to a tsquare to get  reference angle.  but at least that only  angle to get right instead of .side tip where possible leverage a factory corner on a sheet of wood that will always be degrees.  unfortunately it fails as you work your way into the sheet.,woodworking,dgs1qpj,2,t5_2qlqp

11774071,0,t3_67zcm1,Threaded inserts like that are not designed for endgrain use just like screws dont hold well in end grain.  You were shredding the fibers as it went in so there was nothing left to hold onto.  In face or edge grain the threads are roughly parallel to the grain fibers so they slip inbetween the fibers creating a strong joint.  In end grain they just cut through the fibers.  That said I have made it work before although not with brass inserts.Using a tap is going to have the same problem.You could try a steel insert with segmented threads like this.   This is what I have used before in endgrain.  Also the best way to drive a threaded insert in is with a bolt.  Those brass ones have slots like for a screwdriver but they are not effective.  You have to put afair amount of force on the insert when starting it to get it going in without stripping the hole.,woodworking,dgumive,1,t5_2qlqp
