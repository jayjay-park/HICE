The reason I personally didnt like the anime was not the fact that this was different to the game but how the characters are different to the game. In remark to the whole anime game comparison I felt like my biggest problem in it was showing what made this game great. The game tackled very big problems during adolescence such as Kanjis issue with sexual confusion which I felt like the character was done terribly he felt more of a punching bag to Yosuke and Yu with there gay slurs. I must admit Yuu had great character development throughout the whole anime which is no easy feet considering everyone played him differently in the game. The anime is very hit and miss but by all means people have different opinions and you are entitled by your own.

418904,0,t3_1ytqby,Yes thats what the evokers do. The kids in P can summon without evokers because they go into the Midnight Channel which is like an entirely different world that is more in tune with the shadows and thus by proxy personas  if they had evokers theyd likely be able to summon during the day as well. In P they werent that incredibly close to the shadow world so they still had to use the evokers to essentially force out their personas instead of summoning them naturally... The Dark Hour was tied to the shadow world but it was more like the shadow world was bleeding into the real world instead of them going directly into the shadow world.

485801,0,t3_1zfs9g,Oh yeah give the other SMT games a shot. I havent played DeSu yet but its pretty different from the other games gameplaywise...If youre a bit nervous to make the jump from P to games with smaller emphasis on characters and cinematic storytelling not sure if this is the correct term Im talking about constant in your face plot except not in a bad way give Persona  Innocent Sin along with its sequel Eternal Punishment and Digital Devil Saga a shot. I know that PIS is still Persona but it has more of that SMT vibe without giving up a strong upfront story and characters. Digital Devil Saga is kinda similar to P in that way. Both P and DDS are twoparters with cool stories and characters that arent afraid to get weird and dark.If you want something a bit more try SMT and Nocturne. Nocturnes a bit difficult to get into because its very much an atmosphere game where the battles are your puzzles. You have to be in the right mood for it.SMT is a nice mixture of both modern and classic SMT feel so I think that would be a good place to start in the main series. It starts out really hard but it gets better.I listed some games that are actually pushing or past your age requirement but for this series you kind of have to.  years ago was only . If you played Persona   year old game Im assuming youd be okay with Nocturne  year old game and Digital Devil Saga  year old game. Persona  Innocent Sin is a bit older  years old but PS games arent too bad right? Especially when theyve been ported and slightly improved on the PSP.I think the truly old aka SNES etc. games are worth checking out though theres some good ones.

I take it that none of your family was ever killed or oppressed by members of specific religions. Im not going to put on kiddy gloves for people who get easily offended by a video game. The reason they get offended is because of the concept of blasphemy which was created by illiterate and ignorant sand dwellers  years ago as they went on massive killing sprees to prove their God was the strongest. Tell me where were the Hindus rioting and screaming about spoilers Brahman in DDS? Oh right they dont exist. I noticed that you completely omit the fact that Yehowah is also the God of Islam and that Islam is just another variation of Christianity.

588460,0,t3_20ujwc,Im wondering what gameplay mechanics from both games we will see in this game.

Then there is auxiliary gameplay mechanics Do you convince a character to join your team like you would a demon in SMT or do you have to interact with a specific character like FE? Or maybe its a combination of the two? Can we get S Ranked support with a demon? I want to see how AtusNintendo decides to make the core aspects of this game attract fans from both communities.In terms of story Im wondering if theyre going to connect the worlds through Fire Emblem Awakenings canon crossdimensional portal or if theyre going for something totally different.In terms of characters I wonder if theyre going to go the FFvs route with all the MCs coming together in one game or if theyre going to grab a handful of iconic characters from the original titles.So many questions!

She does not represent human desire which what shes supposed represent. The seraphs dont look like angels at all they look like abominations.  The rest look like villains from power rangers.

Each game is such a different experience that it doesnt get stale. If all games were all story and no gameplay that would get stale very fast. Same thing for the other side too all gameplay and a lackluster story would get boring too. I like how SMT games can play both sides of the field.

716665,0,t1_cglqe7v,gtI think yuu is fine. Hes still a self insert. In the show? In the game thats sort of the point. But my point is that it doesnt work in the show because of the lack of choices. Because even if some things are open to interpretation others lines are clearly not. The Persona franchise thrives on its characters and in the game the protagonist is your lens into the lives of the actually developed characters. The problem here is that Yu is a character and we are supposed to be invested in his development given that he is the protagonist. But the sort of investment a game requires in the main character is different than a TV show. In a form of passive entertainment I at least find selfinsertion to be difficult if not impossible. gtI think they did as well as they realistically could have been expected to.No. They could have diverged from the game. They could have picked  or  social links to follow through on. I understand the one season constraint but there are plenty of shows that were only a single season that managed to accomplish a lot. As long as the show tried to directly mirror the game even in ways that didnt work failure was almost inevitable. I might be the only one but I would much rather have an adaptation that encapsulates the themes and emotional beats of the original work over trying to copy the plot points directly. ,Megaten,cglql2u,1,t5_2sj8i

P was great because there was some strong tension between the characters but none of that was ever directed at the protagonist unless you were explicitly an asshole.

1038169,0,t1_chm78j7,But the great will doesnt seem to come off as something that was created. It seems more like some abstract force that was always there but which YHVH hijacked control of by somehow programming himself into. And he and the angels justify calling him the creator of everything since what theyre actually referring to is not him but the great will but since he is now the face of the great will. Possibly before the creation of any worlds it was some abstract emenationist force that in some way that is never defined part of it broke off leading to the existence of worlds and them somehow yhvh got in control of it deciding that means that he should be in control of everything.An important part is the end of SMTI where lucifer says that he is a part of God that God discarded. Which fits with the emenationist idea. The polytheistic gods refer to him as just an arrogant god or the law aligned ones sometimes as the head god whereas angels including lucifer refer to him as if he was always the monotheistic god. That and the kabbalah being associated with chaos in II kind of gives the idea that the chaos side thinks that the divine is some thing that the strong should climb up and become gods by pulling into themself equally but still be differentiated and theyre mad at yhvh for trying to horde all of it to himself in order to control everything. But since yhvh is closest to the source hes still considered a monotheistic god  in part demiurge by people like lucifer who think that the ultimate goal is pulling him down so that they can all do whatever they want with the divine spark. ,Megaten,chmama3,1,t5_2sj8i

1171055,0,t3_27isse,If you feel like P lacked closure then The Answer will definitely provide that.  As long as youre not burned out on grinding in Tartarus Id definitely recommend you play that.  Theres no harm in taking a break and trying something else though and maybe coming back to it later.  Persona  doesnt require you to know the ending of P or the Answer or anything to understand it so youd be fine playing either one first.  That said PArena the fighting game does reference it somewhat so I recommend at least playing it before that.,Megaten,ci1d4b7,2,t5_2sj8i

1371251,0,t1_cimx0xq,gtOccasionally put points into dexterity so when you do run out of MPSP youre not screwed with terrible damage and luck for those crits.A few things. First I do not believe that Magicbased attacks can get crits although they do have occasional instakill effects that could be based on luck but I cant say for sure. Luck does increase the chance of smirking and it helps avoidshake off status ailments so it is definitely worth investing in on a regular or semi regular basis for any build.Second Im a tad skeptical towards the advice of having a magic build invest in Dex. From what I have read and experienced in the game it is optimal to focus on either Dex or Mag rather than splitting between the two. To get enough oomph out of normal attacks OP would need to divert a decent amount of points from Mag and Magic attacks need all of the oomph they can get. A better solution IMO is to invest in the  MP recovery app when it becomes available. Spirit Drain also works in a pinch. And of course dont be afraid to use those Chakra drops especially when they become common. Until those options become available carefully plan your expeditions around your MP and you shouldnt run into problems.,Megaten,cio6aq9,1,t5_2sj8i

1395887,0,t1_cir7gid,To answer your quick question  yes I played PG first. It was my introduction to SMTPersona and you are entirely correct in presuming that it colors my view of all the other games. In fact I really didnt like JRPGs at all until PG so I can thank that game for not only opening my mind to the SMT series but also to JRPGs in general.I do plan on completing all the Persona games. I think my trouble has been that I start P or P and then lose interest or another game on my list comes out then by the time I get back to PP Ive lost my sense of story and my handle on the game mechanics. Plus Ive never been much of a firstperson dungeon crawler kind of guy. Back in the day Ultima was my RPG of choice not Wizardry or Might and Magic. The firstperson dungeon crawling is actually the least appealing aspect of PQ to me. That aside I need to just focus on P and P and get through them.Are you suggesting that AUs success could determine if P is influenced by P or are you saying that depending on where the story ends up in AU will determine if P is influenced by P? Because I think at this point Ps story has got to be already written and set  the game is supposed to release in Japan later this year after all.The mini game idea in that post came from a dream so it wasnt fully realized. But yeah balancing the fun and tedium of a mini game is challenging. One last thought about the Social Links  what if not all Social Links had a tangible benefit on things like Persona skills and overall story progression? What if it was more casual such as youre interested in this character and their personality so you want to hang out after school and play a game. That person becomes your AI opponent or whatever and theres just a social interaction between the MC and the NPC. It could get repetitive and maybe it wouldnt work. It might be annoying like hanging out with GTA IVs characters. But done well it might be cool. Who knows?,Megaten,cir979f,2,t5_2sj8i

If not then this ride is going to be a bit rough. I guess Ill just try to enjoy it for the new golden content and improved art. Everything else is going to feel  shallow when compared to the original anime and especially the game. PTGA is the first version of P that i expect will be unable to stand on its own feet.

You must all be very curious students to be             taking this course over the summer. ...Im not really sure what to             make of that. Eeeheehee... Well lets talk about something             interesting today. All you future magicians will want to pay close             attention... Eeeheehee... Todays subject is Tarot. Thats right             those cards often used in fortunetelling. Originating in th             century Europe as normal playing cards tarot cards evolved into             tools of divination. A variety of different versions of tarot card             decks exist including the Marseille and Rider decks... But today             in respect of the great magician Crowley we will be using the             Thoth deck. First lets talk about the composition of the deck...             The modern card tarot deck is divided into two parts. There are              Major Arcanathe face cardsand  Minor Arcana or number             cards... The Minor Arcana are also sometimes called pips. The             Major Arcana feature a variety of illustrations on their faces.             Beginning with The Fool and ending with The World... they tell             a story in numerical order that is a metaphor of an individuals             journey through life. Each Major Arcana represents a stage on that             journey... an experience that the individual must incorporate to             realize his oneness. They are all important so lets take a look             at each of the  cards one by one.             The first card numbered  is The Fool. It represents the             beginning and suggests infinite possibilities.             The next card The Magician represents action and initiative...             but also immaturity.             The Priestess represents contemplation and inner knowledge.             The Empress represents motherhood and the life it brings forth.             The Emperor is an opposing card. It represents fathering and             relates to leadership and decisionmaking skills.             The Hierophant represents formality and knowledge and stands for             religion.             The Lovers card represents choice. Here the individuals             consciousness has finally surfaced.             The Chariot represents victory for the individual but only a             momentary one.             Justice represents the knowledge of what is right and what is             wrong.             The Hermit represents the individuals search for answers by             looking inward deep inside his heart.             Fortune represents fate and the opportunities that come with it.             Strength represents both passion and selfcontrol. It is depicted             as power with reason.             The Hanged Man reflects the individuals inability to take action.             Spiritual death awaits the individual with the th card which is             aptly named Death. Death is considered a transitional card... The             old ends and the new begins. Now let us continue along the path             following the transition.             Temperance is the balancing of opposites. Opening his eyes to the             world allows the individual to grow...             And as the Devil represents he then faces temptation...             At The Tower his values collapse on him. It seems as if he no             longer has anything to believe in but...             ...he then finds a glimmer of hope represented by The Star and             he is suffused with a serene calm.             This bliss makes him vulnerable to the illusions of The Moon.             Fears arise and he follows the dim path in his heart with             trepidation...             But he is rewarded with a bright future represented by The Sun             which signifies true achievement.             Judgement awaits the individual at the end of his journey as he             looks back on the path he has traveled.             The final card is The World which represents the individuals             full awareness of his place in the world.             That is the growth of an individual as explained by the tarot             cards. ...Perhaps all this talk about life doesnt hit home with             you young folks just yet hm? Eeeheehee... Now you can use all              cards to divine the future in detail... but most people only use             the  Major Arcana. Okay. Next lets talk about how to tell             fortunes using the Major Arcana. First you will need to shuffle             the cards. If a card is reversed its meaning will change so its             important...Now lets begin. Yodhevavhe... How are you all handling the             heat? ...I could brew you some of my special tea if youd like.             Eeeheehee... Now lets continue with our special summer study             The Truth Behind Magic. Ill be talking about Kabbalah. I             assume all of you have at least heard of Kabbalah yes? It is             known as the mystical study of the Hebrew scriptures but... as I             have mentioned before it has had a great impact on western             sorcery. It has been said that to learn the secrets of magic             first you must truly understand Kabbalah. So who was the person             who formed this incredible ideology known as Kabbalah? Well             according to legend it was Moses. Yes THAT Moses. The Moses who             gave us the Ten Commandments and split the Red Sea. But in             reality it was formulated by a group of rabbis long long ago.             However because it consists of such a complicated coded system...             Kabbalah did not become known to the western world until much             later. Now it is important to note that there are many different             ancient methods of deciphering Kabbalah. For example there is             Gematria the interpretatioin of text by replacing letters with             the numbers they represent. There is Notarikon where you take a             letter from each word to form another sentence or thought. There             is also Temurah a method where letters of words are replaced             thereby giving the sentence a new meaning. All these different             methods make it difficult to fully comprehend Kabbalah. Now one             of the most important ideas of Kabbalah is the Tree of Life             formed of the ten Sefirot. Most illustrations depict it as a chart             shaped like a tree. The  stages represented by the Sefirot...             and the  paths connecting them represent the stages of Creation             God formed from his own self as well as the direction in which             humanity should evolve. Where did we come from? Where are we             going? These answers lie in the Sefirot. When training your magic             its important to picture the Sefirot every so often. And when you             are meditating you should focus on the Sefirot as well. If life             was a test the Sefirot would be the basic questions. All aspiring             magicians should know them. So if youre looking for inspiration             try your hand at the Sefirot. Eeeheehee... By the way did you             all notice that I said there were  paths? Yes thats right.             The same number as the Major Arcana I spoke about earlier.             Eeeheehee... Now continuing on according to the Sefirot the             world is broken up into four stages...,Megaten,cjobf8e,20,t5_2sj8i

I do agree on the fact that a lot of skills end up being unused which is admittedly not uncommon for JRPGs but the rate for that is quite high for FFVI. But FFVI still remains as one of my favourite FFs ever partly because I like the large roster of playable characters.FF X is really really good as far as Final Fantasies go and is the one Ive played the most. The combat is pretty much the same as the previous titles but the customisation is insane. Sphere grids.. Weapon slotmodule crafting.. Aeon customisations both stats and abilities.. Different settings for Overdrive conditions.The game also has multiple optional bosses and dungeons. And I like the setting and premise of FFX. Spira is a beautiful world.

The Hierophant is more of grounding the spiritual making the divine tangible think like how a priest might speak the word of God to the people back when not a lot of people were literate and obedience to authority.I do need to say its not weird to get a feminine card as a guy especially if its one like HP.

2862844,0,t3_2stlpb,I believe that whatever mechanics and themes P implement they will not contradict Persona .  Atlus has made too much money off of the PP story to abandon it.  They will continue to make Arena games or games like Persona Q as long as they make them money.A lot of questions have been raised about technology specifically phones.  Its a reoccurring theme in the Persona games and I dont see them not using it.  For those that question how you use phones as a plot element need to watch the Apple adIf and its a huge it P uses phones as part of our subjugation I think social media and privacy will play a big role.  We willingly share information with the internet and constantly feed it with tweets facebook posts instagram pics Foursquare checkins.  We consume the information any time there is a lull in our daily lives.  If I go to the bathroom or it I am waiting for my food I am on reddit on my phone.

At  in the trailer you see someone whos clearly a human jumping off a building and transforming into what Im almost positive is the MCs PersonaCombined with the fact that MC movesteleports around in a disctintly nonhuman fashion during the stealth sequence at  Im thinking that the Persona games are finally going with the truth that Personas physically strengthenalter their users. In P and P the characters all behaved in very human ways no massive jumps or teleporting like we see in the P trailer.gtMy current theory is that MC was a thief then gets caught.That also seems to be the case with the entire intro sequence of MC burglarizing the casino jumping out the window and then being caught in the polices headlights Edit After seeing this image Im even more convinced that characters will transform into their Personas. Notice the similarity in MCs Personas face when compared to this still from the trailer.

It makes sense like for some battles to have certain party members and it just feels right to use everybody because It feels weird going through an area in a game and having somebody who is  levels under. It also makes it easier to deal with enemiesbosses that may have a specific weakness that the other party members may specialise in.I sometimes leave  people out and only use them sometimes but I always try hard to use everybody at least for one boss...I feel like digital devil saga  is a great reason for this spoilers because party members randomly leave the party at certain moments I wont explain why because Its a pretty big spoiler. and its always safe to have everybody at a similar level because a lot of RPGs have some character absences for a short while.,Megaten,cpqccym,2,t5_2sj8i

3547106,0,t1_cpwfcdk,Are you a Vulcan? Cause you sound a lot like a Vulcan to me.Anyway I hardly think that your example of helping  people in Africa with better technology medicine etc. is a good one. Wasnt there something akin to that in the hall of choices in SMT?  Where doing so was chaos? Besides it wouldnt be an instant change to human psychology at the fundamental level. It would simply be assisting them. They would keep their culture and traditions intact. Whether or not they change the way they as a society think on the fundamental level is up to them and time.Another thing. Flipping a magic switch to alter human psychology is all a matter of opinion. If most people in the world wanted it then sure. But thats unlikely. And then theres the issue of whether anything wrong with human psychology is a problem that cannot be solved by humans to begin with. Maybe I could live a life content with farming for the rest of my life but you know what that sounds like to me?Boring. As. Fuck.Its an argument that isnt based on the idea that happiness should be all we have. Crazy. I know. Id rather have a wide range of emotions and thoughts than blind contentment. I still think humans can solve their own problems and decide what those problems are.Maybe you should get licensing rights from Atlus to write your book while someone else maybe Interceptr or Supercuntscicle would have the parallel rights to write a book arguing for the absolute individuality of Chaos.

3571751,0,t1_cpzd7qb,Only thing I said about you was that I dont understand how you can have that kind of attitude. And yes I have several PMs from you on several different forums asking for information. My answer each time? A permutation of I got nothin. Which is true. I had no idea this was even going to be in the Direct otherwise I probably wouldve been a lot more vocal about it. But heres where we vastly differgtI or anyone else reacting to this trailer shouldnt be blamed for a terrible mismanagement of expectations at allHow? Up until yesterday the game was little more than vaporware. There was nothing to go on other than a name. Two companies came together in Japan with the idea of making a title that draws from two franchises that each span  out of the  generations of consoles with spinoffs etc. and of all the possible forms it could take you feel like the company not only misled you but is at fault and owes you an apology because it wasnt what you envisioned. I certainly dont think you can call it bait and switch. If the original teaser from  said SMT x FE awesome new RPG from ATLUSNintendo and then we showed you footage of an FPS where Jack Frost was riding on a Pegasus shooting demons then yeah ok. Thats bait and switch. But we literally had  letters to go on SMT x FE. But heres the big difference between your comment and your original post. Your whole post says we this... we that... whereas your comment is nothing but I this... and I that... That makes it a lot more palpable to discuss. And again your OP started off with some good points that could have led to some valid discussion about the game but then you go off on a wild tangent about the company that is only  of the games title  theres not even a clear indication about how much one series contributed versus another. Why? Because theres not enough information out there. Its super great that you were a huge fan of this game and that you talked it up to a lot of your friends and online etc. Thats awesome! Thats the pinnacle of what a good fan can be for any company. But the game let you down. Well  minute and  seconds of sample footage that had little to no context of the actual game itself let you down. So instead of saying huh well that sucked I wonder what the gameplay is going to be like? or even man thats disappointing  I wonder what could be next in the SMT franchise youre wailing into the sky WHYYYY ATLUS!? WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME? and presumably blasted the gamecompanyme on those same forums. All because of less than two minutes of footage. Im not trying to silence your opinions at all  you started to get into them in the OP but then you kind of lost your way. The comment does a little bit of a better job at voicing your personal beliefs and while I think I understand where youre coming from I dont agree with them at all. I enjoy discourse I encourage feedback I like being proven wrong it happens a lot. But heres what I dont like Baseless assumptions like this whole paragraph gtIm perfectly within reason to suggest that SMT is getting the shaft in at least some way  otherwise why would the initial trailer have existed? From this it is entirely fair to extrapolate given the common knowledge that Persona is ATLUS moneymaker that SMT or SMTthemed whatever have you is by comparison difficult to market and therefore that its continuation may be threatened.The other assumption that really grinds my gears is this gtI know Im not alone in understanding this situationYou dont understand the situation. You start spouting these wild allegations as fact because you got let down after two years. Im trying to tell you its ok. The trailer didnt meet your expectations and you feel that the two year wait was a huge letdown. That sucks. Not going to tell you your feelings are wrong. But just about any way to approach your letdowndisappointment is better than the company is wrong for letting me down. ,Megaten,cpzeo9k,9,t5_2sj8i

Edit Better yet when he smirks  chance that enemies will be feared excluding bosses.Place of origin Carthage.If you read about the man he was pretty terrifying.

4192315,0,t1_cry42c5,There are so many good JRPGs out there. Only likes Persona and specifically the fourth one. Pft. Burn him! xD I feel like a large majority of Persona fans just like G and even some Atlus fans too. So sad.Oooh man an EB remake would be killer and would go immediately onto my most anticipated list. A new Metroid too man mmn. Like especially a D one not Prime based. LIke the unreleased Metroid Dread. Oh man I would be hype as hell for that. xDLike I said I expect March  maybe February if we are lucky but certainly by March. Like yah it is  but it is early  so it doesnt hurt as much. I never meant mid  if that is what you thought I meant. That would be ridiculous and I would definitely be talking to Atlus USA about that. Only way a mid  release would happen is if Japan also gets a delay which could happen but I honestly dont think that will happen. I would be super sad if it did.Heh. XCX is gonna be huge but Id drop it for P. xD I usually actually only play games for a hour or so and then shelve them. I have a huge backlog. P would be one I would not do that to though. I would be playing it as much as I could until I beat it. xD In part because spoilers suck and part because ish P man Ive been waiting years for this.,Megaten,cry4ffm,1,t5_2sj8i

Unlike Etrian where theres an actual daynight cycle PQs events are kept within a relatively short timeframe so youre not gonna see a lot of profound moments.PQ was a very solid crossover that met all its expectations and I thought it was pretty good.

Junpei did do some uncool stuff but always apologized and made up for it whereas Yukari..... well lets just say her social link was purely for Cybele.

4707273,0,t1_ctnvmzf,Its a lot better in a couple things. Inventory is bigger selling and buying is faster you can see what your items doinstead of looking em up on the net are some of the improvements i like so far. Tho it suffers from a couple stuff that bugs me like the negotiation system which is a huge stepdown from the first game so far. Also the lack of Jakyou Manors and Terminals which for a game that requires a lot of going back to previous places has very little Terminals scattered around which makes backtracking so tedious. Also you dont get Mag from killing everything now just from darktype demons so that means getting Mag is a huge chore now. I have k mag so far and I dont even summon at least  demon out because I feel like it consumes a lot and Im not getting enough back for it so I just stick to spamming guns. Fusion is better tho since they added skill inheritance and that attack skills cost health now instead of nothing. Plotwise its a lot more interesting so far since theres almost something happening most of the time. I still like SMT Chaosfag and Lawfag so far tho still just a couple hours in the game so I cant say much plotwise. So far tho its a great game.,Megaten,ctnw18o,4,t5_2sj8i

If you havent done this sort of thing before honestly you probably wont get any site to publish your article even if it is for free they just wont do it for lack of public experience. This is why discussion forums and blogs are so popular people can post most anything they want for others to not only read but also generate ideas and discussion about their favoured topics. If youre wondering Well then how do I get experience? youll have to just create a blog or establish a place online for your works then pitch it to some site linking your experience how you dont want profit and let maybe itll happen. Sadly you cant just email somewhere and say Hey I wrote this article can you run it?.Either post it here or start someplace to house all your works but if you do the latter dont advertise by linking it on other places. That doesnt attract people it annoys them. If you want to share it somewhere else in addition to your little siteblogwhatever just copypaste the article elsewhere then shamelessly plug your site at the end of the post.If its as good as you think afterwards you can hopefully approach some sites. If not you can always post them here people will usually give it a read if you put effort into it and will talk about it. Here an example of a  page analysis of Bloodborne some guy did and theres people here you post their MegaTen analyses stuff here as well like the origins of stuff or just demon analyses Bunkerman for example.

4930818,0,t1_cuf3698,The chatroom is more or less dead for most of every day. When you run a chatroom for more than a month you realize that even people you consider regulars will slowly drift away over time exponentially so as others do who were the ones they were there to see. The risk of too few people using it is always the biggest concern. Arbitrary hoops to jump through cuts new people coming in from an already tiny amount to close to none. Even if in theory its not hard to ask for an invite its something that people who are ambivalent about will avoid doing. Which is exactly what you need to get them to do if you want to keep it alive. Keeping it closed is basically dooming it to lasting a few months at best. Panicking about raids most of which are imaginary or which even when they happen are single day events is not worth turning the risk of the entire thing dying three times as high just to avoid a single annoying day. No one is going to keep up a constant raid in a tiny room they dont care about. Where as it slowly dying is something thats already happening so asking whether its a possibility is not even needed.Put in reverse theres actually no reason for it to be closed since the reasons are things that people worry about far more than they actually happen. The flipside is that keeping it open and easy to use is necessary to make sure it doesnt run out of people.

4941966,0,t1_cugzyyr,Do you into Japanese? Even if you dont Id recommend the Another Centurys Episode series if you get a chance. Its made by From Soft back during their mecha phase and it plays sorta like Super Robot Wars if Super Robot Wars played like Zone of the Enders. The second game is the most wellrecieved and it has fan favorites like the God and Zeta MkII Gundams. ACE emulates like shit but you can play as Nirvash Spec  and Shin Getter Robo the way transformation works all three at once Change Getter at the press of a button. Story seems to follow Eureka Seven too. ACE Portable is the easiest to emulate as well as play simplified controls and less moonspeak but its kind of boring if you play as any unit besides Nirvash.Id also recommend Gundam vs Zeta Gundam it emulates beautifully and there are a ton of alternate timeline scenarios. You can also mass produce Big Zams. Strategy game.If you havent seriously check out Crypt of the Necrodancer. Its a musicbased roguelike and its hard as shit. You can upload custom tracks and the tempo is based on the song you uploaded. I recommend against Initial D and Redline.,Megaten,cuhh2v8,1,t5_2sj8i

5427366,0,t1_cw5dovn,gtFirst of all I love VNs. I really fucking do. But P even by VN standards was lacklustre. Its like some frickin harem Light Novel or Generic Anime No.. Everyones literally just a trope.The problem with that statement is that P wasnt entirely a visual novel. I liked that part as it was done in moderation. I loved going through the environment meeting people and fighting enemies with them. If the whole game was a visual novel such as that fanmade one or PArenaUltimax without the fighting I would probably not like it as well.gtI fail to see how youre able to finish P and then say SMTamp  SH are too old. If anything Soul Hackers has more modern mechanics than P. Theyre not hard to grasp at all so I fail to see your point besides something thats probably just hardme.You failing to see something doesnt mean it didnt take place. I would much rather play P over and over than even attempt to play SMT ampSH. Its really not that hard. P has an interesting story you get to interact with your characters a lot much less than in P though the demon interactions are more fun the indicators of their moods are far more forgiving and easier to interpret too and the dungeons are shorter and move quicker at least on the PSP version.gtWrong Devil Summoner. Raidou  has shitty combat. Im talking about the original Devil Summoner on the SaturnPSP. Soul Hackers prequel. This kind of proves youve played very little of nonpersona games in my eyes if you manage to think Raidou  has a heroine called Rei Reiho or it could have just been a while. I dunno.I didnt mention Rei Reiho anywhere. Never played the original Devil Summoner but seeing as its of the same mould as Soul Hackers I wouldnt even want to. I know full well what to expect.And sitting over a year with a dictionary? I am not a masochist. gtI dont even know how to respond to your next point. Its either saying graphics  ugly or some other crap. DeSu doesnt even have an auto battle so Id like to see how exactly it lacks active participation.Its not that hard to figure out. Play a title like DmC and then play DeSu which is supposed to be an actiongame. DmC or Ninja Gaiden or what have you is so much more fun to play. Yes you cant tame demons and stuff there but it doesnt transport you into a separate screen and force you to fight in a tiny arena. DeSu would work so much better if only you could see the demons and not have to encounter them randomly and could engage them in realtime DmC style.gtNice description of P and  along with P and  if we swap out sprites with models. For someone who claims to like visual novels I fail to see how this bothers you when thatThe difference is that you actually stand there near these characters and they are not in your pocket communicating from another dimension  lines of dialogue and then turning mum.gtSMT games arent that hard. Hell if you wanna be cheap  and  have win buttons and levels dont even matter in Nocturne skills do. Theres no real Megaten out there thats difficult as all hell but only mildly annoying at ocassional points and annoying as all hell with Sector Eridanus which is the only point I can think of besides the slog that is P.Then why do people consider it a hardcore Demons Soulsesque level of difficulty? Just because you are wellversed in its mechanics and like it doesnt mean that its not hard or boring for a lot of other people.The mainline SMT series is far far harder and unforgiving compared to the Persona games.,Megaten,cw5ehc0,-2,t5_2sj8i

5482615,0,t3_3q6730,I am gonna be so upset if Nintendo isnt going to localize this. I mean they plan on localizing it in the west and weve seen gameplay at E. But the game received a lot of backlash from both communities. Plus The Wii U isnt a popular home console though arguably one of the betters ones for this gen We havent heard much about the western release and they seem to be targeting a very small group in west. The english dub VAs have a lot of work to do and even finding appropriate VAs if they do plan on recording over the songs. This game looks like it has a ton of funny moments great gameplay great jpop music and just looks fun on its own. But I wouldnt be surprised if they dont localize it after thinking this through on its western release. I hope to play it though. It looks great.,Megaten,cwcgea0,3,t5_2sj8i

5861968,0,t1_cxo0gb2,Yeah Lost Memories was very good save for one big contradiction Maya fights at your side to reset the world which makes absolutely no sense... I was hoping for some sort of twist explaining why Maya was there fighting to do the exact opposite of what she told everyone to do at the end of Innocent Sin but no such explanation was given. It was a pretty big oversight. I guess they couldnt put Yukino in but still needed a full roster for the battles so they just rolled with it hoping nobody would notice?Persona  Batsu Infinity Mask the sequel to EP on the other hand was pure nonsense. None of the events of either IS or EP are really referenced at all. The fact that rumors are becoming reality again in the game is completely glossed over as if its perfectly natural. Nyarlathotep and Philemon are never mentioned. A set of bizarre murders happens and the twist is that Sudous back and hes trying to transform into a demon... He succeeds at turning into a demon invoking power from some ancient cursed Japanese lithograph... The team destroys the spirit in the lithograph but the lithograph itself is never found. The end.It was as if somebody who never played any of the Persona  games got a list of the characters and a one paragraph summary for EP and was then told to make an original story. It was atrocious. Lost Memories was pretty good but what they did with Infinity Mask was almost insulting.With that said even though Infinity Mask was not very good I think that it should still be preserved and translated for posteritys sake... But as I cant rebuy the game I cant be the one to provide it. All I can do is offer this basic summary.,Megaten,cxo18f0,2,t5_2sj8i

5987876,0,t1_cy4h7yu,Ummm...anyways to be completely honest I would play Persona  then  and then . I know thats a little odd but it all has to do with patience if your going to play the Persona series I wouldnt recommend starting with the most recent entry as itll only make it harder for you when your playing the other games. Not only that but the Persona series goes from Persona  and then Persona    theyre not connected story wise but the general idea of how the gameplay works is similar between the two sets of games in the series. So when youve finished Persona  and you know that you can tolerate Persona  and s pacing then you can play either one it doesnt really matter although personally i chose Persona .TLDR Persona    to get a feel for the series and Persona  when you  feel that you can tolerate its different pacing and mechanics. ,Megaten,cy4jiqi,3,t5_2sj8i

Think of it like Metal Gear compared to Metal Gear Solid if youre familiar with those games. If you want more info feel free to read ahead and check out the wiki both this subreddits wiki in the side bar and also the megaten wikia if you want to know even more.Megami Tensei  is based closely on the Megami Tensei books following the Nakajima and Yumiko characters. For a brief summary Nakajima makes a demon summoning program and the two of them are reincarnations of Izanagi and Izanami respectively if you want more info look stuff up about the books and early games on the megamitensei wiki. Megami Tensei  is apparently based off of the third book but I dont know how close it is. It all takes place in one massive dungeon divided into different sections. So the dungeon crawling feels more like SJ or the EO games compared to the smaller dungeons that something like Nocturne SMT Soul Hackers etc. have in that theyre long and full of traps. MT follows a linear story where youre going through this massive dungeon to kill Lucifer for some reason the story is definitely not the strong point and doesnt have any alignments or alternate endings. It created the mon genre with demon negotiation summoning and fusion. It was released for the famicom and eventually updated to the super famicom along with Megami Tensei  with the title Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei and KMT has an English fan translation. After MT there was MT which seriously changed the story having nothing to do with MT as would eventually become standard for the series. This time it takes place in a post nuclear apocalyptic Tokyo that also has demons and humanity is living in nuclear shelters. You follow two boys who after playing a game that is built off of MT you play what is basically the first dungeon of MT as a game called Devil Busters in MT are told that they are the Messiahs and must go get rid of the demons by Pazuzu. Demons break into the shelter and Pazuzu gives you a demon summoning program. This time around you have an overworld and travel around the wasteland of Tokyo visiting different settlements and exploring dungeons playing out like most mainline SMT games. This game did not have an alignment system but it did give you a few choices in the game that affected the ending. In the end you either side with Lucifer and fight YHVH to free humanity from his control and let humans and demons live in peace or side with YHVH and fight Lucifer to kill all demons and become a god yourself. Though this plays out a little differently than the alignment system would. The law ending where you side with YHVH is the standard ending but if you make a series of correct choices mostly just not killing certain bosses but sparing them when given the choice you will get the chaos ending which is meant to be the better end. This one was also released on the famicom and was updated to the super famicom in KMT.Shin Megami Tensei  was made for the SNES and basically created the final parts of what makes a mainline SMT game what it is. Youre now play as a boy who downloads a demon summoning program and gets caught in the demon apocalypse. Long story short the world goes to shit and you play a part in deciding how it is formed. This one added the alignment system where you choices affected in invisible point counter that at the end of the game would decide if you were set for the lawful end the chaotic end or somewhere in the middle. I mostly only brought up MT here because of the dungeons I mentioned. In most dungeons there are one way doors where when you walk through them you cant go back so it can often waste a lot of time and the map spell shows parts of the map you havent explored yet but in a limited range while the automap shows everything you have explored but with the whole floor. This means the map spell can show you where the one way doors are before you step through them and can save you a lot of time. These return in MT and SMT but they are much less common so it wasnt really worth spending the MP needed to cast the map spell.,Megaten,cyuzdsq,9,t5_2sj8i

It couldve been great it really could have. One lingering thing I still think about is how the Velvet Room guest at the beginning wasnt Yu and how it mightve been Sho. In addition to him being referred to as PHERO in the code Rise was PU FIGHTER in the PU code keep in mind and the similarities in appearance with the P MC somewhat I cant help but think it might be Sho.,Megaten,czlegpq,2,t5_2sj8i

His videos were so awkardly done with lots of pauses a minute long intro sweating and him reading directly from the Megaten wiki. Also theres the fact that the videos were kinda pointless since the information was already available. But he never actually stopped doing them and the amount of effort he started putting into his videos got really impressive. Then it got to the point where he started doing live skits and introducing his family members and friends.

7184635,0,t3_4dv7do,Okay so theyre all in Kongokai. That is a perfect place for this whole crossover shit to happen. It also looks like you have to explore it to find each of the heroes before you progress so at least it is a dungeon you can explore. And Im really hoping you do fight the other heroes when you find them but there isnt really anything here to suggest that. Also I really hope that this isnt like SMTs DLC as in not voice acted. SMTs DLC never had any new lines of dialog it would just reuse some lines for characters when appropriate and use brief sounds from characters to replace them saying full lines. I hope that isnt the case here because I would really like to here Hero Aleph and DemiFiends voices. But hopefully at least well be hearing them make some battle sounds or something.Oh and also those images of the three heroes in this video seem like decent places to get their Doi versions as flairs.Edit Watching the video again I noticed that DemiFiend and Kazuya do make noises when theyre talking. But they seem to be brief lines compared to the dialog so unless there is some editing going on there were not getting full lines of dialog but just them making kind of related noises as they talk. Better than nothing I suppose they at least each have a voice actor.Another Edit Just watched again using a shitty google translate to figure out what shit is saying barely. I think DemiFiend mentions defeating Kagatsuchi and he mentions Lucifer but I cant understand the Lucifer part. And theyre all asking kind of typical things of Why am I here? or What is going on? Looking forward to finding out what is going on in this thank god it comes out in less than a week.,Megaten,d1utwf9,6,t5_2sj8i

7964724,0,t1_d41mww3,gtIm not really sure how you can classify any sense of what matters if we agree that the topic in question is inherently subjective. Assuming thats the case the number of people who have their respective definitions fulfilled are irrelevant from an objective standpoint since trying to apply objective value to such concepts is impossible by definition. Thats a meaningless complaint. Either nihilism is true or its not. If it is then the decision doesnt matter. If its not then there has to be some way to make sense of what is happening even if value is subjective. Ethicists dont say that value being subjective makes there be no way to make sense of it. If value is based on subjective preference of course we have to look at how much of what people want they are getting. If you assume that its so subjective that no counting method can be presumed then theres no meaningful way to make a choice whatsoever. But its not clear why that would be assumed since if it were subjective why would it be subjective to something different than the wants of individuals? Pretty much every ethics agrees that even subjective preferences would regardless of presuppositions most likely collapse into an objective counting method. And even if not and the method was itself up for grabs it would still collapse into something like an agreement method that you an still find a way to make sense of to determine answers. And that itself is a fringe theory so shouldnt be what youre looking at to begin with.So you are stuck in a dilemma here by presuming subjectivity. If its subjective so much that no counting matters then nothing can win. If its subjective to maximizing individual subjective preference then law wins obviously. If its subjective to whatever the people think it should be and their whims somehow control the counting method then law once again wins because the people there are constructed to maximally prefer being there. Decision theoretically based on the different possibilities for subjective preference if you start by presuming subjective preference then you would need to take law since it can be and likely is the right answer but seemingly cannot be the wrong one since in the worst case scenario involving subjective preference there simply is no right answer.gtTo begin with from my own observations most people tend to take some degree of offence to having things forced on them be it from people or situations. In a law world theres a much smaller amount of forcing overall since most people are attuned to the world. In fact if you admit that situations are just as bad as people it means thats another unanimous point for it. Since here you maximize positive liberty giving people more ability to act on their interests since the world supports it. So this is more points for it.Secondly I would think that both natural events like erosion and humanproduced situations like a loss of a large amount of money demonstrate that there is a big difference between something happening abruptly and something occurring over time. And if were going to start comparing infinite expanses of time then all of this discussion becomes irrelevant if we assume that this type of change can occur naturally over time since the subsequent generations who live in everlasting peace would be infinite in number  compared to infinity is the same as  compared to infinity.Thats an attempt to avoid the issue. Yes there may be infinitarian paralysis if the world literally lasts forever. But you have two issues there. First its generally presumed that theres answers to it and so one outcome can still be better. And second even if there wasnt that would still bring you back to there being no right answer at worst. If the answer out of a or b is either a or it doesnt matter then the correct choice under uncertainty is a because it may matter and if it doesnt you didnt lose anything. And close to no ethicists think that these abstract issues mean no distinction matters.Presumably the world doesnt literally last forever anyways. And forever in this context means til it ends. Meaning that the infinity question would not come up. If you had to rely on nihilistic premises to not concede something it means that youre running out of more plausible things to go with anyways. Its irrelevant since it cant be a point for neutral only a possible reason it doesnt matter. Which if theres a possibility of it not mattering its not a point for anything. Since again if the worst case scenario is that neither are right it meas that the one that is right in the best case scenario is decision theoretically correct to go with.gtIts not just a matter of the change being direct versus indirect its that the change occuring is so radically different that its not remotely comparable. To quote myself An adult who is not even capable of conceiving selfish behavior on their part will not suddenly start engaging in it simply because they observe it in others Maybe it doesnt. But its what the game says happens. So its the rules we have to work with. Lilith seems to call it demonic knowledge implying it may not even be something physical. Which is more or less the games way of saying that it doesnt have to make sense you just have to accept that its how things work in this world.gt Furthermore now youre assuming all of the people of Mikado are like that from the start when before you pointed out that members of the Luxorer class quite clearly behave with selfishness considering their institution of the class system in Mikado The luxoror class was created due to taint from tokyo. This is talked about ingame. The first king aquila and even some of the people like skins and the guy with the fedora had visited it. Since he was the first king it is implied that it stems from him. Issachar even implies that theres some way that the luxorors keep themselves seperate and use their separateness as a way to abuse the casualries. Youre also once again ignoring that whatever happens to them happens before the end of the game. The law path isnt doing anything extra to them it starts after the new structure has already been set up. Obviously this change is implied to be big since thats the entire drive of the beginning of the plot. The books lilith gives out to people are seen as transforming them so much that some of them literally turn into demons. You cant ignore this huge a segment of the plot. And you cant assume that what shes doing is unique to chaos either since its just a more extreme version of the change anyways. the implication is that its actually effecting something about their fundamental nature. Its why they compare it with the apple in the garden of eden.gtI think its pretty tenuous to assume the remaining angels and YHVH intend to have no interference with the postLaw world particularly considering the presence of an organized religion dedicated to worshiping YHVH in Mikado. That would suggest to me a social hierarchy that places those beings above humanity as administrators of the world.Most of those beings are dead and the world they wanted is already there. There isnt implied to be any active presence of supernatural forces in the new world. Especially since the omniscient narrator implies as such. And angels dont really rank above people in terms of the way human leaders since they exist to benefit humans not the other way around as fallen angels see it. Maybe yhvh is still around being egotistical that everyone likes him now but so what? Hed be around either way and if the outcome lasts forever then hes not hurting anyone. Even If we have to take a step back and ask whether IVA retcons the law ending into not being permanent which I dont think it does then thats not a huge issue. Then the correct answer would simply be to spoilers take the massacre ending in final and use your new power to create the law ending for real.gtIve said several times now that I personally consider that to be something that has value. Ive also said that youre welcome to disagree since as weve discussed its a purely subjective interpretation.Saying that individuals can subjectively disagree is pointless because the question isnt about what any one person prefers but about what is correct to do. What you value doesnt matter because youre just one person. If your point was only that you might like it better that is neither here nor there. Not to mention that even that may not be true since after psychological restructuring youd probably like the more peaceful outcome better anyways. My point is that its better overall according to ethics. And that this is something that theres a pretty hard to question the case for. Since subjectively more people would like it objectively it easily taps into far more values people consider important and which have good cases for objective importance in general and if they were somehow incomparable and  or nothing was right then in a worst case scenario it still wouldnt lose.gtThis is why I dont think the table format is very good for this kind of discussion it encourages us approaching these subjects like a bulletpoint list where every point has equal weight which isnt necessarily the case.  The point isnt that every bullet point is equal. Its that when you see all the potential benefits lined up next to the much smaller amount of opposing benefits it becomes more obvious why focusing on one single point from the smaller list becomes more tenuous to try to present as the inherent crucial point that everything revolves around. Especially when some of the neutral points not only may not matter at all but some others are things that there would be things analogous to anyways. Like overcoming struggles.,Megaten,d4bb7c7,1,t5_2sj8i

Although Nintendo does still need to approve rd party published games on its own platforms for them to be officially licensed by Nintendo.I think the difference here is Nintendo as the publisher put money into the development of this game and wants to maximize profits or minimize negative profits if the game bombs. I can see some of the changes made could have a wider appeal at the expense of alienating fans of Atlus games. Will it work for them and will they have sold more copies now?

He was the only character I didnt get to Fate level  and lost the true ending that douche battle system is fun fusion was fun Boss battles were insane and clever and its tone was great The level of seriousness is between SMT IV and Persona . Honestly it felt I was watching a TV show because of the plot and how everyone was significant to the story. Every battle seemed connected and meaningful. Unlike when it comes to DS sRPGs Fire Emblem where every battle seemed unnecessary and there stories are just there to fill in the void to a game where its best factor was the gameplay. Yeah I get it. FE is mostly sRPG but I liked DeSuRB more because it was a better RPG in terms of plot characters that are meaningful great story Voice acting though FE has  grunts and choices that can change the outcome of the ending. Aside from DS sRPGs rant and going back on topic its great game and I am pretty sure its my top Megaten game for me so far. I hope NX or the next genDS gets DeSu.,Megaten,d551nyt,8,t5_2sj8i

You can actually be suspended during the time you are supposed to be stealing Mr. Kamoshidas heart. It appears that unlike in Persona  where not completing an objective before the deadline resulted in a game over Persona  allows you to fail to meet objectives by their given deadlines and makes you live with the consequences. Im wondering if this has anything to do with the concept of Glory vs. Ruinperhaps there are significant repercussions later on for getting suspended for example. EDIT Of course this is assuming that getting suspended isnt an automatic part of the plot. EDIT THIS WAS ENTIRELY A MISTAKE. Nenilein mistranslated the typical Days until Expulsion banner. Please forget this was ever a thing. This has been noted already elsewhere but Anne is of the Lovers Arcana and you can bring any party member to a confessional in order to regain lost skills.

Im ok with that because if the culture it comes from found it disturbing theres no need to keep it.As for TMS Im ok with the age change thats like the only censorship I kind of like but the rest of censorship was bullshit. As someone else said ask if it changes the content of the story. In TMS I feel it did greatly. By not being garvue models it seems like we missed out on Tsubasas development and actual embarrassment its almost laughable that shes so afraid to model such modest clothes. Worse than Tsubasa it seems because theyre just ordinary models now there was a lot of subtext that we didnt get relating to Makio and Nobu.

Its the same problem with reddits default snoo thumbnails. They are very semitransparent and look awfully close to the background gray on night mode. Id have to heavily image edit them to be like almost white semitransparent Jack Frosts and I think thats a bit above my image editing skills to make those frosts look good. I figured the best plan was to remake them from some source perhaps make lineart of the demons from a source one dark and one light but thats also above my editing skills. I also was kind of wanting to have like different demons for different things. Initially I thought of Jack Frost self and Pyro Jack nsfwspoiler but then I realized I could have  thumbnail types and that led me to the  demons idea and thus Mitama.

8613459,0,t1_d6i9q2a,Maybe but I also have no idea what Im talking about and am just making guesses here. Youd need new weapons to do any damage and any spell or item that could hurt him wouldnt be all that useful because they dont do that much and youre very limited in what you could bring only so much MP for the spell and getting each item would take a while. So the only real way would be to find better weapons and autobattle it with that. But the weapons have to more damage to kill Lucifer faster than they spend time searching for to get. Also most of the damage is done by the demon they recruited look at the HP when Nakajima and Yumiko attack compared to when the demon attacks so extra weapons would only increase the damage output a bit but would probably still rely on the demon.But then I just remembered halfway through typing that that if theyre timing by last input they dont care how long the autobattle takes so long as they press auto as soon as possible. So going to get a weapon might make the video end sooner but final input would be delayed by however long it took to get the weapon. I guess that measuring by last input is a pretty shitty way to judge time for a JRPG then I wonder why they use that?,Megaten,d6ia2nd,2,t5_2sj8i

8947171,0,t1_d7n9x8b,It comes out in America on the th. But its been out in japan for a few months. And Ive spoiled the majority of the game for myself as well as watched many of the Japanese scenes. The reason for this being that theres something in it that the plot is built around that fans have been waiting for for over two decades. Which is longer than half the people in this subreddit have even been alive. At the first major Japanese announcement of the game they made this aspect of it front and center. I normally dont spoil everything but in this case it was hard not to.I mean the games plots are more vehicles for themes than they are just straightforward plots. Problem is sometimes theyre really vague about the themes. So I think it helps to get an idea ahead of time of what they are going for to be able to already understand it when seeing it in action.

Dagda never really gave you a good reason to cut ties with your friends. The only thing that he could produce was that they were dead weight to you whereas the story and the gameplay seem to point you in the completely opposite direction. What I also didnt like was that they considered friendship to be completely black and white. The two paths seemed to steer you into either absolute dependence on other people or absolute independence from everyone. Dagda occasionally made some good points which made me more inclined to go with his route but it ultimately like most megaten games resulted in me not really wanting to go through either. For example Dagda criticizes your friends for the egojerking they do at some point early on in the game I vaguely remember it couldve been something related to Sheshas defeat. But his point was that your friends were wallowing in their pride and baseless compliments for each other. In other places it seemed like what Dagda was saying had no weight and he held contempt for the idea of friendship for no reason at all. I would compare Dagdas route to a true utilitarian ending. He offers you the position of godhead in exchange for the souls of your friends with the guarantee that demons and gods would no longer be a problem for the new humanity. Youre presented with the choice to ensure the freedom and safety from demons or to preserve the current universe in exchange for the possibility of YHWH coming back or another demon vs. angel apocalypse existing. Another good point Dagda makes is that demons and gods used to not always have physical manifestations and that was something that he longed for. He wanted demons and gods to go back to their original formless selves as parts of nature. Demons incarnate and survive physically by consuming magnetite which they can receive by eating humans or by feeding off of their summoner. Demons are inherently a threat to the survival of mankind and have to go back to being abstract formless entities that exist as forces of nature. The bonds ending goes a different route by saying yes living with demons sucks and the possibility of YHWH coming back sucks but its preferable to restarting humanity. Its implied that you and Flynns souls would be reincarnated in the future to ensure the neutrality and safety of humanity but that would mean having to go through the process of waging a demon war again which would mean more suffering.Youre presented with the choice to sacrifice your friends and what humanity has built so far for a universe that is free from demonic and divine influence. I feel like this couldve presented a very interesting narrative that uses the typical muh friendship trope as part of a greater story. Unfortunately there is a lot of wasted potential here. For what reason I dont know but regardless of Apocalypses many flaws it was still a very fun and enjoyable game. I feel the same way about SMT IV but like you Id prefer more adult themes but we havent had a serious game about that yet. Someone might potentially argue that SJ could be seen as that but I didnt feel real adult themes there.When I first saw the story trailer for SMT IV in japanese a few years back I suspected a suspense  thriller RPG but I didnt get that at all. Which is unfortunate demonhunting samurai couldve been an interesting narrative if the demons were actually threatening and most deaths by demons being very cartoonish.Edit Also I really loved how they fit Krishna into the story. His ideals line up similarly how an actual Krishna would. Hes a composed trickster who wants to bring humanity together into a singular consciousness similar to Hinduisms idea of enlightenment. Maitreya had similar ideals but they never really went anywhere. Buddhism and Hinduism are pretty similar enough in their ideas of enlightenment regardless.,Megaten,d8am0r9,9,t5_2sj8i
9148648,0,t1_d8axf2w,And who any time you express that you are attached to anyone NO! HAVING FRIENDS IS BAD! YOULL REALIZE IT AND BECOME AN EDGY LONER ONE DAY!! Because obviously his plan to respect humans independence from gods makes total sense that this is expressed only as one human being independent but also becoming a god and controlling everyone else. Also said human is more or less being forced by him to comply with him a god. Dagda is insane and hypocritical but the narrative acts like it barely even knows this. ,Megaten,d8bnorp,3,t5_2sj8i

Also I have a really soft spot for edgelords so siding with Dagda wasnt that hard.gt Gaston I took me while to like him thoughSame here I just found weird that he went from selfcentered prick to warrior of the people too fast to me.

9267971,0,t3_57686z,Persona  FES or Nocturne. Let me explain.Persona  is fucking fantastic for easing people into basic MegaTen combat. There are fusions weaknesses buffs and debuffs. The dungeon crawling is a fair bit unlike regular Megami Tensei gameplay but it can be dealt with on the basis of it not being hard to adapt to a different camera angle. The story emphasis might also ease in more casual gamers who might not be ready to jump into a combatheavy Megami Tensei game. Its overall a very fun starting point.Nocturne is what Id recommend to anyone who wants to skip out on the waifu and story elements of Persona  and is confident in their gaming skills. The game teaches the Press Turn system by allowing the player a ton of room for experimentation. The game also teaches the player concepts such as buffs and debuffs with challenging and exciting gameplay. The map may seem intimidating but it really teaches Megami Tensei exploration to the player. Nocturne is overall a very good starting point for hardcore gamers who wanna get straight to the action.,Megaten,d8qs4w0,4,t5_2sj8i

With PFES you have to plan out your move. With P you can choose each action without any plan though obviously youll do better if youre planning a few steps ahead like in any game the difference is that P doesnt require it. In P at your turn you have to make a plan. For example you might be in a situation where youll get your turn then one of the two enemies attacks then another party member gets a turn then the other enemies then the rest of your party. You might want to have that first party member heal up after the first enemys attack but maybe their attack will be weak so you would be better of attacking since youll be able to take the second enemys attack. And then after that maybe you want one of the other party members to heal. This is called planning. ,Megaten,d94mru0,5,t5_2sj8i

9475957,0,t3_5ai494,I love the soundtracks for MegaTen games and the way they draw from genres other RPGs Japanese ones in particular dont often draw from. Theres jazz metal hiphop electronic music even funk and disco.  Theyre so good at producingcapturing specific moods that feel true and distinct to each game and theyre great independent listening I cycle through them on my phone along with regular music. These games would be so much worse without their musiclike imagine the Raidou games with a regular orchestrated soundtrack by some other composer it wouldnt have nearly the same level of charm would it?Also SMT IV had the best OST Ive ever heard.,Megaten,d9h46pl,2,t5_2sj8i

The human alignment heroes are never traditionally good or evil at least as far as I know. Maybe in IISJ they are since Ive not played those.I agree about the aspect of which world youd be in affecting your alignment for that world. Obviously the world of IV is far different from say DeSu. One of the things I meant but didnt say straightout was that your alignment is not something you dont know about yourself. It is typically just a category to represent your general ideology isnt it? And of course this is just a little fun thing but something actually made based around this series would have been a lot less iffy and wouldnt have come across as lazy. As you said alignment is handled differently between both Megaten and DampD.,Megaten,d9weyn5,1,t5_2sj8i

Solitude isnt so bad if its the only thing youd know in the world. In real life I dread solitude and I wish I could appreciate it.I also really like the True Demon Ending for science fictional reasons the concept of breaking the cycle is just mindblowing to me or at least it was when I first familiarized myself with the ending.

I reach the point in the fight where I was obviously going to lose Only  demons where alive in my party so I just put in autofight expecting a quick defeat and went to do other stuff. I return a few minutes later and to my surprise the fight was still going with  demon alive. Turns out my last demon TakeMinakata drained  of her  possible attacks. On the other hand he was out of mana and Xi Wangmu resisted physical attacks. This turned into a fight of who could outlast the other which thankfully my demon won but he was very close to dying.

10052218,0,t3_5jnois,Finally got around to watching Arrival. What a fucking solid movie. Starts off kind of weak but the rest of the film ties so fucking well together and its strangely inspiring. Also saw Rogue One... EUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Ive never been so uninterested in what was going on in a movie. Every character is introduced in the most sloppily done way. Forest Whittakers character is ultimately pointless. Cassian is insufferable the whole way through and I dont care about Jyn at all. The only character I kind of cared about was the pilot but there was hardly any setup for him. HOWEVER the last third of the movie is actually pretty good. Its exciting its emotional and has fantastic character moments its star wars. But at that point the damage was already done for me. The music was pretty good though. Didnt think the fanservice was TOO bad but a lot of it was done sloppily. I have no idea why people are saying this is better than Force Awakens. I have some problems with FA but at least the first thought in my mind when it was over was Yeah. That was a pretty fun film. What did you guys think?P.S.

10234808,0,t1_dc41el4,gt I wonder how a plot like that would have worked. Theres angels and demons but it turns out they are part of a system that is designed to be shitty. So then the point is that yhvh is bad and you have to side with a polytheistic god to fight against him. And some angels or demons would defect to your side tooThat could work I guess but I feel that runs the risk of making this enemy lets call it Yellow Head for now the focus. If we want to really look at the competing polytheistic ideologies in detail I feel like it has to be something a bit more abstract. But Im far too tired to put actual thought now into what that could have been that would have still preserved the concept of an alliance. It would still need to be something wrong with the system though at least from the perspective of the gods.Of course this could just be my bias coming inwanting it to be less like Apocalypsethinking they did a crap job with Yellow Head etc. etc.,Megaten,dc4684z,1,t5_2sj8i

They are so brilliant the ideas that come out of the character and his reactions are some examples    When the interviewer confronts his hate towards the poor he feels discriminated and starts having a panic attack which causes the interview to end.    If our society has so many problems living together then why dont we split up a society shouldnt be divided in two it should at least in . For a society that divides instead of integrate    This new game works with reality and helps you to ignore a lot of aspects of reality thats why it is called Decreased Reality    I really care about the poor people thats why i gave them fake hope so they can have something instead of nothing    Im not saying the inmigrants cant stay after all someone has to clean the bathrooms,Megaten,dccxjtl,1,t5_2sj8i

10500396,0,t1_dcxqf08,Honestly Id much rather have the Ken voice than the Laharl voice. Even though to me the VO for Ken in P did a soso job Kens voice sounds more like a normal person which is more in tune with what the game is going for. I mean the whole point to SMT characters is that they behave more like normal people compared to other games with an anime style to them.But Shinyas voice isnt so normal. I dont mind the same actors performance for Laharl in Disgaea but this is because Laharls voice captures the batshit crazy grandiosity of his character and indeed the cartoonish world itself. Laharls voice just immediately sucks you in to the insanity of Disgaea. Shinyas voice sucks because Persona is a world thats somewhat more in line with reality demons and zany anime comic relief aside but his voice is that of a Saturday morning cartoon character making it impossible for me to take him seriously.Basically Shinyas voice sucks a fat one. The rest were AOK though especially Ichikos voice.,Megaten,dcybx2b,6,t5_2sj8i

Chapter  Aomame Chapter title Chapter  Tengo Chapter title Chapter  Aomame and etc. You start to get into the rhythm of it. As events started to ramp up I got to thinking man itd be sick if they switched it up suddenly. spoilers Then at the start of Book  right when everythings about to get fucked I hear this raspy voice read off the chapter number. The third narrator is one of the creepy relatively minor characters so far and that shit has me excited. Im listening to the audiobook which is fantastic so the effect was that much more pronounced.

Stop breaking the law!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!lmao i was expecting you to pull this sooner but i guess it took till now to scrape the bottom of this barrel.using your twitter page to defend my argument is not stalking. i dont give two fucks about what you do on twitter. i merely recalled a point where you stated your name was tim and posted it here because of how many times youve insisted otherwise.regardless this isnt harassment.gtSee reddit is not social mediawhen i first saw this i was going to type where the fuck did you pull that out of your ass but i ultimately decided to ignore it.regardless you have photos of your face on public platforms. im gonna take a wild guess and say youd bitch about your face being in the video even if jus used the picture in your kitsunegoddess videos thumbnail.just admit that youre pissy because you got offended by the idubbbz joke. and if thats not the case surely you wouldnt be opposed to it being reuploaded so as long as the image were swapped out for something else that youve posted? yeah right. you know the video was shared only to reddit and you know that everyone on this subreddit already knows what you look like. if you were concerned about it your face wouldnt be shown on your youtube channel and your youtube channel wouldnt be directly associated with your twitter page.i love how youve dodged this statement a million times in favor for IS STIL ILEGLAL. tell me would you care if the video was reuploaded with the aforementioned conditions?gtAnd still using my likeness after i said not to is considered harassment.we could also talk about that one time you were an instrument in harassing the fuck out of hatty. we could also talk about how your videos openly harass other people. you clearly dont have a problem with online harassment. simply put youre a pussy if you of all people are pulling that card. not to mention the countless little kids on tf who youd harass daily.gtYou claimed that we dont talkyoure skewing my words. i said you were full of shit when you said hatterz is over it. judging by how he blocked you on discord now just to further prove that point id say youre aware by now.okay. now ive said everything there is to say and more. unless you say some dumb shit about how itd still be illegal to repost the video or some other nonsense ill let whatever comes next die.thank you for participating. it was fun. it is not fun anymore. repeating myself is annoying ,Megaten,ddusxr3,3,t5_2sj8i

11403693,0,t1_dfo2oma,gt The new fire emblem games are pretty much objectively better than most of the older onesIf youre going for a more relaxed playthrough think of The Sims or Pokemon vs SMT then yes it might be a more enjoyable experience.But mechanicallywise Awakening was a clusterfuck of interesting ideas meshed with horrible execution and otaku pandering left and right. You cant say the gameplay is objectively better when all the fucking maps are about either routing the enemy or killing the boss. The entire game consisted of abusing chokepoints and the borders of the map. Of course it didnt matter too much because the units are absolutely broken and you have to be a moron in order to lose one even in hard difficulty.And from hard it goes directly to lunatic where the game pulls the worst kind of bullshit that can only be beaten by abusing farm DLC or cheesing the game with the two main units.Not to talk about the retarded narrative the illogical plot devices or the  characters that outside of some extremely optional support conversations were plain at best.Fates did polish considerably the battle system specially on Conquest but still royals and ninjas are absolutely broken Birthright has the problem of really simple map objectives Revelations unit balance is the most retarded Ive seen in my life and the plot is absolute utter shit.The new Fire Emblem games are still inferior to at least FE FE FE FE FE and FE with Conquest being kinda good actually if only mechanicswise but everything else being mediocre at best.,Megaten,dfolejo,3,t5_2sj8i

11648896,0,t1_dgge0en,Maybe but that still leaves the mystery of Persona  Spoilers Adachi. He makes the same exact gesture. Plothole perhaps? Its possible they retconned smaller details unintentionally as they progressed in the series. No matter how talented their writers may be coordinating with each other and remembering past information can be difficult.Also I think I remember reading that line though I havent played the P Arena games so it was a wiki or other secondhand source.Maybe its that concentration is an avenue for summoning a Persona but trying to summon outside of the TV World is more difficult and having an unstable mind adds to the difficulty in concentration. That could explain why Persona  Spoilers even in the TV World Adachi seems to struggle when calling his Persona.....Persona  Spoiler! NOT s Did Goro struggle summoning his Persona? He didnt when calling Robin Hood but he might have with Loki I dont remember.....My thoughts are becoming scattered on this topic. I dont even remember my original thoughts on all of it.

Its totally manageable if you understand the basics of Megaten in general and theyre not hard to grasp.P is my favorite Megaten period but Nocturne is definitely my favorite mainline. P is incredibly lackluster especially after playing P and has terrible social link mechanics and a really lame story structure that doesnt have a lot of character development. Also imagine if every single palace in P was just a few sections of Mementos as in randomly generated.P and P suffer from a lot of the same issues in hindsight but I would still say P is better than P. Its themes interest me more but personal taste aside it really does have better character developments and social links feel less forced. Nothing compares to P though.As for P its great if you want a memorable and excellent story. Again itll feel dated to play especially Innocent Sinbut the story makes up for it.,Megaten,dgipbdo,2,t5_2sj8i

11749750,0,t1_dgrjy65,gtWell if the Thieves pursuing a highly and unnecessarily improbable plan is supposed to be a style its not a style I personally like. You can have an exciting twist thats also a smart twist.        I seriously dont get you. You accept the impossible but not improbable fiction isnt restricted to supernatural events you know.       gt The Thieves wouldnt want to alert Shido if they could avoid it. Thats why defeating Akechi is so important.        Akechi thought the MC is dead that he won thus lower his guard.      gtPerhaps they could investigate and infiltrate the puppet masters palace during the casino mission but Akechi would probably catch on.       Again at the Casino they didnt know it was Shido the one behind it all. Akechi was the only person they know that knew who was behind it all but of course he wasnt going to confess if confronted directly there were no other clues and they were running short of time. Thus the plan make him believe that he won at the station so that he would carelessly made a mistake and thats what happen at the station.        gtHow you fight Akechi is simple you use his plan against him. You infiltrate Saes palace with him still pretending to be a part of your team and defeat him        Why the hell was he going to tell who was behind it all? Even if defeated. He knows the Phantoms will not kill him and the Phantoms will not kill him thus he can escape after that.       gtWhat I meant in that last part is that the Thieves actual plan relies on many things going very right for them. The undermanned cell Akechi running into Sae no video cameras and so on.        There were cameras they show you that at the begining of the game. And they probably knew how many guards there were there because of the information Saes computer.,Megaten,dgrv3ko,3,t5_2sj8i
