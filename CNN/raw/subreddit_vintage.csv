4729055,0,t1_ctqi37s,Well in my experience in life where I talk to many people in many areas from many cultures about many topics it is considered rude to respond that way. Id carefully asses peoples responses to you in the future to determine if theyre just trying being nice or genuinely dont care as I fell theyre probably just trying to be nice and dont feel like causing a fuss. Just a little life tip there because Im fed up and honestly feel like I shouldnt have to explain this to another human being. I will part with that and will have no contact with you in the future in any sort of way shape or form as it really is just frustrating to deal with people like you who cant see how they are blatantly rude even after its pointed out to them. Have an amazing night and please dont feel the need to respond to this.,vintage,ctqmzjd,1,t5_2qsbw

7946413,0,t1_d498a86,By head unit I just mean control unit.... analogous to a terminal console today.  Im pretty sure the SELRS reference is to route selectors which would imply this is to test that the local exchange is able to dial out and dial LD.  I think this would sit next to an exchange in order to trouble shoot issues.  ,vintage,d499250,1,t5_2qsbw

11347978,0,t1_dfhupjg,Youre welcome and thanks for your very kind words. Although Im no expert I would guess that this chair was produced later maybe around the mids because of its heavier lines the main body going all the way to the floor and its more comfortoriented overstuffed arms. The trend of choosing increased comfort over aesthetic style was gaining momentum at that time as people were finally admitting to themselves that thin cushions and low unsprung seating planes did not make one want to spend much time sitting on ones furniture. So more traditional shapes proportions amp textures came into vogue such as the slightly overstuffed lower half of the chair you posted.Did you end up buying it?,vintage,dfi9tsy,2,t5_2qsbw
