2650837,0,t3_2q4t8s, Id like to see the list of available craftings reversed meaning the best ones should be at the top. It would cut down on the scrolling. Or perhaps add that as a option in the settings menu. Options are always nice. If you have a hero that are high enough level to qualify for next map you should get to that map when you click on the quest arrow. But same here adding that as a option might be best since its not always you want to go too the new map. Maybe you need to farm the old one for a while. If you have the game set to give notifications those should be removed when you open the game via the normal icon. Now you have to remove them manually. I dont click the notifications since it takes almost  times longer to start the game that way sometimes it doesnt start at all. At the moment I have it set to off but now Im getting further in to the game where crafting and questing takes a long time so Id like use it again.,MerchantRPG,cn4lg1t,2,t5_35j3q

2660215,0,t1_cn5q517,Seems to be others that have the same issue and Ive been farming the second map for almost one hour now and no rare monsters at all. I like the game I really do but this and that crafting isnt working as I thought it would Im not a big fan of random stats especially when you craft something and get no stats upgrade at all Im going to put this game on hold until its updated once or twice. Hopefully the crafting is better and the rare monsters crawls out from their caves by then.,MerchantRPG,cn5tgnd,1,t5_35j3q
2727283,0,t1_cne2ifw,gt Id love an AH system for the game but that requires networking so it is a bit out of scope for the game currently.Could be a virtual fake one no networking needed then.What is your take about the crafting with scalesissue I mentioned? That you only have one enemy with scales level  with the lowest percentage to drop them even though you need it for gear you can craft at level . In region  its the opposite you get plenty of resources before you can start use them lvl  enemies with resources you need for lvl  crafting. Its a much more rewarding map to play.What is region  like? Same as region  or ?,MerchantRPG,cne2wsz,1,t5_35j3q

6123954,0,t3_3zefv4,This sounds great and most of it would be welcome.  The problem is in the implementation.  The current principle for game dev is KISS keep it simple silly.  Im not a dev BTW but theyve said this many times.Any new crafts would require rewriting lots of code and possibly big changes to multiple areas quest drops material table equipment table crafter table sections of the main code which call creation of items.  New EQ slots would probably require even more rewriting.New classes might actually be the easiest to implement but we shouldnt worry about that until after the prestige system becomes active.  Just saying that because all current classes get better each tier.  Besides without new EQ item slots amp class specific abilitiesgear its not like new classes would change the game much.While adding EVA to heroes would be interesting adding a stat to all the existing EQ amp modifying the combat code would be cray cray.  Luck  LCK stat not sure what else to say on it.Supremes  like T epic bosses?  If yes Im sure theyre coming.Merchs  they could function sort of like customers and use the existing combat formulas it might not take a lot of work.  I could see a very minimal system at work like  classes atkmatkpdefmdef based.  But why?  I think an upgraded group of super temp pots like the merch idea or  quests would fit the current game a bit nicer.New artwork amp music would be welcome and may come in QOL quality of life updates.  Customers sort of work out the selling issues.  Cutting quest times through a statpotionachievementwhatever sounds nice but I dont ever wanna go back to how farming T drops was.  I can actually keep the notification setting on with  min quests no way I could when it was  quests finished every  secs.Finally you look at the creepy merchant because that is who you are playing.  So youre creepy hah!,MerchantRPG,cylqaad,1,t5_35j3q

You know the feel you get when you loot amazing item is beyond measure. I played alot of terraria as well. Mainly because od decent crafting system and boss fights. and than one they i was just searching through the play store and found the chest looking icon on the list so I just downloaded it.

But now because im using the best materials i can get i can craft them easily. Yes it takes quite awhile to get your s rank materials but when you craft with it it is no blind gamble as you know you are gonna get something decent. Tree system? It enables us to get better gear as an outcome. Back than you just had material which can only have S rank for its quality now you can have items with prefix and suffix to even greater your chance of crafting decent items.

6696578,0,t1_cwgsldl,I think an overabundance of accuracy should do something for the rogueassassin before Reawakening so they can use knivesdaggers again. It feels so weird giving my rogue axes. Either every x ACC over the necessary ACC to hit the enemy  gives the rogueassassin x crit chance or gives a  boost to crit damage.For an example of the latter case a rogue with  ACC fights an enemy that only requires  to hit . That  ACC overkill boosts crits x damage to .x damage.,MerchantRPG,d0bzfrn,2,t5_35j3q

General observations I get  grade B falchions  grade A and  grade C the grade A turns out to be either suffixprefix of a  to atk matk def exp or fortunate. But in  crafts I have not seen a  or even  base roll for the weapon im speechless I feel all my trust on this apk is being raped.I know that was made in purpose inserted into the code you know a game that consumes so much time should reward something otherwise you failed at game design sooner or later gamers will find out that somehow the game code is greedy and wont let you craft a  Suffix max base role. I wrote some  patches ago that the formula would need to be more generous those games too greedy and hard to reward something be it fp or IAP are doom to failure just my  cents.Ill craft another  Blazing Falchions just to prove myself wrong.

7482829,0,t3_4hvtnj,Probably the known issue of if you have grok items in your inventory or on heroes it can cause these runtime issues. Try reporting in app if you can and hopefully an update soon will fix this for everyone.,MerchantRPG,d2sr86a,5,t5_35j3q

7594299,0,t3_4jc5bp,Check the TLDR post it may help you out with some doubts. DexAcc doesnt work for the moment there may be a change later on. But for now stick to the classic CritAtk. WarriorRogue would be the easier to level up. Warrior being tanky enough and with Patk he can take on some quest alone.Rogue with the Evade skill and the high damage output of Cheapshot. If talking about Endgame it would be a dps loss. If you are still Unascended or a bit ungeared sending them in the front line with mixed skillsEvadeCSII works.Gearing em Tanky its a bad idea thou. Best uses for Arthus would be the Undertaker Apoc and Nemesis. Arthus Gauntlet is a really good DPS piece too. KG isnt bad but there are easier pieces to get.,MerchantRPG,d35fm8g,1,t5_35j3q

8913979,0,t1_d7gffgd,If your merchants doesnt come now probably you need to do another trick. For sure set time to  year open game and verify that some merchants come. IMPORTANT  do not buysell anything. If you see merchants close the game and set time back to today.I think its happend for you because game remember last merchant action date  and it is  year. So I think without fix you wont be able to see merchants until  come,MerchantRPG,d7jbvnp,2,t5_35j3q

9156669,0,t1_d8cnyjm,So customers level up as you buy from them if you buy an item for more gold they get more experience. If you buy for less they get elss experience. Its the opposite for when you sell to the customers. As they level up they can sell you rarer items for example in T the Arthus skulls have a horrible drop rate. I have purchased  from customers in the last few days all S rank by paying more gold. This wouldve taken me weeks if not more had I just farmed the boss. ,MerchantRPG,d8co9za,3,t5_35j3q

10057533,0,t3_5jr14p,I think you can beat him with your current roster.Since Ares max party size is  and he has k hp Id go with the following setupWarrior Enable Might for  Passive P. AttSkills Slash or Slash  in as many slots as possiblePosition Front centerRogue Enable  Might for  Passive P. AttSkills Sunder and then just use Basic AttacksPosition Front topMage Enable  Intellect for  Passive M. AttSkills Mind Blast or Mind Blast  in as many slots as possiblePosition Front bottomMake sure each is at full health before going in.  If that doesnt work out try crafting items that grant Int for your Mage Str for your Warrior and Att for your Rogue.  Dont worry about high Accuracy or the Rogues True Damage skills just yet.  They are good but require serious commitment to Accuracy and its early in the game for that.  One of the Rogues best skills is to simply sit front and center with x Evade so your back row can destroy whatever sad beast is cowering before you.  I dont even bother with his Cheap Shot skills until TT.Also I highly recommend you grind on the Tunneler and Ram in T and the Snapper in T.  Those should be a little faster to help powerlevel until you can beat Ares using the above setup.Let us know how you make out!,MerchantRPG,dbiirkk,2,t5_35j3q

10464083,0,t3_5pqog1,It seems to me that you can only watch so many within a time period so I only view those with large returns ie. bosses.The reward also seems to increase based on the grade of your fight.  For example S rank seems to give out more gold per ad watch than say C rank.Finally if you are on a wifi network at work or school perhaps that  blocks ads this will not work.,MerchantRPG,dcu7ku2,2,t5_35j3q

The game needs more different gear maybe some armor breaker weapon or some  real damage thing or so.The point is that maybe it needs more variable gear instead of  changing the classes ,MerchantRPG,df0mxnk,1,t5_35j3q
