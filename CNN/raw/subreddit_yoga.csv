21494,0,t3_1ubeif,I have only just started and am working my way through the doyogawithme beginner series although significantly faster than it recommends. I am doing it to supplement my weight training.  I felt like I was loosing flexibility and I wanted to workout on my rest days but wanted something lightish so that it wouldnt ruin my recovery.  Plus yoga is supposed to stretch the muscle fibers leaving more room for growth broscience and it increases core strength which is super important for lifting.  So it seemed the natural choice.  I am loving it so far already feel more flexible cant wait to progress onto more advanced stuff. ,yoga,cegvp7p,1,t5_2qhq6

He points out that injuries can happen and very bad ones at that but the whole point of the book was that yoga is good and has been improving amp evolving. He argues that hard science should guide improvements to yoga training and instruction not mushy feelings. I think he did point out the rates of injury and reflected that other sports are far more dangerous but that yoga shouldnt cause any harm if taught and practiced correctly.His book affirms the power usefulness and benefits of yoga through research and data.,yoga,cekkmpw,6,t5_2qhq6

106465,0,t3_1vb8kh,A lot of these sound pretty normal especially for someone relatively new to yoga although you didnt specify how long you have been practicing so Im kind of assuming here possibly totally wrong.  Down dog  continue pushing through your fingertips and try to extend your trunk up from the armpits.  Imagine or ask an instructor or fellow yogi to help you someone pulling gently on the tops of your thighs from behind to extend your posture.  Forward bends  try using a strap around your feet to gently pull yourself down while maintaining a straight back or staying upright and placing your hands behind your hips to push your trunk slightly forward.  Side crow  it sounds like you are approaching this from fierce pose it takes a lot of flexibility in your back and hips to be able to get into this one its not a posture I have much experience with so Im not really sure what else might help.  Crow  focus on using your core strength to hold yourself up I definitely had some intense bruises on my triceps when I first started working on it but ideally your legs are barely touching your arms so they arent bearing all of your weight.   Chair  this may be due to limited shoulder flexibility or strength you can keep working on it if you feel like youve made progress so far or hold your hands in a different position such as prayer I really like secret prayer in chair.    Hopefully this helps Im not a teacher and there are folks on here that have a lot more experience than I do at this sort of stuff so hopefully youll get some additional info from other answers.

He cites statisticsthen acknowledges they have no real scientific validity as he did not do in his earlier articles and then says Oh but it may turn out they are valid at some point in the future with more research. It really stuns me that a science writer for the NYTimes writes and publishes crap like this. Where does he get off making up a phrase like yoga strokes?!

230436,0,t3_1wqxa6,My opinion is that you try out the beginners class if you can.  Its not a necessarily a question of learning the various poses or alignment cues though you will it gives you an opportunity to get comfortable with pace sequence vocal cues for alignment and to find out how your body feels in each pose without having to rely on the teacher correcting you. Those adjustments arent only about correcting posture though they can be. Also to get very specific in each pose from the ground up so to speak.Developing a routine and learning handstands etc is something you can easily find help for online Ive posted this before but I think its really useful. Jason Crandell has a great article on Yoga Journal about building your own sequence. Also lots of videos on there and youtube for how to do X pose kind of tutorials.Try lots of different classes teachers and kinds of yoga.  Youll learn a lot from just experimenting.

404062,0,t1_cfmm9b9,The pen and paper is a tool for me just like everything else. Part of what makes these upcoming generations so unique is their ability to take in information so rapidly and then forget all about it when its unnecessary. I think we misperceive that often times as add but its quite the opposite to me. They have the ability to learn forget and then relearn incredibly fast. Theyre extremely adaptable. The point is why would I go so far as to memorize the sequence that I make every week when I have tools for that. After teaching it six times I may accidentally have it memorized and if I forget my book I always have a few base sequences that I know by heart. I do the same things as you sometimes I have to take a quick glance but I refer to it as an extension of myself. I put in hard work and time to think out a sequence that will safely get someone through a series of movements up to a point where they do something that astounds them and then unwind them and leave them feeling good after that. Sorry I rambled. I just felt like talking I suppose. Also great question. Youre right it was nice to hear others perspectives. ,yoga,cfmnbcz,4,t5_2qhq6

516578,0,t3_1zxrk2,It is so great that you have found yoga and meditation for these can be quite healing. I have found in my experience of PTSD that with a gentle of approach of becoming aware of your thoughts is the catalyst for change. We are the awareness not the thoughts. As others have so graciously pointed out the breathe is the link to calming the scattered overwhelmed fearful energy that may come before a panic or anxiety attack. Distraction was my way of numbing but inevitably I was running and eventually the anxiety would catch up and take over. With awareness and the breathe we can be prepared so that when anxiety or panic does hit it cannot take over.  ,yoga,cfyzloo,2,t5_2qhq6
523659,0,t3_2043l2, The hips are the strongest joint in the body. Its really difficult to open them. Forcing them to open doesnt really work. Its like trying to get a flower to bloom by tearing open the petals. You have to be a little more nurturing in order for the hips to relax. This requires patience. And frankly its possible that the structure of your bones just dont allow the hips a wide range of motion. Consider if youre too tight on one side you must be too loose on the opposite side. If the adductors are too tightshort strengthen the abductors because they are too looselong. Usually we have an imbalance between the adductors and abductors. Think of it a little differently. Instead of trying to just stretching open your hips see if you can strengthen the opposite side. At the end of class in seated meditation put a folded blanket underneath each knee. Find the best height of the folded blanket by feeling how comfortable you are. You want the legs to feel supported so they can relax. Heck even wedge a block underneath the blanket if you have to! This may take a few minutes to figure out so if you dont have the time in class. Work on finding the best height for the blockblanket combination at home roll up some towels. I have pretty open hips but when sit for a  minutes mediation I still wedge some blankets under my knees for some support. Its nice to feel supported Dont worry about looking weird with a bunch of stuff under your legs you will only look like you know what youre doing and bonus in a comfortable seated position.,yoga,cfzsnki,2,t5_2qhq6

837247,0,t3_23ly8q, Yoga is not supposed to be obsessive.Measure flexibility from time to time sure but during your yoga practice thoughts of flexibility will only hold you back. One to three years.Someone with tight hamstrings who practices everyday with proper form can take three years to loosen those hamstrings fully. Relax into stretch.Pavel Tsatsoulines great stretching slogan is relax into stretch. Yes a stretch can only happen when the muscle is relaxed. Which is why thinking about flexibility during yoga tends to only cause fears which causes tightness in the muscles which prevents stretching.At only a few months into the practice your focus should still be on learning what the proper expressions of poses are for an inflexible body. Finding where your workable edge is and learning to honor that and not trying to put yourself into more flexible versions of the pose with poor form where the muscles will be forced to be tight and unstretchable.Eventually you will want to learn to focus more on your bandhas mula and uddiyana. Maintaining engaged bandhas during practice will elongate and extend the spine creating space in the hips for deeper expressions of the poses. Strength and muscle engagement is almost as much a part of flexible poses as raw flexibility is.Eventually you will want to learn to focus on your meditative clam. Attaining this calm helps muscles to relax and so to stretch. Maintain meditative calm becomes increasingly important as you start to stretch into areas that your mind does not yet believe the body can safely go.,yoga,cgzg4lb,1,t5_2qhq6

1082106,0,t3_26gi6p,I would skip the books and just take something to practice on eg a yoga mat. I  think that having a mat to practice on is the most important because once youve got the basics down you can do yoga and mediation on your mat each day and no matter where you are while travelling sitting in the same place on your mat can become your special sanctuary and make meditation and focus a lot easier.Try attend as many classes as you can while travelling not only improving your yoga but giving you a chance to meet locals know more about where you are travelling to check out ashrams and retreats and then use the internet for YouTube videos and pdfs to supplement. Take a yoga mat lululemon do a few thin mats that fold up in a backpack really well  but also are expensive or Yoga Paws glovesock combo to replace a full sized yoga mat but offer no cushioning for your knees or ankles or just take a towel with grip on one side again lululemon make some but are expensive but they are quick dry so you can use it as a towel and a yoga mat and it wont take up much backpack space.

1083026,0,t3_26ijwt,Weights provide progressive resistance that yoga cannot. Last week I squatted  kg for three. This week I will do more. My body will be forced to adapt. I will get stronger and bigger. While you can get similar progressive resistance in yoga youre ultimately limited by your bodyweight which is unlikely to increase very much because it is not a particularly hypertrophic practice. You will probably get lean flexible and stronger if you only do yoga but your strength gains will taper off as you get good at the movements. On a deeper level it seems to me like maybe youre approaching both things from a limited perspective. Lean muscles are great for impressing other people but they serve no other purpose really. Strength on the other hand is entirely functional. So is mobility. These are the core physical benefits of lifting and yoga. It is much easier and more effective to base your goals around achieving these things over achieving a particular appearance believe me Ive been there. I would strongly suggest that you continue doing both. They are synergistic and your body will thank you regardless of how your muscles look. ,yoga,chre547,12,t5_2qhq6

Saying that it is competitive yoga is like saying that a penalty competition is a soccer competition or any of the other countless examples where you take one facet of an activity and make it into an event.You call it a penalty competition. Maybe a soccer penalty competition but never would you call it a soccer competition.Applying the same argument to these yoga competitions. Youd either call them asana competitions or yoga asana competitions.Thats my train of thought about this anyway.

A stretch might feel painful because youre pulling against resistance but this resistance is primarily caused by active contraction of muscle fibers due to the stretch reflex not any mechanical property of the muscle.

1395704,0,t3_2a3oba,Different paths to the same goal. From my personal experience Ashtangas benefit comes from the familiarity with the sequence and the challenge of the postures. Iyengars benefit comes from very precise alignment and when holding the postures for a little or a lot depending on the teacher longer than the  breaths in Ashtanga it allows you to move deeper into silence and deeper into understanding your body and the pose. Iyengar is a lot more accessible than Ashtanga as well because the props allow for people of all body types and ability to practice. I think the thought of  sun salutes plus so many vinyasas scares injured and less fit people away. If you like Ashtanga then do Ashtanga but I think if you are open to it you can gain some insight into alignment and precision learned from Iyengar.,yoga,cir8dlk,4,t5_2qhq6

Also it can be a kind of ignorant ablism. People who grew up in yoga are quite understandably going to have an easier time in it. I have had the sinister thought of taking some such teachers like the fat swami who groped me under my wing as an endurance runner I grew up as one and seeing how they fare without injury and with shitty guidance and see how good they feel trying to run  miles at my normal pace. They would literally collapse Im sure... Yoga teachers have their weak spots as well and just because you are hyperflexible doesnt mean you can handle something as basic as a  mile run or even a full soccer game. Most wouldnt be able to handle something like a bare minimum  minute mile. Hope this makes you feel better. Im a tight girl as a result of years of long distance running. Yoga helps balance me out. I cant give up running though. I have married the two in my life. I feel a lot of sympathy for tight guys and girls. And anyone who is not a model yoga practitioner just remember a lot of perfect yoga model types can be quite weak in other areas and would be middling to terrible as runners.,yoga,cl399qc,1,t5_2qhq6

There are several poses that are supposed to be very good for digestion for people with IBS etc. The one thing though that can make that fact problematic is that anything that moves stuff through the digestive system can move it while you are doing it and cause some very undesirable things to happen in say downward dog pose. Yeah Im talking about having embarrassing farts in yoga class. Its happened more than once in mine. We all start bending and twisting and one or more of us lets out some gas. You cant always control it as much as you might like to. We all laugh and the teacher cracks a joke and class just goes on. Its just a sign that someone is getting healthy. Me I try not to eat much before class and I do a few poses at home before I go just in case. I like to try to get whatever gas might be in my system out before I even head there rather than share it with my classmates lol. But yeah yoga has been great for me for that.

2373596,0,t3_2mjvmg,Yes for some people it is impossible. There are two reasons why someone cannot do a pose like lotus or splits Tension or Compression. Tension is when your muscles are stretched to the max and you cant go deeper. If tension is the reason then with practice the muscles should loosen. The length of time depends on the individual.Compression is when a joint has reached its max. The way this persons skeleton is arranged prevents them from getting fully into the pose. No amount of practice can change this your skeleton.You can usually figure out if it is tension or compression based on where you feel sensation when youve reached your limit in the pose.,yoga,cm5325l,2,t5_2qhq6

I really like to stand on a tennis ball to get the plantar fascia loosened start at the ball of the foot and move all around the foot with increasing pressure then try a forward fold and see how much easier it is after loosening from the feet etc.  This is a pretty great way to get a release all along the fascia up to that spot in the forehead.. hope it helps,yoga,cm8aqe7,4,t5_2qhq6

I max out at a sad k.That said before I got into yoga more regularly running was a mfing anathema to me. FUCK THIS SHIT said my body THIS IS HORRIBLE IMMA STOP NOW.  Before I figured out how to not hate it there was yoga. A regular couple timesweek practice made me more conscious of which muscles I was or wasnt using while I ran. It made me more conscious of my core the balance of my stride and the relationship between motion and breathing. It made me play around with different ways to run  practice using different muscles more or less. I guess in that sense yoga actually taught me how to run. When you practice using your body one way itll inevitably bleed over into how you use your body in other ways.To answer your question more directly your running will change inevitably as yoga changes your body strength and embodied consciousness  and that will be pretty idiosyncratic every body amp practice is different etcetcetc. Having gone back and forth between periods of running and periods of regular yoga more generally running tightens you up considerably hams amp hips! intensive hip openers in yoga sometimes made my runs feel shittier yoga improve my pacing amp posture amp breathing amp agilitybalance while running esp in the woods or on uneven terrain. fwiw the last only time I went to have a dude fit me for athletic shoes he was impressed by how evenly distributed my weight on my feet  which is definitely a thing I had noticed.But it will probably take a solid minute for anything to change the way you run.

Others I think like me will find most poses harder.  The beauty of the asana practice of yoga is that none of this really matters.  Its not a competition it doesnt matter where you are and being able to get into a particular pose has nothing to do with achieving samadhi if you dont practise in the right way.  It certainly doesnt matter how your body looks.The fact that you have a healthy body with four working limbs and a healthy spine and can practise asanas several times a week PLUS have the time and money to be able to afford this luxury in your life is a huge thing to be grateful for.  The way you look and the asanas you can achieve is a really superficial factor.Also body type isnt as important as some people think.  I recently practised in India with a Czech girl with an amazing practice who had a fuller body.  My own body is not conventionally yogic  I am a male with very chunky legs and a thick midsection.  Some of the poses take longer to achieve but who cares?  In a way it helps in ashtanga because you take longer on the primary series getting everything perfect before zooming off to second and third because you happen to be an ultra flexible slender girl.,yoga,cobdmn8,6,t5_2qhq6
3024013,0,t3_2uqyct,Vinyasa is the movement that distinguishes ashtanga and all the Western forms that followed it.  It should not be underestimated in its importance to the practice.  It is the linking between postures.  Most western forms of flowpowervinyasa yoga that came from ashtanga no longer incorporate the classic ashtanga jump through  pick up  jump back vinyasa.

If I had to pick a very very highly instagrampresent brand for an example of this  Id say alo yoga. They run endless challenges and give out tons of clothing all to skinny hot women only and appear to prioritise how someone looks over almost everything else.

Both extreme flexion and extension both of which are commonly found in yoga can cause the artery to get cut off and cause the brain to be deprived of oxygen hence your light headedness.

3512407,0,t3_30hxj7,Another thing that I found incredibly helpful was using blocks...Put two blocks under your hands shoulder width apart in a standing forward fold then lift up on your toes and transition most of the weight onto your hands on the blocks.  You should be able to transition most of your weight onto your hands and extend your feet so much that the pinky toes come off the ground.  In class we would exhale and return our heels to the ground then inhale and lift up all the way onto our big toes again... if you really lift your hamstrings and fold at the hips it becomes really great training for floating forward from down dog and strengthens the shoulder girdle for handstand.

The main reason is that Im not sure Im at the level of correct alignment that I will get the same benefits and workout from it. I really like the dynamic rhythm of the group classes for that reason and the cues to push further or twist a bit more or whatever. I still feel like I need those reminders in order to perfect asanas and not slacken. In short I want to be technically better before I go solo. Looking around at others and their corrections helps me out with this too.At the same time though I feel like my advance is limited in a group class simply due to less attentioncorrection from the teacher. I might get  per class and I know I need more than that if I want to go further. Im capable of being more flexible because when I get the adjustments or little pushes I go right into postures with no pain or difficulty whatsoever.

3983851,0,t3_360yyy,I am actually about to finish my last weekend of YTT today. The format of my teacher training was Friday night  Saturday  and Sunday  ONE WEEKEND A MONTH with an additional Saturday session each month from . We started in September and are finishing in May. For the first few months I really looked forward to going but as time progresses it became more difficult to lose a weekend spent with family or friends or catching up on chores I work full time. That being said I am so glad I did this! It has been a wonderful experience and my teachers and classmates are all beautiful souls. I sometimes think that if I had done a  day intensive or a training spaced out over a shorter period of time I would have been miserable. If you are so bored and antsy to be with your friends and boyfriend drop out. To me that seems like that is what your soul needs. Keep practicing yoga and start putting away some money. If youre going off to university take yoga at different studios wit different teachers. Maybe on a summer off from school or after you graduate do your research and information a YTT program thats the best fit for you. And let your parents know you are really appreciative that they were willing to finance this training for you this year but also appreciative that they are willing to let you step out early. Make them dinner do some extra chores around the house maybe buy them flowers. Its hard to quit but when youre typically not a quitter but to me this isnt quitting. This is staying true to your authentic self. You are only  and will have plenty of opportunities in the future of your yoga journey. Best of luck!,yoga,crae7f5,3,t5_2qhq6

For a beginner practicing at home with only YouTube videos they cant really tell if they are truly doing a pose properly or not and they may not know any modifications if something doesnt work for them.

4684856,0,t3_3f3srf,I go through my phases of going to hot yoga classes. They all vary in heat and the type of yoga being practiced. I go to Bikram yoga where the heat is  amp it is practiced at a slow pace I also go to a vinyasa core flow class which the heat is prob  amp practiced at a slower pace as well then theres the power yoga where the heat is ? and is conducted at a fast pace. In these instances of going to hot yoga I go because I want to sweat and want the challenge of the class. I do believe you become addicted to the heat and want to feel the burn. You become more flexible and are able to go into postures deeper. If Im going to hot yoga and regular non heated yoga I have a very strong practice. I personally feel they do compliment each other. I swore I would never go to another Bikram class after my first one. I thought to myself this isnt yoga! This is some weird cultish power trip yoga. But here I am...  years later and will still cruise into a class every so often. Yoga in the western world is turning into a power burning  fast pace heated class. Its whats the consumer wants.

5103050,0,t3_3ksq2v,As a former competitive bodybuilder personal trainerwith more than  under my belt and RYT  I understand your frustration. Though not exclusively its been my experience that execution of asanas are more often than not described terms of feel rather than anatomy. This can be especially frustrating if your either trying to avoid or target something specificanatomically speaking. Simply said anatomy is usually on the low rung of the hierarchical yoga instruction ladder. Thats not to say form is thrown out the window its just that many instructors may not have the education or experience to deal specifically with your problem in the group setting of a class. That being said I do know quite a few yoga instructors who have vast experience in medical personal training physical therapy and others disciplines with a more anatomical focus. Id say your best bet is to check out instructor bios inquire in person and most definitely set up a one on one appointment with the instructor you see most fit. It will cost some money but the attention to your specific needs in that appointment may carry you to a place where you can go to any yoga class and feel confident as to what you can and can not do. If youd like a complimentary online consultation Id be happy to sit with you for a half hour and discuss your goals in their entirety. Good luck!  ,yoga,cv13vnm,2,t5_2qhq6

5123919,0,t3_3l6l0f,I average  classes a week which can be a lot to handle week in and week out. First point I would make is to be sure you are fully engaging in each pose in each class  no sense in adding extra classes just to practice bad habits but if you have good instructors they should keep you on track. As your practice develops and you are being cued to really challenge yourself in every pose you will develop muscle soreness with that kind of volume. Thats not a big deal and you can push through it if you feel the need for more yoga but the absolute stopping point is if you start feeling pain in joints tendons and ligaments. Thats where serious injuries occur that can keep you out of practice for months. Also the biggest key to consistently practicing that much is to make sure you are getting plenty of sleep every night.Tldr Slow down if you develop pain in joints and ligaments otherwise get plenty of sleep and practice away.,yoga,cv3mhix,5,t5_2qhq6

If you think the typical weight loss journey is all about yoga youre delusional. I just lost  pounds under the supervision of a doctor. Together with a trainer wr crafted a paleo based diet that was low calorie based on my needs  then once I lost weight and was in maintenance mode I slowly increased my calories and introduced exercise back in not yoga. Yoga had nothing to do with it. Do not get me wrong Ive practiced yoga for a long time many days a week. But it had no impact on my weight loss journey. Your kidding yourself if you think it does.

5335757,0,t3_3nvpos,For me its all about the long game. For years I pushed myself because I was so focused on what I could achieve in that moment during that practice. Now I focus on what feels right for that practice. Some days that means pushing myself some days that means holding back. Observe your thoughts during your practice. Theres a difference between thinking This is difficult to hold I feel a burning sensation in my muscles and I am exhausted how much longer are we going to hold this? There is a difference between Im comfortable in bed and it would be easier to skip my morning routine and My body needs extra rest right now more than it needs to move. With practice you can start to notice the subtle difference between when pushing boundaries is hard but helpful and when its just draining you. Discomfort is neither good nor bad.I also draw a line between my teaching and my own practice by keeping a binder of different things that I want to share. As a rule I try not to share exactly what Im working on processing. Those thoughts go into my journal. Many things from my journal often end up in the binder but with a focus on the overall lesson not just my personal emotions. My practice might crack my heart open and I certainly want to share that deep level of emotion with my students. However while Im still working through something it comes out as a mess of emotions. Much like I want my cues to be clear I want any message I share to be clear as well. This also allows keeps me from feeling like teaching is competing with or overshadowing my own practice in any way. ,yoga,cvtpa7t,2,t5_2qhq6

All you need is basketball shorts and a t shirt and a soft spot inside or out. I go to yoga classes at my university since theyre free and its nice to get out not because I need it.

Were all there to challenge our bodies together. If theres fewer big people doing yoga then its because fewer care about fitness overall. ,yoga,cw0a31m,7,t5_2qhq6

My injury is fullyhealed however my brain still sends pain signals because the parts of the brain that control pain also control stress and the fightorflight response. When I actively practice yoga breathwork and most importantly mindfulness I am able to control my stress and anxiety much better and ultimately my pain response lessens. So in a way this is beyond just physical exercise for me. I could easily imagine breathwork becoming a spiritual experience for people who are soinclined because being so deeply in the moment can feel very spiritual in comparison to our daytoday lives.,yoga,cwuzn04,2,t5_2qhq6

Usually by the time I feel satisfied with alignment in a pose I only get a few breaths in before moving on to the next one. A great benefit is also that the teacher has time to come around and make adjustments to most if not all the students that need it. It makes me value studios more instead of just getting the poses queued in a regular class while only the new students get help.

Keep working to a totally flat half lotus on both sides one side then the other and once you have that  you will be VERY close to full lotus and you can either place yourself in the position or have someone help. You can get it done in yoga class if uou go often enough but if you dont go as mucb or want to speed up the process  sit in half lotus while you watch TV.....

6661036,0,t3_46ft2m,Well done. Heres some minor adjustments. Your front legs heel should bisect the back leg foot at the arch. This adds stability to the pose so you can rotate. Triangle pose is actually a heart opener more than a hip or hamstring stretch. So I would recommend backing off the base a little so you can focus on creating a single line from hip to top of the head parallel to the floor. Then focus on rotating your chest toward the ceiling stacking one shoulder on top of the other. Act like you are trying to kiss your shoulder and tuck your chin to prevent torque of the spine that it out of alignment. Finally spreading your toes as wide as possible allows you to deepen into the pose. All very minor adjustments!

6696410,0,t3_47870c,I know what you mean. I see it all the time and thats probably because I am a queer woman of color. To be specific I am Indian. My family is from southern India so yoga feels like connecting with my ancestors and myself. I am going to rant a bit but keep in mind I have nothing against white people. Theyre fine. I think they just have a few things to learn and become more aware of. I love practicing yoga but it does feel like its been taken over by skinny rich white people. Its been made inaccessible competitive and athletic. I cant really afford to go as much as Id like. Its competitive in the sense that My yoga is better than your yoga and I take soandsos class so Im super cool. And its done for all the wrong reasons. Yeah the ancients knew it was good for the body but practitioners often pursue that skinny rich white person look and fail to emphasize the meditative gentle spiritual parts of yoga. However on the other end of the spectrum Ive gone to yoga for people of color and its too angry for me.

6751136,0,t3_4833jl,Ive done this! My studio teams up with a local SUP rental company and offers workshops every once in a while during the summer. The boards have anchors so we paddle to a relatively shallow spot and drop anchor. The shallow water a little more than waist deep also makes it easier to get back on the board if you fall.Id never SUPped before so it took a few minutes to get used to standing. Standing poses were more difficult than lower poses which makes sense. But I was surprised that poses with widely separated feet or hands are more difficult than poses where your weight is more centered. The boards are really quite buoyant and stable if your weight is along the center line. Its when your weight wobbles to one side or another that you fall. I did fall once while in a lunge but I found traditional headstand easier than tripod headstand.Being outside and hearing the water and feeling the breeze makes for a different sort of meditation. The class was relatively slow and covered mostly basic asanas and the unusual challenge of the extra balance brought a different type of focus to familiar poses. TLDR Its cooltry it if you get the chance!,yoga,d0hmhr9,10,t5_2qhq6

6845086,0,t3_49j9dk,BOP can be worked on with a strap but before worrying about coming up into the balance you want to work in bound extended side angle with the strap. Youll be working on finding a bit of side bend opening in the hip from the side lunge and some shoulder opening on top. Once youve got a solid base and you want to play with the balance the transition slide the back foot forward usually easier as most of the weight tends to be in the front foot once the bound is found so you can shift your weight into the back foot without losing your bind. This may take a bit more practice. From there you keep the bind snug and really engage the core as you come up the bound leg will come with you because youve got it all tied up.  A strap will allow you to practice utthita hasta padangusthasana too or you can float the leg out and work on balance  strength. The golden rule for modifying for your body is simply that if its in the way and you can move it thats what you do.  When we come to yoga and its presented as do this then do that and do this this way and that that way it never occurs to a lot of people that it doesnt have to be that way.

The gaze drishti is part of any yoga posture so just as a teacher will tell you to spread your fingers and ground through the hand in down dog they may also offer verbal cues to direct your gaze. It can help with everything from balance to inward focus and just like the placement of your feet is simply an aspect of the asanas youre moving through. Of course no one expects you to have nailed every aspect of the pose including the direction of your drishti at first. Looking around is normal. As humans we rely on our eyes more than any other sense and it makes sense that youd look around to see how other people are moving to confirm your own alignment. As you get more comfortable with the postures youll find that you stop needing to look at others to confirm your own form. Having a specific place to direct your gaze makes everything including the focus of your eyes seem intentional in a given pose. TLDR The gaze is part of the pose. I doubt your teachers are trying to call you out. ,yoga,d13m00o,8,t5_2qhq6

But Ethicality lt Efficiency. Ill have to do research on hot yoga whether its bad or not. An upvoted post in this thread begins with someone saying they have done it for over  years.  Just because someone has done something a long time doesnt make it a good workoutpracticeidea. Ive done a lot of stupid shit for a long time so if I were to slap a gold sticker on those things and make a business out of it its still stupid shit at the end of the day. As a response to your OP yoga is not about meeting a level of flexibility or strength that others can do. Its not a race or a competition its only about bettering yourself. Accepting that today you are what you are and tomorrow you might be different or the same. Knowing this there is no mastering yoga or Bikram. Since the above is truly what you believe in Ill say that ethics aside it still isnt the best yoga. Think about why youre trying to get into it. Be more flexible? Lose weight? Become a more stable and happy person? Because Bikram will touch upon those things but no yogi will tell you its the best. If you want to get in shape do cardio. If you want to calm your mind do yoga. ,yoga,d2fj99e,1,t5_2qhq6

You might want to consider going to physical therapy or a massage therapist to help figure out why you have a constant pain in that specific spot.I also suspect chronic aches like this can be due to overworking  overstretching that muscle with overall muscle imbalances.

I had been practicing for several years beyond  when I did my first training and its my practice experience that did and still does inform how I teach first and foremost. As Ive aged and talked to people that are older theres also the difficulty of youth and the lack of experience in general with how your body changes as you age that makes it very difficult on both sides of that coin.

8139740,0,t3_4qn11h,gtI never thought my needs would change. The only thing that we can ever count on in this world is that everything will change  You definitely grow through teachers. As a teacher myself I know this intimately as Ive spent a few years with certain teachers and moved on when it felt right. Its always sad to say goodbye to an era but I think youre being very wise in acknowledging that your needs have changed and that you may be ready to move on to something else.  Every teacher has something different to offer and every teacher is going to attract students that need to hear what theyre currently teaching.  Its very possible that at the moment you need something else beyond what your regular teacher can offer you and thats okay. Its not possible nor required for one person to be able to meet all of your needs for the rest of your entire life.  If you need something else at the moment and this other teacher helps you find that then its perfectly normal to switch for a while. That being said Pema Chodron talks a lot about examing why the people who get on our nerves or challenge our sense of wellbeing are able to do so. She talks often about how those who challenge us are revealing the soft spots in our armor the places where were tender or vulnerable or wounded and instead of projecting that pain onto the external place its an opportunity to look inward and examine that vulnerability and really experience it hold it and know it for what it is. ,yoga,d4v0hhl,5,t5_2qhq6

You mention you have bad joints but even if youre not referring to your knees you can still work out in ways that are low impact swimming using cross trainers vigorous walking. Im a bit against the grain here because I was trained in a highly classical style of yoga Sivananda and studied under teachers in a tradition that has remained largely unchanged in many decades if not centuries more modern approaches to yoga dont always resonate with me so Im maybe not the best to advise on your question. About the  yeah it can be a bit much! Many studios have intro packs sometimes unadvertised where you get unlimited monthly classes for a big discount for those new to the studio. But even  drop in classes a week will make a big difference in your exposure and practise. Good luck ,yoga,d5z0559,2,t5_2qhq6

8999333,0,t3_53jaf8,Ashtanga isnt really beginner friendly when taken as a whole series. As traditionally taught in the Mysore style yes . What this means in this situation is that you work through Sun Sal then standing poses in the first half  a half primary is through navasana and go as far as you are able to do the pose work on the first you cannot do fully for awhile and then move on to finishing and closing poses. Most Mysore teachers will also recommend you work through the entire series to your ability level weekly. Check out rashtanga youll hear stories of people being stuck at the same pose for months or years. eta What youre looking at is only the second half of the first of several series. It just gets more intense from there. And yes there are asanas in primary that are generally considered to be advanced on some level.

9008683,0,t3_53nueu,Ok I think there is a more compassionate way to approach the OP about this. OP although Im sure unintentionally you are sexualizing the women in your class. It is because you as well as every human are a product of their environment and how theyve been conditioned by society. Society often sexualizes female bodies so it is not surprising that your mind almost instantly wanders to that. However I would encourage you to gently let those thoughts pass you and attempt to concentrate on your own body your own mat and your own mind. And if you must mentally acknowledge the women in your class acknowledge them thoughtfullyas fellow humans fellow yogis. Their bodies like yours are capable of so many amazing things other than sex. Sex is not a dirty word. But sexualizing women is harmful not only to women obviously but to your own mindset!I wish you lots of luck in your journey!Namaste,yoga,d7upb0r,22,t5_2qhq6

While weak arms could benefit from something like an Ashtanga practice your lack of teacher combined with EDS makes for a situation where anyone suggesting it is being quite irresponsible. It can be done with the above  styles but youll be more likely to need to supplement with more typical weight training functions or supplemental asanas outside of any video you choose. Edit to add once you have a strong foundation and can feel your safe ROM flow classes including ashtanga would be possible but getting into a class at least occasionally and informing the teacher that you have EDS and are specifically looking for eyes toward hyperextension will be important. ,yoga,d8p4yez,3,t5_2qhq6

9324048,0,t3_586cua,My best friend had been pretty into it when she lived in B.A. She would come over and at the time I was vigorously working out at the gym and sore pretty much all the time so she would lead me through some poses. It piqued my interest. Over the next couple years I dabbled more and more at home and mostly saw it only as stretching. I had attempted a few classes and found them pretty boring and uninteresting. Then one day I decided to try a Bikram studio for some hot yoga to see if maybe I would like it if it were harder. I was HOOKED. I think it has a lot to do with being mentally ready to confront the things about my bodymindspirit that I needed to confront. Additionally the studio I go to is filled with the most incredible instructions. They give a lot of personal tips to each and every class ember. They know all our names and celebrate our achievements with us. I am hooked and now I do not go to the gym anymore I have an unlimited monthly plan and go at least three times per week. I have seen increased mobility strength and body awareness. Another benefit that is helping me so incredibly much is that for  minutes I am encouraged to look in a mirror at my own body and reflect accept challenge and enjoy. As a woman that is easier said than done. I tend to be very critical of my body and way too hard on myself. Ive had times on the mat where I have had to forgive myself for being weak and other times where I have been astounded at the strength I see.

These are the words as I have come to understand them.Hypermobile Joints  joints that move extend beyond the normal range of motion. For a knee that would be a straight line. When a persons knee bends backwards past straight that would be hypermobile like this pictureHyperextend  means to push the joint at its end range of movement extension push against a locked out joint.We never should press a joint at its end range of movement extension. A person should back off from the absolute limit of extension slightly. Use the muscles to hold the joint call it a little micro bend. It will likely takes years to build up this strength. But it is really important not to force the joints into hyperextension as the joint will get damaged. Maybe more damaged if it is already damaged.,yoga,d9mdtap,1,t5_2qhq6

Also depends on your physical structure  but here are some that I consider to be allencompassing and I do everyday before I do px. . Wide legged forward fold. This will stretch the spine back hamstrings and you even learn some variations to add in a shoulder stretch interlace hands behind you  extend overhead.. Prone pectoral stretch. Make goal post or cactus arms and ensure your elbow is in line with your shoulder. Roll onto your outer hip until you find your edge.. Quad stretch. What works best for me is doing a low lunge.

10547328,0,t3_5qvq86,Ill be honest the hardest part for me still is getting to the mat. That aha moment came when I found a studio that practices Mysore. When Im in a simple humble studio that is not my own house or my own room my practice becomes powerful and meaningful. Maybe I was just associating my home with laziness. Anyway I ended up working at the studio about  hours a week mopping and closing out the books to offset the costs of the classes because I was in college and had no disposable income. Morning Mysore became such a required routine for me to feel good about starting the day. Waking up that early and doing yoga first thing was an ethereal psychedelic kind of experience. I got a chance to check in with myself physically and spiritually every morning and I started to notice I had more control over anxious feelings and I had more patience with my family and I started to have more loving thoughts towards my body. ,yoga,dd3noiv,3,t5_2qhq6

11296706,0,t1_dfcfxic,Upvoting bc you actually read my post instead of just reacting. Thank you for meeting me here. My question is what do you believe constitutes showing off? Im a human with a body and I want to practice yoga in what is comfortable for me. At what point does it become an affront? You want understanding and I hear you. But at what point does your perception of motive become myother womens burden? Reactions to circumstances are comings and goings  THEY are natural and not your own. But the ones you choose to cultivate and pursue and thus struggle with...are decisions which are your responsibility. When someone else has a success that Im jealous of I see that as my flawampburden to work out and make peace with. I dont ask for that person to dim their success or happiness over it. This is as universal a reaction as a sexual urge. Meditation supports developing an awareness over which thoughts you pursue and struggle with instead of simply letting them go. It is not a disowning of responsibility over what comes up. Also if you want understanding please look up or ask any woman about how many times shes been catcalled or made to feel uncomfortable about a completely modest outfit. Understand that it is common for most women to be jeered at walking down a street completely covered at least at some point in her life and that your request that we understand your weakness without understanding the burden we already bear is not fair. Please understand where I am coming from. ,yoga,dfcgquf,15,t5_2qhq6
