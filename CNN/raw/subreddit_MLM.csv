2588044,0,t1_cmfwrd3,No I see where your coming from.  Its just hard to explain something to a person with employee mentality  versus a person with leverage mentality. In a traditional job  you trade time for money right?  Well in MLM a company that has been scrutinized by the FTC and has an A plus rating! we practice delayed gratification. How is MLM say differ from working at a real estate company other than the fact you do not build a direct downline  and get paid on helping them become better and gaining more sales. Realtors have to network right! They get commissions.  Do you see my point where the genius lies in a winwin concept? ,MLM,cmwe7y3,1,t5_2qhlz
