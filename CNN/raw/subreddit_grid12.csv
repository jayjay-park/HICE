337942,0,t3_1xuz2x,Hey there!  I was hoping you could shoot a code my way.  I really want to show some of the guys on my Teamspeak Villoux Server System for any of you interested.  The guys have been pretty bummed while RotMG has been down and were looking for some new games.  Lately we have been playing Pixelmon but some people are starting to get bored.  I would like to check out the game and see if any of them are interested.  Thanks Mordetx,grid12,cffsqna,1,t5_2wk21
