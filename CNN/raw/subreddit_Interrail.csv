2276771,0,t1_clsyw5k,Were looking at a mixture of night trains night ferries and hostelscouchsurfingairbnbing. I think some places we might just pass through and not even stay in such as Oslo maybe? Get a night train in and a night train out. Getting accommodation seems to be okay at the moment were just looking at all those options and choosing which places we want to do what. For example Paris will be our last night so we want to find somewhere on airbnb that looks really nice and maybe spend a little bit extra.Thank you!The only major question I have is for anyone who reads this Have you done a similar route? And if so what did you do in each of the places Ive highlighted? Anything youd recommend? ,Interrail,clt4lju,1,t5_2rv8d
3038512,0,t3_2ux1sh,From my understanding if on your passport you are based in a home in Romania. Then you cant travel within Romania using your pass.You can use it within the UK etc I maybe wrong to be honest... If anyone can vouch? But judging by the interrail rules you should be okay within the UK. As it is all based around your passport address. ,Interrail,cocxvap,4,t5_2rv8d
3077535,0,t3_2vc7d5,Ive just spent a week and a half training round Spain and spent less than  so two weeks for  is definitely doable.About five years ago I did ferry to Amsterdam and spent a few days there before starting interrailing. Went berlin Prague Vienna then a night train to Cologne then Paris. I spent way less that.  quid though obviously this was a few years ago you will have to sacrifice flexibility for cost.Investigate buying tickets in advance instead if interrail and remember that you qualify for a youth ticket. The time of year will effect cost too. Prices go up in summer.I like hostelworld and booking.com but it comes down to personal preference.Some people might not agree but putting your spending on a credit card can be a good idea. Just pay it off straight away. That way if disaster occurs at least you can get home.BUY TRAVEL INSURANCE no ifs no buts just do it.Its tempting to try and fit in as much as possible in an attempt to bag as many countries as possible. But its worth taking your time. Youre  you can always go back!Your biggest expense will probably be getting out of the UK sadly. Unless you live very near a major airportport and book really cheap flightsferry.Remember that you will have to pay extra for reservations in some countries or for high speedsleeper trains.,Interrail,cogzflf,1,t5_2rv8d
3484338,0,t1_cppf7cy,Trains in Europe are very different from trains in the US. It is indeed like a bus. And you do have to worry about them filling up because then you wont be able to get a seat and you have to stand for an hour P. Thats only in rush hour though.And for your last question Is the train youre looking for a TGV? You might check this out If you cant find any information on making a reservation online you can always go to the station probably Gare de Lyon for Barcelona trains and make your reservationt there.,Interrail,cppfu3v,2,t5_2rv8d
3484865,0,t1_cppfu3v,Im not sure what TGV stands for but were opting for the slower sleeper train instead of the high speed.  Id prefer to book the trains before we leave to be certain well arrive in each city when planned so we can book hotels.  It looks like RailEurope.com is going to work out.,Interrail,cpphzun,1,t5_2rv8d

4223962,0,t1_cs1m5tq,Ok for Italy youre perfectly fine to get regional trains between cities instead of high speed. These are slower but dont need a reservation and youre very likely to get seats. In eastern europe we were fine arriving in a city and reserving a train out a couple of days later only  costing a few euros each at the station. Im not sure about france but Id imagine its similar to Italy. Its probably a good idea to have a play around on db bahn or sncf just to see which cities have good train links between them too,Interrail,cs1pkol,1,t5_2rv8d

6373825,0,t3_42y6ih,There should be a list on the homepage and I think you will get a map with all the routes that require one.But I know that you need to book every fast train in France and that can be really expensive Paris to Amsterdam ,Interrail,cze4tva,1,t5_2rv8d
7284344,0,t3_4f15xo,First off use bahn.com which is MUCH better for timing and telling you if you need reservations.Unless you plan very carefully youre going to have to make a lot of reservations in Italy and theyre very expensive it cost me  euro to do Florence to Nice. Hungarian reservations are much much cheaper and in my experience I didnt actually need to make any at all. If you want to be safe check at the station when you arrive if youll need a reservation for your departure. Even in summer I imagine  hours notice will be enough to get a reservation especially since pretty much all the routes youre taking except of course for the overnight train will probably be ones with several departures per day.,Interrail,d266j7y,2,t5_2rv8d

The boring part i wrote was about the potential of only one of us get bored at maybe one city just bc it hasnt that many things to do and its a IF one of us gets bored. thanks for the info tho ,Interrail,d7tfjp6,1,t5_2rv8d
