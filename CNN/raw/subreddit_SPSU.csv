1036775,0,t1_chlnn3w,Thanks for the detailed response. That was exactly what I was looking for! I saw where one of my classes my cover orientation but if not thats okay. If its at all beneficial I wont mind. Thats great that everything is the way you describe it. I want it to be manageable but dont want to spend a whole lot more time in school. Shooting for getting it all done in  years while trying to keep working. May not be feasible but I think I can. Hopefully those online  hybrid classes will continue to be available. Good to know about the age group. Not a big deal at all. I was just curious. Do you have any experience with the internships and coops? Specifically how easy or hard is it to get in one? ,SPSU,chm4x4n,1,t5_2sik2

4581144,0,t3_3dpqs1,Im pretty much in the same boat as you. Im taking phys  calc II cs and discrete math...with a hr job. Im debating whether I should drop a class or reduce my job hours but not below . Ive look to working on campus but from what Ive checked they dont pay as much .  hr when I need at least .hr. I feel like if I dont do something overload and suffering grades inevitable ,SPSU,ct821kh,1,t5_2sik2
