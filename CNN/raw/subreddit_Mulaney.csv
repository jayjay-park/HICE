I mean at the end of the episode his character basically says if I cant do this my way Im just going to go back to being a writer. I give it  more episodes before its cancelled and I bet Mulaney the guy not the show will go to some other network and make a great TV show.,Mulaney,cl1x5ap,-2,t5_2z2e4
