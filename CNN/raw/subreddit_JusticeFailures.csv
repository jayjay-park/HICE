Glynis Griffiths wrote in a Special Investigation Section report that she and three other detectives  Tod Beisick and Waters  believe that from  to  Donald McRae raped over  women.Though that number was later expanded to  half were eventually excluded on one of three grounds the women could not be located did not wish to be involved or were deceased or the MO was not close enough. McRae was a suspect throughout the time that all  sexual assaults were committed.The remaining  sexual assaults spanned five years  beginning on April   a month after Henrys conviction nine months after his incarceration.In  forensic testing confirmed that crimescene evidence from two of the  offences had yielded a common perpetrator DNA profile. In  a third match was made  as a result of McRaes discarded cigarette butt and coffee cup being retrieved outside the Main Street courthouse  from a  assault.In May  McRae  faced with inconvertible DNA evidence regarding those three crimes  pleaded guilty  years after the fact to those crimes. Though McRae did not testify his lawyer submitted  without objection from Crown counsel  that he had suffered a brain injury had no memory of the attacks and was filled with remorse.In imposing a mere fiveyear prison term the judge noted the historical nature of the offences the fact that McRae had no similar offences on his record and the fact that although he had a very serious record of post break and enters those offences not only occurred after the subject three assaults they did not match the turpitude thereof.,JusticeFailures,ctpdyin,1,t5_33xvp
