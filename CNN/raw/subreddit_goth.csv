826005,0,t3_23kiw5,I dress the way I dress for me. You have to weigh how much you value your self expression against how much you care about what other people think. I am not the most hardcore goth my style is pretty simple my favorite outfit is a long black ruffled skirt a black shortsleeve top boots and my spiky collar but I do still get referred to as goth by strangers every now and then and its the subculture I most identify with both in fashion and in mindset. I think because of my subtle style I probably dont deal with as much discrimination as you but there have been times when Ive certainly wondered why dont I just dress like everyone else? Answer this for yourself Why do you dress goth? Are you trying to make a statement? Are you trying to get attention? Does the style just appeal to you? When people have asked me why I dress the way I do I respond Why do you wear the clothes that you wear? Because you like how they look right? Same for me. For me its an aesthetic choice that just feels right I wear clothes that make me feel like me. Figure out your own reason for why you dress goth and then you can decide if that reason is worth maintaining a lifestyle that sometimes makes you uncomfortable.edit You may also want to decide to compromise. You can keep dressing goth but tone it down. I think some of the coolest looking people are the ones who can wear a plain black tshirt pants and some eyeliner and still manage to look distinctly goth. ,goth,cgy62gb,8,t5_2r505

Saw an old Siouxsie video on MTV or some other music channel and was hooked...so Ive been around for over a decade now. However I didnt really dress the part until I was an adult because I was too selfconscious and shy. Why did you choose the gothic? Ive always been really into art and music and for some reason dark and macabre art appeals to me the most. Dunno why it just happened that way. I was attracted to the subculture because I really enjoyed gothic music Siouxsie Sisters of Mercy Malice Mizer etc as well as classic horror artliterature cyberpunk etc. I also just thought they looked cool  The Matrix was popular at the time so PVC coats and platforms were still seen as cool among a certain set haha. The clothes were pretty secondary to the artsy side of it for me honestly. And was the idea of rebelling against your parents a factor at play? Not at all.

Its really impossible to condense everything down into a reddit comment yknow but a wonderful resource that gives you a literal AZ rundown of the gothic subculture and its evolution over time is Encyclopedia Gothica by Liisa Ladoucer. Also dont feel the need to slap the label upon yourself. You do you yknow? But if you find yourself in love with the fashion and all of the art that it reflects be it movies or music or books thats fuckin awesome. PS Im a grown ass adult with a full time job in a factory. I wear black shorts with Bauhaus shirts but sometimes I just wanna wear rainbow socks. I also listen to showtunes and s new wave music and shitty metal music. Dont force it. Just find what you like. ,goth,d3a966u,10,t5_2r505

7824303,0,t1_d3vi437,Hmmm unifying numerous subcultures complicates things as it dilutes the purity of events. Some people really dont like that. Especially if they are bringing in traditionally nonGoth stuff alongside the goth and related stuff. Personally Im all for mixed genre events as it covers a wider audience but you have to have limits.Best solution for that is probably a multiroom event so each group gets fair representation musicwise. But no matter what you do you wont keep all people  happy all the time.Is it a question of credibility perhaps? Are the newcomers experienced in alternative culturelocal scene or blow ins who people dont really know? ,goth,d3vio8g,2,t5_2r505

8495551,0,t3_4un9n5,You cant go wrong with a set of black and dark colored skirts especially with the styles you mentioned having a particular leaning towards. Leggings with holes or goth designs on them underneath will keep you warm in the winter work appropriate in shortermini style skirts and bring in some gothness. Also good to have a pair or two in plain black for when you want your shirt to have the focus. Layering your fave tshirts with a nice vest can work for a lot of the styles you mentioned as well. Patching holes in pants with lace can make a nice touch. Scarves are big in the occult side. Lace silk and velvet will work best with the other styles as well so one or two scarves in one of those materials should go far. Some lovely jewelry can bring up the most plain jane outfit sometimes. Etsy has some gorgeous pieces but you can also find lots of tutorials for making your own if you cant find anything in your price range that you like. Thrift stores are the BEST for finding the scarves or simple skirts and the like for a good price. Good luck!,goth,d63htn0,1,t5_2r505
8496738,0,t3_4w0gz0,I think your company  is correct.  Not about the negative sterotypes that are quickly fading at least here in America anyway but about the marketability the of goth in .  Especially in writing about goth culture. The scene is not as large as it was  years ago and it kinda feels like every th goth has a blog or youtube channel and I think there are two magazine about goths culture.Your article is great but its a over saturated market with a alread small base. So if you want views goth may not be the way to go.,goth,d63n6c7,1,t5_2r505

8729862,0,t3_4zlk38,I can only think of examples I personally would rather put under the labels Cyberpunk not Cybergoth or Rivethead both with a bigger tendency to goth in this case and nobarely colors. I quite like Shen Dead Space or Jill Immortal. Unfortunately I cant find proper pictures online. In the movie adaption Jill wears a thin black sort of Matrix like coat trousers of similar material boots and lots of torn tights on her body. Her top is just torn tights fabric for the most part. I personally would add black Lennon glasses or any other suiting glasses to make it even more clich. The whole thing is not really goth in the traditional sense but its lovely futuristicdystopic with a dark touch. Not sure if this is of any helpinspiration?,goth,d6wvl5x,2,t5_2r505

9381608,0,t3_592ekh,I dont even understand what nugoth is. Its all just about fashion right? If so part of me hates it and part of me likes it I guess. I like it because I can now go to everyday stores as opposed to alternative stores only and see goth pieces that would work great in a goth wardrobe. I hate it because I know if I wear those pieces I will be perceived as a nugoth only into the fashion. Related I hate it because all the nugoth girls on tumblrInstagram making it all about fashion when you know they arent actually goth and I dont want to go into the what is goth debate but you all know what I mean by they arent actually goth. So Im annoyed by the nugoths aka fake goths on social media AND Im also annoyed that if I wear anything remotely close to nugoth style I too would be labeled a fake goth. I like the trend a little because of finding goth clothing more easily in nonalternative stores. ,goth,d956oq3,6,t5_2r505

9651301,0,t1_da2irln,I look at it like this the fashion draws them in some people will always stay superficial and drop out once the phase is over but some will become genuinely intrigued by the culture and grow beyond the looks. So if the whole fashion thing draws in young people good. Ive been in the scene for a little over  years now and if one thing has never changed it is the elder generation of goths being suspicious of what the new generation is doing usually related to fashion Ive lived through people decrying cyberlox uniforms PVC clothing medieval stuff horror rock and so on... There always has been some superficiality in this scene like any scene the important thing to me is that new blood comes in to carry on the torch and ultimately like already said some of the youngsters will grow beyond mascara and youtube videos and maybe go on to become the new Carl McCoy or Oswald Henke. So personally what irks me more than youtubers posting goth tutorials its mainstream fashion that suddenly discovers a love for black clothing and claims to make goth stuff that is absolutely not goth and all the press is like oooooh how creative! That really makes my blood boil.,goth,da2q1da,10,t5_2r505
9652080,0,t3_5d7w73,This is why Ive always been into both punk and goth. Punk has never seemed as shallow to me. Not saying the goth per se is shallow but there seems to be a lot more emphasis on what is on the outside by a certain amount of people in the goth subculture. It has always been like that. I can remember back in  trying to start deep conversations with people who identified themselves as goth which was just becoming a thing in the SF Bay Area at that time and it would never go any deeper than fashion or music. In the punk community though you could easily have a conversation about politicsetc... pretty easily.,goth,da2thue,4,t5_2r505
