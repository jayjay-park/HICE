2816612,0,t3_2sb200,If I had it all to do over again Id use everything from natures garden. They have some sort of shipping deal worked out with their carrier and their shipping is crazy cheap. Their oils are amazing people go bananas over their joy wax and they sell glassware and tins and CD wicks which IMHO are the best wicks. It would be a one stop shop with crazy cheap shipping. But at this stage in the game I finally got everything down pat and am scared to change my wax. Ive search for local options and maybe your areas has an option but I couldnt find anything cheaper or as good of quality as just buying from one of the reputable big guys ie candlescience natures garden candlewic peaks etc ,candlemaking,cno8po1,1,t5_2sw59
2956229,0,t1_co41zlx,The wax is an Eco soy from Canwax. CB . I just noticed it says container blend on the bag. Thats not a good sign is it?The wick is als from Canwax. I got yds loose unwaxed type HTP .I realize this combo is probably best for just containers... Am I right? ,candlemaking,co44yzy,1,t5_2sw59

5456376,0,t1_cw8q8ku,mmm......this is why I gave up on that wax pretty quickly  not getting good throw with my favorites. However I did have some great success with a couple fragrances using CD wicks not the Eco wicks.  Did you let them cure for  weeks? Also  are you using Eco wicks?   I would try a different wick before increasing fo. Its a finicky wax but has its good points easy to use as it comes in flake form and I never made an ugly candle with it.  I never had frosting pitting or rough tops.  It was the first wax I ever used so maybe beginners luck as far as  aesthetics.CandleSciences video is greatly misleading.  They dont mention that you have to let the  candles cure for up to  weeks.  Edited to add  Im sorry I forgot to address part of your question  I now use  a parasoy blend with zinc wicks and I get great throw.  I am by no means an expert candle maker just a hobbyist.,candlemaking,cw93qt0,2,t5_2sw59
5652356,0,t3_3sbc6d,Dont get all your information from the Internet. It is full of misleading and deceptive information a lot of it propaganda from the soy industry. Learn the chemistry of candlemaking to understand how all the different types of ingredients work together. Then experiment to see what you like to make and could possibly see yourself do over and over again...because if you eventually go into business thats what will sustain you. If you just want to be a hobbyist like I am try to learn many different techniques and dont limit yourself to container candlemaking. There are so many other fun ways to make candles!,candlemaking,cwxqaf3,2,t5_2sw59
5690806,0,t1_cwxqaf3,very good explanation! I was curious what type of wax you use?,candlemaking,cx2i09a,1,t5_2sw59
5959471,0,t1_cy0gu4a,Id think about it but Im not in the US so shipping would be really high.,candlemaking,cy0tfoy,1,t5_2sw59
6633011,0,t1_d05eic7,I mixed the FO at F and poured at F. I used the scent Egyptian Amber and got all my supplies from Candle Science. Flashpoint is F. Before burning the candle the cold throw was great but while I was burning it and after it cooled again the fragrance doesnt exist anymore.,candlemaking,d05esl1,1,t5_2sw59
6776847,0,t3_48kd6i,Elaborate. Or post pics. Im having a hard time understanding what exactly is happening to the candles. Sink holes like an air bubble cavern under the surface that opens when the candle is lit those suck?Or like a bumpy lumpy top after its been burned and recooled?Or something else?Congrats on almost being ready to go into production. Getting to that point can sometimes be quite a long road! Exciting ,candlemaking,d0kftou,1,t5_2sw59

7026922,0,t1_d1ciyh7,Did you find any black ones by any chance? I actually found black tins locally but they chip easily and since I am planning to sell them I dont want that to be an issue plus it looks cheap when the product itself isnt at all. ,candlemaking,d1cus6v,1,t5_2sw59
7033329,0,t1_d1cus6v,No I didnt think to look for black tins. I like the silver lol.  But black would be interesting.   Ill keep an eye open if I find any online.,candlemaking,d1dkzwa,1,t5_2sw59
7271670,0,t1_d24ptpo,Its a lot of trial and error. But it comes down to finding the right sizetype of wick for the combination of your wax and the size of your container. Also adding your fragrance oil at the appropriate temperature for your wax often  for soy and paraffin and  for palm. Dont know about coconut or bees and using the appropriate amount of fragrance oil. Lastly its important to use quality candleapproved fragrance oils from reputable candle supply distributors the stuff from craft stores and eBay etc often suck.,candlemaking,d24qn8g,1,t5_2sw59

8920416,0,t3_52grj5,Hi there. Im relatively new to candle making. Ive made a few over the years and have met with success most of the time. However the last two times Ive made candles they settled very weird.In this particular instance Im very puzzled. These particular candles were made with leftover wax from another candle. The original candle was a pillar candle that I bought from Pier . As it melted I noticed there was a lot of leftover wax so I decided to melt it and make smaller candles with the leftover wax rather than throw it away.As far as my technique all I did was melt the wax with a double boiler type of setup. I did not add anything to the wax. Simply melted it until it was completely melted then poured it into the jar and let it sit. I let it sit out at room temperature for a couple hours. Came downstairs and noticed that it had set like this. What am I doing wrong?,candlemaking,d7k3qhh,1,t5_2sw59
9690034,0,t1_da6txi4,Scents is personal preference of course but I found monkey farts to be quite enjoyable I think thats the name on eroma and the typical vanilla caramel coconut and lime stuff like that is solid. Wax the Gold  or the ecosoy advanced container blend are the ones I would test first. Ive had reliable results with the  but the ecosoy one is pretty good if you let it cure long enough. I recommend getting a kg bag or whatever of both and testing. Wick completely depends on your container size and wax. I use a double boiler I bought nearby just a metal jug inside a saucepan. I use the Lazer thermometer I got cheap from eBay you get a hang of how to use it after a bit. Sometimes at the start the readings are a bit jumpy. I use a hot glue gun to stick the wicks down but the wick stickers are much better just not sure where to get them as I havent really looked. I went to office works to get some print your own sticker set thing to male the labels. And finally I got some wick holders that fit on the top of the container to hold the wick straight. If you have any questions regarding this or anything else just hit me up. ,candlemaking,da7i2r1,2,t5_2sw59

10446806,0,t3_5p42g9,I use GB  soy wax and allow a  week cure time. Its hard to be patient and allow the candle to sit but its worth it in my opinion.,candlemaking,dcs8etq,3,t5_2sw59
