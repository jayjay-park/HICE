29622,1,t1_ceh79kx,A group of lads about  or  of them were riding Lescott towards the end of the match after he played shit.  I think hes referring to one of them shouting fuck off scarface and saying they want him to leave.Due to this Lescott decided that he wouldnt come and clap the other  fans who made the trip and paid another  trip for the th game in  weeks with another  games coming up this month because hes a precious flower.  Then post about it on Twitter to start a bunch of rumours because this is whats in the best interests of the Club.As far as Im concerned he can fuck right off.  People often say stupid shit at matches because its a passionate game and it was incredibly frustrating to pay for yet another trip and watching that shower of shite.  These guys were obviously frustrated and had a few pints before hand so chose to pick on Lescott.  So despite Lescott being a FOURTEEN YEAR VETERAN who has heard it all before he decides that hes now too offended to show even the tiniest bit of respect and appreciation to the rest of the City fans and will drag the name of the Clubs fans through the mud.Cheers Joleen dont let the door hit you on the way out twatface.,MCFC,cehsz45,2,t5_2s14k

I would recommend Nashville great town to visit especially if you like the night life and live music.

365499,1,t3_1ya1dk,Im propably just postloss mad right now but I felt like the ref were on Barcas side the entire game. On the Demi situation he neglected the free kick for Navas only to declare penalty on a foul outside of the box. This makes me want challenges with viewings of the footage by the ref during the game like in American Football so much. Would benefit the sport a great deal. But shit right now I just wanna swim around in selfpity for some time and then go straight to bed. I mean its not even like I expected anyting else a goal loss was exactly what I thought this would end like. But still we played just as good as them today even when we were a man down.

He is out of position every time we concede when hes playing. Zaba always manages to get back to help defend but Micah is nowhere to be seen.

If we sell him and bring in say Isco were still in the same situation where someone has to miss out on the UCL. Who would that be?I think we could sell him and wouldnt need to bring in a replacement.  world class strikers just always leaves at least one very disappointed. Yaya and others are fully capable of getting forward and weve often looked better with only  out and out striker on the pitch. I would be in favor of us selling him if they meet the m price and not bringing anyone else in this season unless theyre an up and coming talent who would be willing to miss out on the Champions League for a season the U rules are a little tricky with the UCL registration and Squad A vs Squad B Im not sure if we could get away with not registering them or not.,MCFC,cjwo2u4,3,t5_2s14k

2258077,0,t3_2l2hkp,I actually have to dampen your positivity a bit. Yaya was terrible for  minutes. We were overrun in midfield he was not doing any defending and couldnt track Rooney at all. If Smalling had stayed on the pitch I think we would have conceded before too long.  After they were down to ten men and moved fellaini into defence then he started to excel because he ha no defensive duties. This was most evident when he went to  and fernandinho played next to fernando. He was one of the few who was still playing well an didnt lose his head at the end. Having said that surely it shows us the answer!? Play him at  in the   especially now Silva is injured. This also has the benefit that while he defends badly for one of the  for a  he does quite well. In defence its more of a  which gives us that extra man in midfield and tightens it up.

Taking a young player and immediately sending him out in important games only to have him absolutely destroyed which is likely to happen and then benched for a while while we quickly scour for a club that will start him for the second half of the season in order to rebuild his confidence which will be hard as most clubs will have their defense figured out by then is absolutely not what he needs. And its more likely that this happens than him somehow being able to replace Kompany. People on this sub need to get a grip not just this post but so many others are considering Denayer to be a top quality PL CB already...the lad has had one good season in the Scottish Prem as his entire professional experience to date. He needs another year or two playing in England before hes even ready to make our bench. I know we all want to see youth breakthrough but we have to be patient.

4562705,0,t1_ct5olub,Thats exactly what I was thinking regarding the Dortmund players. This is the best time to buy either of them. Everything is unsettled right now and they arent yet comfortable with the new manager.As for Carvalho the injury is longterm but not so bad for recovery. Typically tibia fractures dont have longterm effects on player performance. Recovery will take a few months but he should be able to return to first team action and get right back to his best. Unlike significant Ligament or Meniscus damage which could and on some scale I believe always will affect players abilities broken bones recover fully. There are no significant side effects other than a weaker bone at the break site for a year or so. Of course Im no doctor and every injury is different but this is my understanding from research.City have previously been linked with Tielemans but that was way back in January  right when he was starting to become more regular at Anderlecht.

4709582,0,t3_3ffrrd,If it comes down to overall talent then hell no. If it comes down to form maybe. Kompany is the best defender in the league when hes at his best. Same goes for Zabaleta at right back. I think we are all forgetting how good we can actually be defensively. We just need to get Kompany and Mangala to click. ,MCFC,cto6j1k,6,t5_2s14k
4712403,1,t1_ctoidr9,Hell most likely be th choice behind Sterling out of position. We may see Kelechi in Capital One Cup games. Pellegrini was very disapointed to go out to Newcastle last year so he will probably field a strong team though.,MCFC,ctojckd,2,t5_2s14k
4731927,0,t1_ctqvz51,Am I the only one who thinks this  idea isnt so set in stone? We all love to give labels to formations but this preseason has really seen a mix between a  and  and we havent had a fully fit squad to see what Pellers wants to do with his XI.I do agree that Nasri isnt as adept defensively but I dont agree that he wont play up front in attack. Without KdB Nasri is Citys third best AM behind Silva and Sterling and still miles better than Lopes and Navas.  We all make so many excuses for Navas  oh hell be good as a substitution winger who can change a match but that would mean City make a slight change to the formation. Whats wrong with Nasri coming on for a Sterling or whomever to tighten up a match. Hes still one of the best closequarters possession in the league and can easily contribute with goal scoring. Its totally feasible to have an attacking three of SilvaAgueroNasri and have it to work well. I dont think you can write him off as a front three so easily. And even then Im still not convinced it wont be a front four. Also if formations change midseason youll probably see MP switch to something like a  anyways. If were talking formations and a midfield three why couldnt a DelphFernandoNasri work? Two hard working DMish players with a deep lying guy who gets forward. Thats essentially similar to a double pivot. Its a tough assumption to say hell be sulking bc hes not first choice because he really hasnt been in his whole career at City but hes put in efforts. I agree hes up and down but until Lopes proves he is ready for PL matches meaning he needs to perform like it in a cup game or PL match not in preseason against Vietnam I just am not ready to give the spot to him over a guy who basically won us a match in Roma last year. ,MCFC,ctr0216,2,t5_2s14k

5152963,0,t3_3ll3cd,Im so ambivalent towards Navas. Hes one of the best in the league at creating space on the wing and making excellent if not amazing runs. But it means absolutely nothing if time and time again he cant create the final ball into the box. But then I think theres no one on our team besides silva and toure who creates more plays and more crosses than Navas.

5615495,0,t1_cwt4pj2,Since you have a extremely condescending attitude let me ask if you think being at City is good for young players. Also BTW I dont count Sterling among the likes of Jason Denayer and Kelechi since we paid m for him. At this whole time at City Pellegrini has started kids in  premier league games. Even Jose probably has a better record than that. Its appaling to me that giving youth a chance is not an issue. No one develops by playing in last  minutes of a game. Why is it embarrassing to suggest that if Kelechi doesnt play against Liverpool when we have no recognized strikers Pellegrini isnt the coach for youth development?Edit Also laughable that you think Roberts is better on playing  mins each month in the CC and playing the occasional UYL game rather than develop in the Championship. He is regressed because he was already banging in youth league goals  years and now he is back to square one. You can actually see his regression when he plays for Us when he played Juventus he was our best player and now he looks like a shadow of himself. He still made  appearances last year he would have made more this year in the Championship. With us he has played  full games and about  mins in the CC. You tell me which is better. ,MCFC,cwt5n36,-5,t5_2s14k

If I was Pellegrini I would walk in the locker room and tell the team to forget after we leave the stadium this performance is erased from memory and we start prep for Borussia tomorrow.,MCFC,cxo22qm,3,t5_2s14k
5870235,0,t1_cxp0g0i,But Im asking you what was wrong with the system he played yesterday that made us play like that? What should his plan B have been? What system would you have changed it to that you think would have turned it into a positive result?Id really like to hear answers to those questions because most people tend to just avoid them its the easiest thing in the world to complain about the manager but provide some detailed evaluation of what he should have done better while youre at it.And actually most managers dont panic after  minutes if they go  goals down and start making subs so I dunno why youre criticizing Pellegrini for not doing it.gtNot to mention that the overall attitude of the team does not seem right when this team goes a goal down you may as well wave the white flag. That comes down to one man Pellegrini it is up to him to ensure the players are properly motivated at kick off.Comes down to one man...the players get a free pass on that then do they? Their attitude was fine just last weekend and midweek.As Ive said Pellegrini cant kick the ball for them. He cant make that run or tackle for them. The players need to own up to it just like Joe Hart suggested in his post match interview.I doubt Pellegrinis doing much different in the dressing room to when we were battering teams at the start of the season or to when we we were shite around new year last season. And by that I dont mean he has no power I mean the players will have bad days no matter what he does.Edit a word,MCFC,cxp4apg,0,t5_2s14k

6198076,0,t3_40fsjc,This might be controversial but I actually think Pellegrini has done an excellent job at integrating Kelechi this season.How many times have we seen young promising players experience loss of form after intense media hype? Thus far Kelechi has pretty much managed to go under the radar and its only really us City fans who are anticipating big things from him.If he really has it in him to become the player that we all want him to be  and with each of his albeit brief and infrequent appearances this is looking more and more likely  then I think his game will really benefit from developing under limited pressure. Although the slow integration can be quite frustrating I think itll be for the best longterm.,MCFC,cyu5lbn,28,t5_2s14k
6199717,0,t3_40ht58,Im not sure and any other good posters on here feel free to counter but I think the Bony rumour mill is being fuelled by nothing more than reactionary fans and the media picking up on them. For a striker who has had  or  long injury spells plus being ruled out for illness who also put in a potential player of the month performance in December he is certainly more than adequate to sit behind Aguero in the pecking order and Im fairly sure the club thinks similarly. Weve never been ones to bail on a player as soon as times get a little tough for them and tbh I expect the club to hold onto him at least until a certain Spaniard decides to shake everything up.Not to say Nacho shouldnt usurp minutes in he truly does flop hard but based on his performances recently I think hes done more than enough to tell us to put some faith in him.,MCFC,cyucaxb,31,t5_2s14k

The players and the fans responded much more passionately to the perceived injustice than they would had we just lost fair and square.Bit of a tangent but I watch wrestling.

I know there are numerous contributing factors many of which are unique to English clubs but still its fucking crazy how inflated the market has becomeIm really hoping this quote is inaccurate because paying more than  mil which is still a ton for him is unreasonable and at some point we need to put our feet down and learn to stop being raped for cash by anyone we flirt with. I liked how we ground out a good deal for Gundogan even if his injury made it look like less of a great deal. More of that in the future and maybe teams will stop fucking with us.

Also its rumoured to be m for bony wed probably get m for mangala and m for fernando so with the m youre adding were essentially paying m which is very over the top for a player like him and in no way is a steal. Thats also not taking into account that they woulld want all  of them and all  of them would step down to napoli and probably take pay cuts.Id much rather get players pep wants that fit his system.,MCFC,d5h9ew8,2,t5_2s14k

8449671,0,t1_d5xq7uj,Ive never once compared Stones to Terry. I think you have me confused with someone else I could find you plenty of games where Stones has played well. Defending isnt individualistic though so its a completely subjective term. His ability on the ball however is all down to him. Pep Mourinho and the Barca board all want him but youre blind to his quality. I genuinely worry for your football knowledge. Most of them are fine on the ball but theyre not Stones. They cant step out and find an incisive pass. Theyre tidy nothing more. Mangala is clumsy but average at best. And Tosin well I doubt youve seen him play more than  times and on every one of those occasions hes looked woeful on the ball. If you go and watch it back objectively without your blue tinted glasses youll see that. Vinny the launcher of long aimless and impossible Hollywood balls is better than John Stones? Behave kid. Hes still living off that ball he hit on the volley to Hazard.Youre one of these fans who cant be objective and see weakness. Tell me if theyre all so capable on the ball why does Pep want TWO ball playing centre halves willing to spend m in the process? Even looking at preseason we havent been able to play out at all. Weve been incredibly sloppy in possession in our third. Its not plausible. You have no idea what youre talking about. We have two left wingers. Out and out wingers. Pep wants his wingers to stay high and wide isolate themselves against the full back and not involve themself in build up play. Thats not Kev. Kev will play central and have the team built around him. As I said to you hed never play them wide if not for necessity. Gotze and Muller rarely played there last year once theyd got Costa and Coman in to cover for the injury prone duo in Robben and Ribery. Iniesta played wide because Barcas squad is paper thin. Kev will never play wide under Pep you can quote me on that.But as you say Im done arguing with you. Youre too ignorant to talk to despite your opinions being way wide of the mark. If you could stop spouting shite thatd be appreciated. ,MCFC,d5xqunr,3,t5_2s14k

9412215,0,t3_59k0g5,You can say all you want about Mike Dean or the pitch but there is no escaping the fact that we really struggle to create chances despite a lot of possession in midfield and sometimes further forward. This has been a struggle in a few or the last games and is really concerning. There is definitely a reluctance to run into space in midfield and play the ball into players to hold the ball up. We had no shots on target in a derby.United can just play the ball into Pogba and Ibra and move up the pitch. We dont even attempt that. Really poor all around and thats why our defensive players had an opportunity to shine. Aleix was very good too but he wasnt running into spaces with the ball and didnt track Matas run despite turning around and seeing him. ,MCFC,d992bgm,6,t5_2s14k

9454546,0,t3_5a7uos,The middle tier of seats hospitality is often not  full because hospitality is very expensive and your typical City fan cannot afford it.When we lose badly Liverpool at home last season we tend to clear off as fans of other teams do too United .Another simple fact is that there honestly arent that many local City fans who can afford to go to every game. Only about  which isnt enough to completely fill the stadium. Despite this the stadium sells out pretty much every game to tourists presumably who fuck off and get bored.Champions League games rarely fill out because UEFA are wankers a surprising amount of local fans including my  year old Dad dont give a fuck about the Champions League Wednesday and games are not included in season tickets and prices. Season ticket holders dont show up and no one can take their seats.That big road being closed because of that pot hole last season means people have to leave earlier if they actually want to leave the stadium grounds  hour after kick off i.e. a lot of people.  ,MCFC,d9efimw,9,t5_2s14k

We came to a point where I was convinced we were going to become a forever top  never champions kind of team and it frightened me a little. Not because I expect consistent title wins at all  oh no  but rather because I think we all knew that the quality we had deserved more than what we got.

10450616,0,t3_5po4oc,Pep explained this at length in his last press conference. Id suggest watching the video but to summariseThe PL is not good enough preparation for the first team. The level is poor and there is no pressure on the kids who also dont get the experience of playing infront of crowds or room to make errors.Without that experience he can introduce them slowly dropping them into a stable team doing well bit by bit to build up their experience but its very hard because without the experience of proper football before they dont know how to deal with making mistakes and set backs confidence is fragile and he has to be careful in his choice of when they play.He then talked about how he knew he could trust players from Segunda in more situations because theyd built up experience and could cope with things going wrong.So thats why hes struggling to bring them through and why hes sent Maffeo and Angelino to Segunda I imagine he knows if they perform there they are good enough to just be thrown in.,MCFC,dcsobw6,17,t5_2s14k

10567065,0,t3_5r9tsz,We dont have the players to play a back three at the moment the centre backs dont look comfortable and are exposed too often whilst we have no natural wing backs Sterling and Sane dont have defensive side to their game whilst it would likely curb their attacking freedom. Personally for this game I believe the lineup will be similar to thisAgueroSane  ToureSilva  KdB  SterlingFernandinhoClichy  Kolarov  Otamendi  SagnaBravoI think Pep is more likely to rest Silva for this game and play Yaya from the start whilst I can only see Jesus starting if Aguero is somehow still not fit. Whilst at the back Kompany will still be being eased back in so wont start again in such close succession and I think Stones is being protected at the moment from the negativity surrounding him despite in my opinion being Peps preferred choice at centre back. A win tomorrow would be a massive boost following tonights results and if we play as well as we did against Spurs and Palace then I dont see anything but however considering how things are going at the moment in the league as a whole really I dont think it will be anywhere near as comfortable as a couple of weeks ago in the cup.,MCFC,dd5w9y4,1,t5_2s14k

His finishing is good and his passinghold up play is pretty good too... Ive heard his dribbling is good also but whether its due to lack of confidence he hasnt demonstrated that for the first team. He actually seems to play it quite safe.     And maybe thats it... hes good  or even very good  but we need players who are exceptional. When Jesus has played he looks exciting world class. When Nacho has played hes done a job. Hes got goals in him  but to be harsh any good striker playing in our front line should be getting goals.    Hes definitely no higher than rd choice right now and possibly lower DeBruyne Sterling Sane might even be closer to starting as a central striker    Could all be down to confidence. Though hes a year older than the Brazilian hes really had very little first team game time especially compared to Jesus.

Hes been awful on and off since we signed him but hes been largely solid at CB this season and will probably be a squad playerWould love to keep Nasri for a season think hed have made a difference this year but it may be too late for him tbh and the club will want to cash in while they can get a decent fee. Hart will go to Everton or Liverpool. Mangala will leave if anyone will take him hopefully to China same with Bony hopefully to a landfill. Agree with the comments on Fernando.Aguero will leave. If the reports about Pep taking control of transfers over Txiki whos useless and has served his purpose now he got Pep to come are true I dont see him staying without a huge turnaround in his attitude and form in the next four months. Really hope he does stay on that basis. Kompanys future is up in the air too until he can prove his fitness over a long period.Outs Clichy Zabs Mangala Navas Cabs Hart Bony FernandoPossibles Kun Kompany Nasri ToureThat would mean signing a GK  LB  CM CF to replace the ones whove had minutes this season.

Yes Sane or Jesus are better footballers with better technical ability but Sterling has a very intelligent mind with regards to how he makes his runs. He is constantly getting into positions leading to chance creation and goals. Sane for me is not as intelligent as Sterling. If they both stay in our team its tough to be  sure that Sane will be better because Sterling suits our system better and he understands it better. Sterling is more akin to Muller in my head where he has a very unorthodox dribbling style and technical ability where Sane is more refined. ,MCFC,deo1e0x,6,t5_2s14k

Kompany finds Kevin De Bruyne splitting the Arsenal midfield who takes another touch to pass the ball to Merlin who slips Sane in behind Bellerin down the left flank. Sane takes a touch past Koscielny and whips in a Kolarovesque ball to Gabriel Jesus who chests it down in the path of Aguero and Aguero calmly passes the ball into the back of the net and completes his hattrick against the Gunners at the Wembley and confirms Citys place in the FA Cup final against Chelsea.Edit  So I think Sterling can chest it down since Jesus isnt on the bench,MCFC,dgn0tzr,6,t5_2s14k

11728033,0,t3_66ae9m,Interesting post from MagicMan on the Guardian  more insightful than anything Id have thought to say without being too difficult to understandgtPep Guardiola is both an overrated and underrated manager in my opinion.gtHis zonal system from corner kicks for instance only conceded  goal in the first five months he has been the manager with the shortest team in the league in all competitions. This is an excellent achievement considering last season City conceded  corners in the league alone under the previous manager. This example alone contradicts all the stereotypes that Guardiola is a manager only concerned with the offensive side of the game and playing aimless passing football for the sake of it. He also had a similar record for Bayern too. In fact Im willing to suspect that nobody in English media has yet to note this achievement primarily because of their inherent belief that manmarking is superior to zonal marking. A deep problem in English football that nobody is willing to challenge even if England concede to Iceland from throws ons immediately after scoring in European Championships.gtGuardiola is also excellent at exploiting manmarking tactically one of the main reasons he has a good record against Mourinho. When City won  at Old Trafford coincidentally the only team to beat Mourinho at Old Trafford this season Pogba and Fellaini were told to manmark Silva and De Bruyne in their half of the pitch by Mourinho. Pep exploited this by getting Fellaini to follow Silva into an innocuous area leaving United exposed aerially in the center of the pitch which led to the first goal that De Bruyne scored flicked on by Iheanacho after a long ball which Guardiola sides seldom play. Its subtle but the buildup to the goal was completely intentionally. Hence why Mourinho changed to  without manmarking at half time as he had already identified his current system was being exposed by Guardiola.gtPep also exposed Chelseas  weaknesses in the wide areas in Citys  defeat at a time when Chelsea were considered effectively untouchable. A game that City should have really won if not for referee decisions and De Bruyne missing literally an open goal. A tactical plan that Spurs basically adopted in their  win over Chelsea later that season ending Chelseas winning streak.gtHes a very flawed character from my perspective. Hes must have been arrogant or naive to believe that he could win the league with just Aguero and Iheanacho up front even if Gabriel Jesus was coming in January. Plus his passiveaggressive approach during press conferences probably hasnt won him many fans either.gtFurthermore hiss inability to manage outspoken players such as Etoo Ibrahimovic and Yaya Toure to the point that Toure had to be called back into the firstteam squad on Toures terms and not Guardiolas is a major flaw in his management ability  one of the reasons he probably got rid of Joe Hart too. He lacks the management style of Mourinho or Ancelotti who are capable of handling and getting the best of players regardless of their personality.gtThats why I consider Guardiola a both an overrated and underrated coach. Hes not going to get City to win every single game as some believed at the start of the season but I dont think hes not some clueless bald football fraud as a growing number of people seem to believe now.I think Pep managed Toure brilliantly but there are some very sensible conclusions in there from a neutrals perspective,MCFC,dgpeiu7,1,t5_2s14k
11728792,0,t1_dgpa1dw,No one here wants pep to suddenly be winning the treble. But I expect some progress its clear a lot of last summers transfers were not required. Outside of Laporte we made no progress in signing new full backs and as for center backs Stones is most certainly NOT the solution to our defensive problems.I expect some sort of progression yes we are playing better a lot of the time but no real results are coming out of it. We are losing to a poor arsenal side who are struggling to make top  our title challenge ended before December we showed little passion in all alternative leagues FA Champions etc....On top of that Im seeing a lot of mistakes from a managerial tactics point of view bad rotation wrong players placed too much experimentation in the wrong games.The only reason Im not bashing pep is because as you said its a first year there is plenty of time to turn things around. But as a fan I cant be blind and act like he made no mistakes and just toss it all to first year and bunch of excuses.Our first season would have been a lot different if pep did things differently. Imagine if we stopped playing Bravo way earlier on different game altogether in my opinion.I wish Pep the best of luck he is in my opinion one of the best managers in the world and exactly who we need.,MCFC,dgphmbd,1,t5_2s14k
