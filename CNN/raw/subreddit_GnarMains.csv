7141176,0,t3_4d732i,i just thought i would add that after investigating what pros have been taking recently on gnar from probuilds.net it has been mostly  with fervor of battle.  i have not seen any thunderlords decree or warlords bloodlust recently but i have seen a couple of grasp of the undying notably by faker.  this seems to suggest that the best keystone is likely fervor of battle but again its largely up to personal preference,GnarMains,d1pvinz,1,t5_3786r

7310865,0,t1_d1w8ven,Just curious some people rush FM while others rush black cleaver. Whats your take on Black Cleaver?,GnarMains,d2971yo,1,t5_3786r
7617634,0,t1_d37recx,Phage is limited to movement speed only on basic attacks but Black Cleaver gives movement speed on all physical damage.  However it is nowhere near as strong as Youmuus and you need to be able to hit something with Q to slow.  If you consistently hit the enemy chasing you that shouldnt be a problem but I guess its still less reliable and not as strong.  Youmuus armor pen is stronger against targets with less than  armor compared to fully stacked BC so I guess it would be better as a first item if against someone who didnt build tanky?  Sunfire Cape already gives  armor so after a few stacks BC would give more armor reduction.  How much effect does the  attack speed have?  What do you itemize afterwards to make up for the  health loss for taking Ghostblade instead of BC?  Im looking at this thinking it would spike hard very early on but fall off considerably afterwards.  Maybe this would be the best option against champions you need to bully hard?,GnarMains,d38334i,1,t5_3786r
7666270,0,t3_4karvw,Im Fabrimuch on the LAS servers and Ive mained Gnar since I first played him overtaking my previous main and favorite champion Renekton. Although I have a solid k mastery on Gnar I cant onetrick a champion for too long so I alternate between champions all the time and play all  roles with varying frequency but Gnar is still the one I come back to the most.I am an avid reader gamer and geek whos currently studying translation.

7806874,0,t1_d3sswit,Thing is Mega gnar doesnt have stupidly high resistances he just has buffs to his base casteradc resistance to maker him equivalent to a tank resistances except for MR he has ranged MR meaning  with no scaling but in mega gnar he has the best mr of the game. Everything else brings him back to having tank stats no more. But its top tier tank stats always number  to the best in each stat. he would have less base hp then alistar but hes second best less armor then rammus but just right next to him,GnarMains,d3tjzm7,1,t5_3786r

8558869,0,t3_4wvshh,To be honest  after they buffed him a few times this season  i find it unfair for him to get any nerfs  and the fact that he is being played a lot in lcs  is not a reason to nerf him either ! In lcs  as far as Im concerned he has never passed  win rate  unless we are talking about the very first games  and he is a good pick against this super annoying tank meta  nerfing a champ because he is good against a meta that IS SUPPOSED to have a counter is absurd ...,GnarMains,d6bfohn,1,t5_3786r

8919510,0,t3_52f87h,Thats a good question.  I guess try Wits End in this case and make sure you go Fervor of Battle.  I would take a Lifesteal quint if you can afford one and definitely take all the healing masteries available.  Boots of Switfness might help in this matchup athough youre probably better off getting Frozen Mallet second to kite and just get Merc Treads.  Morde likes to push really hard.  Try to keep the lane towards the center andor beg for ganks.  Morde is a fairly easy gank target like Darius since he doesnt have any escapes and is in a long lane.  That being said fed Morde can easily v so make sure its a gank to prevent Morde from getting ahead rather than to stop him once hes started snowballing.  Morde really isnt that common of a matchup so unfortunately I dont have a ton of experience playing that lane.,GnarMains,d7jztgf,1,t5_3786r

9385011,0,t1_d95kbax,Fair point but i dont feel like the delay between the key being down and the being up is worth sacrifice for accuracy considering all of Gnars abilities are skill shots.Thats pretty much how i decide weather or not to use range indicators on a champ. If they have an ability that is done by clicking on a champ I quick cast allIf they have most skill shots Range indicators.If its a bit of both then its a judgement call e.g. I use quick cast on Ekko Even though hes all skill shots. His E feels terrible with range indicators.Same for Zed no range indicators because his ult and W to a degree just feel awful,GnarMains,d95m6o5,1,t5_3786r

9640887,0,t1_d9yj749,I dont think BoS is viable at all since to make it effective you need to be grouped. I dont know for you guys but I dont group much as Gnar. Unless we have an Anivia J Karthus Bard... you know the guys who set you up in that kind of game I almost go just full tank. I will test but I think TLD will become standard unless I expect it they buff FoB. As you said Grasp is not really interesting. CotC... please?! if I want the shield only on  spells for the tiny time im Mega... cmon... if you think the shield is OP play Nautilus... As a last one... DFT? hmmm maybe not that horrible tbh the pen from the ferocity tree is very good. Just like Illaoi most of Gnar dmg is from abilities and illaoi players moved to DFT,GnarMains,da1frqo,1,t5_3786r
9651987,0,t1_da2ihs6,Against most sustained damage AP champs hexdrinker into MalletSV is nice and if the enemies are mostly ap you dont need to rush armor quite yet and finishing maw is still viable. With the reduced effectiveness of health regen SV is sortoff gold efficeint maybe just  instead of  so just relying on your tankiness and W damage should be good enough since the  champions you mentioned DONT require mallet to kite your basic kit is already good enough that mallet is overkill P.S. after specters cowl and hexdrinker get executioners calling vs swainAgainst the champs you mentioned i would most likely go hexdrinker gt boots gt jaurims fist gt Mercury threads gt giants belt gt Mallet gt Maw gt LocketZzrotRanduinBC BC if fed or if they dont have hard engage having more frequent and more damaging poke is quite good. rd item depends a lot about your enemy team who is fed in their team itemnise to kill them or survive them who is fed on your team itemnise to protect them against the enemy if a squishy is fed on your side be it just being tanky or providing locket shield and such. Mallet is a bit more damage oriented in this build and if you are behind i would replace it with Spirit Visage for more tankiness. No point in buying banshee here since they will pop it easely.Maw also gives you stats that work untill you get out of combat so while you might not use the full shield early you still get the lifesteal spellvamp and AD till out of combat so its either the shield to survive and get out or the extra stats to finish them even if the shield is down.I wouldnt finish maw at first without some form of HP but once you do have some hp finishing maw is much nicer then before.Specters cowl even without the passive health regen when you get hit is already gold efficient so is hexdrinker without the passive shield but the shield is more useful. Having both is still decent. SV is also quite good at improving the shield from maw so bonus points for having both.,GnarMains,da2t2yr,1,t5_3786r

11590340,0,t1_dg8xrn5,If you can get early vision on the enemy jungler then you can get a lot of information about their pathing and whether or not its safe to play aggressively early.  Early invades for vision in top side are probably the best way to do this so you can see if theyre starting top side or not.  If they start top side youre probably safe since the level  route involves both buffs and another camp so they will gank mid or bot side.  If they start bot then you have to play passively.,GnarMains,dg9ru6p,4,t5_3786r
