3465519,0,t3_2zcjks,I think it is absolutely the right thing for them to do.  The machine learning behind Cortana really only improves with massive amounts of data flowing through it.  Therefore the more users they can get using it regardless of what platform they are on the better it will perform.And the more people that use Microsoft services on other platforms the more comfortable they become with the notion of trying out a Windows phone.  I think having their services everywhere where more people can experience the quality of their software only increases the likelihood of growth for their mobile products.,LumiaLovers,cpnalhi,2,t5_2vzg9
