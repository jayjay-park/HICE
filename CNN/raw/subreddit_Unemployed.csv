2794381,0,t3_2rzzsw,Thanks I may take you up on that soon. Im unsure of my next step as I want to do something different but not sure what. I use LinkedIn to keep up with what others are doing.,Unemployed,cnlplc0,2,t5_2qv5y
3061823,0,t3_2slw9q,Im in almost the same position as you. F with M Together for two years hes been unemployed for a year. Hes highly educated a lawyer  but the market for lawyers blows big time. I am really getting to the point where I dont want to do it anymore. I mean I know its tough but jesus if the tables were turned Id be doing something anything to bring in steady income. If the tables were turned I wouldnt be in the same situation as he is. Ive never gone that long without working. Its frustrating to me. Ive been trying and trying to be patient but its difficult when I was going to buy a house and now Im taking care of someone.  I hope your situation gets better if I had advice Id give it.. But I dont even know what Im doing. ,Unemployed,cofcsgv,1,t5_2qv5y

4853743,0,t1_cu6bucp,Well different timezones and I have no idea if thats possible. I would gladly do it but I dont really know how to look for a job in the US while staying in france. I have no real job experience and no degree that might be a problem.But youre right Ill start searching under this angle but I would not really know where to start. Remote work is not common so with that distance I still have doubts.,Unemployed,cu6cmmm,0,t5_2qv5y
6916930,0,t1_d0x8hxh,Have you considered looking in the US at all?  I dont know what your family situation is like but some of our defense contractors pay a lot and you might be able to afford to fly home regularly.     It could be an idea to stay afloat while you continue to hunt for jobs close to home. ,Unemployed,d10cv9x,1,t5_2qv5y

8420724,0,t1_d5u240d,Hi Im glad you liked it and thanks for reading this as well! It means a lot to me.  Our situation is still pretty much the same but Im working out more and it doesnt feel as bad as it did two months ago. Itll work itself out eventually Im sure.And thank you again for posting and your concerns. It really means a lot. I wish you the best.,Unemployed,d5u4t5o,1,t5_2qv5y
8807214,0,t3_50nk18,It sounds like your completely overreacting.  Most employers dont even consider things that happened precollege.  It sounds to me like you just need to relax. Your university course happens in a month and I dont think any employer wants to hire you for only a month. Just enjoy this month and spend it with family and friends.  Your going to regret not appreciating this time off.,Unemployed,d76ia4q,3,t5_2qv5y
8932607,0,t1_d7lc9ek,Thanks. Currently my resume lists the University I attended the years I attended full time which is actually  years but I switched my major halfway through which I why those  years didnt grant me my diploma along with my major and minor. I had considered including the number of credits  which is around   but was concerned that it would draw attention to the lack of a formal degree. I guess Im most concerned about getting in the door for the interviews and then they run the background check and will disqualify me when it returns showing a degree wasnt granted. ,Unemployed,d7lkfpw,1,t5_2qv5y

10710797,0,t3_5qyy7u,You are young have time on your side and have engineering background. Learn to program. You will have to ask the experts about the languagestechnology etc to go for but you should do it. Data science is another field but again programming is required. All resources are available online. You dont have to spend any money on the classes. You can also be a tutor math physics etc to high school students. ,Unemployed,ddkql61,1,t5_2qv5y

11247428,0,t3_60coal,Check your unemployment info to see how much you can earn at your new job and still collect benefits. Also you likely cannot claim your employer as a job contact and cant use the same contacts each week.,Unemployed,df6vnv9,3,t5_2qv5y

11783265,0,t3_6834vt,Dont let the temp agency fool you. They put on a good show initially to bring you on and bring their numbers up. The most valuable candidates in temp agencies are those who dont need the recruiters to find jobs  like you. Shes obnoxious because you dont need her but she gets a commission on you. You do not OWE recruiters jack shit. Not a goddamn thing. And whats more  if a recruiter was rude to me and I had multiple offers coming at me...fuck it. Id demure and then focus on my own efforts. Temp agencies are last resorts for desperate peoplecareer changerspeople who are struggling finding FT work but still need to make money.The best option is always always a full time job. Even minimum wage unless you feel confident based on client reviews  not the pushy unprofessionalsounding recruiter you can get assignments that last at least three months with the temp or jobs that will go from temporary to permanent. You can take the minimum wage job if its offered but keep interviewing for the government job. I feel bad for your dilemma. I would not limit my questions to this sub. Your problem isnt just employment isnt staying employed and not being left in the dust if say the govt agency doesnt take you. I repeat  if a recruiter is rude to you bet she coldcalled you eh? Read their yelp page  you do not owe her anything. Recruiters depend on desperate people like me in an environment that says companies can siphon off labor from people they never intend to hire or pay a full wagegive benefits to. If one temp agency bothers you that means youre a desirable candidate for a nicer agency you can seek out online at a later date. Your brass ring is that government job and your second priority is a job  any job  especially if it looks okay on your resume. ,Unemployed,dgvo6fm,2,t5_2qv5y
