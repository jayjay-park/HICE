10796241,0,t3_5udyne,You went way back to the first episode! In the pilot George says to Jerry that filth is good when Jerry mentions not cleaning the bathroom before his friend Laura comes over.Then the quote is in these matters you never do what your instincts tells you. Always do the opposite.Then Jerry asks him if thats what he does and George simply says yeah I wish.,seinfeldtrivia,ddtk00g,4,t5_2uubm
