11584492,0,t3_61013k,Can anyone comment on their experience with the donut coil? And can anyone comment on if it would be easy to clean between sessions so I can avoid the deep clean process for longer but maintain a relatively clean donut coil to vape off of?,Saionara,dg93xti,1,t5_3hw7i
11586700,0,t1_dg4q558,Question why does ripping big clouds matter? Shouldnt efficient consumption of all material be a more pressing concern?
