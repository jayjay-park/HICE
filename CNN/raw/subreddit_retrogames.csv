1705033,0,t1_cju1tli,Agreed. I got into Gradius via emulation about a month ago and downloaded Life Force on the virtual console for my DS before my flight last week and played the heck out of it.  Still havent beaten it but am close.  Trying to plan ahead for the next game.  ,retrogames,cju2xx9,2,t5_2r3i9

If it was World War  then it could be Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe or perhaps of we are towards the end if the s it might be Screamin Demons There was another one from the earlier s but the name eludes me at the moment. Try looking at the other ones mentioned in the link above as precursors to that also. Maybe thatll help.,retrogames,cycruia,1,t5_2r3i9
