8470348,0,t1_d609nx0,There is a theory that the only time where IP matters is account creation and redeeming if that is true you could put your phone on cellular data create an account turn airplane mode onoff then create an another account and repeat. Up to a maximum of  accounts per phone numberIf this works and it is true that they dont check the IP during searches you probably wouldnt need a proxy. These accounts would probably only last for  redeem however and the phone number you use would probably get blacklisted so you would need a new one for each set of accounts.,BingRewards,d60c0h3,2,t5_2yo3u
