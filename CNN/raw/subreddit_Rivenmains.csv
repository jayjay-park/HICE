5577116,0,t3_3riirz,. Go into a custom game and practice CSing for  minutes. You should try the following conditions only progressing once you are comfortably able to hit  cs at  minutes a Only last hit minions no spells no additional auto attacks b Use only auto attacks still no spells c Use spells and auto attacks in this one also practice using your spellsautos to shove a frozen wave or trim a wave pushing towards your turret in order to practice freezing it. Finally once youve done all of these you can practice against a bot of your choice but focus on CS and practice how you can find windows where you dont need to trimshovelast hit and can either go for a tradeharrasszone on the bot. Remember your first priority should still be hitting  CS in this last exercise but this will get you used to having to deal with a laning opponent and practicing wave control for the sake of giving you the advantage of being able to CS without pressure.. CS whenever you safely can using your spells to mitigate potential harass and quickly moving towards CS and out of harass range from your laning opponent. CSing under tower is pretty easy for Riven once you get a feel for how much damage your spells do to creeps so you can let your opponent shove if you dont feel comfortable trying to set up a freeze the more ideal option in order to prevent potential tower diveseasy roaming opportunities for your lane opponent. Maxing E is mostly personal preference I only like maxing it when Im in a lane where I cant ever win all ins pre and just focus on mitigating harass and potentially quick trades EAAWWAA then using Q to disengage the trade. However BoxBox for example likes using E Max a lot in order to severely decrease the CD of his E early on as he goes for BrutLuc  rush with E max giving him more mobility and fun outplays.. Once again its really personal preference since if you snowball and make smart decisions from your snowball successful roamsgrouping with team to take objectives neither build will give you a more significant advantage in terms of damage output for the first  damage items of either build BrutHydraLW vs BrutBCHydra. However you can prepare yourself in champ select for a certain build  cdr from runesmasteries for BrutBC vs  cdr for BrutLuc based on what champions both your team and the enemy are playing. For me I usually go BrutLuc if we have  tanksbruisers if Im confident I can beat my lane opponent and is squishy if the enemy team does not have strong disengage and can therefore not kite efficiently andor if the enemy teams frontline is not composed of juggernauts. If none or only  of these conditions are met then I dont feel confident to go BrutLuc and I just go for BrutBC build.. Normal games dont really tell me as much all I see is that you snowballed with Riven and you maintained that snowball effectively or the enemy team just gave up and started saying ffs in all chat. If you havent already work on your QAA Fast combo in customs. You should really just take her into ranked and not look to win ranked games but to just improve and challenge yourself while playing Riven. You will be playing against people who have more motivation to win vs playing against people in normals so you will have to learn how to not throw once you have gained your snowball or how to play from behind if you messed up in lanegot ganked.

Now armor pen is really good if you can CS with it and dont think the extra points in E is worth the tradeoff.

You can trade but you have to do it without making any mistakes which means it is yours to lose.  Once you have E W amp Q its much easiermore forgiving.By level  its super easy for him to punish you with an enraged WQ.Another thing to keep in mind in early trades is minion aggro.  If you can trade evenly outright but hell do it into your minion wave take the trade.

Mainly because your shield only lasts for . seconds and it is very easy to get punished with your shield down.To be honest some of the best builds are  damage items and then  durability items based on the biggest threat.Also Mr. SmiteTP forgot to mention that while none of Rivens abilities scale directly with HP or ARMR the shield indirectly benefits from having ARMR as well as if youve built Titantic Hydra you will obviously gain more damage on the passiveactive with extra HP.,Rivenmains,cy314ks,1,t5_34n26

6278482,0,t3_41ln19,I am fairly comfortable with this matchup. You can max E if he has started with corrupting potion otherwise you can just get  points in E if he is using his spear to farm wave instead of harassing you. You can E every one of his spears. At level  You can chip away at him with one rotation of spells and all in him afterwards. Your  is much stronger than his as he cant really use his ult in an allin.I take TP every game against Pantheon as if he plays correctly he can harass you out of lane so this match up is all about trying not to fall behind early and if you are close enough in CS you will be able to win an allin battle. I usually rush BC in this match up as the added HP helps with sustaining his poke and being able to win the allin. If you dont let him get a lead early you will easily beat him providing you know how to combo once midgame comes around. You will get zoned from some cs but just try to freeze beside tower and he will have to choose between using spear to harass or using it for CS. I find that Panth likes to dive me in this situation as he thinks his shield block will enable him to do so. This is wrong and you can easily bait him to dive you and ult  cc him long enough for you to destroy him. Avoid fighting him when youre below  HP at all costs as this will easily be your downfall.This matchup is a lot easier than most meta pics at the moment JaxReneMundoGarenetc.,Rivenmains,cz3ajw5,2,t5_34n26

6412510,0,t1_cziiy9p,Garen is easy for a capable Riven who said trade early??? All you have to do is get close enough to bait him to use his Q and then you Q away and fight him when its down. Its not that hard and any decent Riven would make sure to stop him healing from his passive even if he stays back its okay because hell lose CS.Both Jax and Irelia destroy Riven level  especially with corrupting potion. Like Riven cant out damage them even with a proper Q auto combo shes too squishy for that early. Ive played both matchups many times with my friend  broken blade and he actually told me to avoid trading them level  as thats what he does and its actually worked for me.Rumble is easy Im kinda worried if you actually believe rumble is difficult and Pantheon doesnt deserve to be in a completely different tier from Rumble. Riven was even brought into LCS to counter Rumble so as you can see even in the most competitive league setting Rumble is seen as an easy matchup for Riven so your point of what ELO is this is heavily distorted since Rumble being easy holds up in the competitive scene.,Rivenmains,czijd4h,2,t5_34n26

6434330,0,t3_43tfr9,I just want to do more damage than tanks For real though I think a big issue is that racking up kills just isnt as rewarding as previous seasons because of the gpm changes and the fact that pretty much everyone can build tanky to salvage a lost lane. Riven is a champion that should reward skill but theres very little counterplay to all the meta tanks after theyve finished an item or two even if you shut them down in lane. I honestly think shes fine right now but knowing this giving Riven a better path to snowballing would be still really nice. I think gaining stacking  armor pen against champions you kill would be good without driving her over the top. This way if you kill your lane opponent multiple times no amount of armor stacking is going to let them naturally outscale you but youll only have your regular APen against the rest of their team because you havent outplayed them yet. This would also be pretty good for her lategame because by then shell have a decent amount of armor pen against the whole team so she wont fall off as hard.,Rivenmains,czkuj3g,1,t5_34n26

6458759,0,t3_4425fb,Riven is not in a bad place she isnt ridiculously weak and not ridiculously strong either. I played her since I started this game as she was free weak and instantly fell in love as to me the other champs were too weird as I was used to human characters. anyways shes been through a lot since season  when I started. I feel that this season her power has been pushed more into late game as when I have close to complete build I can see a difference as before her power was more of mid and early game. I think the feeling of weakness stems from all the new items and item changes and everyone is just confused on what to build as most of us have been forced to skew from the regular paths of past patches. the masteries dont help the confusion either. I started jotting notes and trying different items and I have her back to when I felt strong. I really do recommend you pull out a notebook or notes on pc and start testing and trying until you get what feels right to you.,Rivenmains,czndngw,1,t5_34n26

But dont expect to win this all the times usually after  min you have chance but it is lowyou need to make crazy plays and after  it is mostly overunless your team is strong cause he is not so useful in teamfights.  So best advice vs nasus is to try to zone him early make him recall then push lane so minions die to turret and try to roam if your team gets ahead you dont need to be able to v him.,Rivenmains,cztbgzq,1,t5_34n26

7180982,0,t1_d1ue8mk,I want a six of whatever youre smoking son.Riven is a burst champion always has been. Her sustained damage isnt great thats why you have to bait enemies into chasing you so your abilities come off cool down. Not being able to burst someone almost always insures your death given the ridiculous amount of damage somebody with  damage item can do in this meta. If we go back to s when champs actually had to build damage to do damage you were able to out sustain these bitchmade tanks. They would run before you had the chance to pop your bankai. However nowadays your attack speed just isnt enough to out sustain these tanks like vayne or irelia could.Rivens role in the late game is to kill the squishies.

However you have said you run TLD against PantheonTeemo with a Youmous Rush Fervor against Quinn with Youmous Rush.Therefore Im not entirely sure when is the appropriate time to use Grasp over FervorTLD. Do you use it when you are the only potential tank? Do you use it against someone who can sustain better than you with Fervor? Etc.,Rivenmains,d20jn0e,1,t5_34n26

A good Riven can use the Fast Q combo quicker than the CD of Trinity will cooldown. Not only that but the build path for it sucks on Riven.

7427729,0,t1_d2mguv2,Sorry never added runes. I always go AD Red Armor Yellows and Flat . CDR Blues with  AD Quints and  CDR Quints. Tried Armor Pen Reds every so often but they never seemed to matter much in the early laning stage where most runes are supposed to shine. I know that math on them says once you get  or  armor pen items those runes become much more valuable but the sacrifice running  Armor Pen vs . AD isnt worth the benefit later in this case. I throw it on every once in a while when I see a Malphite or Rammus but Ive always felt weaker early on. I prefer the flat  CDR Blues you get with these runes at level  rather than going  flat and  scaling which only give you . AD more. I tried this a bit and didnt really like the  CDR at level  compared to the  CDR. I tried HP per level Yellows quite a bit but again didnt really see much of a difference but the additional  HP at level  sometimes was the break point for my Lord Dominiks. The flat Armor seemed to be slightly better since quite a bit of your early laning phase against anyone is auto attack based. Not a big fan of the AS Quints although Ive only played ish games with them didnt notice any animation canceling improvements would just prefer the base AD. Patch . is going to chance BluesYellows a bit I think. With the buff to mages youre going to see a lot more AP building Top laners in Ranked and at some point Im going to have to figure out how to bring MR back into my runes to avoid getting smacked by Rumbles at level   and .,Rivenmains,d2mhh92,1,t5_34n26

Sitting in a far bush waiting for someone to come up close so you can combo them taking them to  or so isnt bad though. Rarely do you leave unscarred though. I dont think the second one is worth it anymore unless you can consistently get the Godspeed combo where you take  less auto from blue buff. I cant get that one consistently though. If you wanna know what that is its auto bottom one q over auto bottom q auto third q centered on blue auto top one move up auto and auto again canceling blue buffs auto before it finishes. Its nearly impossible to do consistently. Feel like a god whenever you get it tho.So yeah taking one is the most consistent to keep lane control and still get a slight XP lead.,Rivenmains,d377gl2,1,t5_34n26

9016758,0,t1_d7v302i,Generally you can try to make plays when you have flash up without flash your engage and catch potential is limited depending on the other team comp.You want to roam when you are strong and you think youll be able to get your team aheadget objectives out of it if you dont think you can then its better to just keep splitting and create pressure top lane so your team mates can have some time to farm up and get objectives with numbers advantage since theyll need to send multiple ppl to deal with you.You can also roam when you are behind as a way to try to get back into the gamebe useful however its high riskhigh reward generally you do this when your lane is completely lost and you kind of have to try to do something elsewhere.Teamfight when you have flash up when possible depends on the team comps on if you shouldcan engage or catch but in general you dont want to initiate the fight yourself unless its a catch on a squishy out of position or unless your team has absolutely no other way to initiate and you need to get a fight going you absolutely are going to need GASteraks if you are doing the later flanking is also a great way to start fights with Riven specially when you dont have flash.Basically you have to look at all the game variables team comps how ahead youyour team is etc and then make a decision of either splitting if you have stronger vworse v like a team without frontlines and a bunch of assassins for example or team fighting if you have aoe champsinitation or tanks on your teamif youre behind.,Rivenmains,d7vo9u6,1,t5_34n26

9953074,0,t3_5hzunj,the best way to learn her is playing her. A LOT. Just go into a normal and play her over and over again. You need to get the feeling about how much dmg you do when youve finished this and that item learn how to trade in lane and to use your R not tooo soon. You need to get muscle memory and you gain that by playing her a lot.that would be the basic.As you play her you will create your own combos and all that stuff  just try to combine some of your abilitys and see what they do.Also very usefull is the wallhop you can do with your rd Q. There is a video on YT where you can see all the walls you can jump over.tipp try to E at the wall before you press Q   this pretty much guarantees you the wallhop,Rivenmains,db4wt05,1,t5_34n26

10864755,0,t1_de0grcd,. there can be several causes for this. do you still hover over your opponent while pressing q? because if you dont you will dash which prolongs its animation time and therefore decreases dps. this is quite easy to notice and fix though. just keep your cursor over the dummy the moment you press q. are you too slow? you need to be quick to do it properly. if you are too slow with the ground click then you wont reset your auto attack timer and therefore cant get a faster combo off. do you need too long to click your opponent after resetting the auto attack timer? unlike the previous one you do reset your aa timer but then dont click your opponent as fast as you could.. im not sure whether there is a standard for this. i have my small finger on q and then just one finger after another on the other spells so index is on r. but i also use entirely different keybindings  spells v for flash mousebutton for second summ space for hydra and many more so this might change conditions. i have absolutely no trouble doing most combos with this the only problem being a combo that involves hydra into flash so that the hydra active deals damage after flashing i cant really do that in quick and longer combos.,Rivenmains,de0mf5d,2,t5_34n26

10927966,0,t3_5w24db,Call me crazy but i find riven isnt the worst toplane champion to get behind with because you always have the ability to roam and quickly catch and clear out waves compared to stuff like irelia or jax who are totally irrelevant if they cant v their lane opponent. Learning mechanics also comes with learning what to do with different situations etc... You obviously cant win every game but its important to learn how to stay relevant even when youre not ahead its definitely possible even though its not what riven is expected to do ,Rivenmains,de755tx,1,t5_34n26

11488089,0,t1_dfy5kfn,You have some good THEORETICAL points.  But the idea that you wont useful because you wont be as tanky as a full tankmaokai nautilussion and wont deal enough damage with this build because you have no special damage to compliment this build just comes from more of a lack of experienceknowledge.  However I will go through your points one by one to try to share my thoughts with your issues..  Now you gimp your damage so if you try to jump the enemy caries you will probably get shut down by cc if they have some decent peel before you can kill.You may very well be ccd by their support if they have hard crowd control to mess with youalistar.  At that point just stay away from that carry that you are trying to kill until THEY decide to try to walk back into the fight to deal damage.  While theyre trying to get away from you you just ignore them and deal damage elsewheremaybe go help your adc.  When they come back into the fight youre still healthy and because youre riven your e is probably back up from the last time you engaged on them so just JUMP ON THEM AGAIN.  You have to realize your role changes in this and that youre more of a jack of all trades compared to the do this one job really well..  Also you definitely wont do a lot of damage to big tanks v without LW.Usually they will only have one or maybe two big tanks.  Your cleaver will usually be enough to shred them down if theyre too far away from their turret.  However in the case that you find yourself within a team of five ad and the entire enemy team is stacking armor you can feel free to buy a last whisper to replace your GAGA also isnt as important if they are stacking armor just to counter your team composition.  .  And combined with the fact that you need to be near your teammate splitpushing is suboptimal.You dont lose as much as you think you do just because the item is so god damn underpriced.  If you looked at the item comparisons I compare it to some other tank items that are about the same base stats when you are with an ally and get the  armor.  Now take away the  armor because youre split pushing but also keep in mind that you spent  gold less on your item.  Ill let you know one thing.   armor is not worth  gold.  Think of the extra stats for being near your partner as a bonus not a requirement..  Another point is why not just get your junglersup to build this item and bind on you.Well for one most junglers arent going to listen to you when you try to tell them that they should build KV because Modx says its broken.  I should mention though that its quite often that I try to convince the support or jungler to buy it WITH me.  With two vows you can each put it on one of your carries.  Never more than two though.  .  That way you get the  reduction for free and you can build another item.With this build youre not trying to be the one taking less damage.  Youre the one trying to make up for other peoples mistakes by taking control and soaking up damage while also killing people as you please..  And last but not least I feel like with this build you put a lot of trust into your teammates and the general consensus is the lower elo you are the less trust you should put into your teammates which I guess doesnt apply to you since you are challenger.Strangely enough it is quite the opposite of how you thought about its applications.  This build allows you to not HAVE to trust your teammates to do stuff for you.  This is a jack of all trades build that lets you take control of your own game and turns you into the commander.  Also as you may not have known about me I have done many bronze to diamonds and have also used this build in challenger.  I find most of my success with this build to be from about midhigh gold all the way to midhigh diamond.  A stretch of two leagues.  In low elo I prefer to use a more snowbally build as youre not forced to teamfight and can just kill people one by one.  In very high eloMasterChallenger  The build is a bit riskier because that little bit of pressure you lose from splitpushing matters a lot more if you cant get into a teamfight but also because sometimes you truly do need to kill the enemy in one second instead of three because players can do a lot more in that two second span in this high of elo than anywhere else so you cant take the chance all the time and have to go with a youmuus and ravenous hydra build for maximum dps.I hope this might have cleared up some misconceptions!  Feel free to ask more questions!,Rivenmains,dfy69di,1,t5_34n26
