I also dont like the little disposable plugs you rollsqueeze and insert you take them out to answer the phone and they get lost or covered in gnarly dust.I use the Howard Leight protectors with the orange neck band.  You take them out theyre around your neck ready to reinsert.  You can also hear if someones trying to get your attention but they block the damaging high db.One thing when you first get them sometimes the plugs are squishy or in a weird shape and dont quite seal the ear the way they should.

We clipped the shit out of it every  or so and double clips on either end where it turned to pass through the joists.It was important that our loops were  and we didnt want the cold end of a run exchanging heatcold with a hot beginning of a separate run. That would be my concern about running different parts of a loop through the same hole.Generally keep everything as level as possible and make sure your loops dont interfere with each other to trade heat. Dont kink anything. Once its hooked up and working add extra clips anywhere the tubing might have expanded and insulate the underside. Were using the foil insulation stapled beneath the joists about  away from the lines to reflect any heat upwards not to actually touch the tubing though.Ill be working on it tomorrow if you have any questions you want me to ask the plumber.,Construction,cg9h3i6,1,t5_2qiuc

The operator will usually break apart all the sections and work harder than anyone else as its ultimately his truck and responsibility. A good story would be once in Nebraska on a shut down we had a pump truck plug up during a pour. A newbie operator and myself along with the other concrete crew guys busted our asses tearing the entire boom down trying to find the plug.

Most of my work revolves around underground utility construction.I think there are two sides to every coin and the relationship between engineers and contractors is no different.  Engineers dont always think about constructability convenience and price and contractors dont always think about design parameters and constraints.Another common issue is that by the time the contractor is hired the design is already  complete permits are done or in progress if applicable and the owner has boughtoff on the engineers design.  By that time its kind of a dickmove for a contractor to throw a wrench into the works saying the project should be designed differently.Those are just my thoughts  Ive worked with a lot of good and bad contractors and it also takes a lot of experience to know when to not listen to a contractors suggestions.,Construction,d1tvs5n,6,t5_2qiuc

7561425,0,t3_4ivwjo,Im a gc.  I do a fair amount of higher end jobs with architects that range from highly involved to nonexistent.  My number one source of stress is indecisive clients.  By far.  I tell my clients Ill make your house float in the air and build it out of toothpicks if you want but you have to give me clear decisions that dont change.  Because Im on site regularly the owners frequently grab me in the field to discuss a change that is often already coming at me way late.  This basically cuts the architect out of the conversation unless I throw the brakes and round everyone up for a meeting... as my material sits on site subs take off now my whole schedule is fucked and my client is wondering why the cost is running high and our timeline is dragging out.  I digress...Maybe offer to buy the guy a beer as a peace offering.  Sit down at a bar and ask him how he wants to handle it.  See if there is some common ground somewhere.  In my perfect world all the changes would be highly detailed and on a set of plans coming from the architect but the reality of timelines and cost keep that from happening more often than not.  If you can be available and responsive tell him your goal is to make his job easier and keep the client happy.  My rock star architects are involved in the project and every time there is a design edit they get me a revision.  This is not the norm but Im extremely appreciative of it when it happens.  Id rather have a solid architect and good team on a job than be the sole captain of the ship.

Way higher? fine you did good but if he bid k and you wanna shake a k bid in his face youre wrong.  and the k bid you may get?  youre attacking an honest person with the bid of a tax cheaterCalm yourself.  If you signed a contract just let it happen.  Stop pricing shit out yourself because you have no idea about the machinery gas man hours tax rates insurance tire ware oil changes support staff drug habit advertising printing phone charges storage equipment loss and everything else that this guy deal with.If you didnt sign a contract let a couple other companies bid.  Go with the low one who will do half of it take your money and not finish.  Go with the high one and it gets done with spit and polish put on top usually cuz they know thats what you paid for.  But at least youll get an idea without needing to you know assume contractors are dumb and piling dirt should be easy and cheap.If youre in an area like mine Ill tell ya everything is double what it should be right now simply because everyone is busy as hell.  Its a sunday night and my body is killing me because I worked  hours today without a day off in a month.  Im on a k project that should of been k but my excavator cost me double my labor costs me double or they will jump ship Material went up if I want it so I can bump the sucker who paid less off a week and even though Im charging double I will make... just slightly more?and I only make that slightly more because if these people didnt want to pay me slightly more someone else would of and they could wait.You can verify if this guy is legit in much better ways than just assuming hes ripping you off and coming on the internet to question it.  ,Construction,d70wn0i,5,t5_2qiuc

We do interior alterations mainly for reference commercial.We all follow jobs similar to a project manager amp we have a site super who visits sites and manages them more actively. Im somewhat new and I price jobs on my own now. Ive brought business to our company and won a lot of jobs too relatively speaking. The two biggest reasons why are  our company recognition and quoting for previous customers and  our pricing is competitve. If youre competitively priced and your work seems decent and they get the impression you know your business there is no reason for them to not award you the job barring politics and kickbacks which are actually VERY common.To be honest Im not  following your post here but this was the best I could do to respond.

10849646,0,t3_5uwl82,I have built large homes with both Zego block and Ecoblock ICFs. Best thing is to get quotes from suppliersinstallers.Just beware the extra costs that arent told to you by the suppliers. That is Possibility of excess concrete loss due to blowouts or foam failure Are they including the concrete pump as well? Has site access been considered? Obviously check all Labour and materials included such as rebar. Fixing to these walls afterwards can be a pain. For some wall mounted cabinets like kitchens you need to chase back the foam and install timber studsplates. If you want to install plantation shutters baseboards architraves curtains pretty much anything wall mounted you have to plan ahead before you cover the walls with Drywall or similar. Even powerpoints need be considered as over time if they are only attached to the drywallfoam they will pull off the wall.  Drywall can be a bit of a pain too. Just installing with gluecement doesnt always work. Finding the little clips within the ICF form to screw into can be a pain too. Finishing on the outside is a pain too. If youre going to Render the render doesnt always get the best adhesion. If you are cladding you need to have Mechanical fixings and cant rely on the foam. One of the biggest extra costs I have found is fixing the walls after they are poured. Such as filling in cavities in the concrete because it was too dry a mix or the wall got clogged from all the steel or something like that. I have had to pump grout into a lot of window corners where the steel above the window opening has caused a clog in the concrete. I have to make the concrete so wet when I pour it in that I have questions over its strength. Also the forms are foam and plastic so naturally pouring in tonnes of concrete causes them to move around regardless of your bracing. I had a carpenter armed with a blow torch and an electric planer spend about a week on one job just shaving walls back to get them Plumb and dead straight so I could get a perfect finish inside.I specialise in Green and Sustainable homes but to be honest I think ICFs are a little bit flawed. There is way more embodied energy in getting the product to a good final finish than traditional framing or brick methods. I would recommend doing something like blockwork filled with concrete and framing off that with insulation if youre after strength or installing double frames with insulation or brick veneer with insulation.I recently achieved the same insulation rating as ICF on a double brick home with cavity insulation. It was also done quicker and cheaper.Any other questions about ICF ask me. Other people may have different or better experiences.,Construction,ddz2bp7,1,t5_2qiuc
