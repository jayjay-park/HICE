11572439,0,t3_656alx,Ive been using Heroku Review Apps on an app named CheckAFlip to test the waters.  I really love how trivial it is to get deployment information back to a pull request where I spend the majority of my time.This post enhances review apps with automated postdeploy QA testing. The process is push commits to GitHub PR CI builds the code  Heroku deploys code to a temporary environment Assertible runs automated tests against unique Review App environment URL Assertible flags GitHub status check as pass or fail dependending on the results of the tests.Interested to hear your thoughts or your testing process.,Heroku,dg7qpz8,1,t5_2t6ic
