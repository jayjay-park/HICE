811169,0,t3_23f6uo,Im playing  and spent a decent amount of money on a new midfielder who is definitely now my star player. I want to get another striker as backup but you dont really get much money to start with.. I got battered in a lot of my friendlies but like everyone else have smashed the league. Only have one more game left and then its promotion! Ive focused on  players or so to train and you can actually see an improvement during matches. I wish there was a way to check the progress of which stats Im in the middle of raising though.,NPFC,cgwhfrh,1,t5_31a5z
