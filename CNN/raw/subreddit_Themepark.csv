92947,0,t1_ceois0v,It really comes down to knowing what to shoot. If you got k on the old system you really already know all the tips I could tell you that are obvious. Beyond that its knowing what to shoot. There were runs where I would intentionally not go for a high score and instead itemize out what different targets were worth what. I will say that three of my biggest money makers are the eyes in the trees after the alley ambush the parking meter towards the end of the right and the eyes on the poster behind the other car after the screen scan thing those are all worth k per hit and refresh quickly. But really the make or break point is early in the ride. There is a giant monster with a giant eye with two tentacles early bursting out of a building. The tentacles and guns swing about and are difficult to hit. They are worth k per hit but they are very difficult because in my opinion the sensors on the targets and the guns do not always communicate effectively. If you botch that part and leave that section with less than k youre not going to max. ,Themepark,cep0fn9,3,t5_2r2w2

It wouldnt surprise me if things continue how they are right now for Universal to start stealing some attendance away from Disney. I also dont really agree that this helps both resorts. It helps US theme park fans and guests of the park but I dont see Disney gaining anything in the long run if they continue to be as lazy as they are now. ,Themepark,cezamhg,1,t5_2r2w2

1543081,0,t3_2bwnv4,No it has not cleaned up since then as its still in PG County.  I dont think its as bad as youre remembering though.  Sure there are some lowerincome folks there but I have had a season pass before and I have never felt unsafe.  Even if the unsafe clientele youre worried about are around theyre not interested in messing with your day theyre just at the park to have a good time too.  That was always my experience anyway  and Ive been going there since it was Wild World.That said its a concrete jungle.  The theming is nowhere near as solid as Universal Disney Busch Gardens or the like.  Its a bunch of rides put together in the same place.  Its good for what it is  a publictransit accessible theme park  but beyond that I wouldnt give it much.  If you have a car Id say try for Hersheypark or Kings Dominion instead.  Youll have a much better time there  not because of different clientele but because theyre nicer parks.,Themepark,cj9p6i3,2,t5_2r2w2

2048105,0,t1_cl04zes,I know Im playing devils advocate but Disneys visitor base is not just local Floridians who can visit every other dayweekmonthyear. Sometimes a familys Disney trip is a once in a lifetime event. Being said I completely understand wanting to get everything on video for memories or to show people back home who wont ever get the experience. When my dad was being deployed to Iraq way back when we took a Disney trip and we made sure to document everything. Being  at the time I was able to look back at all the videos of my trip  with my dad in them and helped me get through the long months without my dad.Either way I think its an annoyance for those goproscamera combos however its not an etiquette problem.EDITFor the record you can replace Disney with any attraction thats memorable.,Themepark,cl05qnm,14,t5_2r2w2

There was one incident when a tree fell over next to the Mark Twain dock. The helicopters hovering over kicked up significant amounts of wind and made a lot of noise generating a ton of complaints at guest relations.

2844744,0,t1_cnr9s1d,Be aware though that at Universal the lockers are free for the duration of your wait in line.  But at SeaWorld and Busch Gardens they are rather rude about you having to put it in a locker and it does cost money I believe two dollars?  Dont hold me to that one.  When Im out at the parks I bring my camera to Disney and Universal but I leave it at home for the SeaWorld Parks and just use my phone I have a really nice camera phone  But then again I am a local and have passes to all  chains so I frequent them all.  Bottom line DSLR is fine but you will have to pay for a locker at SeaWorld and Busch Gardens unless you leave it with a nonrider.,Themepark,cnrg2ru,2,t5_2r2w2
2845375,0,t3_2sntee,Ive taken an SLR on almost every ride at WDW with a couple of fairly obvious exceptions  Kali River Rapids at AK is a no for me as I have no waterproofing I havent used it at any of WDWs Dcentric attractions and I cant shoot anything meaningful in the level of darkness that Space Mountain and RocknRoller Coaster provide. Im sure you know that there is a no flash policy on dark rides and on any other ride where they ask you not to use flash or external video lighting. Additionally there is a recorded message at the beginning of Carousel of Progress that asks guests not to take images or video of any kind though Ive seen a lot of people violate that.The coasters at WDW like Big Thunder Mountain Seven Dwarfs Mine Train etc. are pretty tame. The only one with a loop is RNR at DHS and its too dark to shoot in there anyway. On the minicoasters Id secure with a wrist strap or neck strap just for safety but Ive shot on all the minicoasters with my DSLR without feeling that it was dangerous and theres no policy against it AFAIK.At Universal there are a lot of rides that dont allow any loose items at all as other commenters have said. Youll have to stow your camera and other loose articles for those rides in one of their free lockers or with a nonrider. This is really a LOT of Universals rides and most of the rides where you can bring loose articles with you are Dcentric and theres not much to shoot unless you have some way to capture images in d. Thats just rides though theres a lot of fun stuff to shoot around the park when youre not on a ride.Ive only been to Sea World a few times and Ive never been to the FL Busch Gardens but Ive brought my DSLR to Sea World at least once. Again you cant use it on rides that dont allow loose articles and you cant use flash in dark attractions. The lockers there are pay to use lockers as other commenters have pointed out. I assume the lockerloose articles policy is similar at Busch and Sea World as theyre owned by the same parent company.I have seen MANY tripods I know you didnt ask about tripods specifically but a park that will let in tripods plainly doesnt have strict policies against camera equipment in general so I use it as an example of that and large camera bags presumably with several lenses and other stuff at Universal and WDW and Ive never seen anyone get hassled unless they use flash in a dark ride and then they are sometimesbut not often enoughadmonished by the ride attendants and additionally they have to contend with me sending stub your toe really hard getting out of the ride vibes at them. I cant recall if Ive seen tripods at Sea World but I havent been hassled for bringing DSLRextra lenses there and I doubt it would be an issue at any of the three unless you made yourself a nuisance with it somehow.I myself have brought upwards of three extra lenses and a camera body and a few accessories to all three and Ive carried a tripod into the Magic Kingdom at least once. It is a drag to deal with and I dont recommend it really unless you really want it for something specific like fireworks shots. Its hard to secure your camera on a tripod in the crowds Ive seen one camera get knocked over in the paradefireworks crowds that was up on a tripod without its owners hands on it to steady it.tldr If you pay attention to when you have to stow it for rides that dont allow loose articles and you dont use flash on dark rides you should be fine.,Themepark,cnrio3h,4,t5_2r2w2

3446434,0,t3_2z1tt4,I went this past September to both parks and it was awesome. Especially both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley.. Hogsmeade has the most rides. Honestly it was so slow when I went that I didnt even need the express pass. I planned to buy a ticket and then see if I needed to get the pass once I was there to see how packed it was. It was so slow that the only ride that even had a line was the Escape From Gringotts which was only about a  min wait. I could pick any ride that I basically wanted to ride and walk right on. Once you enter the parks there are kiosks to buy the express pass inside in case you need it which it would I would suggest doing and I saved some  money.. Definately do Escape From Gringotts. Its the best dark ride Ive ever been on. When I was there I rode it a good  times and took off my D glasses once or twice to see how advanced this ride is. Its truly an engineering feat with how many things go into this ride. Its a bit short but the story is much better than The Forbidden Journey which is just scenes thrown together from the Potter movies. Both Potter rides have the best queues Ive ever been in as well. HIGHLY detailed especially if youve seen the movies. Spiderman Mummy and the Hogwarts Express are also worth it.

As to why it broke and what it would take to get it moving again its to the point that every friend of a friend knows someone in Imagineering or maintenance that has a different story and the truth is probably somewhere in between all of them.

But because of the some trouble with the ride system it was delayed with no exact opening year given. Instead of Hartenhof Aquanura a WETDesign water show premiered in . In the mean time the park invested in dive coaster Baron  which opened in  as well as some other smaller investments and refurbishments of some older attractions and restaurants over the last couple of years.In  when the ride was first announced some concept arts were released. You can see a big difference in the main structure of the building. The building has changed from a big rectangle box to a more multidimensional building with more high towers Keep in mind that the other smaller building in the left corner in the concept art of  is restaurant Polles Keuken which did open in .The location of the ride will be right in the middle of the park where all of the four realms in which the park is divided come together. It will be interesting to see how the parks going to build the ride their while all the big crowds have to use some other way of getting to another realm.The ride system has not been confirmed yet but the park has already said that the guest can choose between  different routes the ridevehicles will take.
