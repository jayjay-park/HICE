9184663,0,t3_560yuk,In the windows store start updating. Then wait and wait and wait until the button play is visible again on that page.    Thats what I did after it started updating a second time and that worked for me. ,Forza_Horizon3,d8g81wa,1,t5_3eju7
9186577,0,t1_d8gfuaj,True. It is reason enough for me to avoid FPV entirely though. I dont want to deal with potentially conflicting information.,Forza_Horizon3,d8ggrvl,1,t5_3eju7
9191844,0,t1_d8h0jx0,Well it was originally on my D Hard Drive and it worked fine got quiet a few races finished but i noticed the load screens were kinda annoying so i uninstalled the game to reinstall it to my OS Drive SSD and it just keeps failing at the end with a error code. Im trying one more time now on the ssd did some changes but if this doesnt work its going back to the Hard Drive. Which also failed to install on yesterday after giving up on the ssd?,Forza_Horizon3,d8h4ti9,1,t5_3eju7
9196966,0,t1_d8hrgew,Horizon was always the arcady version of Motorsports. Any gameplay video from before launch made it pretty obvious. While I agree that Motorsports is better in terms of simulation I think I still prefer Horizon overall. But thats probably because I play Assetto Corsa for simulation racing so Motorsports is not really needed for me anymore.,Forza_Horizon3,d8hs768,1,t5_3eju7
