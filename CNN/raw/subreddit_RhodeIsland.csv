10450916,0,t3_5pmtyh,I have a couple concerns that are not addressed in the article.  . Is this just tuition  not fees? Im not sure how it is now but for me fees were waaaay higher than tuition so Im not sure this helps much. . If the state is paying for all tuition  what stops the college from just raising the tuition price every time the sports director wants a new limo?,RhodeIsland,dcspkmg,12,t5_2rec6

Deport them all.Theres something in this country called laws. If an illegal alien comes here do you think they give a shit about the rule of law?

11206263,0,t3_5zsgof,agreed. people who are heading north will travel in the fast lane and suddenly cut across all four lanes to take either the state house exit or the  exit. on the other side those going south will board from the city up the ramp where the  connecter is. Supposedly they are fixing the backup from the  connecter but those two areas I mentioned seem like they will remain problem areas.

11396828,0,t3_62ktjz,Providence Bagel just opened up on North Main Street in Providence and theyre surprisingly good.  Easily vaulted to the top of my list for a good bagel in the area.For Chinese Sichuan specifically go to Chengdu Taste in Pawtucket.  Most of the menu is standard Americanized Chinese which they do well but they also have a Special Appetizer and Authentic Sichuan Cuisine menus.  Shredded Ginger Duck Mapo Tofu Sauteed pig intestine and all of the Sichuan classics are perfectly done.  Also if you eat there you get Sichuan pickles before the meal and orange slices afterwards.  BYOB taboot.As for pizza if you cant find good pizza youre not looking hard enough.  There are lots of great places suggested in this thread but the thing about pizza in RI is there are a ton of different styles to choose from.
