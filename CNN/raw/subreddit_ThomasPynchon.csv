892732,0,t3_24a6w7,I loved it. Seriously underrated. If it were written by literally anyone else it would have gotten much more acclaim. The problem with Pynchon is that everything he writes will have the words not as good as Gravitys Rainbow in the reviews somewhere. Even if not explicitly stated the sentiment will still be there. But the Thomas Pynchon who wrote Gravitys Rainbow is not the Thomas Pynchon who wrote Bleeding Edge. GR came out over half of his lifetime ago. Hes changed mellowed out. Hes not the highstrung paranoid satirist that he was as a young man.That being said Bleeding Edge is Pynchons love letter to his son. Everyone says its to New York but look at it carefully. The plot of the book is not the Gabriel Ice thing. Its not about how everything changed after . Thats all just typical Pynchonian obfuscation. The real story is about Maxine and her sons how she wants to take care of them but knows that they need to learn to take care of themselves. I guess you could say thats a metaphor for America and New York but I think its much closer to home than that. Jackson is in his s now. Hes growing up. I think Bleeding Edge shows the personal side of Pynchon that weve only really seen in the introduction to Slow Learner. Thats just my take on it though.,ThomasPynchon,ch5raln,3,t5_2skte

2058859,0,t1_ckwxpl5,Huh. I had not seen that photo before . When was that from?It sort of makes sense with Salman Rushdies description as well.gtThomas Pynchon looks exactly like Thomas Pynchon should look said Rushdie. He is tall he wears lumberjack shirts and blue jeans. He has Albert Einstein white hair and Bugs Bunny front teeth.,ThomasPynchon,cl1iy64,1,t5_2skte
2754526,0,t3_2rm26r,A few years ago I read the first part Beyond the Zero and then gave up. Rereading it recently I found I really enjoyed that part and then once I got to the part of the book I hadnt already read I got completely lost again.  Maybe you do just have to read everything twice!,ThomasPynchon,cnh6ewl,2,t5_2skte
3504825,0,t1_cprne3t,Ha apparently The Brady Bunch was his favorite. Also gtOccasionally he came out to visit the Shetzlines in rural Oregon. I remember Pynchon on the horse I had Shetzline says. He looked like Don Quixote. Shetzlines exwife Mary Beal says he mostly stayed up late and watched TV. Kirk Sale remembers his houseguest arguing with his kids over which cartoons to watch.,ThomasPynchon,cprrwko,2,t5_2skte

5116205,0,t1_cv2o7ph,I just got a copy today. Ill start reading it one I finish Franzens new book. The little bit Ive read seems nothing like Pynchon though I do love that because of Pynchon this sort of controversy surrounding a pseudonym can exist.,ThomasPynchon,cv2ozud,2,t5_2skte
