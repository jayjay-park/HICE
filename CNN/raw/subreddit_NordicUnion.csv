3079542,0,t1_coh33cp,So states parliament members need translator to talk with each other for nations policies? Or would all talks happen using english?Then states main language would become english and other languages would fade away little by little.Some sort of standardization would be needed and those would need to be considered before even becoming one state.I think that best way would be to form image of great nordic brotherhood and make people feel that that identity is theirs like We are children of people from north and we have lived together long time fighting each other but now we must unite to face difficulties togetherSecondly we are finnsnorwegiansswedesdanes but first of all we are brotherssomething like that,NordicUnion,coh6xly,1,t5_2sosa
3312304,0,t1_coh6xly,Why not have English as an accepted language during talks? It IS and has BEEN a global language and second language to many for hundreds of years!  I see no languages fading away because of that we are all already speaking the language and learning it in public schools so what is the problem here?,NordicUnion,cp5twpo,1,t5_2sosa
10567704,0,t3_5rb2tk,Personally I would be eager to accept and learn almost any language. My unrealistic preference would probably be an artificial and logical language that incorporates parts from many nordic languages.,NordicUnion,dd5yvx3,2,t5_2sosa
