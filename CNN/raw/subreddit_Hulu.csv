I really dont want that.What Under The Dome did was bad enough...  Trying to ape The Walking Dead model of changing the original source material to make it fresh only works if your changes are for the better against a barebones story.  UTD had a pretty solid story in the book and it got all kinds of fked up when they put it on TV removing all the meth lab storyline removing how dangerous Junior was and basically abandoning the reason for the dome in the first place.UTD couldve been a really solid  season TV show but they dropped the ball.,Hulu,czw3583,1,t5_2qhxb
6941283,0,t1_d12qmjc,I use Netflix and Hulu together. I have done so for the last six years. It is a great way to catch up on a series and then pick up wherever the current episode is.

So what happens this fall when shows come back from summer break? will they remain at the bottom of my watchlist with new episodes and I have to go searching through the whole thing to see where the new ones are ignoring all the falsepositive NEW badges next to shows that have been off the air for years.

11573566,0,t3_64phxk,gt I feel that the commercial breaks ruin the flow of the episodeI feel the complete opposite especially for shows filmed for traditional network broadcasts.Most of those shows are structured in a way to account for the commercial breaks so its very jarring when it comes to the conclusion of an act and then fades out only to fade back in immediately somewhere else.I mean its not like its terrible or anything and Im not saying that everything needs to have the ads put back in it but thats they way those shows are flowed. Youre supposed to bring the audience up put them in suspense let them come down from it over the course of the break and then bring the emotion back up. Its supposed to be a roller coaster not a hill.The thing I hate is that for the few shows they have to show ads for on the commercialfree version they play that ridiculous s This show is not a part of the commercialfree program and will be played with ads before and after the show. JUST PLAY THE FRIGGIN AD AND DONT WASTE MY TIME TELLING ME YOURE GONNA BE PLAYING THE AD!,Hulu,dg7vbkb,2,t5_2qhxb
