4503200,0,t3_39xkm2,Ive promoted people on my crew within  days if theyre the right person for the job.  If you want it ask your manager if you can talk to him for a couple minutes.  Tell him that you want more responsibility and ask what he needs from you to get ready for your next step.Worst case he says theres nothing ready for you and its going to be a while.  Best you get moved up and take on something new.,retail,csya43n,2,t5_2qs9s

10134403,0,t3_5koqil,I think Ill write one more before I take a break. There was this day when our cardstock papers were on sale for  for  so each individual piece of paper was about  cents each. This lady brings up a whole stack of individual cardstock papers. I start ringing them up and some of them are ringing up as .. The thing is that on the sale sign it says REGULAR PRICE  CENTS. EXCLUDES LICENSED AND HOLIDAY CARDSTOCK PAPER. So from the first sentence the paper that was ringing up as . wasnt part of the sale. The papers were holiday cardstock paper also which was NOT PART OF THE SALE. The lady gets all worked up and yells HOLD UP THATS NOT WRITE THE SALE SAYS THIS THE SALE SAYS THAT and Im trying to explain to her but shes not listening and keeps yelling and insisting that shes right about the sale. My coworker standing next to me says the exact same thing Im telling her my manager tells her the exact same thing also. I then try another approach. I ask her did you get these papers in bins that say . and then she replies with NOOOO I grabbed them from the ones that are  cents theres a bunch still there. So I leave the registers real quick run towards the scrapbooking section and scan the aisle. I check for more of the papers I had in my hand that rang up as . but were supposedly from the ones that are  cents and to my surprise sarcasm they were under the . bin. I go back and I just tell her how it is. Then she shoves her hand in my face and yells I DONT WANT IT ANYMORE. And then she scurries away. I call up the next customer who also had cardstock paper. She apologized for the previous customer which kind of lighted my mood up a bit and even said that she understood the sale policy from how I was explaining it. So it was obvious that the previous lady was just being a huge cheap stubborn bitch. The rest of the day I was just done. My shift was over in one hour and I just wanted to get out of the place after that rude bitch with the cardstock who kept insisting that she was right. I hate retail.,retail,dbsimwo,1,t5_2qs9s
