The digitizer connector is the one next to the rear camera if Im not mistaken.It could also just not be sitting down right. iPhone S LCDdigitizer connectors love to pop up and really benefit from having the grey piece of foam moved over from the old LCD or having new pads cut out so the cable plate can keep pressure on the connectors when screwed down.

They are on  meaning they always have their sales mask on taking as much as you can get as fast as you can take advantage of everything always poking for weak spots.

They will make up excuses like I just had a baby Im just going to use this as an alarm clock to get you to pity them. No matter how you explain they will always counter with but this guys so much lower than yours! Please give me something! or insert made up excuse here. Or they pretend to make friends with you first then after they think you are comfortable they go hey please for a friend give me a discount. Then when you do give them a low ass price and you start to do the phone they keep going hey buddy I dont have much time here you see Im a insert sales position here I am very busy so can you hurry it up? when you are just  min into a  hour repair. Then after the repair they will say things like can you take ? when we agreed on  and ask for free stuff. Then if they dont get anything they go Can I talk with the manager or your boss? Finally after it all they go so whats the warranty on this? These customers are the worst.

Sometimes people are going to bring phones in and it simply wont make any sense to pay to get it fixed from a financial standpoint. I find this a lot in the Samsung line of phones because of their pricy oled displays. Some phone we charge more to repair than it costs to go and buy a new phone of the same type. We tell our customers this and let them decide if its worth it. You are a repairman and a salesman you have no reason to be dishonest but at the end of the day youre getting paid to fix phones and make your boss money. Should you tell people they shouldnt get their phones fixed because its too expensive? No. The customer knows full well what their phone is worth to them and you should just let them decide without your input. Many times their phones have sentimental value in pictures or information stored on it that money cannot buy so I think you should just be a statistical informant.

8226041,0,t3_4rxxur,Check out the sidebar. There are other good ones too however I would avoid GoKrazyWireless like the plague even though they advertise here. If you pm me we can talk about suppliers in more detail. I cant say much here because I assume we cant talk about specific suppliers here and I dont want to sound biased. I switch between a few different suppliers for different parts and Id be happy to point you in the right direction. However in terms of eBay I only use them when I have to. Also any non popular parts are safe on eBay. They only counterfeit parts that are common. Truthfully every iPod Classic and Nano part Ive ever bought is from eBay except SSD conversion stuff. My iPod Nano  power button flexes from eBay actually have an Apple logo and Apple part number right on them. Never had a single defect in those ones and Ive done over  of them alone. I also have a bunch of other tips for beginners but its too much to share here. I have a soft spot for beginners because I was once there and I remember what it was like so if youre willing to learn Im willing to teach. Pm me like I said and Ill give you some advice. My top three tips are these though You get what you pay for so buy good parts. Your customers get what they pay for so charge good labor rates and not . I charge  to fix an iPhone  and its an  part and a  LCD to recycle. Trust me its a  phone theyll pay up if its fair.  A lifetime warranty is THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT. You put your name on your work and you guarantee your work. Your warranty is simple. If they take care of their device your part will work correctly. The screen will work. Thats it. No bullshit. If I give you a screen and I say its gonna work dammit its gonna work. And if it doesnt Ill give you another one. And you should ONLY deal with suppliers who feel the same way. Its the only right way to do business. ,mobilerepair,d55t80w,-1,t5_2yb4z
8301065,0,t1_d5eyzca,Based on observation it can be concluded that AMOLEDs are inherently more fragile than LCD. Kinda sucks for people who broke their shiny new Tab S because the display assemblies are easily . iPhone screens being so durable could be partly because of how well Apple makes them flexible digitizers that still work when broken in most cases partly due to how the screen assembly is designedfitted not rigidly adhered to the mid frame and having a frame of its own and partly because theyre LCD. Original Apple LCDs seem to be more durable than most replacements out there and also more durable than most other brands.Im sure most people would rather pay the extra repair costs for a better experience s.I think I was being trolled there The thing is Ive found that the price of AMOLEDs do go down a little bit but then they go back up. This was especially noticeable with the S and Note II displays. Dont know why it could be the supplier Im buying from. Or it could have something to do with supply and demand. The screens are expensive but back in the day they were new phones so people were willing to pay for the repair. Then the phone gets outdatedslowdies eMMC brickbug or something and demand goes down so the price goes down. Then the screens go out of production and the majority of the supply has to rely on remanufactured screens which would get increasingly scarce as more panels get broken.This is just my speculation though.Edit beinggtbuying,mobilerepair,d5f6vwr,1,t5_2yb4z

And yes it is extremely difficult to pull an iPad Air screen off without breaking it the glass is very thin and brittle and usually shatters into fine glass powder that gets everywhere. Fingers clothes EYES.  They probably have a cheap supplier. I know for the minis Id have to put that yellow tape everywhere on the bottom to avoid phantom touching. That could be an issue if the flex is shorting against the frame.  Plus if it has the fingerprint sensor we have to reuse the original and attach it to the screen. Its a real pain in the dick especially if its not done correctly because the screen needs pulled off again to correct the problem. I hate doing iPads.

10812074,0,t3_5umq5j,In scenario   The rep should have explained to the customer after they assumed that the device would still be completely working other than the damaged LCD Well it was working before the drop or damage to the device but there is no way to tell that everything is working  without plugging up a new screen and testing all of the components because they could have been damaged at the same time as the display especially with the bending of the frame. The customer will now know that there is some risk involved. They need to understand that this is a repair and many times things are not guaranteed. Just like on a car you can get rear ended and you think its just your bumper needing replaced but it turns out the exhaust was also punctured creating a huge exhaust leak. So now when the customer comes back in you will be able to explain to them that it is just like you explained before the device could have endured other damages during the drop in this case likely a board fracture. You will now be more easily able to explain that if the damage were caused by you it would have probably died in the repair room. Now youll need to offer them options to turn the bad situation into a good one. If you do board repair offer to attempt to repair the damage if not offer them a good deal on a phone youve got for sale.Scenario   You never should have proceeded with the repair when you noticed the LDI was red. You should have called the customer talked to them about liquid damage and how it works. liquid damage can cause corrosion on the board that allows the connections to still function but once the corrosion and connections are tampered with the device may not be able to make full contact anymore resulting in a non working device. This may or may not be the case here but we just wanted to let you know the risks of the repair before starting. Would you still like to proceed? Now the customer understands that there is damage to their device other than what they originally thought. They chose to proceed with the repair and now the whole flex doesnt seem to function. You can now contact your customer and tell them what happened and what their options are. Now the customer doesnt see you as the asshole who broke their phone they see you as someone trying to help them solve their issues.Im definitely not perfect and Id like to work on my communication and customer satisfaction as well so Id love to hear how other people feel like these situations should be handled.,mobilerepair,ddv6tg4,2,t5_2yb4z

11059877,0,t1_delfauo,When I was swapping the camera I did disconnect the battery. All the swapping was done with no power.After all the parts were replaced and I was about to connect all the cables I made the mistake of first connecting the battery. It was connected for  sec and was the only connection connected. No electrical charge was going to the home button since it wasnt connected.I did stop myself and immediately disconnected the battery.Then after starting back at square one st connected everything else and the power last. So no battery wasnt connected when I was swapping anything. ,mobilerepair,delmarn,1,t5_2yb4z

If you make sure that the touch connector flex clicks on the board like it should and there are no bent pins or debris on any of the connectors then there should be no more ghost touch issues. If the problem is still not solved it may because the bad quality screen. If you need better iphone  screens supplier plz PM me.,mobilerepair,df2tn34,1,t5_2yb4z

11660957,0,t3_666cll,As far as Im aware there are no aftermaket manufactured OLEDs only refurbished ones. I would go for a cheaper one. Worst case you will experience some burned in images in the screen. Judging from the age of this phone I would not trust any Samsung service part out there to not be a refurbished one anyway. Samsung stopped manufacturing OLEDs for the S a long time ago.,mobilerepair,dghs8sc,2,t5_2yb4z
