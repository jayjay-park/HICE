1614746,0,t1_cjink7s,Yeah if you need to look good youre going to have a tough time until you stop growing. For me being a tradesman I can get away with looking like a slob at work no problem. Very rarely do I need to be dressed up for meetings. Youre in a tough spot for sure and youre going to have to spend a pile of money to look good especially while still growing. Thats life.,tallfashionadvice,cjipeow,1,t5_2umpz
