6579891,0,t3_3yz90y,Alec is attracted to her but not much else. Im  sure he actually has feelings for Max. I think the episode Borrowed Time makes this clearest. Alec doesnt make a real move on Asha until after he thinks Max and Logan have found the cure. He also has no qualms about ditching Asha when Max barges in on them even though she doesnt elaborate on why she needs his help. Like he doesnt even blink. In the DVD commentary I think Jose Molina mentions that Asha and Alec dont end up hooking up because they wanted to strengthen the MaxAlecLogan love triangle and leave room for those storylines. Hope that answers your questions!,DarkAngel,czzwxhl,1,t5_2ul6j
