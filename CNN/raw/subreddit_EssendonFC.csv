3602780,0,t3_31mey6,I brought this up with a friend during the Sydney game. Playing the extra number at the stoppage works for us getting a strangle hold on the game and whilst our players are still fresh and scoring quickly. We can quite quickly jump out to a  or  goal lead by half time. But Joey tends to go missing in the second half and as said in the thread Carlisle gets double teamed. We can say all of the time that we need time to develop and just need to play  quarters but the fact is that is difficult to do and puts a lot of pressure onto our forward line. As teams realise this game plan it gets harder for us to take marks in the forward  and as fatigue kicks in the game plan begins to lapse and we end up just bombing it in anyway. If the emphasis is on counter attack and moving the ball quickly then a new focus needs to be built when coming off a stoppage. Play wide and up the line but be precise with the final kick into . I think if we are going to have an extra at the stoppage it needs to be a quick. We have plenty of good inside players but they need to feed it out to blokes who are quick and can kick. Isaac Smith would be ideal. I feel like it is coming together for us and hey it may even just be a thing of getting the game plan consistent for  quarters. But we need to work out a way to slow a game down but be able to ramp it up when necessary. ,EssendonFC,cq2xxzf,2,t5_2upvb

Zach is .More games into kids  Steinberg Kavanagh and OBrien got some really tough AFL exposure today. None won their position but there is potential. Steinberg on Reiwoldt is an education in AFL running.Willingness of the coaching staff to try something different. Hooker forward despite his  goals probably wasnt an overall win for us considering how important he is in the back half but it was a win for him personally. I didnt expect it Im not a fan of it but the coaches tried something a bit out of the box and it reaped some reward.

But he shouldnt be used in a chain of possessions not at the moment at least.
