10711534,0,t3_5t81j5,I love how he mentions guys shouldnt be on scholarships as if his boy Snee wasnt the poster child for that his last  years in the league. Sure competition is a good thing but the reality is that most teams have clear cut starters and hope to have quality depth behind them. You bring in legit competition for either declining vets Cruz or talented but underperforming youth Flowers. You dont expend premium FA  or high end draft capital on positions you have locked down. ,G101SafeHaven,ddktbxr,1,t5_3evpb

11030832,0,t3_5xgr0r,Well after today its quite likely McCaffery doesnt last to  if enough GMs go BPA.  Im telling you Ive watched almost every Stanford game for the past  years and this kid is special. This season when Stanford didnt have a decent QB every defense stacked up to stop McCaffery and even when they controlled him for most of the game he would make a few great plays. He makes plays when there is hardly a hole to slip through. He sets up runs by delaying slowing and then absolutely exploding into the hole. I dont think Ive ever seen a player go from nearstanding to topend speed so quickly. And when he fields a punt or a little screen anything can happen. If we got him hed be a better solution for Eli and our offensive line than ANY tight end or WR. With McCaffery and Perkins defenses would have to respect our running game and that means OBJ Shepard and Receiver X will find plenty of space on the field.,G101SafeHaven,deibip0,2,t5_3evpb

11386257,0,t1_dfmk015,You have way more football knowledge than this stuff on Eli based on hatred which I dont get. Forget all those PFF Stats about clean pockets total garbage!!!! Here is the undeniable reality of last year...ELI HAD  SECONDS TO UNLOAD THE BALL and he was being pressured consistently  by failures at both tackle positionsat that incredible short time window. OBJ never beat anyone deep most of the year because there was no chance of running any double move routes that take  seconds to run. The majority of OBJ big plays were a slant broken wide open by his speed. The coaching staff designed an entire offense around how fast can get the ball out thus  thousand crossing routes for OBJ n company. The Minnesota game the coaches felt we were so overmatched they had the ball coming out in  seconds. Here is the reality of ELI Manning circa the last few years...NONE OF US HAS A CLUE TO HIS ABILITIES...why? because JR has given him OLINE play that makes it impossible to properly judge any performance. The Super Bowl even with the GOAT as a perfect example. First half the Falcons get all kinds of pressure on Brady he cant score points hes rushing passes and throws a pick . Second half Falcons D gets gassed the Pats OLINE gives superior protection and the greatest blown lead in NFL Playoff history disappears in a flash. Brady or Protection...Protection or Brady...which one??? How about the effectiveness of both!!! Its not just the Pats watch any Saints game and look at that offense designed around the deep pass and double moves...you think Flowers plays LT for them???,G101SafeHaven,dfmm2pd,0,t5_3evpb

11720868,0,t1_dgokv8x,Yeah i get all that and dont disagree but then you have a guy like Ahmad Bradshaw who was a th round pick and was a pretty big part of the team while he was here.
