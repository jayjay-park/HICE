11241355,0,t1_df65skf,So when Im having a particularly garbage day I will find three positive things to focus on.  It might be something simple like a cup of coffee or getting all of the lyrics right when singing in the car.  The point is to find the good and stop focusing on what seems to be bad.  I would often try to coax her to do the same but she just couldnt do it.  I get it its probably annoying to have someone like me around sometimes  I once had a fella tell me that not everything is sunshine and rainbows.  I reminded him that rainbows come when it storms... anyway I say all that to point out that she couldnt even find one little positive thing most days. Or it would be a veiled complaint like well I guess there was that banana but it was all bruised.She does not want to be happy or she doesnt want to be self reflective enough to truly participate in her own happiness.Edit fat thumbs ,FriendshipProblems,df66w4n,1,t5_37h1q
