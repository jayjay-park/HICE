9979948,0,t3_5idrr5,I agree with all of this... Id also add when tuts dont show the end product at the beginning of the video. When people are just telling me how to do something and dont explain what Im doing and why Im doing it so I know what itll do in the future yes that can come from experimenting but just opening serum and telling me what numbers to type in isnt helping me shape my own sound. When the teacher has issues with their equipmentDAW just edit your videos.... I dont need sit here and watch you wait for your computer to load Im doing that enough on my end. I really enjoy Upsound Cymatics Sadowick Sonic Academy and am recently enrolled with the deadmau masterclass  all have been phenomenal IMO.,MusicProductionTuts,db8eyx2,2,t5_2x92g
