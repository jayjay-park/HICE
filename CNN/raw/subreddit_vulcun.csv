3529746,0,t3_30o9q2,I like the new approach it provokes a different way of thinking and at the very least more information which is always useful.,vulcun,cpum5h0,1,t5_35qyu

3836043,0,t3_34advk,Personally Im not a big fan of the MVP points because of its irrelevance towards an MVPs skill or impact during a match. Yes defusing a bomb plays a big impact for the CT side but another player could have aced the Ts  at bombsite and defuser still gets MVP. Fantasywise the MVP points are nice but if they are continued to be used reducing MPV points would definitely be a more viable option IMO ,vulcun,cqtjj6u,2,t5_35qyu
3922063,0,t3_356160,It would also be nice if I can sort the live drafts. Like by points or alphabetically by team etc.,vulcun,cr3cnty,2,t5_35qyu
4060615,0,t3_36wlai,Some sort of notification on the Live page for each league that lets you know when a quest is up when there are multiple leagues going on at the same time would definitely be awesome too.,vulcun,crj51ye,1,t5_35qyu
4449894,0,t1_csrke6t,Not working for me either. Tried deleting cookies clearing cache etc. Same issue as people mentioned above the login button doesnt work and before I got logged out by clearing cookiescache I couldnt switch around resultsupcoming etc... I guess its something with the javascript? Every single other website Ive works including sites that heavily use javascript...,vulcun,csrlf1i,1,t5_35qyu

5514179,0,t3_3qljt0,If they do itll be based on how serious the bug is and how much it will affect the website andor its users.,vulcun,cwghjc7,1,t5_35qyu
5519360,0,t3_3qj7fh,Issues with item retrieval are because people have unverified accounts or invalid accounts ie multiple accounts underage etc or because steam has had some issues lately.  The support desk has a ton of requests so dealing with this takes time but everything is legit.  ,vulcun,cwh5ckf,1,t5_35qyu
5641910,0,t3_3sccn0,same issue i hope they adress this because this is totally legal in europe if they do manage to still allow to block other countrys someone else just will make another fantasy and alot of users will leave because they cant enter paid fantasy so they will use another fantasy site because vulcun is not an option anymore. very dissapointed when i saw this PS Please vulcun think about your users.,vulcun,cwwflu5,3,t5_35qyu
5642032,0,t3_3sccn0,Yeah same here. Tried entering free fantasy leagues and still says the same message. In the UK BTW.,vulcun,cwwg5hm,2,t5_35qyu
5734602,0,t3_3tojb5,I am pretty sure they are smart enough to create a system where it is REALLY hard to complete an item even if it seems easy.I wouldnt say it is impossible but the chances are really really low on completing by wathcing streams only.,vulcun,cx7xm7r,4,t5_35qyu
5750831,0,t3_3tt2dc,I know Im late but yes you will get the points. You are basically drafting Origens mid rather than the specific player. They just put the player they think will be playing.,vulcun,cx9y2fl,1,t5_35qyu
