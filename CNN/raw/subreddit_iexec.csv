When you design a distributed application on Ethereum you want to keep in mind some parts must be on the main chain smart contracts then you can use Swarm or IPFS for storage and iExec for computation resources.In our demo application which is available at this url btw  there are  Ethereum transactions  one to launch the job and another one to make the result available. Of course gas needs to be paid for both transactions.There will be an API to make integration easy. Feel very free to ask about details here.,iexec,df9agv7,3,t5_3hex5
