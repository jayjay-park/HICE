785564,0,t3_233fbm,Ive ridden both. The ONE has been my daily rider for the past  seasons aus I wouldnt look back. First ride on that board I landed a few new tricks and you get more pop with less effort so you can ride harder for longer. I love it the boots will only last about  seasons though if you ride  times a week then again in the US I dont know how long your seasons are. Good luck with it mate.,Wake,cgtkmgs,2,t5_2r8ty

1270661,0,t1_cic8hr0,Definitely just focus on the pop then once you launch grab the handle with your back arm and that should start to pull you around and then use your head to lead your body for the rest of the spin and then grab on to the handle with your front arm again and that should finish off the spin. Dont really know if that helps too much haha but thats the way i think when im trying them ,Wake,cickeaj,2,t5_2r8ty

1608081,0,t3_2cpon7,If you have surf gate try filling both sides and then using the surf gate only to switch sides. If you have a trim plate as opposed to a wake plate you should have it trimmed all the way up. Taking weight out of the front will make your wake taller and shorter. Adding weight to the Starboard side if your surfing on the port side will help sink the boat down in the water but using too much will stop the boat from listing to the side you need it. I usually use about  percent on the opposite side Im surfing on.,Wake,cjhv6x2,1,t5_2r8ty

3970126,0,t1_cr8swot,gt do you get a similar responseNever been on a ski lift so I dont know the assumption youre trying to make but at this cable park the better riders are helpful supportive encouraging and make those of us who are learning feel welcome.Plus if someone falls it frees up a rope.  People waiting on line like that.So if your presumption is that other people here are smug arrogant and pompous then no.  But this is Georgia.  Might be a Southern thing.,Wake,cr8tsu8,2,t5_2r8ty

4844837,0,t1_cu54s52,Bulky expensive often wont release if you have a hard fall on a boat its just one more thing getting in the way and it doesnt really have any useful advantage over traditional bindings aside from a few circumstances.  Those being. At a park or winch spot where youre getting in and out of your bindings repeatedly and you want the extra convenience of having boots to walk around in between sets.  .  You and a buddy share a board but have  different foot sizes and you both want a closed toe.. You care about having an adjustable highback.Ive been selling wake gear for  years and in that time I have sold maybe  sets of Systems  of which went to kiteboarders.  If there were more cable parks around here it might be a different story though.,Wake,cu587z8,1,t5_2r8ty

8149521,0,t3_4qv31t,Also regarding surf boards I bought a larger board and it works easy for surfing its a liquid force I dont use it much because we mainly wakeboard. What boat are you riding behind? If you have a big enough wake you can afford to go shorter but the size can not always but its possible dictate which friends it will hold up. Im not very good at wakesurfing so my area of expertise is wakeboarding I only know stuff the I hear and read from friends about surf. ,Wake,d4w8ke8,1,t5_2r8ty
