365893,0,t1_cfiarma,When you try to play the video through reddit it starts your playlist. People have to click through to view the intended video. Also while I have your attention are you able to group in DeadZ yet? I played it when it was free but not since youve had to pay. What changes have been made to the game? How many maps are available?,TheWarZ,cfioun2,3,t5_2ujwe
411547,0,t3_1ysmn5,At a rate of  patches a month yes. Vehicles were just added to the main maps along with a few other major things.,TheWarZ,cfnf8j0,1,t5_2ujwe

807087,0,t3_23dgxb,Why is this the death of WarZ? The game is not popular atleast amongst the majority of the internet. There and will be a ton of zombie survival games in the market so I dont think that HZ will be the death of it. ,TheWarZ,cgw0qbw,6,t5_2ujwe

1276644,0,t1_cicsy86,Yeah and the marketplace prices are a joke I mean its quite hard to collect money as  in  zombies drops money which ranges from  to  zombie dollars with the very rare occasional k drop of which I might had  or  from the about  zombies I killed between my  characters. And then basic supplies like food and drinks cost about a  ammo costs a fortune as well as backpacks so youre always needing to collect stuff and every time you had a good loot run youre probably going to be killed by some jerkwad.,TheWarZ,cid8n7l,-1,t5_2ujwe

10272444,0,t3_5mxcgf,Pretty sure there are only  usable cars all purchasable in the market tab. pretty expensive stuff though and I read that they are only usable on private servers and new account servers. could be wrong I started up again recently myself.,TheWarZ,dc8frob,1,t5_2ujwe
