7240050,0,t3_4ekvyo,I used Tianeptine Sodium from when Powder city was selling it and it worked great! Didnt last long but that  hour it did on my mood helped. Suflate version takes longer to kick in the effects are less pronounced and more drawn out or what from I heard.Just letting you know the T does work esp the powder variant. I also began trying etizest and they are useful and fun to take. ,Tianeptine,d21532a,1,t5_328b6

9172492,0,t1_d8cx40u,No Im not even talking shooting it up I just mean its not hard to fall into a pattern of abuse with a redose impulse comparable to a stimulant drug like say cocaine due to its dopaminergic effects and short half life.To stress again and again do not replace Kratom with tianeptineAlso since its a French company that makes it and stopped giving a shit I really dont see why the FDA would even bother approving it as I am not entirely sure there are any buyers for the copywrite or iirc it expired so maybe theres generics?Idk but like with Kratom this treats a WIDE spectrum of things including but probably not limited to anxiety PTSD depression ADHD chronic pain and so on. Thats a whole cabinet full of drugs and as we all know its more profitable to sell  drugs than one when you could prescribe  different drugs for the symptoms then prescribe  more for the side effects.We need to remove profit incentive from medicine. We need to stop letting these guys treat the medical establishment like its seem seedy street corner where they get to pretend to be respectable in their suits and titles while doing the same or even worse shit.,Tianeptine,d8eojet,1,t5_328b6
9213862,0,t3_566ig1,Wow that sounds very very promising. I suspect I might have fibro hope not but theres something definitely wrong with my body. Just ordered some sodium. If it works as well as it does for you Ill stock up on sulphate lots of sulphate.Whatever I have I only feel normal at night time or any time I was awake for a prolonged amount of time.,Tianeptine,d8jxbsd,1,t5_328b6
9989172,0,t1_db8r86r,i basically have to agree. on occasion  though  a small dose of mg does actually work like mg of codeine. Dont ask my why but sometimes it happens.,Tianeptine,db9m7i7,1,t5_328b6
10106515,0,t1_dbn6es1,What he said.Also youre a complete fucking idiot OP. Why would you do that? Youre already abusing the shit out of multiple things that would diminish the effects. As a polydrug abuser no this isnt for you.And to answer your question you cant mix tianeptine with other opis. Im not sure how it works with multiple drugs or the specifics of it like binding affinity however I suspect the binding affinity is fairly weak relative to other drugs.The only way youre going to get any recreational effects would be to stop taking tramadol and heroin. Idk how gabapentin mixes but people whove gotten addicted report that it works quite well for helping one get off the stuff. And on that note you should be aware that Tia addiction is fucking hellish. Ive never seen any opi like it where your tolerance skyrockets that fast. It has a wicked short half life meaning you have to take it  times a day just to not be in withdrawal. It can be used safely and effectively at prescribed dosages but not if you abuse it. The thing is this is an antidepressant not a narcotic meaning to successfully abuse it youre going to wind up affecting a wide array of other systems. That also means that you cant just use Kratom or burprenorphine to get off nor can you escalate to a several grams a day habit and just switch to an opi at no ill effect the way actual opioids work. Instead you will manage the opi effects while feeling like utter shit .And to clarify the abusive dosages start around mg of sodium. Sulfate basically doesnt really work and frankly I am amazed you even felt anything at all. For someone with high tolerance who is Tia naive youre probably going to need about mg as your starter dose. Now this cannot be emphasized enough those who abuse it will find themselves craving more all the time like a crack addict continually redosing every  hours which clearly will wreck your shit after awhile. This means that if you stupidly go chasing that dragon within a matter of days youll find yourself taking multiple times as much. People whove started at mg and keep using till the batch is gone will find themselves taking  mg at a time just to get the same effects by the end of the week. That is the point at which youre doing like mg capsules times a day within a just a couple of months and desperately requiring it just to function and as Im sure you can imagine a  gram a day habit is not cheap. Typically those who abuse it find after just a weeks worth of abuse when they ran out they got the sniffles maybe felt hot and cold flashes feel chilled to the bone goose bumps muscle tension and insomnia. Insomnia is by far its worst aspect imho because then youre stuck suffering awake even after popping shitloads of benadryl or benzos or whatever. And then should you ever actually fall asleep rather than kicking around nonstop for hours and hours and God mercifully grants you some sleep youre just going to wake up two hours later probably feeling even more awful than before.For some people it does indeed feel extremely similar to oxycodone however I would much much rather just abuse oxy instead to get high because it lasts longer tolerance doesnt seem to climb as much and frankly its just all around nice well that or hydrocodone just because hydro has more chill factor as opposed to speediness of oxy and tianeptine. For some individuals whove grown jaded and weary it can be quite the extravagance to actually get the kind of high you havent actually felt like in years. But it really just isnt worth it.You in particular I would strongly advice against ever ordering it again. You dont have that kind of discipline and mental willpower to deal with this drug. It has far greater redosing urges than just about any of the  other drugs I have tried in that category and wildly high tolerance curve. The kinds of people who have actually managed to use and abuse real narcotics in the past seem to fall for tia and that includes me. I have used tramadol oxy dillies pretty much anything but opi RCs methadone demerol and oxymorphone without ever getting addicted which clearly makes people arrogant enough they start dropping precautions but it was Tia that finally got me and made me into a junkie. Getting off the crap was truly one of the most nightmarish things thats happened to me. As best I can see you cant drop more than  grams without being addicted and even abusing those  grams is extremely chancey. But because of the fact youre already addicted to drugs and have had raging poly drug addictions my faith in you taking the stuff is about zero. Its gotta be like a one time type of scenario or chipping if you want to be a dumbass which you already are because youve been taking heroin. So no it probably isnt for you. That being stated Im proud of you for having kicked alprazolam which is something I thankfully have never experienced as benzo addiction seems one of the worst ones possible.So just to answer your question in hopes you delete thisim fucking serious you need to delete this thread after reading my post I dont actually know what your starting dose would be. If you got those kinds of effects from sulfate then mg sodium should be a pretty relaxing slightly euphoric experience. Odds are youre going to need about mg to get the kinds of effects you are looking for.But of course you are also taking not just any old regular opi but the only one that also acts as an SSRI which clearly means you have to be even more careful if youre mixing it with a tricyclic antidepressant. Tbh I definitely would not if I were you as youre already hitting multiple neural systems and the addition of a tricyclic AD is probably going to give you some pretty nasty or unknown side effects. So keep in mind you are not just dosing high on opioid effects you are dealing with dopamine serotonin AMPA and I forget what else.Now please delete your thread kthnx,Tianeptine,dbow2cw,4,t5_328b6
10137601,0,t1_dbswe8w,You paid how much for it and over what timespan?I dont get why people take more than  say mg per day.IMO the effects peak around that amount and taking more mostly increases side effects like a slight vertigo. grams a day? That is just absurd.,Tianeptine,dbsxm91,0,t5_328b6

10217924,0,t3_5j2fbe,Anyway looks like youll just have to find a dose that works for you without causing your HPPD to act up. Its interesting that tianeptine does that too you though.

10279074,0,t3_5ms8gp,Thought Id circle back and give feedback as promised. Shipping was slightly delayed but he jumped right on it when I asked about it. Quality is good. Im not a heavy user at all but I had intentionally run out for a few weeks. A  mg dose brought back that familiar happy feeling. Tastes like tianeptine. No complaints. It comes in a little sealed bag with no desiccant so make sure you have those desiccant bags on hand to keep it from clumping. All in all if Im going to order tianeptine again I would be comfortable ordering from him again. ,Tianeptine,dc96tra,1,t5_328b6

10372685,0,t3_5og337,Well to answer my own question I ended up testing it out. First just tasted that was as per usual then I tried a small amount out and can confirm that the product is on par with that of newmind. The packaging leaves a little to be desired and it was more expensive than newmind but I was able to use amazon pay. So I guess in case anyone else is wondering nootropics syndicate seems legit to me. ,Tianeptine,dcjt0xz,2,t5_328b6

10810014,0,t3_5ul6h1,It depends on how much you are taking a day when you jump off. At one gram a day you are definitely going to be feeling rough. Like at my worst back in the glory days i was at g ish a day. Of sodium. Now also to note is that sulfate is around  times weaker dose wise. So it wont be as bad as if you were taking sodium. My advice? read some recent posts on advice ive given its all legal things you can buy to help through this. For you though? I recommend with this tub order you  count capsules from Noot Dep. after your tub runs out take like  in the morning and  at night. This will be just enough to keep the worst of the mental withdrawal at bay. You could take less or more capsules just take barely what you need tho. And just taper down to  in morning and  at night and you are free man ,Tianeptine,dduz5y9,1,t5_328b6
10841834,0,t3_5uyxxy,Yeah there are a lot of very highdose users here  you may want to check out rnootropics also.Still its good to have a place to talk about stablon specifically.

10933421,0,t1_de7jgje,I noticed the same thing. I was suddenly drinking two pots of coffee every day instead of my usual two or three cups. This only persisted for a few days though before my coffee consumption returned to normal. It seems to be the only thing Ive ever really found which acts as a partial substitute for tianeptine as opposed to something which is taken to make the withdrawal less noticeable. I wonder what modafinils effects would be.,Tianeptine,de7peov,1,t5_328b6

10992540,0,t1_dedxq20,I prefer FA over Sulphate. Sodium was my favorite my history lead me to grow addicted to such a fastacting substance like the Sodium but I only really preferred that one for recreational reasons. The thing Im liking about the FA is that I really only need to dose  times or so a day like you say every  hours. The Sodium was way too often at every two hours or even less.  Regarding the FA I fear Im taking rather large dosages but it has helped eliminate any withdrawal effects from the Sodium. Unfortunately my measurement system isnt effective at all. I was measuring my dosages per heaping white scoop from NM which I measured once as . gr if it was heaping enough. So I weaned myself down from four scoops to three scoops for the longest time then about two months ago it was two scoop dosages and then about a week before I quit I was taking one scoop dosages. ,Tianeptine,dedyx19,1,t5_328b6

11599429,0,t1_dgai3q0,Well when I started looking into using a lot of the information I had read said it was designed for people with PTSD and opioid addiction. I also think that the reason I didnt get any kind of euphoria was the fact that I was using opioids so long. Regardless if you have used opioids or notthe drug will cause a physical manifestation. It may take more timebut it will happen. France where the drug was first synthesis . Just made it illegal because its so addictive. But the one thing I was looking for other than it had to workwas to not reach a euphoric state. I had that with methadone. I just didnt like the price of it and that there is no doubt of health risks it causes. My experience may be completely different from yours or others. There are so many variables brain chemistries physiological and personality differences. All of which play a role in how we respond to different substances .,Tianeptine,dgasy9b,2,t5_328b6
