4623827,0,t1_ctde849,Sorry dudes! My mate isnt really up for meeting Internet strangers. uparanoidwarpig has my number though so if anyone wants to text me we can possibly meet during the intermission or something. Would be great to meet irl especially as I dont live in Southampton so I rarely make it to a home match. Probably one of my only chances to meet you guys! ,SaintsFCLadsOnTour,ctdeobw,1,t5_38a7z
