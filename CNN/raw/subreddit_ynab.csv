352142,0,t3_1y4ddm,The key to YNAB is to give every dollar you have available a job until your next pay. Budget for only the billsitems you need to pay or buy until your next pay cheque. For example if your phone bill isnt due until the st dont bother entering it into YNAB until after you get paid and have available funds for it. The YNAB website actually has some great tutorial videos and walkthroughs that I found really helpful when trying to wrap my head around this. ,ynab,cfh9mfo,3,t5_2vqaa
650814,0,t1_cge8lmv,Yes sir! I am halfway through Allen Carrs book so soon is pretty much now.Totally understandable about the credit cards.  I try pay it off a little at a time because it doesnt hurt my budget too much doing it that way.  Especially because I have a lot to pay for this month that I need to find money to do so.  I have never missed a payment on any of my bills and always pay more that is owed  I thought that was pretty good!Youre right about the buffer  and I never thought about just using the extra money as a buffer and not contribute it to my savings.  After this month Ill have reached my  goal so that seams logical.  You just took a LOT of stress and reduced it by half and I thank you for that!When I was apartment hunting I was thinking the same thing.  This is a pretty decent setup though.  I pay  a month for everything except cable.  I dont have an electric water heat etc. bill to worry about and personally that is worth the  from my perspective.  Is this a crazy way of thinking?My car insurance is through American Commerce.  I have no idea why to be honest.  My mom helped me set it up because at this point last year I didnt have a single clue regarding doing any of this on my own.  Now that I think Ive gotten the hang of it looking into other car insurance options isnt a bad idea.Thank you for all of the recommendations and advice!,ynab,cge8x4b,3,t5_2vqaa

829887,0,t3_23n2qg,I went into it in a similar fashion. Just bite the bullet and classify that as preYNAB debt. I have  credit cards in YNAB and most went in with some debt. Of course I dont carry balances and it hurt my pride but I didnt see a better way. I recommend budgeting the full amount on each in your starter month to cover the preYNAB debt and just forget about it. After that initial issue its great for those of us that rack up loads of credit card spending for points. I manufacture spend like crazy and its great in that regard. ,ynab,cgylyum,7,t5_2vqaa

964577,0,t3_254w10,My suggestionCreate one master category for the shared expenses. Budget for how much you are going to spend on those categories in the next month. Now calculate  and  of that master categorys budgeted total which is easy. Have him deposit the  recorded as income for next month and you deposit the  as income for next month or as a transfer from one of your nonshared accounts if its also in YNAB.To prevent problems with running low you could each deposit  amp  in order to establish a buffer in the shared account.So basically each month you both make a proportional deposit to the shared account based on what youre going to be spending. Then just spend from the shared accounts as needed without having to worry about dividing up individual transactions.Transactions in YNAB should accurately represent what was done in the real world and account balances and registers should be completely accurate. Dont play with the truth to make things fit your plans.,ynab,chdxjmv,2,t5_2vqaa
969237,0,t1_chefohh,Exactly. Those of us that get paid every  weeks have  three paycheck months so if you keep going for several months youll eventually build up your buffer and roll into the next month.

1217346,0,t3_280xuz,For my husbands reimbursable expenses I do this Category Hubbys Work  Reimbursable everything goes to that regardless which card he spent it on. Then I turn the arrow to the right to have that category balance roll over to the next month and not influence the rest of the budget. When he receives a expense check I categorize it as an inflow to Hubbys Work Reimbursable instead of doing it as an income into my bank account. I then set up each of my credit cards to pay the statement not account balance in full when due. That way Im never paying interest but we also arent paying in advance for reimbursable expenses that he hasnt received money for yet.,ynab,ci6kiz1,3,t5_2vqaa

1330864,0,t1_cij3ovn,Thats how its intended to work.  You have the total amount of money that you can budget and youre just divvying it out across all the places you expect to need money in the future.  So in June if you know  has to go to your student loans you apply it in June and itll just sit in the student loan bucket until you spend it or you pull the money out of the budget.  It will roll over month to month. As an example I pay my  phone bill around the th every month.  So I have to apply  from my end of the month paycheck so I have  sitting in the budget at the end of the month then apply the next  when the next paycheck rolls around at the beginning of the month.  Then I pay it on the th and it drops to . in my budget.  Then I get paid again at the end of the month add . and it rolls over to the next month.It makes things easy in the long run.  If you know that you need to pull  out of every paycheck whenever you get paid put your paycheck into your income and apply  to the student loans budget.  Then you will be sure that you have the money you need for your loans because its applied and you can budget out the rest as needed elsewhere.,ynab,cijc7zt,1,t5_2vqaa

Have just one vacation category if you only want a generic label for your vacation plans. Or have one category for saving up for that Xmas trip one for skiing in Feb another for camping next summer and yet another for impulsive travel spending. See?

That is rolling with the punch.  You knew when you purchased it that you would be going overbudget on that category.  You know you can roll with it by moving money from another category the down payment.  The purpose is to think about it  you think you got a good deal on the tv and can use the month you were going to save to rebuild the down payment fund.  So unless you were planning on buying a house in the next  months there is little downside.  Because you had the information at hand you were able to make an informed choice.As another example I have several saving categories new computer some vacations etc..  If tomorrow I see a great deal on airfare for a vacation I would but it even if I hadnt assigned enough money yet.  I would just move some money from computer to vacation.

My budget has a Spending Money subcategory to track stuff that doesnt really fit anywhere else movie rentals postage haircuts for the kids etc. as well as each of us having Allowance categories for our own personal expenses so budgeting haircuts into one of those categories probably makes sense.  FWIW I zero out Spending Money at the end of the month while I let our personal categories to roll over  nobody wants to lose their money! Outflows only happen when you actually spend the money.

However thinking of your  month buffer as ALSO an emergency fund will save you from financial ruin if you lose your job...that is true for anyone with a buffer.  My issue is with people thinking their  month buffer with no separate emergency fund IS their emergency fund for unforeseen issues like car repairs medical bills etc.  Im pretty sure were in agreement with each other.

Its an entirely different thing to actually take the next step and arm yourself with knowledge that will allow you to succeed. You have to acknowledge the problem accept the help and execute the plan.My wife and I went into this last week with the knowledge that while both earn a good paycheck we are not managing these dollars effectively. Were not suffering by any means...I dont want to diminish the true struggles of some of you out there. We just know that we can do better for ourselves and our son. So we acknowledge the problem.Immerse yourselves in the free education ynab is offering. Whether its from this subreddit which is extremely supportive and informative the live videos offered pretty much daily with a chance to win a copy of the software or the archived videos on youtube or vimeo. Its not something youll understand overnight. Ive asked questions Ive had troubles with transactions etc. I dont think Ill be in the clear next month or the month after.

The primary problem with using YNAB like this is that you cant trust your categories to ensure that your spending doesnt put you into debt either by putting more on the CC than you can pay off or going into overdraft.  Now thats a big problem for a lot of people trying to get their financial house in order and learn new spending habits.    In your case though it sounds like you have some control over what you earn and you want the software to help you make both spending and earning decisions.

As you start to spend in the category it fills up from left to right. It will be half full when youve spent  of your budget in that category.

I follow more the put it all into rent first route but there is nothing wrong with splitting it in half either. The downside there though is that you are sort of forecasting that your next paycheck will be enough to cover your rent. If for some reason you didnt receive that paycheck you would have to reallocate your budget to cover rent. And then you would probably go into panic mode. If rent isnt due until after you get the second paycheck and you know youll be spending  dollars on food between now and your next paycheck then you definitely would want to split rent up because you wont have enough money to cover what your money needs to do before you get paid again if you put it all in rent. So you could allocate  towards rent and  towards food or any other combination. ,ynab,cvj0y4k,1,t5_2vqaa

That is with us cooking meals almost every night and having leftovers or large meal prep items for lunch i think the biggest thing is that we buy something dont use it and it goes bad ... esp true for veggies. not sure if that is an issue for you but what we try to do is have a couple big trips for meats and other nonperishable or slightly longer lasting goods a month and then pickup veggies and other specific things for recipes x a week so we use them and then buy more. vegan diet definitely isnt cheap either so i dont think your budget is  completely unreasonable but could probably be cut back a little bit ... sometimes its just not worth it though and that all depends on the individual. just remember not to compare yourself to others in terms of your spending habits go look on rfrugal and if you lived like them you would be eating cabbage and lentils every meal and IMO thats no way to live ,ynab,cvsh73j,2,t5_2vqaa

6123904,0,t3_3zf16y,I did a full migration from YNAB did have to fix one category because of spending on a CC and it worked well.  At first I thought I would dislike the one month thing but its not so bad.  The little sidebar on the right for a category shows me everything I looked at anyhow.  If you asked me though I do prefer to pick the months I want to see.  At a glance its nice but not a deal killer.I really enjoy the color codinggoal feature.  Some of those things I would just keep track of in my head and the color coding of goals does that for me.  I enjoy that a lot.  As a person who also logs into  different banks every day to download transactions via a .QIF file being able to just hit the import button and the software makes the connection for me is very nice though I still have security concerns but the convenience outweighs them.  Couple of things I would like to see  Resize columns be able to minimize split transactions so I dont see every category under it by default and be able to see more information when approving transactions.

6144562,0,t1_cyo1xgf,You are argueing the use of YNAB.  I have been using YNAB for  years and love it just as much as you.  But when a company changes its core business model to subscription based its naive to think it wont piss off its long time users.  New users wont be upset cause ignorance is bliss.  If I were a new user I would be happy to pay the subscription.   years ago I paid  dollars for YNAB.  The new pricing model that would have been . over  years.  Is YNAB worth .? yes. But I have a right to be upset. Maybe YNAB as a company had to do it.  They just werent making enough money.  Maybe a consultant came in and said listen change your business model to SaaS and make more money  Ever watch SharkTank? They love to know about subscription rate customer retention.  Thats ok a company has a right to make money it needs to.  But dont get pissy at me cause im mad that I know have to pay for something that use to be free and in my eyes isnt fully baked. With all that said I will probably move to the subscription based model once they introduce a feature I think will be worth it.  Like Apple PayAndroid Pay integration.  A purchase with Android pay automatically creates and entry into YNAB.  Now thats a feature worth paying for. ,ynab,cyo2lsk,3,t5_2vqaa

It could all be in one account or split among many its an arbitrary way of categorizing the money.If you actually need to access a large chunk of your Emergency Fund then thats when you would benefit from keeping it in a single chosen account for simplicityease of access.,ynab,cyo4bjm,1,t5_2vqaa

6154056,0,t3_3zuede,I think this is pretty accurate.  Id say Im around  adherence and the move to a system that requires near  adherence or nothing makes the software less appealing to me.  The YNAB system is amazing but Im not living paychecktopaycheck.  I am fully buffered or whatever the new term is and I dont need the application to hold my hand while I follow the method religiously.  Does that mean I get no value from YNAB?  Absolutely not.  Many aspects of the YNAB methodology are still really really useful and I use them to adjust my financial thinking on a daily basis as well as using the YNAB software on a daily basis.  Its a glorified spreadsheet but it just works.  Adding transactions is easy.  Transfers are easy.  Reconciling is easy.  Creating a budget is easy.  Tracking assets and net worth and how much I owe on my credit card and so many other uses are just easy.  It all works together extremely well even if some of it wasnt originally intended to be used that way.  Hooray for flexibility.  The new version though views all that as a bad thing and doesnt even give you the option even if you felt like you were a big boy and could handle it.  I cant use it like this but apparently YNAB is fine with alienating all their existing users that werent using the YNAB system  as YNAB said was acceptable today.  It really is all or nothing now and damn the noners that were still getting a lot out of the application and YNAB method they werent true believers anyway and shouldnt have any input in the direction of YNAB or be able to gain any benefits from the system andor software...This is far from my only issue with the switch but its the part thats relevant to the post you made.  Im also really tired and rambling...  Long story short even though Im not following the YNAB process religiously  I still gain a lot from it.  The method and the software have significantly changed how I view and deal with finances.  Ultimately that is YNABs goal but now I feel like they only care about that if they hold your hand the entire way.  ,ynab,cyp5hf7,32,t5_2vqaa

If your debt is a credit card that youre still using theres a specific way to handle that and the video lays it out well  around the  mark especially. If its another kind of debt Id recommend you set that up as an offbudget account instead. That way you can track the balance but it wont affect your budget. You should still of course have a category or multiple categories for debt repayment that youll pay toward your debts.

Hope they put something like this in.Should include future transactions too. As a grey extension to the main bar. Or rather than extending the bar the grey future transaction should be placed as a chunk such that its right side would be at the planned date. It should then extends to the left accordingly. The space left between the main bar of the already happened spendings and the grey future spending bar will show you how much money you have until the planned transaction hits. If the grey bar is too long and hits the main bar just extend it further to the right.,ynab,cyv7mob,4,t5_2vqaa

6299156,0,t3_41v1np,I put interests charges in the interest category. You transfer money as usual to pay your credit card no category because you cant. Its really more in budgeting where you could go two ways. You could budget to cover the interest the orange circle will disappear the Available amount will set to  and your credit card Available will show the amount of money you budgeted that youre supposed to send to your credit card or you could just budget into your credit card category and at the end of the month the interest fee will become part of your debt.

6318092,0,t3_420vgz,I think thats where a lot of the issues have arisen the YNAB method works well and the new method doesnt seem to add a lot of value.  Age of Money as a metric is flawed doesnt really provide any value and feels more like gamification.  It doesnt give people an understandable tangible goal to shoot for like Live on Lasts Month Income did.  My girlfriend was asking about the new version and I was trying to explain what it was to her.  Between me Jesses multiple blog posts on the subject and etc she was still no clearer in the end and said It doesnt seem to make any sense.I love YNAB Ive saved a ton of money with it and Im willing to meet them halfway but there just hasnt been a lot of sensible explanation on the methodology and usability changes.  Its been more like we think this works better for new users or were doing it this way from now on.  I dont think they give users enough credit and havent been as receptive to feedback as in the past.But that aside I cant complain about past performance.  I paid off my car loan in less than a year and recently hit six figure savings since I started with it.  I paid  for YNAB and I would gladly pay more in the future.  I just hope they dont lose their focus on what makes it work for people.,ynab,cz7sosx,2,t5_2vqaa
6353465,0,t1_czbrct7,In a nutshell if you pay the bill in month A the expense is in month A and you should budget for that.Say you get paid on the th of month A you have a bill on the th for X so you budget X dollars to that. Now imagine you also have another bill on the th of month B. You are not going to be paid again before that bill so your paycheck in month A also needs to cover this and should this should be budgeted for. When your paycheck for month B comes in you repeat the process until youre buffered then you have already budgeted for this with last months paycheck  Basically YNAB focuses more on the value of the expense rather than the time it covers ,ynab,czbth81,0,t5_2vqaa

6404889,0,t3_43chiz,gtDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how I could manage this? How are you guys storing your longterm budget plans and seeing where your spendings running a little over on some categories? How are you making sure you dont accidentally reallocate from a category thats saving up for a big future expense?For big expenses I use goals. I set the amount I need by a set date and  it tells me how much I should allocate each month. When I get money I can simply click the yellow numbers and press underfunded and it adds the amount needed. I use the same for rent savings phone bill and regular payments only they have a monthly funding goal. I added  to rent to have a rent buffer. Whatever is left I can spend on discretionary things.gtIf I add  to one goal theres no mechanism to indicate that I should find that  from somewhere else or even check whether my monthly goal obligations actually exceed my income. Its also not displayed to me when if Im reallocating from a category that is just sitting on its goal ie that allocating from this category will cause it to be underfunded so Im just moving a problem around in the budget not actually solving it. And there isnt a goal for only budget this muchie it doesnt help me detect overspending.I dont understand this. First of all only budget money you have. Then when you spend it gets added to the post if you spend more than you budgeted and you have you will have a red or a yellow negative number on that post indicating overspending by cash or credit respecitvely. If you move money from a post funded to its goal it will turn yellow. You can also see goal target at the sidebar indicating how much needs to be budgeted to reach the goal. You can even click it to automagically add the right amount.gtAnd does anyone else find it really frustrating that you can only see one month at a time? I really prefer to see what happened last month when budgeting this month.When I click groceries I can see what happened last month what I spend on average and so on. Is that what you are looking for? gtI asked the YNAB help line and their response was that I shouldnt be comparing my planned budget with my actual spending in this way or even retain a planned budget at all because this information isnt helpful which I think is absurd. Planning ahead for future expenses isnt helpful? My planned budget is what I know my money needs to do to account for confirmed expenses in the future my actual spend is what it just did and clearly I need to adjust next months budget by any discrepancy thereBut it does this. All yearly expenses add them as their own post car insurance whatever and then make a goal. Every month you can see how much you need to allocate to reach the goal. ,ynab,czho5kg,1,t5_2vqaa

6528912,0,t1_czudoew,I would  suggest going down the house remodel route.  years away means you have plenty of time to save for it and it means you guys can be self sufficient rather than relying on family to provide for you guys. The hardest part would be getting motivated to save for something that far in advance but I think if you take an estimated cost say   hah I have no clue how much it would be! then over  years that is   a year  a month. Looking at your numbers unless you live somewhere with an obscene cost of living you could quite easily cut  from your shopping and massages categories each and  from food. So now the question is just would your wife prefer a house remodel or to eat out a lot? YNAB is more about spending in line with priorities than not spending at all so if the answer is no she doesnt actually want that remodel that much she would prefer the eating out then maybe there is no need to get her on board but if she would rather the big house remodel then you might be able to use that as an incentive to get her involved.,ynab,czun3ex,3,t5_2vqaa

If youre worried about how much youre spending on toothpaste maybe.A concrete example for me is that while I can get beer and wine at the grocery store when I do I try to split that out from Groceries to Alcohol and Bars because I am interested in controlling or at least monitoring how much I spend on wine and beer and going out for drinks.See,ynab,czwkr8j,9,t5_2vqaa

6637620,0,t1_d00yiyz,In YNAB  this wasnt a problem  the card was just another bucket of money and YNAB only cared about the total not which bucket the money was in.In nYNAB credit cards are super weird. Theyre listed as onbudget accounts and when you transfer money to them you still cant add a category because its a transfer to an onbudget account.But behind your back nYNAB secretly treats this as a payment to an offbudget account  it adds the Credit Card Payment category and removes the money from your budget. This leads to the weird issued you saw  YNAB tells you you have overspent but as you spend more on your card the amount of overspending gets less. Its bonkers.Iff you overspend from a cashsavingschecking account YNAB makes the category balance a big scary red number and lists that spending as overspent in previousmonth next month. If you overspend on a credit card YNAB pretends this isnt overspending  the category balance only goes yellow the spending isnt transferred down onto the card payment category and its not listed as overspending in the next month.HTo really catch everything you need to do more than just pay the amount in the available to budget field in the credit card payment category. You need to click on the inspector and look for the words and will increase your debt by . That last number tells you how much extra you need to pay to cover the Unbudgeted spending,ynab,d05vxjy,1,t5_2vqaa

That way I was able to avoid interest to a certain degree because I only had to live off credit for shorter and shorter periods of the month.The new system now wants me to butget either to the credit card or to categories not allowing to temporarily change the actual balance on the card reusing that line of credit later.

6763098,0,t1_d0iu7j4,Ah I didnt realize it also uses orangeyellow for missed goals. As I mentioned before one core idea of YNAB is to only spend money you earn one month in the next month. I guess they are saying underfunded goals are much like you are in debt to yourself. Which  I can understand. Maybe that goal is to prep for an upcoming payment in which case you will need to save more at some point which again is like a debt.Ive been using the program for a couple years and have no problem meeting that requirement once I used it for about  months and got some debt and spending in order. I feel lucky because I make enough to not often if ever have debt problems. Planning ahead for large spends like car insurance every  months has also made a huge difference for me.As for goals and meeting them once you have a buffer youre right itll be more like dont pull too much from this category or Ill warn you.In the end everything in YNAB is about only spending the money you have not creating new debt.,ynab,d0ivjb1,2,t5_2vqaa

So you shouldnt have a cash category  it should be called spending money or something. The fact that all of your expenditure for that category might come from a cash account is somewhat coincidental because your money is fungible and the YNAB method doesnt care where you keep your onbudget money.

So you only budget after getting the check and you only budget what you actually have? is that it? but how do you actually forecast? i mean how do you actually budget for example a vacation  month from now that you plan to allocate  on.

7221609,0,t3_4ed00i,You cant. However this worked great for me to populate history of transactions. If your bank shows a running balance you can clear a few days up to all in a day unclear everything after that day up to present time not always in the same order in bank so clear the whole day then reconcile  it should match that day. Even though you left  transactions afterwards unclear Then clear another day or two and work your way to present time.,ynab,d1z1iy5,1,t5_2vqaa
7229180,0,t3_4egjqh,This probably isnt the best way but I actually just leave my FSA out of YNAB. Even though its technically a deduction from my paycheck so my money I prefer to have one less thing to track in YNAB. Since I have a debit card for my FSA I think of spending from my FSA more as an insurance benefit payout rather than a transaction from my accounts.  I only track the outflows of my copays on my credit card. If you wanted to track it in YNAB youd need to make a new account for the FSA. Then as you said create an inflow and make a new budget category for just the FSA money. It will be important to remember that you cannot move money intoout of the FSA account and category. YNAB would let you cover overspending from you FSA category balance which you cannot do. ,ynab,d1zwjz7,3,t5_2vqaa

7387556,0,t3_4gix1t,Direct import only works with banks based in the U.S. and Canada. But you can certainly use YNAB without that feature. Very soon they should be adding manual import which I think youre calling filebased import which will allow you to bring in transactions using a file that you export from your bank. In YNAB  compatible file types included .OFX .QFX .QIF and .CSV files. Its likely to be the same in the new YNAB so you might see if your banks use one of those file types. Regardless you can use it easily enough without importing. Manual input is meant to be the main form of data entry and importing transactions is just a way of helping you fix errors when reconciling your accounts.,ynab,d2hwxiw,6,t5_2vqaa

7495501,0,t1_d2tyay6,Buffering basically just means that you have money set aside thats not being used for anything specifically. Its your emergency fund  so even if something comes up and you have to shell out  for auto repair or a meteor crashed through your roof or your dog grew a fifth leg and needs surgery  you have the money already set aside to pay that without dipping into funds that are normally used for your monthly bills and expenses. Then you start putting money back into the buffer to get it back to where it was.Traditional advice both here and on rpersonalfinance say to start out with a  month emergency fund. In other words if you got fired today and are no longer collecting paychecks you have enough money to pay all of your expenses for a whole month. Most people go with a target of a  month buffer so if your normal monthly expenses are kmonth you want k set aside for emergencies. If you have high APR credit cards or loans general advice is to pay those off after you get a  month buffer but before you start building it up to  months.,ynab,d2u76c4,2,t5_2vqaa

7762913,0,t1_d3ojbta,My financial situation is also moderately robust and relatively complicated. To accommodate this I budget in what I would call a tier system. The top tier is broad and I use it mostly for forecasting as far into the future as possible. It provides a monthly readout of my global financial situation i.e. personal income taxes living expenses rental income k etc.... I have found this critical in helping me set my future financial goals while also providing a relatively clear picture on how realistic those goals are. As I mentioned this tier is monthly and I have forecasted out for  years. Obviously this means things are pretty generic beyond the  year mark but it does show what my current situation will trend me toward. The middle tier is a detailed record and forecast monthly for the current year. This tracks all of my sources of income separately. As well as expenses broken into primary categories i.e. business expenses living expenses rental expenses corporate expenses ect.... I use this tier to track my ROI on my k and other investments. I also use it to track the potential equity in my home trailer and vehicles. The spreadsheet is set up to calculate my estimated change in net worth based on these inputs. The info on this sheet is fed directly into my Top Tier spreadsheet.The bottom tier is YNAB. It is the knitty gritty budgeting. Actively tracks every penny that enters or leaves my accounts all of them including my investment accounts. I thought that I ran a strong budget before YNAB just watching my big expenses. Since I started using it last year it has changed everything. I was dumbfounded the places I spent money and quickly reigned everything in. My savings have literally almost doubled. Like someone mentioned above I just set up multiple savings categories and budget toward them like they are normal expenses. I use all the end of month values in YNAB to populate my Middle Tier spreadsheet. I honestly recommend YNAB to anyone who asks me about money management. Hell I use it to budget for my wifes SCorp.,ynab,d3okzel,1,t5_2vqaa

8454978,0,t3_4vhciv, Income from Prev Month This is a term from YNAB  and isnt really used in nYNAB as far as I know. The months in nYNAB are not walled off from each other as they were in YNAB  so any inflow from any month can be used in any other month.  Funds for current Month This is probably the most confusing one but it makes sense once you realize how its calculated. Theres a good explanation here. Think of it as any money you didnt budget in the previous month plus the Total Inflows for the month youre looking at.  Overspent in Prev Month Pretty selfexplanatory. This is the total of overspending in the previous month that is deducted from your ToBeBudgeted amount in the current month.  Total Activity This is equal to all inflows in the current month all inflows to categories other than Inflow To Be Budgeted minus all outflows in the current month. It is the sum of the activity column in the current month.  Total Available This is everything youve budgeted and made available to spend minus activity in your budget categories. It is the sum of the available column in the current month. The Total Available amount in the furthest month ahead that you can see should be equal to the sum of your budgeted accounts minus the ToBeBudgeted amount.  Total Inflows This is the total of all inflow transactions in budgeted accounts with a date set in the month youre viewing.

9040043,0,t3_542dnz,If you happen to have a high deductible health plan HDHP you are eligible for a health savings account HSA where you can contribute money to savings pretax. This account will roll over year to year if you dont spend it all and can be invested in many of the same types of funds as an IRA or k. If this is available to you you could consider saving as much as you can afford in this account up to the yearly maximum of  for singles and  for families even though you can only withdraw it for medical purposes without a  penalty. Medical withdrawals are also tax free. You will probably have some larger medical expenses at some point in your life and once you reach age  you can withdraw funds for any purpose without paying the  penalty but I do believe you pay regular income tax on the withdrawals as with a pretax IRA.Note Be careful not to confuse an HSA with an FSA Flexible Spending Account.

9357495,0,t3_58j4b9,Ill piggyback off of hmlj and cincodenada  I agree that putting your extra money into categories here and there to give you a bit of a buffer. Putting this into the current month allows you to spend it now. If thats what you need to do great. If not put it in the next months budget so that you dont spend it! I combined this idea with using goals as a measuring stick for each month. The goal serves to give me a need to budget at least this much for almost all of the categories. Im a biweekly paid individual so each paycheck i get I add  of each goal to all categories that have goals. Then I sprinkle the rest around wherever I need it. Then sometimes I have some left over. I then try to fill out the monthly obligation categories until I get to their goal amounts. The second pay of the month if Ive already reached those goals i still try to add  to the category goal total and create a buffer. This helps me know how many months of buffer I have saved.Im currently getting close to hitting the  month mark on all my monthly obligations. At that point im going to increase the amount of payments in all of my long term debt payments Mortgage Student Loans Car Loans. I think im going to make a separate category for each of these and continue to use the normal category line for the monthly obligation amount plus a  month buffer. But then instead of adding more buffer put it into the secondary category and put this money into the principle of each loan.,ynab,d924ov1,1,t5_2vqaa

9463202,0,t3_5ad56l,The purpose of budgeting to zero is precisely to handle this situation. You currently have extra money and based only on what youve written no idea what it is for. If you DO have some idea what the purposes of that money are then just make categories for those things and budget it to them.Other people will tell you to make a category called Savings I hate this! or one called Buffer just savings that you plan to spend next month or to just budget it in the future. But for me I think of longerterm goals make a category for them and budget it to that. I can still take it out of those categories later if I need to!But leaving it as an undifferentiated blob of money is such a mental drain. At some point youre going to need to spend it. And then theres a ton of questions  am I spending this on the right thing am I spending too much from savings should I spend savings or cut the budget somewhere else. If its in a category then theres just one question which category is more important right now?,ynab,d9fizz6,11,t5_2vqaa
9465745,0,t3_5ae8bw,There is a methodical painstaking approach to finding the issue.Go to the main Budget page.. Look at the four big numbers on the right side.. Total Inflows is the sum of all the money YNAB thinks you added in October.. Total Budgeted is the sum of all the money YNAB thinks you budgeted in October.. Look at the center top. There are four small numbers to the right of the big To Be Budgeted number.. If you have no Overspent for September and you have no Budgeted in Future then To Be Budgeted should be the result of Total Inflows minus Total Budgeted. . If you do have Overspent in September or Budgeted in Future does it make sense to you?. If you do not have Overspent or Future Budget and To Be Budgeted does not equal Total Inflows minus Total Budgeted report a bug.. If you got this far the toplevel arithmetic is working. That means the  To Be Budgeted is due either to Inflows being too small or Budgets being too big or both.. If you can guess by looking at it whether Budgeted or Inflows is more suspect start with that one.. If the CC category has been confusing start with the CC category. Maybe  turned into  because  got budgeted to paying a credit card. Do any of the budgeted amounts in the CC category look strange? Do any of the activity amounts in the CC category look strange?. Good luck!Edit Something that sounds a lot like this happened to me two weeks ago. I chose the Blind Panic option and made a Fresh Start.

When you get a credit youd want to record it as Income To Be Budgeted then negative budget that amount.

10852065,0,t1_ddvrz5v,I agree that putting all free money towards the cards first is the better option.The purpose of the emergency fund is that if something shitty happens then you can afford to fix it. And so that you dont have to borrow money at high credit card or worse payday loan rates to do so.You already have a k credit limit and are already paying interest on that debt. So if you use the k emergency fund to pay off a bit of that debt you can borrow that k again in the future at the same rate if something shitty does happen. It would be different if the highinterest debt would be a car payment or something where if you pay early you cant borrow it back again at the same or lower rate.I guess another reason for keeping the emergency fund separate is to change your habits so that you avoid using credit cards for more than you can pay off at the end of every month and dont end up borrowing for nonemergency purchases there. But you have to decide yourself if that separation is necessary or not.,ynab,ddzbavb,1,t5_2vqaa

10991476,0,t3_5wy3a5,The nYNAB budget screen doesnt work quite like the YNAB  budget screen. It only shows your cashassets. So you have to explicitly tell it when you set up that some of that cash was reserved to pay off your credit card balances. Thats not connected to preYNAB debt its just a difference in the way the two systems handle credit. Flip back to February and make sure all your other category balances match YNAB . Then flip to March and budget enough to the Credit Card Payment category to make the Available amount equal to your credit card balance. Also check out Toolkit for YNAB. Its a free addon that lets you turn on certain features like running balance. Also check out financier.io if nYNAB is not for you.

11182641,0,t3_5zn0wj,Ive only been with YNAB  days but similarly to ugurase heres what Ive set up Target Date Goals  annualbiannual bills and subscriptions anticipated car maintenance ex oil changes Roth IRA  Target Balance Goals  emergency fund vacation fund big ticket wishlist items Monthly Funding Goals  pretty much everything else. I set monthly funding goals for my regular bills but also for groceries gas personal care shopping... This method lines up with what I did before YNAB. In Excel I put in all my spending and saving categories and how much I thought I would use in each area and played with the numbers until the sum perfectly matched my income. I was lucky enough to have a lot of data about my spending habits and so budgeting was pretty easy for me. Then if I have leftover money in a category it either gets reassigned utilities groceries etc or rolled over into the next month shopping. When I reassign money I try to put half in longterm savings and half in another category like if I spend less on utilities maybe Ill add more money to my vacation fund or to my shopping envelope. This method was just too complex for my Excel sheet so Im really excited because I think YNAB will make this budgeting method so much easier. ,ynab,dezjfpe,1,t5_2vqaa

11580224,0,t3_659mff,Since you dont have any accounts including a credit card this is going to be real easy. YNAB is nothing but a bunch of envelopes with cash in them. Imagine each budget category is just an envelope. You have one envelope that you put your cash for grocery purchases in. Another envelope you put your cash for that months electric bill. Another envelope holds all the cash you want to spend on gas for the month. Other envelopes are for the cash you want to put toward paying down preexisting debt like the electric company go ahead and make that debt a separate envelope for now from your regular monthly bills. So first Budget Category  envelope that holds cash for something specific. Next as you get paid more cash you enter that amount in YNAB and YNAB creates a big pile of it for you. This pile is called To Be Budgeted. Every time you get more cash either because you got paid won the lottery found  in a jacket pocket whatever you enter it as an inflow and categorize it to To Be Budgeted. This adds to the big pile of cash. Now whenever you have a big pile of cash sitting in TBB the next thing you do is to decide how you want to spend that money for the rest of the month. You decide what things are important to you and how much it is going to cost you. The main question you should be asking yourself during this time is what does this cash need to do between now and the next time I get paid. If the car payment is due this week but the rent is not due until after your next payday then you need to budget enough cash to cover the car payment first then put some towards the rent. Once you make that decision you budget that amount to the specific category. This simply means you take that cash out of the TBB pile and put it in the corresponding envelope. Keep doing this until all of the cash is gone from TBB and it is at zero. Once TBB reaches zero stop. You are out of cash and have to wait until you get paid again before you can budget again. You can move the cash around between the envelopes as you go along but you cannot add any more cash to the envelopes until you get paid again. As you make purchases you go into each envelope and get the cash out to pay for it. So lets say you buy  worth of groceries at the store. When you check out you get out the Groceries envelope and pull  of cash out and pay for it. Whatever is left in the Groceries envelope is all you have left to spend on groceries until the next time you get paid. When you go to pay the electric bill you pull the cash out of the Electricity Bill envelope and pay them. When you decide you want to pay down some of that dit ton of debt you have at the electric company then you go into that envelope get the cash out and pay them. You may find that in the beginning you misestimated how much something costs and you dont have enough cash in a particular envelope to pay for something. Well now you have to make some tough decisions. You either have to . not buy that thing now if you can or . move the cash from another envelope and put it in the envelope that needs it. This means of course that you have less to spend in that other envelope. Rinse and repeat this until you get out of debt.,ynab,dg8mie2,2,t5_2vqaa

Companies with an even larger user base than YNAB with a larger product impact were completely pummeled by that outage.Outages are an unfortunate reality and smaller dev and ops teams have a lot to take on when youre dealing with a service with such a large user base like YNAB. Whether or not the fault of the company YNAB is obviously affected by this.From my own experience I completely understand the world that YNAB folks live in. As a customer Im frustrated but I also temper it with an understanding that outages are not forever. Every company needs its uptime to survive.
