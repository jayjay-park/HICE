10859161,0,t3_5v3bjo,To be honest with you I feel like this was uncalled for. One does not deserve to be ridiculed simply for their preference. As a short guy  cm I feel like just because my height is something I cant change people should have every right to not be attracted by it. If a girl wouldnt want to date me because of my shortness thats perfectly fine. Everyone has standards. ,shortmen,de01ny7,3,t5_2sz5f
