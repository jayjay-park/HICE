A certain fraction of us. Those who arent either poor andor depressed.gtthe nutritive requirements of our bodies cant be met from foraging and hunting unless we devote every waking hour to finding food.Thats simply false. Even in marginal environments like the Kalahari  where farming doesnt even work otherwise it would be settled  people get by with less.gtIts what allows us to live beyond age thirtyFalse. Like so many others you include the  admittedly high  child mortality in the average age resulting in a skewed number. Again the average age at death does NOT mean people died at that age on average.gtCultures without it from the neanderthals to the aboriginal Australians and African bushmen are universally and objectively worse off than those with it in every single metric weve thought to test the health of a societyI can point to a lot of people working in industrial sweatshops who are worse off. Even in the wealth regions and classes of the world people are often more depressed and suicidal so it seems there are a lot of metrics where huntergatherers are better off.gtif not for the external support of farming people Early colonies in the Americas often had the problem that their settlers would desert and join the natives...Did they disappear because farming was better or just better able to force its will on people and conquer territory?gttheyve all either died out completely or stagnated as a culture.

Nothing about this treaty will allow violation of our due process rights if it did it would be struck down immediately and the u.s. can withdraw from the treaty at any time. Yes this results in a centralized dispute resolution system and yes it involves arbitration but there is no real evidence that arbitration favors corporate defendants. Rather what is likely to emerge is a quicker more consistent less costly body of trade law that will overwhelmingly involve international corporations bringing suits against one another with the occasional suit against the government. In the event of any especially egregious results expect to see countries withdrawing from the treaty because they do indeed maintain sovereignty and their involvement in the treaty is completely voluntary much like with a wide range of similar things like the Bern Convention.,DarkFuturology,cp09knm,0,t5_2vva3

Of course I have hardly any knowledge of whats possible with genetics. A scifi scenario involves the latent genetic code being activated by some environmental agent perhaps within the human genome or some environmentally distributed parasite.

10691635,0,t1_ddi2tae,I think youre right. It doesnt fall on the political spectrum and hardly represents what all people want. However studying anarchism opens up our understanding of regular politics. I compare it to Antimatter. No we cannot build anything with antimatter thats not the point. The point is to understand how things would work if they worked radically and almost unintelligibly different. And so it provides great insight on to what we thought we understand. What are yalls thoughts?,DarkFuturology,ddirhkz,-1,t5_2vva3

FBI and DHS monitored Occupy and are presently monitoring Trump protests the same way. Peaceful protest is terrorism in the eyes of the feds  looks like its as much the case in Mexico as it is in the US.,DarkFuturology,ddpbodh,2,t5_2vva3

It means that the probability of any revolt is actually decreasing over time and people are generally happier today than a century ago. ,DarkFuturology,debdoyr,1,t5_2vva3

I mean slave labor might work in that distopian future where we are all pawns of the megacorporations.

11262162,0,t1_df85wz3,Thank you for taking the time to say what you did. If you have another minute I have two questions about diversity and competition.First what role does human diversity play in a post human world? Diversity is important to species survival in the wild. If I understand the science correctly we can hardly say the same for domesticated animals. At least not from our perspective. Weve assumed responsibility of their genetic development.Second when you talk about the competitive tendency extending into AGI is that perhaps incorrectly anthropomorphizing the entity? If competition among animals developed to carry the best genes and an AGI could presumably selfdirect its own evolution it seems to follow that competition isnt required for an AGIs survival. Such an entity doesnt need to compete for limited mating partners. It just needs to write good code.Thanks again. Im really struggling to get my head around this stuff.,DarkFuturology,df8jshk,2,t5_2vva3

11304022,0,t1_dfda81o,Ive been in this sub awhile. But most recently Id say the Facebook detects suicidal users story is not dark. I understand the argument that it could be dark but thats like saying nuclear power plants are dark because nuclear power can be used to make bombs. Early detection of suicidal tendencies and alerting real people could easily become a very powerful force for good.Posts like this typically do very well despite being just totally unsourced cynical FUD rants. And look how well it did.Theres plenty more but those are items I commented on recently so I picked them.,DarkFuturology,dfdalhs,3,t5_2vva3
11304762,0,t1_dfdalhs,Ok thanks for providing examples. I appreciate that you mentioned ones where you commented.In the post about selfsegregation on facebook youll notice that I agreed with you. OP didnt clearly demonstrate a dystopian trend. They alluded to one by providing an opinion about how dark things are right now which is what I believe resonated with the community. Its easy to look at something and say thats awful upvote and move along. Its more difficult to explain why somethings a trend. Interestingly this thread also isnt future focused. It shows us something awful right now without exploring any lasting negative impacts on humanity.The post about facebook using AI to intervene in someones personal affairs is dark because as someone explained you can predict almost anything about anyone with user data. This is because the entire platform is designed for human data trafficking and behavior modification. Once were comfortable with the megacorp intervening presumably for someones benefit wed become more comfortable with it controlling other aspects of peoples lives.Ok so now Ill talk about what I meant when I said whenever I see vague criticisms of unspecified posts launched from a distance I get curious about ones motivations. First it may seem like splitting hairs but youll see I wasnt directing that at you specifically. I was saying that when someone claims some post should redefine a sub while offering no reason why the sub needs redefining it makes me suspicious for two reasons. It makes me think someone has an agenda. It also undermines the community by instilling doubt over the relevance of a subs content.,DarkFuturology,dfddm1z,2,t5_2vva3
