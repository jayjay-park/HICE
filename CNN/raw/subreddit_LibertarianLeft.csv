85637,0,t1_ceo694s,So the idea is setting the bound of what is immoral and what should be illegal as opposed to selecting one radio button per section?  I should have tested it but needless to say that is a questionable UX call.edit Horizontal slider jQuery for each question would provide much better clarity.,LibertarianLeft,ceo6fxh,1,t5_2r54y

1221158,0,t3_282ddm,gtOf course labels have a habit of being reappropriated by hipsters seeking to differentiate themselves. I have more than one friend who describes themselves as socalled libertarian socialists. This strikes me as a nonsequitur title that a yearold might think sounds subversive but Im no philosopher. If you can explain it to me Im all ears....  gtbut selfownership and private property are also important pieces to the leftlibertarian puzzle. Pretty clear this blog has no idea what theyre talking about.,LibertarianLeft,ci6zykv,6,t5_2r54y
1832558,0,t1_ck9v3ws,gtYou mean basically prevent generics from being able to swoop in and produce a drug after RampD is done? Generics keep costs down if drug costs were regulated it might be able to work.It is my understanding that they FDA already regulates generics. So Im asking why do we need to let the PTO handle drugs at all.,LibertarianLeft,cka0mt8,1,t5_2r54y
2756987,0,t1_cnhf9o4,You can argue if you want I dont care  I dont like the term capitalism but the reality is capitalism has morphed in meaning to refer to either  the status quo economic system or  voluntary exchange to most people. You can cling to the historic meaning if you like but you cant deny that your definition is now the minority again Im not saying youre wrong it just is what it is.,LibertarianLeft,cnhgi3s,1,t5_2r54y

3938817,0,t3_35jglt,Protect American workers from WHAT?All manufacturing has left the US.Nobody cares about that. THAT damage is done.

4425269,0,t1_csoh44a,This thread is about what liberal policies have done to Black people. While it is true that there are more Whites on welfare than Black the fact is that it has been used by liberals to specifically control poor Black people for decades. In fact Lyndon B. Johnson sought to use his so called great society for this very purposegtThese Negroes theyre getting pretty uppity these days and thats a problem for us since theyve got something now they never had before the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now weve got to do something about this weve got to give them a little something just enough to quiet them down not enough to make a difference. For if we dont move at all then their allies will line up against us and therell be no way of stopping them well lose the filibuster and therell be no way of putting a brake on all sorts of wild legislation. Itll be Reconstruction all over again.,LibertarianLeft,csohx63,-5,t5_2r54y

6611477,0,t1_d036b2l,Thanks for the downvote. So who owns the means of production in socialism? Statefree groups of people labour unions? that you can then no longer distinguish from being an actual state? Who will redistribute the wealth if not state? And regarding anarchism who will stop anyone from declaring a state when there is no authority to oppose this? And why only respond to half of my objections what about the schism between liberty libertarian ideal and equality socialist ideal.,LibertarianLeft,d036l20,1,t5_2r54y
