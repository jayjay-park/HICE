There were no cards with that kind of memory allotment at the time the  series debuted in .They may have had GB each for a total of GB shared in Crossfire but thats only GB of accessible VRAM due to the way Crossfire and SLI work. ,supremecommander,co759o5,1,t5_2shrv
3090651,0,t3_2vjwft,On some maps they are really stupid.  Be sure to play on maps with AI markers. The AI complains in the chat if you dont so its easy to notice.Sorian is loads better than the normal AI but still no replacement for a human opponent.  If you want an extra challenge play on AI maps they are designed with AI in mind. Read the descriptions on where to place what AI and faction.  You can also play around with the cheat multiplier in the map options.  The option that the AI has all intel is hard too.  Dont go crazy both build multiplier gt. and ressource multiplier gt. or youll have so many bombers circling your sorry head in the first  minutes you wont see the sun anymore.  Every map is different on what is possible with the multipliers try around.,supremecommander,coicesw,2,t5_2shrv

10114117,0,t1_dbpmdvu,It is extremely complicated! But great nonetheless. Best way to lead rn is getting in bot games and messing around. Theres a halfway decent tutorial in the game too. Forged Alliance forever is the community client after the old servers were taken off line. Just Google it and youll find it. Once youve got the basics down check out some casts on YouTube by a guy named gyle,supremecommander,dbpvmf1,3,t5_2shrv
