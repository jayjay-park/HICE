2682311,0,t1_cn8j2rm,hmm i thought so... tho im scared what rock bottom is for him  weve always been best buddys. but lately he doesnt want to hangout anymore. or do anything at all. i will be there for him when he hits rock bottom. but im thinking about just ignoring him for now. since everytime i try to contact him he turns me down anyway  seems like the only way to hangout with him is playing WoW xD but i wont go down that path P,nowow,cn8p5jc,1,t5_2w31l

3259647,0,t3_2xg6ro,Its probably a little bit of both. people can become irresponsibly and sometimes dangerously addicted to smoking alcohol gambling and drugs in part because of their effect on the brain i.e. Dopamine. The same is true w gaming. So in that sense WoWgaming have a similar potential for pathological addiction albeit not as severe or common as in drugsalcohol. This potential is inherent in the game itself. So if you would agree that drinking and gambling are addictive then WoW is also addictive in that sense... If your view is that drinking and gambling arent addictive then maybe were just parsing different concepts of addiction.,nowow,cozvgnc,2,t5_2w31l

I have all sorts of good WoW memories but then when I line that up with the amount of time I spent the times I ignored friends or turned down other invitations because I was playing thats enough to not play. No more are the days where I work then log on to farm mats then shove some easy food in before settling in to raid for  hours and then spend an hour postraid ... uhg.Keep on keepin on.,nowow,crp78rz,2,t5_2w31l
4636652,0,t1_ct9hyc1,I think I am done with WoW.  My WoW account has already been cancelled.  My game time expires at the end of this summer August .  I could renew it.  But I dont think I will.  I think this is it for me.  My WoW days are over.  It has been fun.  Thank you Blizzard for such an incredible and ADDICTING game.  But it is time for me to move on from WoW.  And thank you again Reddit!  For giving me a place to rant.  Haha.,nowow,ctf0o97,2,t5_2w31l
5973860,0,t1_cy1m4jf,agreed sound statement.  I was totally wow addicted my op may not be so sound tho i tried to be balanced by saying yes they made a good game.  consciousness of and not sustainable thats what happened.  ,nowow,cy2pd2g,1,t5_2w31l
10224415,0,t3_5mbvfm,gt I had the hardest time quitting RunescapeThen you might have a hard time quitting WoW.At least at the time when I quit mid was my sign off it was still a game that rewarded logging in daily for a good chunk of play even after hitting max level. Youd log in do your daily quests complete a daily dungeon run do some work with professions ... I didnt even have it as bad as some but I still felt an obligation to log in for at least an hour every day. And then more for raiding nights with my guild.And that was just to play one character a max level and not having anything to do with the PVP game. And not being involved in the auction house or being a crafting materials person or hawking my crafted materials. If those carrots tempted me I couldve lost hours and hours every day. Or if Id played more than one character.,nowow,dc2ztju,1,t5_2w31l
