3665989,0,t1_cq7cu6v,Hey why all the hating on my guitar tone!Seriously though I often try to go for more of a clean funk tone but I think that day I was torn because its QOTSA so a little grit felt appropriate and the engineer made me turn my W amp up a little beyond its capacity for clean headroom.  I often do use a Tele but was just feeling this guitar in the moment for reasons I cant remember.  We were on a really tight schedulebudget so as long as we got a decent take I wasnt gonna bog us down with alternate takes even though I coulda spent all day using different guitars amps and trying to get a lesssloppy performance etc.,funk,cqa5bkk,1,t5_2rfid
