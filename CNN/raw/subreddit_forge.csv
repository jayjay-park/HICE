7062569,0,t3_4ca9wv,as a person whos been at the CCs throats since reach for corruption bias and other things.where is this issue with forgehub coming from? the CCs are an entirely seperate entity and have absolutely nothing to do with forgehub at all. there is no forgehub bias in the system forgehub is just the old home of the forge community which is made up of a large group of people with the same goal of making maps.trying to move focus to other communities wont remove any bias issues regardless of the communities location the problem of people creating their own circles ending up in echo chambers is still going to persist and be an issue. this is an issue of people being afraid of points of views that doesnt agree with their own.the problem with the CCs is the lack of transparency how i are handling the process and CC nomination process. the lack of transparency means were not going to know whats going on. i handling seems to be to some degree hand picking maps themselves then instructing the CCs to get the forger to make adjustments for the map to be ready. and the nomination process for the CCs is the CCs suggesting their close friends to be CCs which leads to complete assholes like AgentPaperCraft becoming CCs and abusing the whole system in their favor.what we need is systematic change of the entire CC proccess not moving it from one place to another. a system where each community votes who they want to represent them. i do not think a system where we vote for maps would work because it turns into a popularity contest the person who is more popular gets more votes regardless of the quality of the map. we also need to know what maps i are interested in so that we can focus our efforts on that to try and provide a selection of the best possible maps.,forge,d1gwixt,5,t5_2qmpd

8511478,0,t3_4w7vss,This is probably a mess of a comment but it CAN definitely be done.OP will try and deliver and make one myself if you use it just credit me for the pod pls  You can have the switch send a signal you want the  blocks on the drop pod to move backwards. Put move on signal then apply desired amount of distance desiredhowever take note that the block in the back will go back on a different axis than the  blocks above and below in this case the  blocks above and below will move on a zaxis while the one in the back and front will move on the x or y axis depending on the rotation altogether.  Most of it comes down to scripting the timing on the blocks I would have the front slide open and give around  seconds before departure including closing time. However you will need to have a delay matching the time it stays open AND CLOSES before it moves you will also need to add a script to the front moving panel that not only closes but one that has a delay waiting for the open and closing to take place basically just timing each one to match up and close properly before movement. The final script will be added once you got it moving backwards REMEMBER THE BLOCKS MOVE ON DIFFERENT AXISES welded scripting is a bug ridden hellhole and is not recommended. the last script will just have each block descend the exact same amount so the blocks stay together normally and have it drop really fast a high distance with little time.. As for the little white blocks you just apply the same type of philosophy just delay the timer to match the drop pod and have it move with the block. Edit I think only rotating with welded objects is a mess will report back as it will make this whole process x easier if welded things dont act up.,forge,d65hplk,2,t5_2qmpd

9285863,0,t3_56sb6e,Im not entirely sure but I think some objects like chromas and rocks have a nearly infinite draw distance. So maybe you could hide some chromas just barely behind or rather inside of your walls that way when the walls disappear it should be nearly unnoticeable. Luckily most of your walls are generally dark and at the distance from which they disappear most of the small details and texture is no longer visible which would make some dark colored chromas all the more convincing. Anyway hope this helps!,forge,d8t1tjp,2,t5_2qmpd
