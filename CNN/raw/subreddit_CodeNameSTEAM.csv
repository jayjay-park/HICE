5079795,0,t3_3iimgt,Map   I didnt actually think of this strategy. I saw it a long time ago and just copied it.Done in  turn.Map  Map  could have been done better if I landed on the enemy instead of next to them. Then I wouldnt have been shot the amount that I was.Done in  turn.Map part  I ended up recording unnecessary parts here and it cuts at the end due to my phone having issues.part  I feel map  can be done better than how I did it. Perhaps if you use Ike and Henry to push one or the other to Lion you can shave a turn or two off. I dont have New DS so I cant use my Ike amiibo yet. I may revist the level when I get the amiibo adapter.Done in  turns.,CodeNameSTEAM,cuyb30c,1,t5_325ew
