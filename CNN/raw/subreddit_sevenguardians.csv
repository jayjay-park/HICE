9161658,0,t1_d8daj20,I spent the  pick cards on rusalka archer and rusalka defender. The cards allows me to start the chapter  farm in my rd day of play or so. It means more mystic bags  hammers and good exp. Also the rusalka archer allows to kill any daily boss and have a very good score on the world boss even in  .After that I farmed the fury warlord and fury archer and start to farm chapter .About mage  u dont rly need a mage for story at all. For the arenastronghold I think the seraph mage better I have it and always win against of the dragon mage with similar other units on arena.I still dont have the dragon mage sw golem and dragon warlord. Anyway Iam top  on arena atm will drop to  or so at end of week top  in the world boss atm rank  in the stronghold slowly growing there and can farm chapter  with all the chapter  bosses. So I dont think that the  units required and help u a lot in the game. Yes some of them  very good but definitely not the best.,sevenguardians,d8db2q8,1,t5_3f2lg

SW very good dragon not so good but usefull in sanctuary and arena in case u dont have other good golems. Rusalka great in stronghold best for stronghold defence in case u also have the rusalka warlord  its hard to win then the rusalka golem get the second wave from the warlord they just not allows u to move from the base and ranged enemy units kill your base in the time  its very quick in most cases. Also rusalka better with dragon defender very good on arena in case most of your units ranged.,sevenguardians,d8wzv0b,1,t5_3f2lg

9596636,0,t3_5ce0p2,I got the demon warrior. So far I think its a pretty solid warrior option especially for bosses. Basically if the warrior dies and the tombstone isnt destroyed you get a second warrior for free. this can quickly add up but again its dependent on the ability to protect the tombstones. ,sevenguardians,d9vzcbv,1,t5_3f2lg
9661680,0,t1_da25qil,Fury wizard is arguably worse than dragon as his fury form is melee and it dies quickly and in nonfurymode the dragon wizard has higher range and deals more damage. In higher tank warsstronghold wars I havent seen anybody use fury wizard.,sevenguardians,da405t3,1,t5_3f2lg

9942453,0,t3_5ht7pq,The only runes really worth it are reflection runes or critical damage boosts and bonus damage to hero  boss. For my tanks golems  warlord  warrior I try to get as many range and melee reflection bonuses as possible.For my dps archers  rogues  wizzards I go for the damage attributes that stack up like critical bonuses damage bonus after critical then larger damage boosts like  to boss or hero.Ideally you would have a hero with nothing but reflection or nothing but critical stacking bonuses but you need so many rusalka dragon runes etc that its very very costly. Plus the  diamond reroll...Frankly the rune system is very paytowin right now and extremely rng based. Dont spend a ton of resources on it unless youre already mastering all your  heroes and are in the very late game.,sevenguardians,db3ixy6,3,t5_3f2lg

10195377,0,t3_5lzzio,Finishing chapter  and  is mostly about summoning several fury archer in berserk mode and protect them until they destroy enemy core. In chapter  the main difficult is those orc archer that kill your precious backline. To avoid this you can use your dwarven golem when he dies summon a fury archer inside the shield and she will more easily clear the way.Demon defender is also a precious defender to delay enemy units but it is more useful in chapter  than in chapter .Two more guardians that will help you greatly to finish the game fury warlord because she protects and boosts fury archer and seraph rogue because of his high ranged dps and his invicibility,sevenguardians,dbzpa9f,1,t5_3f2lg

11374074,0,t1_dfkvs65,Congratulations! I just recently did up my Beast Warrior. What a fucking investment haha.For Runes for Beast Warlord... his Defense and HP are damn good I mean he rivals several of the Base  Warlords in those regards. Heres what Id do though Im no expert at RunesDestruction Damage  or Bonus Damage to Debuffed Enemy or Critical Hit rate. For Elements you can go for the Rusalka Special Passive and if you get On Critical Hit Damage Bonus per  of Max HP that seems pretty good for him. Protection HP  or Defense . Pretty much any Seraph Element is going to be great on Protection Runes Orc and Dwarven arent too shabby eitherDivinity Im tempted to say Debuff Success Rate here just because hes got a Knock Back and a Knock Down but I suspect youd be better off stacking HP  and Defense  here as well. Demon and Silverwing have some pretty good Debuff Elements but you might just be better off stacking Defense stats again. But I dunno Im pretty bad at Runes so.

Lose give you   honor personally I dont get a lot of defense battles so its fairly easy to move up in ranks. Archer shards.  just auto farm that stage that gives them. As with any other rolls its always random so even if you dont get them while youre looking at your screen auto farming will.
