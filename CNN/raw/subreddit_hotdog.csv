For wood I go with applewood andor cherry you can buy bags of it pretty much anywhere that sells grilling stuff. Then I just throw them on my cheap ass brinkman smoker for about an hour. If you dont have a smoker you can smoke on almost any grill just google it depending on what kind of grill you have.  Heres a pic of how they turned out  Also if hawaiian sweet roll hot buns are available by you use them.,hotdog,d74tks6,1,t5_2qnj9
