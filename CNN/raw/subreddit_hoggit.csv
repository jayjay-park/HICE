155629,0,t1_cew48hv,Its just a matter of being able to put your SPI on the subsequent targets quickly enough. Slewing the TGP around is probably not going to work unless your targets are quite spread out. Hoozin in the above steps was creating mark points on his targets and creating a flightplan with his markpoints as waypoints and then lining up on his attack run with his steerpoint set as his SPI. That allows him to just cycle through the markpoints in his flightplan as his steerpoint and thus as his SPI dropping JDAMs as he went.,hoggit,cew5oq1,3,t5_2tifv

443878,1,t1_cfqns5t,Alright fine Ill defend myself since now youre busting out the ad hominem.Lets establish the exact words I used firstgt...  lets please refrain from speculation or blame ... they want to be able to focus on their DCS work instead of dealing with drama ... They want to make great DCS modules for us they clearly have the talent for it so lets focus on that.At no point am I doing any of the following all of which are direct quotes of yours. Censoring the issue   stifling conversation   not immediately during events to make them go away   intellectually dishonest weasel words My statements were entirely polite requests not demands commands orders proclamations or anything else that could be construed as this.   Same as .   That you are only just hearing about these events now does not make them recent or relevant to what is now taking place. Indeed that we have now received a public statement indicates these events likely concluded weeks ago and likely for the most part took place weeks before Beczls original rather odd post. This was an internal private matter that has been concluded for some time you cant seriously believe anything else. It isnt as though Leatherneck studios came into existence less than  hours ago and are telling us asithappens.   Wat? I dont even. I mean seriously wat I hate having to trot out this phrase but you must be new here if you believe that. While I may be occasionally guilty of footinmouth disease I think Im mature enough to own up to that when it happens. However I have never tried to hide or manipulate with my statements. I cannot emphasize enough though if youre already trumpeting the censorship! card on a public internet forum with an established history of letting people air their grievances so long as everyone can be civil about it these words arent likely to mean anything to you.   Same as .So heres the thing and I sincerely hope you can understand this. Ultimately at this point Beczl is no longer relevant to DCS MiG or Leatherneck Studios. You are not being denied information nothing is being brushed under the rug no conversation is being shut down.In Leathernecks own words and Im going to bold this so you cant possibly miss itgt While we appreciate the fact that everyone is eager to know exactly what lead us to the internal difficulties we feel the need to keep as much of our private matters private. Were here to deliver topnotch quality DCS products not to run a forum soap opera. ... In essence the only difference to you the backer  is that you may have to wait a short period to receive your physical goods. We hope that is amicable.Thats them saying they want to focus making aircraft not dealing with bullshit and that nothing is going to drastically change as far as us as fanscustomershaterswhatever are concerned. Can you understand that? Even if they internally harbor resentment towards Beczl  and if they say he parted amicably thats the most information weve got so we have no evidence to assume they do  it is internal and theyd rather get work done than deal with petty drama and shitstorms people who cannot possibly know what happened feel entitled to stir up anyway.What does uninformed speculation accomplish then? At this point we only know what theyve stated. Beyond that we dont have any more public information from which to draw conclusions. I can tell you I personally remain optimistic about MiG based on the work weve seen already and indeed this public announcement. If it matters to you I didnt fund it during the IndieGoGo campaign so Im not speaking from some position of justifying my missing purchase or whatever. Lastly I can tell you that if Beczl comes forward with some other DCS project in the future I will wish him the best of luck and yet approach that project very cautiously.Look how much more reasonable and respectful that is without jumping to conclusions based on literally zero information. Thats what I was politely asking people to keep in mind and somehow from that you got censorship!,hoggit,cfqru03,-2,t5_2tifv

1521877,0,t1_cj6jcpi,I have the early access and the FM is outstanding.  Its very comparable to DCS standards it just doesnt have clickable cockpits but it has damn near all the controls that the cockpit would allow.  For startups on many of the aircraft you still have to have the right mixture prop water and oil radiator settings for it to start.  After that you have to adjust each setting based on what youre doing ie climbing cruising fighting etc or your plane expels a ton of smoke and your engine overheats.  Currently the damage modeling is a WIP but you still get bent props wing roots ripped off oil and gas leaks and the plane breaks apart exactly where its hit.  So if you botch a landing and your wing scrapes the ground that part of your wing will crack or break off completely.  As far as I can tell it does seem like it has some standard areas on the plane where they just change the texture to a general bullet hole texture area instead of having accurate bullet holes.If Flight modeling is a worry for you Id say dont worry about it at all.  Im an avid simmer always looking for good flight models and get turned off by sims with terrible FMs but IL BoS is easily one of my favorite sims at the moment.  Im on it damn near nightly and have been for a few months just messing with the quick editor.  I cant get enough of the explosion and fire effects which sadly is leaps and bounds ahead of DCS.

More complex but more powerful software to save and load multiple curve profiles for different games and the like for instance different profiles for ARMA DCS and a F Racing Sim....

Any delay in pulling up will have you recovering at a lower altitude or pulling hazardous GsAOA. The dangers of delaying the pull increase dramatically as the dive angle increases.In as steep of a dive as you were in its not surprising you exceeded limits leveling off at AGL even if you did pull before the GCAS warning. At  knots in a  degree dive youre descending at nearly  FPM or  FPS. This increases to  FPS by  knots. A . second delay in pulling a full recovery at  knots once you get BREAKX puts you in the dirt or exceeds the limits on the airframe.

Next time try and move your cursor up and down and watch as the altitude indications move and youll see what altitudes your scanning throughout.

3589365,0,t1_cq1dt55,Yes I shouldve mentioned that. When you create a mission in the mission editor there should be something called bort on each unit menu for aircraft. That is the number that will show up on the aircraft. It differs depending on what aircraft it is but for the mustang its  letters and  numbers. For example SKM. SK would be the squadron designation the two letters close to each other the last letter in this case M would be this particular aircraft within the SK squadron. With  aircraft per squadron youd even have letters to spare The last three numbers would be the addition to the aircrafts serial number on the tail unique to each aircraft.,hoggit,cq1eyno,1,t5_2tifv

3864016,0,t1_cqwgs5b,According to the manual not only will the governor bring the engine back to idle throttle to prevent the turbinerotor from overspeeding it will actually shut the engine completely off. Ive never seen such an extreme situation myself but I have seen the engine rpm drop to idle. The logic is probably something along the lines of if we dont slow things down immediately and drastically shit is gonna fly apart. Since the engines take several seconds to spool up to normal speed I usually end up crashing shortly after a stunt like that because pulling collective bleeds off a ton of rotor speed before the engines make decent power again.Your thoughts in Edit  are correct to the best of my knowledge though I honestly dont fully understand the fullmax throttle position. The manual says it is to ensure full engine output in the event the other engine has failed. This could possibly mean that the engine exceeds its normal operating speed and output and slowly damages itself in order to keep you in the air but with the EEG on I dont recall that ever happening. The max position doesnt cause the rotors to overspeed so the EEG still limits the engine speed at max throttle. If you turn the governor off the max position WILL run the engine way past its normal operating limit and give you a lot more power but the engine will destroy itself in a matter of minutes. I guess there just doesnt seem to be much of a point to using the max position vs the auto position with the governor turned on.The free turbine switch it a setting for the governor. It tells the governor to hold the rotor at either the high end of acceptable the normal position or the low end of acceptable the low position. It only works with the governor turned on. If you turn the governors off and if you have the throttle bound to a joystick axis you can manipulate the throttle levers to maintain whatever rotor rpm you desire this quickly becomes unmanageable once you start maneuvering.EDIT With the governor off you can both run the engine way past its limit and you can also overspeed the main rotor. Im just making this note for the sake of completeness. I imagine you probably knew that fact already.,hoggit,cqwqdo9,1,t5_2tifv

If you hold the helicopter steady and hit the trimmer button and then immediately center all axis it will remain steady. Relatively speaking. Its a helicopter so its always trying to fall out of the sky and kill you.You really need a yaw axis of some kind to fly the huey properly. At hover it requires right pedal to remain steady. At kts the pedals are close to centered. At kts you have to use a bit of left pedal. Its easier to not trim the pedals unless youre trying to use the keyboard for the pedals. But without a pedal yaw axis its going to be quite annoying to fly.EDIT I typed that up backwards. It should have saidAt hover it requires left pedal to remain steady.

The Mi on the other hand is much more complex and a bit more sluggish. Until I had quite some hours in it I often got into VRS or screwed up some other way like selecting the wrong weapons.Now after about h in it those problems have mostly gone away and I love the machine. lt,hoggit,cuqtn8d,1,t5_2tifv

5184245,0,t1_cvaixay,PFM is the old AFM. This includes the AC.The current AFM is a new term confusingly invented and wedged between the old LockOn SFM and the renamed PFM and describes the Su and AA style models. It is a shitty term and should not have been used as it only leads to further confusion. And then theres EFM which as you point out is entirely independent of DCS and implies absolutely nothing about its level of detail. You could very easily end up with something no more detailed or complex than the SFM but call it an EFM because that is how it works. Again a misleading and kind of lousy term. I wish ED had come up with better ones but I think there was probably some pressure not to make it look like they were pooping on their old work or the original wave of rd party devs who wanted to make things with notoldAFMnowPFM levels of detail.Of course now it seems like ED is just saying look it had better be PFM detail or get out but because the rd parties are for the most part not allowed to use EDs systems we still have the confusing EFM term.Details hereEdit snipped by uluckyhendrix.

6056380,0,t3_3yhav8,. and . are similar in features. They are in beta and alpha states respectively. Terrain is essentially maps. The difference is that . allows for multiple maps the only other one besides Black Sea at this time being NTTR Nevada Test and Training Range. Expect that most maps aside from the Black Sea map you find in . will need to be purchased or possibly come with an aircraft or as a package. The Black Sea map you find in .. is in the process of being converted to work with the terrain engine in . but until they finish that work the only way you can use . is if you buy the NTTR map.If you buy a module it works across all the versions where possible. NTTR requires . or newer for instance and I think all the campaigns are on the Black Sea map thus far with at least one requiring . or newer. When Black Sea gets updated to . expect them to work with it as well.VR works and gets improvements from time to time. You can hook up a DK and fly for sure.Combined arms is OK. It could be better...As far as economical choices you can buy FC and get several aircraft modeled at a similar level to the SuT you have for free. Then there are the more fully modeled aircraft with clickable cockpits which covers virtually everything else and choice depends mostly on whether you like choppers or planes air to air or air to ground etc.Campaigns are sets of related missions you can fly. Youll need to purchase the aircraft theyre meant for before you can fly them.Tuesday night is still a thing and not sure what you meam by level but I guess you mean the mission which uses the free black sea mapterrain and is set up with lots of aircraft slots and areas to practice with weapons and or flying around with minmal risk of being blown out of the sky unexpectedly unless you wander into one of the ranges where things shoot back.Hope that covers it!,hoggit,cydhmdb,5,t5_2tifv

Id already spent enough time on it that I just gave in and bought the TrackIR. But that didnt work either really because the I fly in front of a large flat screen TV and the distance and angle were all off. Two days ago I clamped a piece of wood to the bookcase and extended a boom out to a foot away from where my TrackClip would be and its finally working OK. After all that the idea of having a headtracker that cant be occluded is very seductive. Its also nice to know that my money is going to the hardware and not a smallmarket monopoly.

Yes VEAO has had some issues in the past but they have made some in house changes and are showing us their progress in good faith. Given how difficult it can be to make an accurate and high fidelity craft I am inclined to think we should return some of that faith.This is not to say that we should blindly go buying whatever product comes through their doors but there is no reason to discard updates and progress with disdain when the progress they show is given in a clear an accurate way.

You shouod have the nose pointed down directly at the runway threshhold and there is so much drag created by the flaps and gear that you should be at almost  throttle all the way to the runway threshhold and even then you should only lower the throttle a tad bit and add a tiny flare to get it to settle onto the runway softly.,hoggit,cz49jb9,1,t5_2tifv

6531448,0,t3_44yxnh,In the wibbly wobbly world of FSX Iris would subcontract other developers to produce stuff for them to release under the Iris label. Over the years theres been some bad blood when subcontracted developers have claimed Iris never fulfilled their end of the contract. I believe Colin Pearson of Milviz maintains to this day Iris never paid him a cent for the Avro Vulcan model he was contracted to produce for FSX.A few years back Iris subcontracted a developer to make an FE for FSX. The FE was released for FSX and I believe Iris were going to use these guys for DCS development as well. Some time after the FE was released for FSX the developers now known as MetalMesh parted company with Iris after claiming Iris were pulling some shenanigans with them. MetalMesh then made a very nice Mirage  for FSX which I believe was then taken to Razbam and that was the genesis of the DCS Mirage .Bottom line  the developers Iris were planning to use for DCS products left them and went to work with other labels. Iris however are still active producing aircraft for FSXPD.,hoggit,czuwj87,2,t5_2tifv

7260768,0,t1_d23hhck,I just took a look at how the DRM system worked.  I first downloaded The Enemy Within through the DCS updater note I dont own the DLC and cant activate it. If I try to open the mission in the mission editor it asks me to activate it. The DRM system works by keeping all of the mission triggers encrypted within the ACEnemyWithin.dll file. When you load the mission it checks that you own the module and then decrypts the triggers and injects them into the mission file as it loads. You can edit the mission file and remove the DRM check allowing you to open the mission file and play it however it wont have any triggers making the mission rather pointless. You can modify the mission waypoints and units but you cant see or edit the triggers. Modifying things related to triggers would probably break the mission but changing unit properties does not.Edit If you own the DLC you can see the triggers in the editor and with some .miz wizardry you could probably successfully add more triggers that loaded separately to the encrypted trigger injection,hoggit,d23hxz7,1,t5_2tifv

I dont really see Thrustmaster being so smart about the price.  Still these may be their entry level pedals in their new lineup.

Every rivet every joint every moving piece on the aircraft has to be modeled and animated. Every switch and button and dial are separate from each other and have to be coded to click when operated. This is all part of the modeling and artwork and therefore takes the most time.On the other hand systems modeling and avionics while certainly not easy are not nearly as time consuming. Teeter has said that in RAZBAMs work on the harrier and tucano main systems are well into development and that easily the thing taking them the longest is the modeling of the cockpits and other parts of the aircraft.Also in Leathernecks case in regards to the Viggen Cobra was very very sick late last year into early this year.

8768046,0,t3_505mzm,I have a question regarding the Fs control system specifically regarding trim. Trim is something sims rarely get right because of the limitations of standard commercial hardware. Does pitch trim compensation PTC effect stick position or does the stick remain in the same place when trimmed regardless of airspeed? For instance with PTC working and maintaining g level flight does the stick move on its own if you were to move the throttles forward and accelerate nonunique trim? Or does the control system add this in later and leave the stick where it is unique trim?My understanding is that all this doesnt matter when the gear are down. PTC is disengaged and the aircraft must be trimmed manually in the traditional way with nonunique trim. I honestly havent investigated whether or not DCS got this right I dont think so. EDIT As a followup if the stick DOES maintain a unique trim position with PTC engaged what happens when the gear is raised or lowered and PTC transitions from off to on and on to off?EDIT  How does lateral stick force compare to longitudinal? Where could I find a lateral stick force vs displacement diagram?,hoggit,d71o3zr,14,t5_2tifv

9414239,0,t3_59gl80,From the release notes of revivegt However the new SteamVR beta has a couple of more surprises. A bug was fixed in the frame submission which was heavily affecting Revive performance as it introduced an extra frame of latency. This means that motiontophoton latency has been reduced for many Oculus games even if you cant use Asynchronous Reprojection.gtgtBut wait theres more. Another bug was fixed in a function called the PostPresentHandoff this function can be used to postpone waiting on the running start until its necessary. This trick gives a big boost in performance in games that were bottlenecked on the CPU such as Dirt Rally. In Dirt Rally this will nearly double the fps as long as your GPU is not the bottleneck.Looks like its a very welcome combination of things that has made DCS much more pleasant to fly in VR.,hoggit,d99bjsz,1,t5_2tifv

Thats roughly . of the US defence budget on average per year or . of US GDP yearly. Hardly a crippling figure. Edit Also no its not a pure loss. It gives you the ability to safeguard your economic interests far cheaper than any alternative platform meaning you can protect your economic position and the money goes to Lockheed Martin.

Its only real sensor is the radar and that is mostly useful against big targets and especially ships.If that means it is less suited to the kind of missions you want to fly than certain other aircraft in DCS then sure thats an entirely reasonable opinion to have but I really dont think you can call it a onedimensional aircraft.,hoggit,dcjba0a,10,t5_2tifv

That said that convenience and the popularity of those kinds of scenarios has put a lot of emphasis on them in the larger discourse about the aircraft their use and how multiplayer server missions are structured overall.  I also have to keep in mind that the missions that really show off the best of DCS are the ones that are the least accessible online. They are the ones that are more suited for small private coop servers or perhaps very highly structured and carefully designed PvP servers where they play more like a coop mission but with some players inhabiting roles on the other side.  ,hoggit,dd2ugdk,3,t5_2tifv

10562824,0,t1_dd56ahc,I have both.The Mil is a flying garbage truck. Its stable once you get it in the air and pointed where you want to go especially with the advanced autopilot. It can carry lots of weapons but is pretty sluggish for use as a gunship and it falls out of the sky due to VRS at the drop of a hat. Good campaigns available for it though.The Huey on the hand is more nimble and thus a bit more wobblytwitchy in the air. It also does not have a true autopilot system. It is however much much much easier to land than the Mil and makes a better gunship. It really needs a better campaign though as the bundled one focuses a lot on very straightforward long distance flying.

If theyre deadset on committing to this new business model the lowrez texture might be the only way to make it work going forward.I personally do wish they would reconsider adopting that model but Im not ED I dont really know anything about their business and wouldnt presume to tell them what to do.

11137339,0,t1_deue2fp,There is a difference yes. DCSs SFMs were mainly based on simple performance data data sheet stuff. Current PEFMs are usually based on time with the actual aircraft which Id say is close enough. It being bad is subjective yes. But Im presenting my point of view as someone who played WT from the beginning of open beta up until like early last year or some such. I think its pretty shit and the devs seem keen on making it shittier.And of course this is entirely based on the air component of the game which I mostly ignored during my last year or so of play in favor of tanks which I feel much more confident in calling an objectively bad game.,hoggit,deuemte,3,t5_2tifv

11263798,0,t1_df8q22v,Yeah that is the Shat man himself. You check out the YT vid showing the demo? They have only real celebs doing the voices and original characters from other media. I like Astra and Alix a lot myself. And Shatner is a soothing and perfect AI voice companion for ED. Does a good job keeping it low key delivery. What is cool is they update them and send you a note saying we added new stuff make sure to update.As for DCS and stuff it is great can just say flight or wingman  or  etc and issue their orders. I say tower and boom tower radio opens. For refueling and all that stuff it is just way more immersive. I can just say cursor and cursor disappears say it again and back..no mulitkb commands ever anymore. And all for just the price of a crappy lunch meal. ,hoggit,df8qh4c,2,t5_2tifv

11302020,0,t1_dfd23fy,I can see that point but I wonder how open the niche really is for something like this to happen. Plus putting it up as Paid version with free dlc is possible with Steam so they would effectively pay for . and get the map free. SCS Software has done that for American Truck Simulator the map parts are essentially DLCs that you get free with the game itself. They could put ingame icons on the modules and a popup explaining that the modules will follow once they are updated and that any bought modules will just carry over eventually.I get your point completely and it is a concern at the same time the other side of the coin is where I am at and its equally as frustrating in my mind.,hoggit,dfd2fjm,2,t5_2tifv
11359652,0,t3_622m2q,ProTip Been flying for a couple years now and ive gotten quite the collection. I recommend going out to your local hobby shop and get This Most hobby shops should have them. Its great because you can learn the hardest part which is the perspective of flying a model aircraft and it comes with a radio controller that plugs into your computer. It really saves a lot of money in the wrong run.As for controllers I went out to my local hobby shop and bought one of these Very good if you figure out you defiantly want to make this your hobby and you dont really need more than  channels unless youre going all out.As for a starting aircraft  this Its a T very forgiving and still allows you to do aerobatics fun for all skill levels. Edit SOME SAFETY STUFF THATS MUST KNOWThe Props on rc aircraft are NOT harmless they can and will take a finger off so when you are loading a battery or doing stuff with the plane make sure your body is out of the way of the prop and always turn the radio on before the aircraft because some aircraft are weird and they will throttle to  if there is no connection.As for LiPo batteries you should really charge them outside and pay attention while you are charging them LiPos sometimes do fail and its better to be outside than inside if that happens,hoggit,dfjlgg1,10,t5_2tifv

11538254,0,t3_64nh0u,The faster the plane is the more Gs you will get with even small inputs. Unlike a slow prop plane that you can push the stick around and get a certain amount of Gs out of it when you are in a jet flying super fast pulling too hard on the stick will give you instantaneous G loads instead of slow gradual ones. The effect is that when pushing negative Gs you can get a slow gradual redout effect in a slow plane and a very fast GLock in a fast fighter plane if you pulled the negative Gs too quickly. So it really depends on the speed and how violent you are with your G load. Go ahead and test this out in DCS. Get a jet and fly at a comfortable  kts. Pull some negative Gs without just shoving the stick full forward. Watch the gradual redout. At least last I remember doing that for fun it still worked. I wouldnt know now I just dont pull negative Gs if I can help it.,hoggit,dg3v3b6,4,t5_2tifv
