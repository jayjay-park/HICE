555375,0,t1_cg31mlk,Yeah what I learned from others in MP Seelow Heights is that youre gonna want a lot of very mobile AT like a Flak  with a truck to tow it from danger. I saw allies doing this. Also you get two huge cannons in the back  use them. Resupply them with the supply truck.With infantry mostly you want them just to stay alive. The Russians can only get so close before they have to cross nomansland so as long as you got bullets heading out youll be okay. But when they close in but before they are point blank you need to pull back into the town or the home trench. MP is scarce so mostly you need to keep infantry alive.Lastly Im starting to think its a better idea to focus on some trenches more than others because they outnumber you hugely. In my games they all fall around the same time KVs yeah but I figured if I could hold the right for instance then Id only have to defend half the home trench.I dont know  its a really hard one. I think the best idea is to get some heavy artillery defend it well maybe lay mines and know when to run away.,menofwar,cg3ei9a,1,t5_2skni

599881,0,t3_20yeke,I think the UI improvements and new engine are worth something yeah. At any rate its like  atm.Edit I want to point out that this games main flaw that Im afraid wont improve is the playerbase size. A total of like  people even play this game online and the pp hosting is unreliable. Dedicated servers would be nicer of course.But the main problem is finding people in the first place. Sadly even if you do a lot are quite immature. One guy yesterday was setting TNT on my units in a v tking them then pretended he didnt know what hed done. We were at  points when I got the host to end the game and kick him. We didnt find a replacement.So two things Dont count of the community being good. And two dont grief in this game because theres a few people who if I see them and again theres like  of us I will make everyone knows of their griefing.,menofwar,cg8gkha,4,t5_2skni

Not sure how it was implemented in AS  since skirmish missions were the new thing but in the first men of war it would give you some points to purchase units then you would take them into battle on maps and complete random objectives. ,menofwar,cot1533,1,t5_2skni

7568890,0,t1_d3227kh,Honestly the only trick to it is to remember that you share points so just ask eachother before you buy then make sure the other person gives you your units once they arrive. Other than that nothing particularly strange with the buying system.,menofwar,d32jnsq,1,t5_2skni
