4805031,0,t1_cu03gi6,I would be more than happy to contribute. However I have to caution you against using any Googlerelated services. If you intend your project to remain super secret youve already made secrecy impossible by discussing the matter on Gchat. As mentioned in this subs stickied threads three friends of rsocialistprogrammers namely tsukamoto Mara and sstersoldierLadyJane maintain a hidden IRC called leftsec. I encourage you to join the IRCP network and our channel. ,socialistprogrammers,cu07po9,5,t5_30bmy
