4195457,0,t3_38vn0q,Any combination of Shadowjackseither of the hunter hybrids seems to be the safest bet.  Stealth and stuns are by far the most useful abilities in this game.Alchemists just arent worth the effort.  Their flasks can backfire hard brewtalists probably have the highest damage capability in the game but are not worth the risk and boomstrikers are good but trickshots do the essentially the same thing with stealth.,massivechalice,cryh9fk,2,t5_2xekj
4237560,0,t3_3983nx,I think alchemists are useful against certain types of enemies. If you notice that youre going against cradles or seeds then they are worth it. Otherwise I dont generally think they are.,massivechalice,cs39usq,1,t5_2xekj
5297521,0,t1_cusalso,I didnt find boomstrikers all that powerful until they got to level  but perhaps I just didnt have enough experience using them.I liked hunters fine but I particularly liked the trickshots ability to shoot an item  combined with the perilous core it provided a guaranteed instant kill which was very useful for the first ish years.  I found this ability less important in the last  years as my folks got more powerful.Similarly I really liked my shadowjacks for the first  years or so.  They could scout ahead in stealth mode and where more durable than hunters when I needed them to break stealth and take out some of the enemy.  I also enjoyed their stun ability.  I similarly found them less and less useful as time went on.Have you tried that hard run yet?  I havent but have similar concerns to you  a successful hard run may require some fortunate traits for the starting group of heroes.  I believe Ive even seen some people suggest restarting a few times if the initial batch of heroes do not have strong traits that align with your style of play.,massivechalice,cvoti5y,1,t5_2xekj
