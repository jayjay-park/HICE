4944028,0,t1_cuhp86a,Yeah what you wrote there is pretty much what I said in my deleted post ! I agree fully. The interviews he had with artists are really fun and makes the blog pop out more. I think making posts more bloglike can help to some degree but the fact that you have to click on each link open up a new window to listen makes it a hassle. Its way more enjoyable to just scroll down for me. I didnt even know there was a guideline before today. Another thing is that I miss looking at the feelgood pictures which were a part of the blog.,musigh,cuhqg5x,4,t5_348db
