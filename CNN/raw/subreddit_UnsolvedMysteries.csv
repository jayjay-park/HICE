4019343,0,t1_creet0f,I mentioned this in another comment I think that Burke had been sexually abusing her. The ME and other Drs who looked at the pictures all agreed she had a history of sexual abuse. I think Burke molested her with the paint brush handle after he had hit her in the head there was blood meaning she was still alive when that happened and before she was killed with the garotte.She had been wetting the bed according to the house keeper which is a known sign of sexual abuse. The house keeper also said she had found feces stains in her bed. Also Burke had smeared feces on things in JonBenets room.,UnsolvedMysteries,crefp1c,3,t5_2qmsc
4023004,0,t1_creet0f,I feel the same way its so hard to fathom the parents choosing to cover up the death like that. But  I lean towards the fact that Burke might have done the assault on his own at the same time he made the marks with the train tracks but before Patsy came and found the body.   There was evidence of sexual assault on Jonbenet in the months prior to her death. I wonder about Patsy and John Ramseys knowledgeinvolvement with the prior sexual assaults I still think the perpetrator of both the assaults and the murder was Burke  but wonder who else other than John and Patsy had access to the children that might have molested them in the past?One scenario I put forth is that upon Patsy discovering what Burke had done she was horrified.   Its possible that when she saw Jonbenets dead body in such a horrible state all she could think of was to wrap the body in blankets  and not move it because it freaked her out.  Or another scenario is that maybe she decided to stage it as a sexual assault to cover it up and to further put the blame on a mystery intruder.As much as I love to get to the bottom of a good mystery I really have to say I dont think well ever truly know exactly WHY the body was found the way it was.

9174871,0,t3_55wohv,So to be fair Netflix left out a lot of evidence. They were focused mainly on the people involved and the impact all of this had on them rather than presenting all the evidence that was found. She did things that at the time looked very guilty  her demeanor joking around in that underwear store cart wheels etc. The public had decided she was guilty before it even got to trial. It wasnt until the firstsecond appeal especially with the independent forensic examiners when everything was spelled out that it became pretty clear to the outside world other than Britain that she was innocent.I think a lot of her missteps were that she was a dumb adolescent girl who didnt think about how her actions would be interpreted. She was scared in a new place and naive and yes probably very infatuated with Sollecito. To Italians she looked promiscuous boisterous and uncaring. Youd have to google this to get the exact specifics but in Italy you can retryappeal an innocent verdict without any new evidence. In the US you cannot its considered double jeopardy. Once someone gets proven innocent in the court of law they are free to go unless new evidence is found to retry them. If I remember correctly the rd trial the retrial of her innocent verdict is practically considered a joke from the perspective of the US  it is not uncommon to have to go to the Supreme Court to find an impartial juryget the most correct determination. I followed the case pretty closely after her first conviction.edit corrected myself. ,UnsolvedMysteries,d8ezdig,10,t5_2qmsc

9761904,0,t3_5ezd9s,I watched it about  minutes ago and here are my thoughts. SPOILER ALERT. Duh.. In that era police wholeheartedly didnt want to believe in pedophilia or any other menacing theories because it made their jobs far harder. They also strictly prescribed to the rules including the whole hr waiting period. I suppose for many years there were more runaways than genuine abductions  violent situations. Processes are changed for a reason I suppose unfortunately this and the subsequent abductions were why these were changed. Also it seems like the Des Moines police were sticking to the party line as were the FBI. Most enforcement agencies do not throw each other under the bus and can be treated harshly for talking out of turn. I dont think its a conspiracy more just the thin blue line at work.. Paul Bonacci seemed credible and if anyone were to believe it itd be Noreen. I know most parents of missing children grasp at straws but by the point Paul Bonacci came to the table  shed done all her grasping.Not to mention the information that came out of his interviews led to the house in the woods with the carved initials etc. He had so much information that honestly made sense and he also had no reason to seek her out he clearly got no pleasure out of seeing her. He actually seemed genuinely upset and guilty.  . It seems plausable that he did visit her as often victims find a way to send a message to their loved ones as they are seeking closure but not always a reunion with them. Again I see no reason for her to lie as itd actually hurt her case to find Johnny not help it. As by that point hed be in his teens and considered a runaway as he again  left voluntarily this time. If he were returning to that life and the people involved in those rings or living rough as a teen  he may have met a bad end after that. OR hes actually alive and just keeping a low profile in order to protect himself  his family. Potentially he could have contacted Noreen again and as shes not been under oath since she may keep her silence  be keeping her silence. . Most likely hes part of the cycle of predators if he wasnt able to escape and find help. Hopefully he was able to get some therapy and medication to assist with his likely trauma and PTSD assuming he is alive. Its all pure speculation but we all like to have hope. . On this topic is Why Johnny Cant Come homeThe The Franklin Scandal A Story of Powerbrokers Child Abuse amp Betrayal and also there is The Franklin Coverup Child Abuse Satanism and Murder in Nebraska which were referenced in this documentary. ,UnsolvedMysteries,dagdesh,14,t5_2qmsc
