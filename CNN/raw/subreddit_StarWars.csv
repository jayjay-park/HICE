20921,0,t1_cef7am0,But wont JJ Abrams been writing a large part of the story not Disney themselves they will have a say in the final cut though. Im pretty sure Disney cancelled CW merely because they wanted a clean slate from preexisting media,StarWars,cegtcl0,1,t5_2qi4s
28331,0,t1_cehhdit,There are in fact rules to be adhered to. All of the books were written to maintain the overarching story although some contradictions and holes will slip through here and there. I believe the magazine WIRED did an interesting article on the guy who is in charge of overseeing it all and making sure everything fits together. This was probably  years ago interesting read.I have been reading all of the books since I was a kid and it will always be the real Star Wars story to me. It seems a forgone conclusion that the new movies will not adhere to these stories Disney and JJ Abrams are looking to make a blockbuster CG orgy and the books wont fit into that. They may still be good in their own right I hope they are. But I will look at them the same way I do some of the video games and some of the early comic books or even Splinter of the Minds Eye Some interesting stories based in the Star Wars Universe but irrelevant to the overall story and not canon.,StarWars,cehnovs,2,t5_2qi4s

Yes Grievous is awesome in it but like uVakarianGarrus already said the action at times is seriosuly ridiculous. I love crazy action but come on a show needs more than just tons of ridiculous over the top action. There is zero character development zero anything other than action really. There is like  minute scenes of Clones just standing around shooting wildly. Its so ridiculous I couldnt help but laugh at times. The newer show does have its seriously awful episodes but the good episodes are so good they more than make up for the bad ones. I wouldnt really say either show is better than the other.

Step Three Luke surrenders himself to Jabba. Now Luke Han Chewie and a disguised Lando will be together on the prisoner barge above the Sarlaac.  A formidable fighting force for sure.

I wanted the Star Wars theme to be subtle and when you swipe to empty homescreens then the theme becomes much more apparent The way I changed the background was by using this Tasker profile slightly modified to suit my needs. Basically I just changed the zip code. I used these backgrounds renaming them like the wallpapers in the zip on the Tasker profile above. The backgrounds are sized for a Moto X x and the middle screen shouldnt be too busy to put shortcuts on. That was a big deal for me I didnt want too much wallpaper getting in the way of my main screen. Icons used were Minimal White Rings and I created my own app launcher icon. For the widgets I used Wizz Widgets Agenda and Beautiful Widgets Pro with the S JB . theme. Tapping the clock takes me to a detailed weather forecast. The launcher is Nova Prime with the grid set at  rows and  columns.Expanded desktop is on and I use PIE controls and a hidden statusbar for the fullscreen look.Heres how all the homescreens look when swiped from left to rightHeres the main homescreen superimposed on just the wallpaper imagesI tried to combine everything I do regularly into one screen.

431603,0,t3_1z0acj,I understand why it is done the way it is but I always thought that the events of the ep III would have probably been much more significant over the long term. Not only was it the death of the Republic and the beginning of the new Empire but it also represented the destruction of the entire Jedi Order from an institutional perspective. I dont really know how much of this was covered in the EU but the Jedi which had been both around and significant for millennia would have probably suffered a virtually complete erasure of knowledge and techniques. It is probably safe to assume that the Empire under Palpatine would have purged the Jedi Archives of anything that would have been genuinely useful to a new Order though they probably would have kept stuff like their detailed records of planetary locations and species.Even if Luke the Solo twins and maybe Ventress and Tanno and others were able to rebuild the Jedi Order it still would have been a fundamentally different organization than the one that had been destroyed at least for a thousand years or so. The jedi may never have been numerous but they were incredibly influential all throughout the galaxy.An even more realistic beginning calendar date would probably have something to do with the Vong invasion I think thats what they were called as I said I dont actually know the EU all that well but then most casual SW fans dont really know much about that so it wouldnt make sense in our Universe just in theirs.,StarWars,cfpi10t,1,t5_2qi4s

Besides that there are mostly more targets when fighting non JediSith so consentration would be devised.When he first came to Mortis Anakin was mostly in the gray area of the force. As events progressed he started to slip further into the Dark side.Masters are shown because they give us an example of the sheer badassery that is the power of the Force. That and they are more likely to survive long and teach us plausible lessons do not forget that Anakin is still a knight.

586421,0,t3_20urkq,I dont know if this is correct or not but I read about the sith and how the have the rule of two doctrine which is Two there should be no more no less. One to embody power the other to crave it.This rule is do to their belief that if the there is only two Sith Lords to access the force then they will have greater control. Kind of in the sense that there being so many Jedi waters down the force.This was always my explanation as to why Obi Wan is able to defeat Anikan even though he is a more skilled at the time. Obi Wan fights him after order  making less Jedi accessing the force making him stronger. Maybe.Luke comes along and has solo access to the force due to the fact most Jedi have been eradicated. Possible explaining how he so quickly gains cotton of the force. Also he has two former Jedi counselors teaching him along the way in Yoda and ObiWan.And as far as mastering light saver techniques so quickly you could assume that throwing him into the situation makes it a learn now or die option. Maybe.,StarWars,cg6xhvm,-6,t5_2qi4s

587275,0,t1_cg6xhvm,Youre missing the true point of the rule of two. The aspect of craving for power is the key. With only two Sith at a time it is assumed that at a point the apprentice will overpower the master. Thus the master will have been unworthy of the title of Master any longer. A cycle of this would keep producing stronger and stronger Sith.The Jedi did not believe in this hunt for power and allowed weaker beings to become Jedi. The idea of everyone being equal and seeking for greater power as a path to the dark side would lead to no one Jedi becoming very strong. Thus the power of the Jedi lay in numbers alone. ,StarWars,cg70zol,3,t5_2qi4s

589589,0,t3_20vqkb,I was a week shy of my th birthday and saw it at the Coronet theater in San Francisco. For those who have never been there it had two tiers of seating general in the lower level and the loge upper level and very far back. I went with my parents younger sister and brother and my grandmother who doesnt speak English.We got there around noon and it was a madhouse. The line went down the street around the block and down another street. The buzz was palpable and anticipation was high. The presentation was mm with Track Dolby Stereo. Unfortunately we had seats in the far right corner of the loge of a packed theater. Sound was terrible and the picture was less than immersive. Still with these downsides I was completely enveloped by it. My Dad however was less than impressed. Eventually I convinced him him to let us see it again but with General Admission seats.

592735,0,t3_20u7pj,Well I think that it has become understood that becoming strong with the force and using a light saber come hand in hand. First off Yoda never trained Luke how to use a light saber. Like not at all. They never touched it in his training. All of Lukes training with Yoda was with the force. Next thing the only reason JediSithetc are skilled with the light saber is because they are strong with the force. They are able to predict the actions of their opponent and from that they are able to do close range combat. Regular people just cant do something like that. They can because of the force. Soooo it makes you think that the more powerful you are with the force the better you are at fighting with a light saber. It comes automatically because fighting with a light saber stems entirely from your force power. BAM!,StarWars,cg7nc1n,2,t5_2qi4s

788965,0,t3_236ezd,gt Does the internet exist?Yes its called the HoloNet  It is basically a galaxyspanning highspeed internet accommodating data transmissions of many kinds.  The guy below is wrongits not just internet TV.gt How common are androids and cyber augmentations?Common enough but far from ubiquitous.  Bacta is a magical healing agent that allows people to often escape without having to turn to prosthetics.  Androids existed but were not typical.  If you want to be technical CPO is an android as he somewhat resembles a human in his appearance but that is not the focus of his purpose.  There were actual androids like Human Replica DroidsCyber augmentations were pretty common.  Aurra Sings antenna Ton Phanans body Lukes hand etc.  Lobot is a cyborg.Palpatine was able to transfer his consciousness into clone bodies by means of an ancient Sith technique of spiritual transference but synthetic brains and consciousnesscontaining technology do not really exist.  If you look at The Old Republic the brains of soldiers were put into droids and some of them still retained their thoughts from when they were humans a quest on Balmorra I think.gt Are there...other cases of technology that might diminish or neutralize the effects of the force...?Cortosis was a rare ore that interfered with the beams of lightsabers.  It could successfully prevent a lightsaber from cutting through something by means of weaving the ore into the blade of a sword or armor.  Contact between a lightsaber and cortosis sometimes necessitated a reignition of the lightsaber.There are things like a neural band that could defendprevent against Forceusers trying to infiltrate ones mind or compel them through the Force.Theres other shit but you can find that on your own.

860319,0,t1_ch20mcu,Quoted from WookieepediaIn  Lucas Licensing appointed Leland Chee to create a continuitytracking database referred to as the Holocron continuity database. The Holocron follows the canon policy that has been in effect for years but the capabilities of database software allow for each element of a story rather than the stories themselves to be classified on their own merits.Gcanon is George Lucas Canon the six Episodes and any statements by George Lucas including unpublished production notes from him or his production department that are never seen by the public. Elements originating with Lucas in the movie novelizations reference books and other sources are also Gcanon though anything created by the authors of those sources is Ccanon. When the matter of changes between movie versions arises the most recently released editions are deemed superior to older ones as they correct mistakes improve consistency between the two trilogies and express Lucass current vision of the Star Wars universe most closely. The deleted scenes included on the DVDs are also considered Gcanon when theyre not in conflict with the movie.Tcanon or Television Canon refers to the canon level comprising the feature film Star Wars The Clone Wars and the two television shows Star Wars The Clone Wars and the Star Wars liveaction TV series It was devised recently in order to define a status above the CLevel canon as confirmed by Chee.Ccanon is Continuity Canon consisting of all recent works and many older works released under the name of Star Wars books comics games cartoons nontheatrical films and more. Games are a special case as generally only the stories are Ccanon while things like stats and gameplay may not be they also offer noncanonical options to the player such as choosing female gender for a canonically male character. Ccanon elements have been known to appear in the movies thus making them Gcanon examples include the name Coruscant swoop bikes Quinlan Vos Aayla Secura YT freighters and Action VI transports.Scanon is Secondary Canon the materials are available to be used or ignored as needed by current authors. This includes mostly older works such as much of the Marvel Star Wars comics that predate a consistent effort to maintain continuity it also contains certain elements of a few otherwise Ncanon stories and other things that may not fit just right. Many formerly Scanon elements have been elevated to Ccanon through their inclusion in more recent works by continuityminded authors while many other older works such as The Han Solo Adventures were accounted for in continuity from the start despite their age and thus were always Ccanon.N is NonCanon. Whatif stories such as stories published under the Infinities label and anything else directly and irreconcilably contradicted by higher canon ends up here. N is the only level that is not considered canon by Lucasfilm. Information cut from canon deleted scenes or from canceled Star Wars works falls into this category as well unless another canonical work references it and it is declared canon.D is Detours Canon used for material hailing from Star Wars Detours.,StarWars,ch22nhg,7,t5_2qi4s

887536,0,t1_ch55qli,Thats kinda self contradictory. If Lucas had full creative control over Star wars then he signed off on all the EU content and is therefore responsible for it even if he didnt write it directly. I also never said that Lucas or Disney should have to consult with the writers of fan fictions and classifying officially published Novels comics video games and RPGs and fan fiction is ridiculous I said that they should consult people who have a better understanding of the universe and the canon to avoid writing ridiculous contradictions especially when theyre not necessary.I understand the clean slate thing because the EU is so dense. My problem stems from the fact that the newer content that is being preserved as top tier canon is some of the weakest content story wise. Lucas gave birth to Star Wars but he sent it off to other writers to raise it. Most of them did an amazing job and now we have a mature universe. His response has been to go back and undo that either at will or through ignorance of his own creation.,StarWars,ch55zns,2,t5_2qi4s

Interviews or commentaries by Lucas are irrelevant. My personal favorite interpretation is that it is Luke who brings balance to the force by using both the light and the dark side but without giving in to the dark side. He uses his anger and his attachment to Leia to give him power but in the end his goal is not more power his goal is selfless so he proves you can use the dark side and not be consumed by it. Again its all interpretation. But my only point is just that Lucas never made it explicit in the films so there is a lot of room for interpretation. ,StarWars,chcdj3s,5,t5_2qi4s

The plot literally does not make sense concerning character motivation and everything just does not feel special like the originals did. There are so many images from the OT that resonate in our collective memories and in the PT there are nowhere near as much.Also the prequels basically just stole a ton of concepts and motifs from the originals. Look they are visually appealing and are interesting if you really love Star Wars but honestly the stories are not on the same level. Which sucks because with the right care and effort in filmmaking they could have been.,StarWars,chhdfv8,24,t5_2qi4s

The  show obviously was made after the movies. The show is good and I recommend watching it at some point but only about  or so is really relevant to whats happening in the movies.

I dont give a shit about the convention scene or the idiots on tumblr no one can deny theres a lot of idiots on tumblr but theres a lot of idiots on reddit too that talk about it.I cant even figure out what youre saying frankly. You say theres nothing wrong with geekiness which traditionally involves being in fandoms based around certain franchises and getting involved with those franchises in a number of ways one of which may be collecting merchandise. I dont see why you have a problem with somebody wearing a batman bag or a pokemon hat. Theyre a fan of something that they like to show off to people. This helps them connect with other fans. Would it be totally awesome for you blue collar businessman to come into the office one day flaunting his new batman backpack. Hell yeah! That shows the dude has character.You seem to have this belief that geekiness is something private and secret and individual and to display your geekiness is to expose yourself to the critique of the outside world which you know will critique it because of your experiences ?. So what frankly. Star Wars is one of the most popular franchises in the world so most of the people you meet are also going to be fans of the thing youre flaunting with your merchandise so why would they judge you or deride you?You say you understand how society works but you profess indignation at the system of capitalism and the state of democracy in your country. Which leads me to believe youre the sort of basement dweller you derided earlier youre content to sit there and critique the world and laugh at people for showing openly that they like something as if somehow you are better than them?Infantilism What the fuck does that even mean? If you truly understood how society works youd realise that societies are constantly in flux that what is popular andor socially acceptable will change constantly. All you have to do is look at the demographics of people who like something to see that sometimes who a piece of entertainment is aimed at may not be the same person it appeals to. So all those grown men that like that My Little Pony show. I dont watch it I dont intend to but apparently its very popular with late teens early twenties males. Does that make those men infantilised because they like something made for kids. Almost certainly by your definition. But what about the millions of people of all ages that play Nintendo games such as the Super Mario franchise which is family friendly and whilst it might not be squarely aimed at kids does work perfectly as a piece of entertainment for children. Does that make adults that play that game infantilised?What about young teens that play GTA COD Battlefield or if were running with that Batman rucksack from earlier Arkham AsylumCity. Are they infantilised because they play games filled with exlicit blood death sex crime and violence. Are those games aimed at them?Ill leave you to try and justify yourself in a reply to this.,StarWars,chlv3qe,1,t5_2qi4s

Imagine being Kit Fisto or Sinsasee tin and being told by Mace that that shit disturber Anakin said the Chancellor was Sith. Youd be more than a little incredulous. Now factor that disbelief on a surprise attack when you think youre king shit and that spells disaster. Imagine if you were secret service and you got told Obama was actually Osama.

1143911,0,t3_277zzz,gt  Palpatine orchestrates an invasion on his own planet so that hell be elevated to Chancellor due to the inaction of Vellorum?Yeah thats pretty much it for that whole event. Palpy just used it to drum up sympathy for himself while simultaneously making Valorum look really bad. If you remember he even tells Amidala gt If I may say so Your Majesty the Chancellor has little realpower...he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption...Which we can kinda guess is probably also his own doing. gt Shmi is virgin mother? She says Anakin has no father.She is. The exact details are never fully explained though Palpys story in Revenge of the Sith about Darth Plagueis being able to create life certainly carries an interesting implication that perhaps the Sith were somehow involved.... gtOn several occasions including Master Windu in Ep.III states that the prophecy promises that a Jedi will bring balance to the force. Are the Jedi too powerful thus the force bears Shmi a child to later join the Sith to actually restore balance?According to George Lucas himself the prophecy is fulfilled at the end of Return of the Jedi when Vader kills Palpy and basically himself as well. That being said inuniverse the Force is really supposed to be pretty mysterious so the interpretation of a prophecy like that is pretty openended. Maybe its something theyll address in episode ?gt The Sith Lord Future Galactic Emperor uses droids and the funny fish people Neimoidian  spent  min finding name to attack Naboo as part of a trade embargo dispute. But in the following movies the Sith Lord attacks the droid army with his clones. What motivates the Neimoidian and allies to fight against the Jedi and Clones of the Senate alliance? Do they just dislike the Jedi and democracy? Yet Palpatine turns it into a Galactic Empire something that is an alternative seemingly favourable to Duku Greivous Neimoidian etc.Several things motivate the Trade Federation and later the Separatists. The trade federation it is implied are simply promised some kind of deal by Darth Sidious who is probably just playing off their greed. As for the Separatists many of them are motivated by the fact that the Galactic Senate has grown corrupt over the millennia and are a legitimate political movement that is unwittingly used by Palpatine for his plot.gt Who placed an order on the Clones? The Giraffe cloner aliens say that it was Master Sypha Dias but Obi Wan later says that Sypha Dias died earlier than the order was placed. Is this a coverup of Palpatines doings since the planet is also erased from the archives?Sifo Dyas actually did live long enough to place the order I think. Its a bit vague but he was eventually killed by Dooku and Palpy. And yes Dooku having once been a Jedi was probably the one to erase it from the archives to keep it secret until the time was right.gt Does that mean that they cloners are lying or were they lied to with regards to the person who ordered them?Judging off the Clone Wars show it seems they pretty much know whats really going on and are basically just in it for the money.gt The clones attack the Jedi when ordered to execute order . This would mean that they were previously trained this command as part of the clone training back on the secret ocean cloner planet? Does that mean the Cloners are in alliance with the Sith Lord and simply doing their job for the cash not caring about backstabbing the Jedi?In the Clone Wars show they explain exactly how Order  works. Basically the Cloners are indeed taking orders straight from Dooku and just care about the money.gt Why does Bounty Hunter Jango Fett accept being used as the genetic source for the clones yet later on join the droid Duku locust aliens etc. and dies fighting with them.... against the Jedi and the very clones he helped create?I think he really only cared about the paycheck.gt Does Count Duku know that Sen. Palpatine is actually the Sith Lord? I think so.Yeah he would know. gtThen does that mean he readily lies to the Neimoidian people so they drum up a droid army? The Emperors Clones then defeat the droids and bolsters the sentiment in the Senate that a Galactic Empire needs to be instated to fight the droid rebels?Bingo.gt I dont understand the position of Duku and what he is trying to get. He is a Sith lord that crossed over to the dark side and fight the Jedi in alliance with the droids against his master with the Clones?Dooku is simply following his Masters orders. He is acting as an influential political figure just like Palpatine only leading the Confederacy. This way Palpatine has complete control over both sides of the war which he slowly used to build up his executive power as well as build distrust against the jedi and build support for himself so everyone will jump on board his new Empire when everything is ready.gt Duku stresses the importance of finishing the Death Star which he then express couriers to the Emperor. Does that mean Duku allied with the Neimoidians and Locust to create droids and Death Star battle plans then sets them up for a loss to elevate Palpatine from Chancellor to Galactic Empire?Again bingo. They were simply being used the whole time poor chumps.gt Somehow the Droid Rebels Kidnap Chancellor Palpatine so Anakin and Obi Wan rescue him. Was Palpatine planning on being rescued or was he expecting a longer kidnapping? Why would he want to be kidnapped to generate more Dictatorship sentiment in the senate?Thats a bit more unclear but it might have to do directly with him wanting to test Dooku against Anakin who hed been eyeing as a better apprentice. And sure enough Anakin proved stronger.gt What is up with Grievous why is he fighting with the droids? I dont understand the motives of this character other than a formidable foe for Obi Wan to fight.They never really explain in the films but it could be he simply believes in the Separatists cause. In the EU theres a much more complicated explanation that I like but it isnt really cannon anymore.gt Does Palpatine reveal to the senate that he is a Sith? I didnt interpret that he did although he did say that the Jedi made an attempt on his life. I am not completely sure why nobody would question that and readily accept the murder of the Jedi as an acceptable retaliation. I guess Sith gonna Sith.He made it look like the Jedi were attempting to take over the Republic and that he simply defended himself. He probably left out the part about using a lightsaber and shooting out force lightning though. gt The Jedi then take a beating and also lose any ability to use the Clone army. Yoda fails to kill Palpatine so they all go off into exile. Anakins twins are separated and fostered by Anakins HalfBrother and a Senator?Theyre split up so the Sith wont sense them more easily. As for why Luke is placed with Anakins relatives its perhaps due to how painful returning to Tatooine would be for Vader with everything that happened to him there.gt Is there an explanation why General Chewbacca would leave his home world to smuggle goods with Solo?The long standing EU explanation was that Chewie was captured by the Empire at some point and a slightly younger Han Solo saved him at which point due to wookiee customs Chewie owed him a life debt and basically pledged his life to himgt Why did they decide to build a Death Star again? Even from the perspective of making a sequel to a movie why not make a different design? Why was the empire so convinced a Planet destroying battlestation is superior to clones and the Jumbo Battleship for running around after the Rebels? Is the Emperor afraid that the Systems he controls are losing favour with him so he makes a Death Star to scare them back into place? Thats what I generally understood.Thats basically it. Its supposed to be so utterly terrifying that the Galaxy gives up and accepts the Empires rule. Imagine the threat of your entire planet being obliterated if some of your citizens start to rebel a little too much. Everyone would try to placate the empire as much as possible. Too bad they never really last long enough to actually have a large effect.gt Why was Luke able to sense the turmoil and doubt in Vader yet the Emperor was unable to see that Vader still had good in him? How was the Emperor able to see events unfold but not see Vaders betrayal or his own death?Your overconfidence is your weakness Luke observed. Its basically that simple he got too cocky.gt Did Vader realize just as he did with Duku that Luke was meant to kill his father and give into the dark side to join the Emperor as his new chew toy err  apprentice.Probably. Vader was actually planning on having Luke join him to kill Palpy so they could rule. And this was basically all he was concerned with. He wanted to kill Palpy and Palpy probably even knew it. It is afterall the Sith way. Just as its also the sith way to constantly test your apprentice with other candidates in case someone better comes a long. Sith arent very loyal.,StarWars,chyaver,2,t5_2qi4s

1349242,0,t1_cile8y5,No not low T. Probably depression. Dude was pretty heartbroken over how Zach and Mirri performed at the box office. The movie had a ton of buzz. He was expecting it to be his biggest film yet. Then it made just a little more than Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Hes been in a tail spin of depression ever since. I was an avid listener of his SModcast up until . He started becoming a big proponent of marijuana use and smoking a ton. Kev is kinda like most Hollywood types who come from really humble backgrounds. He worked hard on making movies rewriting revising being a perfectionist. Like George was during the initial trilogy.Then he struck big and started to surround himself with friends yesmen and sycophants. Like George when the prequel trilogy was being made. Now Kev hangs out mostly with the same guys hes hung out with since he was a clerk at a convenience store in Jersey. Except hes a millionaire a few times over and a recognizable name in Hollywood. No one wants to tell him Hey man Cop Outs script kinda sucks maybe you should revise it a little to fit your directing style. Or Hey man the reason why youre really emotional and smoking a ton of pot these days is because you cant cope with reality and youre depressed. Maybe you should see someone and get on some meds. Instead theyre guys who dont want to stop sucking from the famemoney train teat and just tell him everything he does is awesome and everything is okay. Kevs flaming descent is a lot slower than the other stars out there because hes got a great wife who keeps him grounded and supports him. The only problem is that he needs someone in his life to tell him the hard things he doesnt want to hear because theyre good for him. ,StarWars,cilf3p4,4,t5_2qi4s

Eventually it consumes you to the point that you are no longer able to serve any purpose beyond feeling the high you get from using it.

1751480,0,t1_cjzwpxl,I think the first crystal they find is supposed to be one they have some connection to through the force. At least according to the Clone Wars series. In the EU it was seemingly more about the process of building the lightsaber than the specific crystal. That process was a learning one at first but afterwards any Jedi could make a lightsaber fairly quickly and easily. Choosing to learn a new lightsaber fighting style was the hard part about it not constructing another saber.But thats part of the reason I dont like that they decanonized the entirety of EU but kept the Clone Wars series canon. It feels like they only did it because it was a visual medium popular and because of recency bias. The series had more than one questionable thing done in it that was better explaineddone in the EU.I mean just as a quick related example the rareness of the crystal and it apparently being extremely valuable according to the series.

There are a lot of great restaurants and events around the area and feel free to message me if you are looking for advice on where to go and what to check out.  Oak Lawn is doing a Fall festival on the grounds of the library  Raymond Ave next weekend.  It could be a great way to meet people from around the area and get to know some of the local businesses.  You should for sure check out Portillos as it is a local restaurant not as local as it used to be. There are several in the area and they have a delicious Italian beef sandwich and a great chopped salad if you arent in to heart failure.  ,StarWars,ck1koy8,3,t5_2qi4s

He controlled the Separatists droid army AND the RepublicSenate clone army. The clones were made for the Republic. Who was the Supreme Chancellor at that time? Palpatine. To whom did Dooku answer to? Palpatine.gt Did the clone troopers become the stormtroopers? If so how and why?It was basically a name change. Taken directly from the SW Wikigt When Emperor Palpatine declared the formation of the first Galactic Empire the clones of the late Jango Fett were rechristened as Imperial stormtroopers.As for your last question I think it was a combination of clones and recruits?

It just doesnt work. Unless you overpower the enemy to the point that they can TPK the party and barely get hit themselves in which you have a TPK your enemy will be gangbanged into oblivion by the party. Neither of these makes for an interesting fight.So give the villain bodyguards. Dont face a Sith Lord face a Sith Lord and his apprentice. Dont face General Grievous face General Grievous and two Magnaguards.With a fight like this you can use the space more effectively moving around the chamber.What Id REALLY recommend of course is that you switch to the new Fantasy Flight system and its narrative dice but it sounds like youre already committed to the homebrew youve got plus Forceuser support is pretty light for now and wont really be up to speed for another year.,StarWars,ckljgoc,2,t5_2qi4s

That said Thrawns suggestion to defend the shield generator was to blast a barren area of  kilometers around the shield generator and leave a bunch of heavy guns to defend the place. The Emperor however wanted a trap. Most of the battle goes rather well in space for the Empire despite the fact that Piett is killed.

2132011,0,t1_clatkfo,The story would seem totally disjointed and have no purpose or plot. TCW is a show of story arcs there are some filler episodes to move you from one arc to another especially in the first  seasons as they are feeling out the tone and direction of the show but most introduce a character or topic that will eventually come in to play later on. Some of the show is targeted towards kids but most of Star Wars itself is for the most part we all fell in love with it as a kids and so theyll do what they can to bring more kids into the community but I would actually say that especially after season  the show takes a very dark turn and Im surprised it wasnt tv for most of  the episodes.,StarWars,clatq6m,2,t5_2qi4s
2132400,0,t3_2je3f0,People like it because every has their own taste in entertainment. I loved it all the way through even with the occasional dud because it told fun entertaining stories that enriched the universe and characters and were just plain cool to watch. As to your specific grievances. Ahsoka was a test. Its there plain and simple in the movie. They want Anakin to grow through his teaching and more importantly work through some of his attachment issues by becoming close with a padawan as he trains her and learning to let go when she is knighted and ready to move on by herself. Obviously that test backfired massively but thats why it happened. . The battle droids were an extension of the road the were headed down in Episode II and especially Episode III. They took the occasional slapstick comedy bit from the movies and just ran with it. Its comedic relief for children plain and simple. I wasnt a fan but thats not nearly enough to outweigh the good of the series.. Ventress is not a Sith just like the inquisitor in Rebels isnt. She wasnt a new character for the series either and the idea of dark side allies to the Sith has been around in sooooo many incarnations over the years. Emperors hands Sith Acolytes Dark Side Adepts Dark Jedi etc. The general idea is that they have some degree of Force potential and are trained as allies and tools by Palpatine or Vader or in this case Dooku but they arent taught everything and there is no expectation that they are to eventually kill the master and take up the mantle of Sith lord.,StarWars,clavid5,2,t5_2qi4s

2478397,0,t1_cmi1qx7,I totally get that if it wasnt for the EU we wouldnt have gotten the incredible resurgence of Star Wars that we enjoy today. EU material has given us an incredible amount of depth that we would have never gotten from just the movies alone. I think the moment where I stopped caring about the EU as a canon source was while playing The Force Unleashed . I hated that game! It was the first thing from Star Wars that I hadnt loved. I guess when I discovered that there were different levels of canon I was relieved that in my head that story never had to happen. Now watching Rebels I can sit there and enjoy the show despite knowing that it is writing over The Force Unleashed  and possibly Star Wars Dark Times one of my favourite comics.I guess what Im getting at is that its important that these filmmakers not be encumbered by twenty years worth of stories that a majority of the audience will never know or care about. I appreciate these stories but am not precious about them and thats helped me to enjoy TCW and Rebels a lot more. And it will probably help me enjoy the sequel trilogy a lot more too!.,StarWars,cmi2bi2,1,t5_2qi4s

I am simply pointing out that if no EU names not necessarily plot points were used then there would be no danger about sharing the names of characters. As for children I think only one will be a child of the main trilogy characters. SpoilerMan suggested Isaacs character had the last name Darklighter not me though a nod to a minor character seems appropriate. Again others not me have been pointing to a two sided war with the former Rebels facing off with Former Imperials in a  war of attrition. I dont think this is the case I think those will be two factions in a more chaotic galaxy with other power groups and less clear cut lines.

2517362,0,t3_2ofrej,Im at the beginning of Season  now. Here are to me the best the show has to offer in the first  seasons Ryloth Arc Season  episodes  Storm Over Ryloth Innocents of Ryloth Liberty on Ryloth Geonosis Arc Season  episodes  Landing at Point Rain Weapons Factory Legacy of Terror Brain Invaders  you can also include episode  Senate Spy but thats rather peripheral setup to the arc Mandalore Arc Season  episodes  The Mandalore Plot Voyage of Temptation Duchess of Mandalore The second Mandalore Arc Season  episodes  amp  Corruption amp The Academy Heroes on Both Sides Season  episode  episode  Pursuit of Peace is a followup and Season  episode  Senate Murders takes place after both but only Heroes is any good IMO Nightsisters Arc Season  episodes  Nightsisters Monster Witches of the Mist Mortis Arc Season  episodes  Overlords Altar of Mortis Ghosts of Mortis  DEFINITELY WATCH THIS ONE Citadel Arc Season  episodes  The Citadel Counterattack Citadel RescueI also really enjoyed the first arc of Season  episodes  Water War Gungan Attack Prisoners but the second part heavily features Jar Jar and other Gungans as does the third though less so than the first. But its a great look into Mon Cala and its culture and features some of the best battle sequences in the show so far.Im also in the middle of and loving the Umbara arc which is a few episodes later. Again features some stunning battle sequences.So basically it only gets really good in Season  but there are some pretty okay Season  and  arcs as well.Note that your mileage may vary on the Mandalore arcs as theyre a rather different take on Mandalore culture than the previous EU depiction of the planet and its people. I loved it though. Its more political and less actionheavy than stuff like Landing at Point Rain and Darkness on Umbara though.,StarWars,cmn5nzo,1,t5_2qi4s

Episode  DOES set up Anakins attack on the Sand People but Episode  in and of itself rehashes the conflict well enough on its own. It makes that particular part of Episode  unnecessary. As for the Trade Federation that whole arc became moronically convoluted with the introduction of Dooku. Episode  sets up the Trade Federation as this backdoor scheme by Palpatine which I admit is brilliant but then we have Count Dooku and we dont know how he fits into the established plot if Palpatine is the one backing it. If we started at Episode  we have Dooku as the prequels established villain the guy masterminding the Separatist plot secretly allied with the future Emperor. Its a little bit more compelling than the trilogy as a whole. ,StarWars,cmpg028,0,t5_2qi4s

2551706,0,t3_2oxsb2,gt So why does old Obiwan decide to give up and become one with the Force after  seconds when his friends could really use a diversion as they get to their ship?This one is easy.First of all he already served his purpose as a diversion.  After Vader strikes him down Vader and his stormtroopers dont have time to make it to the closing blast door.Second of all its very clear that Obi Wan voluntarily drops his defenses to Vader.  He raises his blade to vertical and closes his eyes.  He allows Vader to strike him down.  He only does this when he sees that Luke is watching.  You see Obi Wan knows what a risk Luke poses.  He knows Lukes father was easily turned and fears that Luke could also be easily turned.  But he saw this confrontation with Vader witnessed by Luke coming when they were on Tatooine and he fed Luke the lie about Vader killing Lukes father.When Obi Wan allows Luke to see Vader kill him too he cements in Luke the idea that Vader is truly evil and not to be trusted.  This is the sacrifice Obi Wan makes to give Luke and the Rebellion the best chance to triumph over Palpatine and Vader.,StarWars,cmrn8h1,86,t5_2qi4s

2795927,0,t1_cnjgmzy,Mandalore is near featless and is not force sensitive. And Maul would defeat revan in lightsaber combat so struggling with him is not a low point. Malak was featless and held only a title. Also it is implied revan won against malak mostly by force and not saber combat. He has very weak dueling feats while obi wan has dueled maul and anakin to a standstill defeated greivous and beats ventress often as well. He has also preformed well against dooku. Its laughable saying he is on par with the force. Redirecting lightning is a good feat but Nyriss is of an unspecified strength. Meanwhile obi wan redirected telekentic blasts from Anakin which I would put on the same destructive levels as Nyrisss lightning. Revan has more knowledge of the force for sure but strength wise im not so sure.Telekinetically they would be even. Revan has collapsed an archway ObiWan has collapsed a huge slab of durasteel. Revan has blasted a pair of heavy durasteel doors wide open  ObiWan has manipulated Durges ship. Revan has utilized Saber Throw and so has ObiWan. Revan has used Choke on an Imperial Officer ObiWan has pushed a boy into a bin and froze him in place. There is no real disparity between them.To address the healing point Revan has only used heal once to my knowledge and that was against Vitate. He healed some pretty bad burns from lightning but the healing took some amount of time. Obi Wan doesnt have lightning or anything to injure him badly like that so it is not of too much relevance.,StarWars,cnlvxbh,0,t5_2qi4s

2912984,0,t3_2th9pk,I would say that Anakins connection to the Force was weakened somewhat by the neardeath on Mustafar and the fact that much of his body was replaced by mechanical and electronic components.  But it really wasnt THAT much.Most of Anakins amazing ability as a Jedi and therefore Sith in battle was lost because his mechanical physical body limited him greatly.  The suit was heavy and unwieldy because it was more lifesupport system than mechanical power suit.Also much of the more powerful Sith abilities that Palpatine could have taught him such as channelling lightning would have been impossible with his new bodywhich is ultimately what ended up killing him.  As for the powers Sidious learned from Plagueis ... I doubt Sidious ever gave Vader that knowledge for two reasons. After Padme was dead or at least Anakin thought she was dead he wouldnt have really wanted that knowledge as much.. Sidious would have probably not imparted this knowledge simply because it would have put him at risk for the usual Sith practice of assassination by apprentice.Powerwise in single combat Darth Vader was probably at the height of his power at the time of his fight on Mustafar with ObiWan.  After that he was still quite formidable but where he lost the ability to perform amazing feats of agility speed and superhuman leaps and such ... he gained vast amounts of other kinds of power.,StarWars,cnz7pqr,4,t5_2qi4s

Thats what its like in here. I call it the George Lucas bias  because without fail George Lucas will be the answer to any criticism of SW  no matter how small or illogical  uncritically and taken for granted. I guess people get sick of it  I know I do.  p,StarWars,co05uu4,4,t5_2qi4s

Captured by the Sith he was imprisoned for three years until a former lieutenant of his named Meetra Surik rescued him with the help of the Sith Lord Scourge. The trios attempt to eliminate the Sith Emperor failed and Revan was held captive by the Emperor for three hundred years until he was finally freed by Republic forces. Taking control of the Rakatan Foundry Revan attempted to construct an army of extermination droids to destroy the Empire but the Jedi Master died when he was defeated by an Imperial strike team.gt However the torture that he experienced at the hands of the Emperor had splintered Revans mind and though part of him attempted to become one with the Force the rest rejected death and clung to life embracing the dark side. Taking control of the fanatical Order of Revan he sought to destroy the Sith Emperor once and for all by bringing the Sith ruler back to a physical form and killing him but both the Empire and the Republic joined together in an effort to stop him. Revans light side was unable to pass on and aided the coalition in defeating the dark Revan and though the Emperor was able to regain his strength the two halves of Revan merged and were able to die a final death.,StarWars,co4lcc4,2,t5_2qi4s

3000142,0,t3_2ujlj9,You may not be aware but there are several versions of these movies. The original trilogy at least. Lucas has made little changes with every release the special editions in  the DVDS in  and the Blu Rays in  all contrain changes big and small. Purists myself included will tell you to avoid the Blu Rays and standard DVD sets as they contain lots of pointless additions tinkering and revisionism very little of which enhance the quality of the movies many of which actually make the movies worse. You can buy the theatrical version in a DVD boxset but some people say that they are not the same quality.As for the order Id watch the original trilogy first. The prequel trilogy episodes IIII are quite controversial. A lot of people hate them. Personally I dont hate them but I do not think they are anywhere near as good as the original movies so Id watch them after watching IV V VI. ,StarWars,co8yo29,2,t5_2qi4s

3027665,0,t1_cobt0tt,Well I get why TCW and Rebels have a different theme. Have you read anything that suggest they will go with the usual theme for the episodes? As I tried to say but perhaps didnt get across is that I dont think they will change it but fear it.I mean they seem to have lost the episode from the title. It is just Star Wars VII  The Force Awakens. Officially there is no episode in there the trailer logo doesnt even have a VII. Too me this is also stupid and yet another we want to distance us selves. I just dont think it is out of the realm of possibilities that they decide to tweak the theme a bit.In total all these small things and bigger things like throwing out EU and changing Korriban to Moraband the latter for no frakking reason generally makes me think that there is nothing sacred enough so that Disney will not touch. They changed the lightsaber although we still have left to see what is actually going in with those crossguards anything seems to be fair game.,StarWars,cobtd42,0,t5_2qi4s

3185769,0,t1_cos6eu0,I think a couple factor will lead to it being higher grossing than the prequels. While people were absolutely hyped for Episode I it immediately received disappointing reviews causing it to fail in the box office. Episode VII has the advantage of having most of the original cast back in it for the first time in  years and on top of that it isnt being directed by Lucas instead its being directed by Abrams who famously recently revived the Star Trek series And I thought did a pretty good job. Disney being involved will also certainly help.Depending on how the movie gets its initial reception it certainly has the potential of breaking the B mark.,StarWars,cos7e30,4,t5_2qi4s

3255245,0,t1_cozav4t,Yes this is true. What I mean is that the version that I linked to is based more accurately on the photos of the helmet we have seen.

However the pictures weve seen only depict the port on the wearers left side and there is an absence of a flat indented dark part. When you said that the helmet here fits with the evolution I thought you meant that this helmet was not meant to depict the VII helmet but rather that it was a complete invention to bridge the gap....

Lightsabers arent shown to be a magical blade that chops through any material at the slightest touch especially in the Original Trilogy.  We see Vader chop through some metal pipes and Luke chops open a hatch but its more in the Prequel Trilogy that we see them chopping through materials and it takes effort.  QuiGonn really has to work to cut through that blast door for instance.Lukes hit is quick and offbalance.  He falls over almost immediately after he makes contact so he didnt have a lot of force behind the blow.

3408499,0,t1_cpgiru5,gt In terms of they can both feel the force and know whats going to happen next so it looks choreographed. Thats such a lame copout. Especially considering that there are fights between Masters in both the Clone Wars and OT that dont look nearly as choreographed. Even for Jedi there should still be SOME time between action and reaction. gt It was really long because that was Obi Wans gameplan like his fighting style ideally lengthens a fight tiring his opponent out until he can secure a win. Just so happens Anakin took a long time to tire out or for Obi Wan to secure the highground.I feel this is anothe copout. Im all right with the idea behind that plan but the way ObiWan fights isnt consistent with said plan. If he really wanted to tire Anakin out he should have stayed as far back as possible and used minimal movements. Sort of like what Dooku was doing against Yoda. Instead hes intentionally directly engaging Anakin. Worse you never get the sense that this is due to a failure in ObiWans plan. Both characters hit simultaneous high and low points. Thats not how you want to show two characters being evenly matched. ,StarWars,cpgslkv,0,t5_2qi4s

3434779,0,t3_2zhfb9,You might end up causing some shit with the Deathtroopers one though I wasnt overly fond with it. Id say the worst Ive read was the Courtship Of Princess Leia. I had Just finished Xwing Solo Command which had promised at the end the CoPL which was published four years before  XSC would finish the Zinsj arc. It did but it was fucking disappointing and so far off from the Xwing series. And just fucking weird. I think Han kidnaps Leia at some point and wins a planet playing Sabaac. The weird part is that I think it was a very influential book. Thats where Dathamir and the Nigh Sisters were introduced and its where the Hapans were introduced. Both of those groups I love in other expanded universe. I also wasnt a fan of the Fate of the Jedi series. I didnt finish it but I though Abeloth was too powerful to be interesting.

I have a friend who is a bit of a curmudgeon and dislikes any and all kids shows but has told me he loves Rebels.Anyway to your point about Chiss and yes the Inquisitor in Rebels there are exceptions to the Imperial dislike of nonhumans. Thrawn and the Inquisitor are two prime examples. Thrawn was known as an anomaly of sorts and was looked down upon by other Grand Admirals IIRC. The Emperor himself was willing to make exceptions with anyone who was particularly useful to him gaining more power whether on a political level or any other level his master Darth Plagueis was a nonhuman. Most Imperial officers however viewed nonhumans as second class citizens. Moff Tarkin for example owned a slave Mon Calamari by the name of Ackbar.All of this is Legends EU of course but its something Id like to see carried on and I see no reason to expect it wont be. Racism is something that most normal people view as evil and as another commenter said it strengthens the similarities between the Nazis and Empire.

Living in a constant state of cynicism isnt pleasant. I spent way more time than I wouldve liked doing that.I understand and Id love to do the same but EA has had its chances with me.gt I dont really accept that this is the reality of AAA games. I just find ways to work around it. Buying games used or after price drops so I save money. Waiting for Steam or PSN to drop prices radically. EA still publishes games I like but I do my best to minimize the money I give them.You do accept but you dont like it. I do the same I wait till it has been released and then check if its worth my money. But that shouldnt been needed. People should be able to preorder in good hopes of getting a good finished game. In the last years they have just become really good in hiding the fact that the acutally game is still unfinished or just not good enough. I dont accept it anymore.gtWhy do I do all that? Im not a businessman. I have no intention of trying to take over EA or some other large publisher and changing how things work. Thats just not who I am.Well but you would welcome it? Why were you so hostile then towards me that is. If its because of the rape thing I would recommend to myself and to you is calm ourselves down before we reply or post anything haha!

The season  arc gave me that.Anyway look at how horrified the clones are in both the Umbara arc and when Tup killed the Jedi in season . They are completely shaken. That proves the entire clone army to be tragic characters in a way. You know that very soon they will all be forced to do something that disgusts and saddens them probably without ever even realizing how they used to feel about it. Its tragic how after hearing three words from Coruscant the friendships theyd developed over the course of the entire war are erased and theyre values are essentially stolen from them.

3732952,0,t1_cqhpp2p,Eh Id rather it be mostly unrelated to Rebels. As much as I enjoy Rebels I dont think it would do the universe or the operation in question justice. This is a desperate mission to retrieve plans to a battle station that at the time has just become fully operational and is coming into service.I dont know if youre familiar with the story surrounding the German battleship Bismark in WW but Britain pulled out all the stops in a frantic and desperate effort to stop it from reaching the Atlantic.The rebels have this one chance to get the information they need to even have a chance at stopping it. I dont think Rebels is a suitable medium to convey that. The Tarkin Doctrine isnt wrong with respect to the Death Star. There is no counter there is no hope when they can simply eliminate entire planets. You cant act when that level of collateral damage resulting in the annihilation of entire civilizations with history going back thousands of years is at stake. Which was the entire point.

3746562,0,t1_cqiwzan,Well for example CampC Zero Hour expanded each faction to go from  general per faction to  generals per faction bringing up the number of playable factions to  each with their own truly unique playstyle.And I really do mean unique. For example some generals completely gave up tanks. Other factions gave you unique alternatives to solving problems like the superweapon generals EMP Patriots and FAB Aurora Bombers that gave her defensive and crowd control abilities unmatched by pretty much any other general.It also added tons of maps a new campaign for each of the three main factions. The generals challenge mode when you chose one of the specialized general and faced off against most of the others.It cost less than a season pass.Or Empire Earth Art of Conquest that expanded on the main game by adding shit tons of civs a new era that included going to space and managing an interplanetary empire unique unitsabilities for each faction that could radically alter not only how you played the game but how you played the game in certain eras. It also added three new campaigns although tbh I dont think they were as well done as the original four.Of course there are also modern examples like the Civ Series Civ IV and Civ V that still release full on expansion packs even if they also release an obnoxious amount of nation DLC.You used to get lots more content for either the same amount of money or quite a bit less than even season passes.Also selling maps is horribly anticonsumer as it divides the community.Also I didnt say DLC encourages you to sell pieces of the game piecemeal. I meant it encourages them to sell you pieces of what would otherwise have been a much larger better expansion pack piecemeal.Im not antiDLC as a whole. Im anti DLC as most DLC has become. DLC should either be mainly cosmetic optional stuff that doesnt affect gameplay or return to the good ol model of full sized expansions that did more than say Hey heres a couple new things now give us  or .,StarWars,cqjc0gz,1,t5_2qi4s

I started off doing some copyist work preparing parts and writing for small student films. Eventually that turned into orchestration and regular transcription gigs. Now I get to write a lot more too. Did an internship with a big name composer which did a lot for me resume wise. Just recorded some stuff in Prague for a soundtrack CD release Lord of the RingsThe Hobbit.

3758325,0,t3_33ghij,Vader personally has  separate goals in E.  In the beginning he knows who Luke is and is avidly searching for him though his endgoal is unclear.  When the Emperor calls him on it Vader plays dumb and suggests that they turn him to cover up his awareness.  After he actually fights Luke I think he has a twisted proud father moment and revamps his original idea to get Luke to join him and actively overthrow the Emperor.Something happens between E and E because Vaders a beat dog and concedes to turning him for the Emperor Its too late for me my son.  While on the Deathstar his motivations become a little confused and by the end hes motivated to let go of his baggage and finally do what he knows to be the right thing.

Then I read the trilogy about him and loved it.  Fleshed out his character a lot.  I also loved history when I was a kid particularly warrior cultures like the Spartans and Vikings and the more you read about mandalorians the more you realized they were a legendary warrior culture.  I put that in quotes because there wasnt much out there back in the day.  We thought they were a civilization that died out long ago which raised the question of how Boba got the armor and if maybe the mandalorians werent extinct.  We didnt know if he was male or female or if he was even human.  There was a lot of mystery around him that added to his coolness. The holiday special even made you think he was a good guy for a bit.

One example is the Revan book retconning the exile from Kotor .This was done so they can pick and choose what they want from legends old EU and make it canon or make new character all together so contradictions wont happen.Post ROTJ stuff had to go theyre making new movies and the thrawn stories wouldnt work since the original cast are way too old for those stories so they had to make a new story.Also JJ Abrams made two or the best star wars movies in a long time they were just skinned as star trek movies.

However its not as bad as trying to make the force a mystical energy that various groups follow as a religion a natural substance that can be measured and manipulated. It makes it hard to believe Han doesnt believe in the Force in Episode IV if midichlorians exist. Qui Gon was able to measure how much midichlorians Anakin possessed. That means that there is some proof that they and the Force exist. Han saying that he doesnt believe in it is like saying he doesnt believe in atoms. There are imperial officers who openly question Vader for following the Force years after the fall of the Jedi.The introduction of midichlorians seems like an idea that Lucas came up with to make a Virgin Birth make sense instead of relying on the mystical powers of the Force.

That job was the cleaning and repairing of the hundreds of lavatory facilities located on the stations expansive CDeck. There were  other droids just like her on board and each one was ready and waiting to do their part to service the Empires more humble needs. While most waste generated on the station was evacuated via a sophisticated system of vacuum chutes leading into storage dumps where it would be compressed before incineration there still remained residual detritus that required more handson care. That was where QT and her family of fecalfocused cleaners came in. They worked both on a set bidaily schedule as well as responding on call to handle the more sudden and severe contamination events perpetrated by the millions of organics working onboard the station. Whatever the particular job might entail the Q series custodial maintenance droid was programmed to engage with enthusiasm scrubbing spraying sucking and sweeping away whatever might tarnish the Empires otherwise pristine living space.

To answer uthegrrambino I doubt that the Rebels would have believed Palpatine about anything he said and they surely wouldnt give their forces over to him. Besides the Rebel fleet was pretty small compared to what the Empire had overall. You should also take into consideration that the Rebel Alliance is an alliance. It was comprised of different factions that didnt support the Empire and had decided to band together to fight it. This means that the Rebels had different leaders that had soldiers within the Alliance more loyal to them than to the Alliance as a whole. Because of this not everyone would agree on how things were to be done if there was ever an alliance with the Empire. These inner differences would probably have proven to do more harm than good in the fight against the Vong.,StarWars,cr1a2is,2,t5_2qi4s

Im not certain how far into episode until it happens but Im quite positive that they do end up saying Anakins last name. The combination of these two should make it fairly easy to make the connection that Anakin is Lukes father even if it isnt completely certain in fact the uncertainty might even add to the experience as the viewer may still wonder about what connection Anakin actually ends up having to Luke. But any doubt about whether Anakin is Lukes father is removed fairly early in Episode  when the Emperor tells Vader that Luke is the son of Anakin Skywalker,StarWars,cr49qy3,1,t5_2qi4s

I cant remember off the top of my head but lets just say barrel trigger grip and magazine. Again i cant remember exact details.To make these individual parts you needed materials that were extracted from the world somehow. Different metals etc. To get materials needed you had to scan and prospect the ground to figure out what type of minerals you could get. Each of these had quality sliders. You could go to Dantooine and get some really awesome ferrous metal. But you also need non ferrous alkali power etc to make each component.Now after crafting the individual components each of those had quality attributes to them depending on the quality of materials used in manufacturing the items.The pistol quality is determined by quality of parts which is determined by quality of materials used to make those parts. You could have a guy mass produce shitty pistols or have a guy make really awesome pistols but limited run and expensive due to having to search out the best possible resources.  This was just weaponsmithing. Doctors combat medics droid engineers architects etc. Tons of crafting professions with countless things to make.Also things deteriorated so that super awesome one of a kind pistol will wear out after so many uses.,StarWars,cr6resp,25,t5_2qi4s

Hes a big fan of having the camera shake all over the place as a way to make things seem dynamic. When you look at all six Star Wars films the camera movements are always steady and clearly frame the events. Even during the lightsaber duels cuts are conservative and the focus is on clearly showing off the extensive choreography. Same with the space battles. I worry that the new films are going to trade that for the same shaky shaky excitement! that Hollywood currently has a thing for and both trailers for Ep VII had a lot of wobbly camera work.  Too much fanboying over the original trilogy. Say what you will about the prequels at least they were their own story with their own focus. I worry that Ep VII is going to essentially come across as gushy fanfiction over the originals especially given that Michael Arnts more original screenplay was apparently jettisoned so that Abrams could put in stronger ties to the original films. The way that  the production has been pouring over discarded design concepts from thirty years ago... I want these films to feel fresh and is if they take place thirty years after ROTJ.

4100342,0,t1_crnm3ny,As much as I love ObiWan he was firmin his obedience to the dictates of the council and quite vocal about this to Anakin. As evidenced from Episode I QuiGon was not and went with his gut feeling trusting in the force above the council. I feel like Anakin would be more receptive to QuiGons style in this regard and this would lead to less clash between master and apprentice. For example one of Anakins dark side turning points is in Episode II when he loses his mother. Knowing that QuiGon had met his mother before and that he was not the style of jedi to reprimand Anakin would have been open about his dreams and fears of losing her. They could have gone and saved his mother then before it was too late or QuiGon very well could have gone back to free Shmi much before then with Anakin and allowed him to atleast keep in contact with her. Just this event in itself would have prevented Anakin from giving in to his anger so early on.

Their rules about love and emotion are what drove Anakin to the dark side and happens very often compare the amount of Jedis that fall to the dark to the Sith that turn to the light. They were all arrogant enough to believe they were in control when really they were puppets of the Sith Lord. I believe the reason Anakin turned bad was to bring balance to the Force by destroying what the jedi had become and then later also the sith to bring balance with a new jedi order that was much more accepting of emotion and love. ,StarWars,cs09wqn,-1,t5_2qi4s

The person in the theater who worked for Lucasfilm was talking about how they wanted to make Dooku appear powerful and agile despite his age. One of the initial ideas was to have Dooku lift himself with the force and fall elegantly and slowly to the floor. They then showed the triple forward flip and explained that this was decided because it looked best... I really wish they put in the menacing almost vampiric levitation instead. That would have been much more powerful and menacing. He doesnt even use crazy acrobatics when he fights.,StarWars,cs4w0os,1,t5_2qi4s

That character has been hidden under a dark mask and deep rage with no possibility of them returning to the Clone Wars era. Unless they wrote a book on it but I dont feel that would be so exciting.,StarWars,csgs4y6,1,t5_2qi4s
4357430,0,t1_csgb6du,When TCW was first starting they wanted it to be roughly compatible with the existing show so all of the stuff before Anakins knighting was retconned to happen within the first few months of the war while all the stuff after was of course moved up to near RotS.As TCW grew and had more seasons this take on the relationship between the two shows changed and eventually the Tartakovsky show got bumped out. But TCW does cover Ventresss origins after retconning them so shes a Nightsister.The Tartakovsky show never really gave Grievous a real introduction though other than to say that he was a new Separatist general and then show him slaughtering Jedi. TCW gave him a quick origin story in Lair of Grievous via his statues so he actually has MORE of an introduction in the new show.,StarWars,csgtdcw,6,t5_2qi4s
4361076,0,t1_csh80qb,No I think George Lucas knew the word parsec but not what it was only that it was space sounding and went with it. Probably because it has the suffix sec like second. Like he did it in  parseconds which must be fast. I think real scientists poked fun at it and a bunch of people scrambled so that they didnt look stupid.Id rather accept the explanation that Han was talking out of his ass to see what Ben and Luke knew about space travel.

4433598,0,t1_csp0pw5,I can actually explain the Slipspace jump scene in Halo . In Halo Slipspace is an entirely different dimension where it takes less time to go from Point A to Point B because it is compressed compared to real space. The way ships in Halo enter Slipspace is by using dozens of artificial black holes to open a rupture in real space. HumanUNSC ships use inferior Slipspace technology compared to the Covenant and can only enter Slipspace oustide of a gravity well. In the Halo novel First Strike Master Chief and Cortana help capture a Covenant ship near the debris of the original Halo which they use to get back to Human territory. Whilst fleeing a Covenant fleet their ship enters the atmosphere of a gas giant and it appears that they will be unable to escape the intense gravity of the planet. This is when Cortana discovers that Covenant Slipspace drives are incredibly more accurate than those on Human ships and that she can still calculate a jump into Slipspace from inside a gravity well. Something like a Covenant A.I. copies Cortanas calculations as she makes them and sends them to the rest of the Covenant. Now fast forward to Halo . The Prophet of Regret is actually using the same kind of calculations that Cortana did to aid his escape from earth without going back into space first.Wow I feel really geeky now.,StarWars,cspjju5,5,t5_2qi4s

Im all for some new takes on old characters as long as they arent completely transformed into something else idiotic Thrawn or evil Pellaeon or some weakass Neocrusaders.EDIT Also seeing as how Bothans are brought up.  One big thing Im worried about is that the postRotJ stuff Shattered Empire in particular will continue drawing upon the Empire  Irredeemable Space Nazis theme.The Galactic Empire spanned an entire galaxy.  It was built on the overthrown corpse of a galaxywide republic and its birth was met with cheers and sighs of relief.  It would come off to me as cartoonish if  of the Empire was depicted as some brutalcorruptsupervillainous police state devoid of hope where every stormtrooper is a moronic bully or murderous brute who also happens to suddenly become even more stupid whenever the good guys are nearby. And the Rebellion is also certainly a massive group.  At least I hope so I wouldnt want to learn that a tiny fraction of the galaxys population managed to instacripple the Empire through sheer plot armor.  Wheres the fringe groups the guys who joined the Rebellion just to take advantage of it and plunder the Empire?  The extremists who are willing to crash Star Destroyers into populated cities in the name of freedom or vengeance?  The Bothans while nowhere near as bad as that gave us a glimpse of it.

I think its probably just a natural thing that happens just like anyone else though the Order obviously teaches to be wary of attachment.  In TCW Obi wan has a flirtatiousromantic relationship with the Queen ? from Mandalor and even admits to her that he would have left the Jedi order to be with her if she had asked him to.

4657230,0,t1_ctgy7ky,It is possible that using force choke shows much room for improvement in Luke but I see it as another factor that makes Luke a force user that doesnt dogmatically adhere to light or dark side ideologies. The light side taught that you shouldnt feel love or passion at all and the dark side taught that you should harness such emotions even hate as a source of your power. But Luke uses both passion and restraint in necessary situations. This temperance is shown in Ep.  as OP has pointed out. Ultimately I see Lukes use of force choke not as a lack of training in the light side but a symbol of his acceptance of both light and dark side ideologies and employing them in a balanced and tempered manner. Thus he is the balance to the force that Anakin brought.This is simply my opinion however. It is very possible that choking is evidence that he has much to learn and I am reading it wrong.,StarWars,cthloeb,4,t5_2qi4s

The idea is that the Force stimulates life and since these singlecelled organisms are a very basic form of life and are present in every individual thus someone who is stronger in the Force will naturally have a greater abundance of bacterial life in them.

4818730,0,t3_3gva10,Yup Ive heard this thrown around a lot over the internet since the release of Episode II and its absolutely true.  Jar Jar hands Palpatine the first in a series of keys to galactic domination despite it being sooooo against the wishes of who he was stepping in for.  Its almost as if Lucas reflected on Jar Jar in between scripts and decided to use the hate he received to play Jar Jar as the fool who damned the Republic due to his almost gutterally hated reaction in Phantom Menace but considering he began writing II before Phantom Menace even released I dont think it was that intentional.As an aside in the former canon there was strong hintings that The Emperor had Jar Jar killed so his role in putting him in power could be hidden though I assume this was just a writer who disliked him making an offhanded comment.  Still was an interesting idea though.,StarWars,cu1xv72,2,t5_2qi4s

4879966,0,t3_3hqj6k,At the time of the Clone Wars the Republic had no standing army. Galactic law was enforced by two institutions  The Judicial Forces a law enforcement agency with some military trappings arguably the closest thing there was to a Galactic Navy. The Judicials were called upon to shoot things when the Republic needed something shot.  The Jedi Order a Forcesensitive organization that was sworn to the service of the Galactic Senate. The Jedi served the Republic in two primary roles as diplomats and mediators and as special forces when diplomacy failed.When the Clone Wars began the Republic suddenly found themselves with an army but the clones were trained for obedience not leadership  the Republic had to supply their own officers. The only people available with any military experience at all were the Judicials and the Jedi and so the members of those two organizations became the officers of the new Grand Army of the Republic and Republic Navy.Essentially it wasnt that the Jedi were especially qualified so much as that they were the only officers available. ,StarWars,cu9noc4,14,t5_2qi4s

Its more told through the perspective of someone working closely with Vader to help with his plans but you also do get plenty of perspective on what Vader is thinking and feeling like when he figures out that the Death Star was blown up by his long lost son.

I could see another teaser near release just to continue building hype but really there isnt much reason to release more trailers so far from the movie.

4943919,0,t1_cuhotzq,This is something Id LOVE to see. The lightsaber duels in the original trilogy are characterized by the emotional stakes behind them. Seeing a fight take place in the new movie that is raw and rough will be fantastic to watch unlike the prequels choreographed dancefighting.Edit The issue I have with the prequels is that the fights look too clean. Yeah experienced duelists fighting each other will be more proficient and technical but there wasnt really any sense of danger kr urgency present in the fights. The one I really liked was the fight between Obi Wan and Anakin on Mustafar. Good mix of emotional and choreographed.Edit I guess I should clarify. I did enjoy the Maul fight. My grievances mostly lie with the lightsaber overload in Episode  and the goofy Yoda fight in . ,StarWars,cuhpyah,124,t5_2qi4s

I dont think well have anyone changing sides though. Kylo Ren will stay evil LukeReyFinn will all stay good etc. If there is to be any fall from grace it will be with Ren going from a Machiavellian military leader to a sinister heartless murderer to gain power. In other words going from evil to more evil.  Im betting that well see an exploration of Kylo Ren and Leader Snoke in very different ways than Sidious and Vader. Ive heard it said that Ren is publicly claiming to be Darth Vader while secretly longing for Sith artifacts that will teach him the Dark Side. Perhaps we will see him struggle with maintaining his image perhaps Snoke is in on it and pretending to be Sidious too. I heard it said in a leak that Ren is looking for Luke because hes the only one who knows for certain that Vader is dead and could therefore destroy his entire persona. The idea of them pulling strings having to lie in public growing paranoid at everyone finding out who they are could be interesting if done right. It would certainly give a very different tone than the other two trilogies.,StarWars,cut86xl,1,t5_2qi4s

5075424,0,t1_cuxpa67,Ok a couple of reasons. Just to clarify the TB is relatively new during the Civil War and is  a direct descendent of the ARC and Z Headhunter star fighters. For one you dont just scrap a tried and tested airframe. Things like the UH CH and F have been in use for decades by the U.S. Military and are constantly improved upon with updated avionics. See the F Growler for and example. Another reason is the reverence and legend built around the XWing after its contribution to the various victories of the Alliance. This is the fighter that took down the Death Stars with the help of the falcon of course what better a marketing pitch is there than that? I imagine Planetary millitaries across the galaxy were after this thing hence the reason Incom saw fit to release the T variant.I think that line comes from the fact that the idea of attacking a moon sized battle station with single seat fighters seems crazy no matter how good your fighter is.,StarWars,cuxs3eu,2,t5_2qi4s

The only reason that happened is because Lucas wanted him to take out his little laser sword and go to town through the use of CGI.Furthermore the supposed change in his demeanor is all a retcon and happens completely off screen so its all speculation anyway.,StarWars,cva6cnj,0,t5_2qi4s

5222616,1,t1_cvfickl,WARNING long rant x.x Well I didnt know Phasma was a woman not been paying attention to anything with the new movie though Im not a spoilers avoider. But I dont see the issue. The Wars is by and large marketed to men and boys not women Im a woman myself if it matters. Its like Samus or Sheik costumes being marketed at boys even though theyre both women. Generally storm troopers have been men and the Wars a boys club so it makes marketing sense to push a new version of the storm trooper on boys. Capitalism isnt sexist the general populations desires on what to buy are sexist. Thats why we have gendered Lego and pink aisles. We know girls like science toys and boys Lego but the reason for the marketing is strong. Im guessing well see little girls in Phasma costumes after the movie comes out but while its still in the marketing phase boys and young men are still the prime target audiences.,StarWars,cvfimld,0,t5_2qi4s

5260209,0,t1_cvjzrrh,That would have been soooo much better. The villains existing before Batman is a laughable concept in and of itself let alone have halfformed versions of the full fledged characters running amok while Bruce isnt even training yet. But WB seems more apt to try and sell the brand I.e. to use familiar known characters to tell whatever kind of story they need to to further the brand. Smallville The Flash Arrow and now Gotham are all guilty of it. They throw in all these little Easter eggs just to get a familiar face out there and origins and circumstances true to the character can suck it. I expect details and ethnicity these days to change but DC seems willing to change a lot more than Marvel when it comes to their adaptations. In Gotham and Smallvilles case it all ends up making things less special to have a protoLuthor or Joker running around without the true threat of a fullyformed hero to stop them. It doesnt work for me on a fundamental level and it was always one of the things I hated about the EU. Man a Ben Edlund take on Gotham Central? Drool...,StarWars,cvk1t7f,2,t5_2qi4s

A guilt trip is a form of emotional blackmail wherein you say to someone I know you absolutely dont want to do this but if you dont youll feel bad.With Han and Luke its a matter of Luke seeing the hero inside Han that he keeps hidden under the indifferent smuggler facade. He isnt shaming Han into joining the Rebellion hes appealing to that heroic side of him essentially saying You know this is the right thing and its what you want to do youre just too afraid to do it. Luke isnt coercing Han to do something he doesnt want to do hes helping him realize that he is a hero and he does want to help the Rebellion defeat the Empire.EDIT In the context of just A New Hope this is a little more difficult to see but looking at Hans overall character arc in Episodes IV  VI I think the evidence for it is a lot clearer.,StarWars,cvqbvch,8,t5_2qi4s

5317676,0,t1_cvr3ljl,Im pretty sure Kylo is a force user but not a Sith.My theory ninja edit Im sure someone has thought of this so this is the theory I like. which Im sure is full of holes is that kylo was a force sensitive child that was taken by the inquisitors before the yavin battle and dump on some backwater planet and kept there in secret. Then the movies happen the empire falls apart all the Sith die you know the story....Now the force likes balance. So we have ol Luke arguably the most powerful Jedi ever Leia also a light side force user but no dark side user to balance them out.Until kylo a kidnapped and forgotten force sensitive kid dumped on some unimportant planet that everyone has forgotten about and probably pretty upset about it. Over time he grows and learns and the dark side channels through him but there is no one to teach him. Still he gets more and more powerful learns rudimentary force powers assembles a haphazard lightsaber as best he can again with no guidance Im also a fan of the exhaust idea for his saber and bam theres your antagonist.The timeline sort of matches up I think it would put him at ish.

I conceded revenge and the other OT have good songs in this post but argued their soundtracks arent as full of good songs as the OT. Williams always did good work but I disagree that Revenge was his best. I stand firm that Jedi and Empire showed his furthest range of work while the PT especially Attack of the Clones are full of forgettable to god awful tracks I cant bear to listen to like that terrible fucking opera thing. Does the PT have good music? Hell yes.The trade federation march Duel of Fates Jangos Escape Battle of heroes etc. etc. etc. etc.But overall? The rest of the soundtracks are pretty mediocre. The love themes the ambient themes etc. A lot of it is just... not as good as the OT stuff.Like just listen to The Force from the original Star Wars and tell me anything in the prequels is that good. Are any of the Marches as good as the Imperial March No not even close. Are any of the space combat themes as exciting as Into the Trap or The Battle of Yavin Is anything as chilling as the Battle of Hoth or The Emperors throne room? Anything as exciting as Snowspeeders Take Flight or The Asteroid Field?Oh and lets not forget the theme of the most badass character in all of Star Wars Its just not a fair comparison at all. Williams best work was all in the OT.Also if you want some good non williams star wars music?Vode An from Republic CommandoOld Republic Theme KOTORRebuilt Jedi Enclave KOTOR Starkillers theme Force UnleashedThe Occupation of Balmorra SWTOR SWTOR is full of a ton of good original star wars music I highly recommend checking out the soundtrack. ,StarWars,cvs8b2l,-4,t5_2qi4s

Likewise if you can get a clear shot of the fuel tank a shotgun might be able to destroy a tank very quickly. The problem arises when the tank is moving and firing shells and machine guns back at the man wielding the shotgun. At best hes only going to be able to take pot shots in between being fired upon so there is very little chance of success.,StarWars,cvsd9ff,2,t5_2qi4s

5363545,0,t1_cvwcld2,Exactly. Lets assume the Death Stars superlaser was near the limits of thencurrent technology and was designed to destroy Earthsized terrestrial planets like Alderaan and Yavin . Blowing a planet completely apart as we seen done to Alderaan requires overcoming its gravitational binding energy which is inversely proportional to its radius and proportional to the square of its mass. If we assume Yavin is about the size and mass of Jupiter it should be about  times the radius and more than  times the mass of a terrestrial planet which means it would take over  times as much energy to blow it apart. It seems unlikely the Death Stars main weapon would or could have been overbuilt to that degree.Interestingly theres reason to think that Yavin is actually much more massive than that. It turns out that Jupiter is about the maximum size for a gas giant if you add more mass it simply compresses more and gets denser and gets classified as a brown dwarf up until about  Jupiter masses. The fact that Yavin diameter of km is significantly larger than Jupiter km implies that Yavin is actually a highmass brown dwarf. If we estimate that Yavins mass is about  times that of Jupiter then its about  times as massive as a terrestrial planet at  times the radius which means it would take around sixty million times as much energy to disrupt.,StarWars,cvx94wm,2,t5_2qi4s

Still Ive got no issue with him being Boba but I would prefer it to be someone else. Most of my issues with Jordan come from how terribly Fantastic  flopped.

5368978,0,t1_cvxvzip,Its not as daft as it seems. Screenwriters often take high concepts and make  pages out of it best known example I can think of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are Twins.Anakin could appear to a chosen few just like Kenobi whispered in Lukes ear telling him to use the force. Sounds absolutely ridiculous as a concept but in the movie it just works. People writing the script should have an imagination or it is just a job.,StarWars,cvxy3re,3,t5_2qi4s

5385719,0,t3_3osk82,I suppose DisneyLucasfilm can do whatever they like with these characters but it wouldnt make a whole lot of sense to have them in the new trilogy. What would be the point? Why would they have to include them? It would make sense to me to have all the Force users die before the events of the original Star Wars to truly make Lukes story as meaningful as possible. This is how Id prefer it anyway. Rebels seems to be a glimpse of the birthgrowth of the early days of the Rebellion.

These mystical uplink stations YWing bombing sorties against the ATATs which were never seen on screen let alone hinted at... As for the blasters being used by all sides I suppose its likely that the Rebellion would use whatever it could get its hands on whereas an established military like the Imperial NavyArmy would have standard issue equipment and wouldnt just use anything. We never saw Stormtroopers using the A on screen and I doubt they would use anything but the E when it comes to riflemen. The DLT is their standard heavy rifle too whereas it follows that the Alliance would pilfer these whenever possible. I cant see the Empire using the Tusken Cycler rifle at all.EDIT Even Wookieepedia lists the A as an Alliance weapon. I dont think DiceEA can even spell canon.,StarWars,cw0jffq,3,t5_2qi4s

I could be confusing it with another midnight showing though.Either way it may have become more common recently but my point was that it wasnt because of the TDKR shooting.

5455750,0,t1_cw8rgqi,Showing scenes without their context makes them that more interesting.  If you had never seen Empire Strikes Back youd have no idea why Leia is running or what Han and Chewie are working on.  Youd have no significance of who Luke is talking with though I think it gave too much away perhaps ObiWans ghost talking would have been better.  Different shots that arent related cant be known to someone who hasnt seen the movie yet and they invoke mystery and encourage discovery.

5458341,0,t1_cw7wptv,I am pretty sure that at least previous to Tarkins presumed death on the first Death Star Vader was no higher than rd in line. I feel like Palpatine would have safeguards of some sort to prevent Vader from becoming Emperor should Palpatine be killed or was otherwise dethroned and possible placed Vader even lower in rank. Darth Vader was Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet which means he was pretty high in rank but perhaps the Imperial Military had several branches much like the US military. Vader may have been Supreme Commander of the Air Force while others were the Supreme Commanders of the army marines and navy and would be equal in rank within the military. Second in rank among Dark Side forces users and apprentice to the Sith Lord does not necessarily denote second in rank within the Imperial Military. I know that is not exactly how it was in the old canon but so far as I know new canon does not really go into detail on these matters and to me this is what makes the most sense considering what we can determine from the films the Clone Wars and Rebels. ,StarWars,cw9cs5w,1,t5_2qi4s

5466106,0,t3_3pxfkz,I really loved Lords of the Sith. Some people dont but I think the general consensus is that its good. In my opinion the Vader chapters are done really well and you really see that there is still a man underneath that armour. One thing to note though it is pretty faulsley marketed. Dont get me wrong Vader and Palpatine are featured heavily but they arent the main characters. A small group of Rebel Twileks are but a couple of them are pretty interesting and I found myself getting quite attached to one of them in particular. The dialouge between Palps and Vader can get pretty damn intense. That was probably my favorite part of the book actually.You should definitely check it out.,StarWars,cwachn0,3,t5_2qi4s

To people saying the contrary look at the other Netflix produced shows they are nowhere near Star Wars scope. Theyre still good shows dont get me wrong but just saying Star Wars has a certain scope that is bigger than the typical budget for a tv show. Now if they make a story that fits the small screen sure that could be interesting. But Im not sure if Disney wants to even put themselves in that position.

These  points would violate my personal definition of the spirit of star wars.  They would take me out of the film. Lets take  as an example for me the question of whether luke would ever turn to the dark side was answered in jedi. He looked down that path and rejected it. That was his temptation.

That fight is spectacular whether thats because of the s combat or not. No rationalization required the ending fight of Empire is dramatic and intense. And I think it does make sense for Luke at least to be terrible at fighting. He does struggle to keep up the whole fight hes clearly losing. I dunno to be honest I always saw the original trilogy as having the real combat and the prequels fucked it up. All three prequels are filled with choreography thats more dance than fight sabers go nowhere near each other flips and kicks for the sake of it. Its pretty but realistically.... I dont like that stuff.

5494929,0,t1_cwdjrwd,Fuck that dude. Dehumanization lust for power the alienation of your friends in pursuit of your goals and losing yourself to something those around you find evil? The Godfather did it in one film. XMen First Class did the Two good friends turned against each other in one film two if you count how Days of Future Past expanded on XavierMagnetos relationshipbreaking apart. Hell there are so many fantastic movies expanding on the character of a single person from biographic masterpieces like Schindlers List or Theory of Everything to fictional movies like Enemy and Nightcrawler. Three  amp  hour films totalling out to  hours  minutes is a lot of time to expand on a single character.The problem wasnt the time limit. The problem was that Lucas had become enamored with the world he had created than the characters story he was meant to portray at least initially. I mean compare what we see of the Star Wars universe in the Original Trilogy to the Prequel Trilogy and its easy to see the Prequels are far more of a worldbuilding exercise showing the workings of the Galactic Republic the corruption and decadence at the heart of its political system the Jedi Orders pompous distancing from the real world the hypocrisy of the glorious Republic and decadent Naboo existing in the same galaxy as slavefilled Tatooine etc etc that The Phantom Menace becomes less The Story of Anakin and more The Story of the Old Republic.Then Attack of the Clones comes along and Lucas says to himself Ok I need to link this back into the Original Trilogy I know Ill expand on the Clone Wars by showing how it started without actually showing the war to keep its mystique. AotC involved Lucas trying to weave so much of the Original Trilogy into the Prequels that its hard to see why hes doing it. He essentially combines fanfavourite faceless Boba Fett and the faceless Stormtrooper mooks together into an army of a single person multiplied ad infinitum who are pitted against hordes of personalityless inhuman machines in a war that sets the Galaxy on fire. Lucas weaving is for the most part so much on the Big Scale the world around the characters that the characters themselves dont have much room to grow within that world. Anakin has to find himself on Tatooine again because he wanted to introduce Owen and Beru the farmstead that Luke grew up in shots of Jawa sandcrawlers and Tusken Raider camps all Episode IV imagery while adding in a forbidden love plot thats destined to end in tragedy as the two lovers are torn apart as soon as they realize their love for each other Oh hi Han and Leia in Cloud City meanwhile a trap is set for the Galactic Players by the insidious mastermind who has concieved of every possible outcome and ensured they all end in his favour Return of the Jedi stop hiding in there!. Revenge of the Sith aka the one people can kinda stand has elements that works because its here that Lucas actually can focus on the elements that the fans wanted. Ive argued before that where AotC is Lucas trying to bring in elements of the Originals for fans to enjoy RotS is Lucas actively reveling in the destruction of the aesthetics mindsets and in a meta sense story of the Prequels which has all been set up by him paradoxically both to create a fascinating and interesting world but also to inevitably be destroyed by him as the series starts blending into what we know of the Original Trilogys world Now that the stage is set the drama of the story can actually properly begin The seeds already in Anakins mind can fester into a tree of hate envy and disgust the machinations of the Emperor can finally be executed the passivity of the Jedi can at last be shown as futile the love and compassion of Padme can be shown as being useless or even a negative quality in an unjust world the comerardery and mentorship of ObiWan can be shown to not be enough and reveal a dimension of ObiWans fears that he will not do justice to Luke just as he failed to do with Anakin Yoda can finally experience the loss of the great world of knowledge and peace he once knew and Lucas can finally show this fantastic and to be frank poetic fall of grace wisdom and peace into a world of ruthless fanaticism and patriotic dogma that he wanted to show for Twenty Years counting from Return to Revenge.The problem wasnt the amount of movies he had to do it in. The problem was Lucas focus. He wanted to show the collapse of a society which IMVHO is represented in RotS by Order s montage the AnakinPadme lovely stare scene and the Assault on the Jedi Temple. To do so he needed to show the world that was to be crushed Phantom Menace and show the threat that would crush it Attack of the Clones. To show the collapse he would have to show what existed and how it would be destroyed then he could show how it was destroyed and then he could show that in the remains there was a little hope for the future.His problem was one of spacing. He focused on the big ideas and on that one specific moment of the story for so long Im talking about him mulling it around in his head that while as a trilogy its a fantastic idea each of the pieces become a little dry in comparison to the whole. The characters suffer because outside of the characters assumed from the OT Anakin ObiWan the Emperor Yoda Anakins Wife there isnt much characterization. Dont get me wrong theres a lot of amazing characters that Lucas thought of The Chancellor whos a member of the old guard the last honorable man whos trying and failing to be a bulwark against corruption and who at the last moment is betrayed by his closest political ally Palpy to take over from him the WarriorMonk who cannot find his meaning in peacetime and who personally yearns for war to find the life he was meant to live despite being fully aware of how horrible war is and the devastation it would cause to those he is sworn to protect his entire being urges him to continue the fight the man who rejected what he felt was the corruption at the heart of the Jedi order choosing instead to change the political system and became corrupted by the ideals he sought as an alternative to the corruption he knew of the Child Queen whose mind has been so focused on political maneuvering and activism that she cannot allow herself a personal reprieve and must learn to open herself to another not sexually but even just friendship wise without that shell of political straightfacedness to hide behind the Wise Old Man who is a relic of time gone by seeking wisdom in an era when the wise are overshouted by the strong and the corrupt the Slaveboy who was always altruistic because he thought the world is tough so people have to band together if they can who becomes so frustrated when he sees that luxury decadence and selfishness is the norm and the poor the needy the vunerable are shoved to the wasteside that he actively seeks to protect those people by force if needs be the mentor who realises he has spent so much time teaching his student the whats and hows of his philosophy that he cannot understand the why and feels that he betrayed his student not that his student betrayed him the puppetmaster who in contrast to every single fucking villain in western culture doesnt blame his actions on a sad past or believe he is doing good but rather knows that he is manipulating the world around him for his own benefit and is doing it because he knows his will is all that matters not his outlook not his philosophy his will. Sorry got sidetracked These characters are quite frankly some of the best ideas in any film series I can think of but the problem is development we know their personality by whats told to us or what we see in secondary sources not whats shown in the films. Lucas wrote some amazing characters. Lucas wrote a setting that was fascinating. Lucas just sadly focused on certain parts of the story too much. ,StarWars,cwe1292,3,t5_2qi4s

5536621,0,t3_3qyacx,In the Expanded Universe Legends its explained that there was a strong dark side presence in that cave on Dagobah because a Jedi named Minch had defeated a Dark Jedi there hundreds of years before the Clone Wars.Sometime near the end of the Clone Wars Yoda visited the dark side cave himself under guidance of the Force ghost of QuiGon Jinn and had a vision of Darth Sidious and the Jedi Purge. After Order  Yoda went into exile and took up residence near the cave on Dagobah to mask his light side presence with its dark side energies.gt When Luke Skywalker traveled to Dagobah to train with Yoda in  ABY the elder Master tasked him to enter the cave. Luke confronted an illusion of Darth Vader within and defeated it in a lightsaber duel dipping into the passion of the dark side in the process. It was there that he realized what would happen if he turned to the dark side of the Force. ... It also presaged the revelation that Vader was unknown to him at the time actually his father Anakin Skywalker.Fun fact in Star Wars Battlefront II the cave is also present and upon entering it you can hear the breathing of Darth Vader.edit Simple facts.

5570237,0,t1_cwni9kh,Honestly expense. As a one off for a effective military to last till the Republic built a standard army it was worth the expense. But continually relying on the Clone Army bankrupted the Republic. There are parts of the Cone Wars show where its explained that the Republic is surviving on Banking Clan loans. Many citizens were going without basic necessities and entire sections of Coruscant were dealing with rolling blackouts. The Republic was losing the War on economic grounds.

I assume he got rekt by Kylo in the wood fight scene  very likely he was really afraid in the first trailer she finds him crying  suddenly a light someones coming to save them.. its probabaly Luke.It seems likely that Rey and Fin develop feelings for each other just a thought after the name scene crying over him at the end... I think we will see Rey falling to the dark side in this trilogy cause she seems to have some relationship to kylothe force  Finn will somehow get her back. The real unknown here is the connection between the characters but we will see  sooner or later D.In addition id say we will see a first h lightsabre for the lightside in this trilogy  cause Reys weapon is a staff.Calling it right here bois.

5597644,0,t3_3rsjup,Is it too farfetched to think that Kylo Ren is going to be the Darth Maul we never received or rather kept?  I was thinking about this the other day.  IIRC Darth Maul was wellreceived when TPM came out though I think I remember the dual lightsaber took some time to be accepted but I remember hearing that people were bummed that he was killed off so soon.  With his probably unexpected popularity I guess that prompted his return in TCW show and his own novels.  With Kylo being hailed as a Darth Vader fanatic and building his own lightsaber it would be safe to say that he can fight very well with it. Hopefully that fight scene with Finn wont disappoint. We see he has his own knights confirmed? so he might have his own minions to do his bidding.  We see a scene where he tortures Poe so we can assume he has some kind of trust and influence with the First Order.   ,StarWars,cwqxw0r,20,t5_2qi4s

His mechanical body parts along with his life support system could be easily destroyeddamaged by Force Lightning an ability Vader was not able to learnuse because of this disadvantage. Palpatine probably gave him this flaw so that he wouldnt be overthrown. Thats why Vader dies so suddenly after killing Palpatine in Ep. . His life support was damaged by Palpatines lightning.

Some fanedits are really impressive. I recommend Hals as hes quite conservative with his cuts and he actually does love the PT in a way.

5705979,0,t1_cx4cl3m,What I personally hope for after the run of these comics and novels and any others set between IV V and IV is that they never go back and make new stories in those time periods involving the core characters. Sure they can tell the stories of side characters or other new faces in those times but no more involving Han Vader Luke etc. I like knowing what they did during the time between the movies but I would prefer if they avoid the absurd clutter of stories that became a problem for some characters in the old EU. Not every story needs to feature a big movie character. Give the main people enough to fill the gap in between features and tell how they grew but cut it off before it becomes too much. Then they should go back between Episodes I though IV and post Episode VI. Wouldnt mind seeing some stuff set before Episode I added to the new canon too.

The problem with young Anakin has always been that if you are watching the movies for the first time starting with the OT youll have no idea who that is. Seeing it with the original actor you have a quick moment where you realize that must be his father. Seeing it with an actor who looks the same age or younger than Luke is confusing and requires outside knowledge and explanation. ,StarWars,cx550qr,0,t5_2qi4s

5715466,0,t3_3td943,I always figured Palpatine had it worked out so that if one thing failed  more failsafes existed to make sure it happened. So was his exact plan that ObiWan found it? Maybe not but did he order the army via the name of a dead Jedi thus when all was ready the Jedi would have been alerted? Sure. I tend to think the way it was unraveled may not have been the best way because that thread got ObiWan all the way to the name Darth Tyranus and if the Jedi only pursued this they would have discovered Dooku was Tyranus and may have pulled out of the war as they discovered the Clone Army was ordered by a Sith Lord. Back to the original question remember Dookus line I have good news my lord the war has begun so it was all planned but the details I feel could have worked out differently and possibly the timeline a bit as well. ,StarWars,cx5k55u,1,t5_2qi4s

5728767,0,t3_3swgcp,Kylo Ren and his future lightsaber problems..So... I bought one of those Kylo Ren lightsabers on force Friday a few months back and Ive goofed around with it with friends a handful of times since. But the other day I was playfully engaging in a lightsaber battle with my girlfriends daughter when about  minutes in the saber started to flicker...and flicker more..and sputter..and almost turn off. Id never had it on that long and figured maybe the batteries were going out. So I turned it off and replaced them continued the battle and again.. minutes in..the same thing. Now I truely believe that its programmed into it to do that and its a clue to something that will happen in The Force Awakens. I think Rens self constructed saber will start to malfunction and itll give someone the upper hand. Anyone else out there with the toy should give it a go because if it turns out to be that way in the film thats a hell of an easter egg to hide in the world ,StarWars,cx77jmt,1,t5_2qi4s

5749587,0,t3_3tvv53,Youre so beautifulThats because Im so in loveNo its because Im so in love with you!God damn it George.  Learn how to write dialogue.That being said my biggest problem with this movie was that they waited until the very end before they realized oh we are supposed to turn Anakin to the dark side and then rushed it.  So we ended up with a very short timeframe in which Anakin turns Palpatine in to the Jedi Council then Anakin intervenes with great remorse to prevent Palpatines death... then moments later Anakin murders every man woman and child in the Jedi temple.  Uh... ok I guess.  Palpatine should have revealed himself right after Anakin defeats Dooku and is at a new height with his passioninduced powers.  The rest of the movie can show Anakin gaining strength while ObiWan starts to catch on.  Then they could have ObiWan be the one to deduce that Palpatine is the Sith Lord and bringing Anakin before the council.  This would set up a situation in which Anakin confesses his secret marriage to Padme and his fear of the visions of her death. Rather than offering to help Anakin the Council expels him from the order.  Now you can send Anakin back to Palpatine at the same time the Jedi Masters show up to kill him.  That imo would create a perfect storm where Anakin feels betrayed by the Jedi and decides to side with the one person who promises to help him save Padme.  Now you have Anakin in a position of true rage against the Jedi that Palpatine can twist into a desire to destroy everyone in the Temple.,StarWars,cx9siwf,153,t5_2qi4s
5749647,0,t3_3tvv53,I consider myself a pretty hardcore Star Wars fan I love the symbolism and storyelements of the saga. And thats why I think I love ROTS. Its easy to dismiss this movie as just a bunch of scenes leading up to Anakins downfall but theres so much more going on under the surface. One thing I love about  ROTS is that it really focuses on the moral grayness. Its easy to label the Sith the sole bad guys but by the time ROTS starts the Jedi have become pretty corrupt themselves. Theyre training Jedi child soldiers forbidding love and theyve become war like Were keepers of the peace not soldiers. Thats why I think Yoda took his loss to the Emperor as hard as he did. He wasnt beaten only physically but mentally and emotionally. The villains are great too. The Emperor kills it in this movie. And I love Dooku too when he and Anakin are dueling and he gives him the I sense great FEAR in you Skywalker. You have hate... you have anger but you dont use them. COMPLETELY underrated line. Rare prequel dialogue that has the appropriate emotion attached to it. And while Im at it... I like Grevious too. His weird obsession with collecting lightsabers of the Jedi hes killed is a great character quality. Wish he wouldve been introduced in Attack of the Clones so he couldve had more of a backstory.If you havent I highly recommend reading the novelization of ROTS. It hits on a lot of the themes in the movie that even a hardcore fan could miss. Most notably when Anakin finally dons the Vader armor. He realizes how bad he fucked up how much living in the suit sucks and realizes just how permanent the consequences are.My only major dislikes of the film the scene with Anakin killing the younglings wasnt necessary in the slightest. We know who Darth Vader is we know hes one of the most evil movie villains of all time we get it. Vader was evil not a sociopath. Also the scene where Anakin tells Mace Windu that Palps is a sith lord is the worst fucking scene in all the prequels. Mace just found out that Palps has slowly been eradicating the very thing Mace dedicated his life to. Hes lost friends his ability to use the Force and his self in a way... and his reaction is like Anakin told him he forgot to take out the trash. Its the most earthshattering moment for Mace and hes like A sith lord.... hmmmm. Well now that you mention it I can see it. Weird didnt see that one coming. ,StarWars,cx9ssiv,32,t5_2qi4s

I dont know about the whole betrayal thing but I think his motivation for hating the republic is spurned more by what he republic has done to him and less by Sidious.  Obiwan got in there unseen. They did not capture him until he sent a transmission. Jedi are a slippery bunch. And then there is the asteroid field. Easy to hide your approach there. As for the republic fleet well I am sure there was more to their arrival than we know about.  Dooku is a tricky beast. I would think he does and while he is working with Sidious I feel that at the same time he is constantly trying to win the war and beat Sidious. Conflict between master and apprentice is a necessity with the sith. ,StarWars,cxazl8j,4,t5_2qi4s

5766914,0,t1_cxbqci6,Well I see it as there being two options. Either you can view the movies as inconsistent or you can submit yourself to the rules of their universe and use that universe to justify what happens in that universe. I prefer the latter. I just rewatched that scene for good measure and ObiWan seems to have fared as well as could be expected against an armored warrior. Jango lost his pistols but still had weaponry and was still actively fighting him. Obi wouldnt have been at peak energy or concentration. Thats how I would justify it anyway. Besides maybe its against the Jedi code to use the Force against the living. The Jedi seem only use the Force against droids and Sith who are the embodiment of evil. Maybe its not the Jedi way to use the Force to harm life Sith being the corruption of life. The only time we see the Force being used against nonsith living beings is by Darth Vader antiJedi when he Forcechokes people and these were noncombatants at that. Im also reminded of the scene in Attack of the Clones where Anakin uses the Force to lift a pear and he says to Padme that ObiWan would be really grumpy if he saw him do that. So perhaps Jedi are only supposed to use their powers to protect life never to be used lightly and never to be used against the living. Actually I just thought of an example to the contrary... Luke did Forcechoke the guards at Jabbas palace but three things could be said about that  he wasnt a fullfledged Jedi at that point  he was not exposed to the Jedi teachings the same way Jedi in the prequels were and  Jedi arent perfect. But maybe ObiWan was pretty darn close to perfect.Its unfortunate IMO that we didnt get to learn more about the codified Jedi teachings in the prequel trilogy. That would have been nice. Much about the Jedi religion remains a mystery. ,StarWars,cxbxswf,1,t5_2qi4s

5779300,0,t3_3u9iyh,I saw it first day in Boulder Colorado skipped out of work for a few hours to catch it.  My hopes were high but the movie lost me at midichlorians at that point I wanted to strangle George Lucas for trying to reduce the Force to something scientific.  I thought the pod race was dull and predictable.  And having a child play Anakin was annoying I was not buying having a slave child build a droid capable of speaking six billion dialects.  I couldnt even understand what Jar Jar was saying so I did not know what to make of him at the time.  But during the movie I remember thinking there was a slight sinister vibe about Jar Jar behind the cute and cuddly thing so people may have been on to something with Lucas initially pursuing a Darth Jar Jar twist. I thought Darth Maul was going to be awesome from seeing him in previews but I felt letdown in the movie.  I could not follow the politics the first time around.  The lightsaber battles were awesome though like nothing I had ever seen.So when I walked out of the movie theater I was happy about seeing Obi Wan and Quigonn in action but disappointed with everything else because my hopes were so high.

I remember talking with my friends about maybe Vader was still alive but at this time sequels were very rare not something a five year old would think of.  Then theres rumors in Bantha Tracks the magazine I sent for after getting a flyer with the grappling hook utility belt I sent away for with poofs of purchase  trading that said Obi Wan would be back. Then ESB comes out and it is the best movie ever made.  Luke gets sent on a quest by Obi Han saves his ass.  Yoda is a fucking Muppet that knows the force.  Lando is coolthen the biggest asshole everthen a debate on the play yard about the ethics of selling out your friend to save cloud city. At the end Han was taken by Boba to Jabba who we know nothing about.  There was no scene with Han and Jabba in ANH. Han shot first.  Vader was Lukes dad WTF.  GOOD DAMN did I want an ATAT for Christmas that rich asshole down the street got one and it was the coolest thing ever.  I got the dagobah playset.  It was cool theyre was this foam bog that you could push an action figure through but it wasnt a fucking atat.  I sent away for the Droid bounty hunter with my poofs of purchase. ROTJ its really cliche now but Leia in the metal bikini was the start of puberty.  The Jabba music scene wasnt there but Boba died really weak. The speeder bikes were awesome nothing like it.  The Ewoks kind of sucked but Leia saved Han and that was cool.  Vader was redeemed.  Yub Nub. That was the end. In college we had an amazing star wars party.  It was nostalgia mixed with the really hot girl in the gold bikini. Then the enhance versions.  Han shot in self defense? Bullshit.  PM trailer was amazing.  I taped that commercial and watched it over and over.  Then the movie came out.  I was in line the first day.  As  the first showing was let out we could see on their faces something was wrong but nothing could have prepared me for how much was wrong.

5799699,1,t1_cxfzktr,Im not so much talking about the stakes in the plot itself though thats another discussion youre obviously right that there were stakes but the dialogue and the pacing was so poorly executed that it felt forced at best and goofy at worst like the Mona Lisa painted with crayons as I am about the interplay between the actionlightsaber battles since thats what the thread is about and where the movies are headed. When do lightsaber battles in the OT take place and what do they mean?ANH ObiWan dies at the hands of Vader setting up the OTs main antagonist and casting Luke alone into the world to fend for himself while learning about the Force. ESB Luke ignores Yodas exhortations and goes to Bespin to save his friends setting up a nervewracking encounter where he loses a hand and finds out Vader is his father. ROTJ Luke fights Vader and the Emperor we know how it ends its a huge deal for multiple reasons.Okay now that thats established when do lightsaber duels in the prequels happen and what do they mean?TPM QuiGon who has no discernable personality and we have little reason to care about beyond him being in the movie dies fighting Darth Maul who we have little reason to care about beyond him being in the movie. Darth Maul dies and its literally meaningless to the plot QuiGon dies and its only significance is that ObiWan now trains Anakin. QuiGon is not mentioned again afaik until Revenge when were suddenly supposed to remembercare about him again. His death has no apparent personal impact on ObiWan whatsoever over the long term nor does it have any effect on Anakin. He does not come back in dreams or visions. AOTC Yoda fights Count Dooku. We have little to no reason to care about Dooku other than the fact that hes evil. I dont even remember why they were fighting. Nobody died or was injured. Anakin and ObiWan fight Count Dooku. Samsies. Anakin loses a hand. It has absolutely no significance whatsoever to the plot other than being a callback to Empire. Even in Empire it signified Lukes connection to his machinelike father and a hint that in seeking to confront Vader he risked becoming like that which he hated. ROTS Holy shit lightsaber battles up the wazoo. Yoda fights Emperor Palpatine. Neither of them dies. Its a lightsaber battle. Mace Windu fights Emperor Palpatine. Windu dies but we dont really give a shit about him because he serves no purpose in the films other than to show that Anakin is now evil. Obi Wan and Anakin fight Count Dooku. Dooku dies but we dont really give a shit about him because he serves no purpose in the films other than to show that Anakin is now evil and to be a designated bad guy. Obi Wan fights a fucking fourarmed robot General also a designated bad guy who we have no reason to give a shit about with a case of pneumonia. And finally Anakin fights ObiWan in the most drawnout overly dramatic lightsaber duel in the entire film series. I will admit that it was extraordinarily wellchoreographed and the stakes were high but the bombast of it cheapened it when it could easily have been smaller more personal and a lot more emotionally impactful while still having a sense of danger due to it taking place in a volcano. See what I mean? Lightsabers arent cool because theyre glowy deathrods. Theyre cool because were supposed to REMEMBER that scene where Luke gets his hand cut off or where Luke and Vader duel in the throne room as his friends die and he drifts close to the dark side or where ObiWan willingly gives his life to become one with the Force and play a more important role in Lukes path. Those scenes are all memorable and emotionally substantive.

5859608,0,t1_cxnk12i,I dont think corgis are any more receptive to costumes than any other dog breed... I dont think dogs in general typically enjoy wearing anything unless it helps then with some medical condition or physical reasons.  There are lots of pics of dogs in costumes all over the internet but perhaps the reason you see corgis specifically may be due to their popularity with social media as well as their image in costume big head short legs stumpy body.  This leads to them being chosen for cosplay more frequently probably.  ,StarWars,cxnq2fr,3,t5_2qi4s

5859970,0,t1_cxnr2ye,No there is no plot reason for it.  They are correct in saying it is a result of older special effects.  Originally they tried visualizing the lightsabers by making the blade very reflective with the idea that the actor would hold the blade pointing towards the camera and then when it was slowly angled to the side lights reflect off it and it would appear to turn on and extend.  This didnt work well and they eventually hand drew in each lightsaber blade on top of the original effect.

5864988,0,t3_3vh7f5,Youve hit one of the many reasons I didnt like this book. The author wrote the characters with knowledge of the galaxy only the audience sitting outside and observing should have. Yes it is a big galaxy and there may be more stories of the Sith than we know but in the same way its a big galaxy and stories dont get spread around that specifically or quickly. Reys comment in TFA trailer sums it up nicely There are stories about what happened. That should be the understanding any character without a direct link to the movies has of Jedi or Sith and even then knowing specifics is a stretch. So you are correct there is no reason the  year old character should know all of that. These new canon novels have been so hit or miss its unfortunate to say the least. ,StarWars,cxofiiv,2,t5_2qi4s

The idea being that how could someone who had known sin possibly carry Christ inside of her.  So the Catholics came up with by that I mean it is not in the bible the idea that she was chosen by God for this role so he made sure that she was without sin immaculate the instant she was conceived.EDIT Added link and fixed an error.,StarWars,cxrrm5m,4,t5_2qi4s

5905482,0,t3_3w5zc6,Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith are both better than A New Hope.The only thing wrong with The Phantom Menace is the pacing.As a younger fan I cant imagine being very invested in the Star Wars galaxy if it werent for all the cool places shown in the prequels. The OT barely even shows the people that the rebels were supposedly fighting for.The duel in The Phantom Menace is good but overrated. It only gets really good in the last few seconds when its down to ObiWan and Darth Maul.The Clone Wars and Rebels should  not be considered on the same level as movie canon. They consistently cheapen the events of the movies even though theyre pretty good a lot of the time.Thats also my fear for the new trilogy and especially the side movies. Eventually Im worried that new Star Wars movies wont seem special anymore due to oversaturation.Anakin and Padme actually make a cute couple when theyre rolling around giggling or Across the Stars is playing. Its just the stiff dialogue that gets in the way and even then they have some good lines and chemistry at times.The pod race is a really fun exciting scene especially on the big screen.,StarWars,cxtqqfi,21,t5_2qi4s

5911552,0,t1_cxue8kl,gt How different are your mixes compared to the actual orchestra performance when you work with John Williams? Well with John Williams we dont layer. Everybody records at one time and Johns orchestrations are such that our best shot is to get a live representation of what hes written. Because of that were typically doing live mixes or close to live mixes and were not adorning them with anything other than a little bit of reverb. His compensation his writing is complete. He doesnt use orchestrators generally. He balances it on stage the way he wants it to sound and he will check with me in terms of playback. If its what he wants then its what he wants and thats what we stick with. We do not use samples we do not use multiple takes other than for editorial purposes and performance but we dont layer and we rarely overdub. The only time I can tell you that we did much in the way of overdubbing was a heavily percussive section in A Lost World or Star Wars Episodes  or  where we had a lot of percussion and we did that separately. gt How do you approach reverb for dense orchestral sections?We use multiple reverbs typically. We use a short dense reverb to sort of fill the spaces between the instruments and we use a longer reverb to create a tail. We use it judiciously for film and music because we dont want the reverb to overcome the direct sound in terms of competition with sound effects and dialogue on the screen. We want the picture to represent the music on the screen accurately. So multiple reverbs typically not too much for classical recording or sound track recording we typically add a little bit more reverb for the CD and typically a little bit more as well because we want to make sure there is a good clarity and a good accuracy in music representation verses sound effects and dialogue on the screen.gt did you mix Thomas Bergersen  Final Frontier?No. I dont know who did it. I can ask Thomas. ,StarWars,cxujcex,22,t5_2qi4s

5922027,0,t1_cxvv5i8,My thoughts exactly. I would think they have to constantly use the Force when wielding a lightsaber. Thats why nonForcesensitive people cant safely use the weapon.

Id assume it would be far harder to find lightsaber masters after the PT purge. Also Jedi use lightsabers because their reflexes allow them to not be that guy For nonforce sensitives theyre really little better than things to show off on a wall somewhere when you got people running around with blasters. ,StarWars,cxvx1l3,1,t5_2qi4s

After several past wars and conflictsSpanish Civil War WW ect. that lead to the creation of the current carnation of the Republic the pre ww version of the UN that was created to prevent another war. Due to burocracy and insane taxation that lead several economicly desperate worlds and factions who felt betrayed or exploited Germany Japan Italy to eventual come together to form the CIS Axis Powers. The first was the Trade Federation Japan laying seige on neighboring planets like Naboo China and the surrounding pacific islands. The jedi council a neutral faction that thinks its the keepers of the peace  U.S. sends jedi sactions and all that business prevention shit to try and halt the seige. Later the Trade Federation joined the CIS Japan joining the Axis power as Count Duku Adolfmussolini semi secretly start pumping out a droid army  German army. The CIS start taking surounding systems into its fold invasion of Poland and Checkoslahowever your suposed to spell itbluh im too tired for this while the Republic sat around arguing about what to do Basicly Britian freaking out about crazy Count Hitler is going rampant across Europe. with the neutral suport from the jedi U.S. Sending suplies to Britian Padame Churchhill the manliest manly man of the maniverse tries to convince the senate British Parliament to go to war while they didnt listen.After Padame and friends are threaten with exacution in the arena Battle over Britian between the luffewaffles and the R.A.F. and fight off the enemy temporarily a Clone Army that has been building up for the past several years  The U.S. and Russia the canadians helped too eh dont forget us Aussies mate come into the wareffort to bolster up the Grand Army of the Republic Allied Forces. After years of war countless lives lost and homes destroyed  Count DukuAdolf Mussohitler was killed after a daring counter attack to kidnap Listerine the battle of the bulge and the loss of their greatest General Greivous Rommel. Ok I know Grevious in the movie is a evil cowardly asshole and Rommel was a pretty badass general but they were both the best generals of their respective armies arguably. Soon the rest of the of the CIS Japan Basicly was on the losing defensive when the Emperor ordered Darth Vader The atom bombs to wipe out the last of the CiS and shut down their droids Japan surrenders . But with one enemy down the Galactic Empire  America andor Societ Union. It dependS on who you find the greater evil or maybe they were both equally evil i dont know. Im here for the Starwars bro they spread the Imperial might across the galaxy Terra Ferma for a new age of fear.

The difference is that while audiences had seen many of the characters in the series before it aired it was our first introduction to Grievous. We had no real backdrop to fall back on or act as a contrast.

For another the Prequels came out after the internet had started to get big so theres a much wider pool of critics with very different tastes and metrics than the traditional newspaper reviewer of the s and s.,StarWars,cxxxjuo,4,t5_2qi4s

The temptation to not listen to others and just do whatever we want leads to dark paths. In this case a movie with horrible plot bad acting and awful characters.

5947652,0,t1_cxylec1,I hope it mirrors Episode IV by showing us a unique universe with plenty of imaginative locations and characters and species. I want to feel like Im stepping into a preexisting universe and seeing little details. I want to feel like a kid seeing all of the aliens in the cantina for the first time. The plot is almost secondary for me  I hope its good of course but what I really want to see is a realistic glimpse of life in the galaxy across the different cultures and institutions if that makes sense. Even if the film end with Finn and Rey getting medals and BB comes rolling in beeping happily it wont bother me as long as the universe provides fertile ground for new stories. I guess what Im getting at is whats most important to me is that its a good canvas for future material. I do feel like were likely to get a cliffhanger ending though since Episode VIII is definitely going to happen and they want people top be pumped. ,StarWars,cxz9n0u,1,t5_2qi4s

5958166,0,t1_cy0j8if,rofl well...s no. Theres no mention of him nor is there a single Gungan that I could spot.Jar Jar being an evil mastermind makes no sense. Hes a gungan. Theyre a race of amphibious people and their only connection to the galaxy at large is through the humans that live on the surface. If Lucas wanted Jar Jar to have a bigger role like that he should have hinted at MUCH more it in the first film not made him a blithering idiot. Yodas reveal happens in the span of one single scene... hes annoying and ridiculous for like  minutes and then hes awesome. Yodas race is also never revealed in the films and because we dont know his race we cant pick apart inconsistencies like how a Gungan on a populated planet with force powers didnt get noticed by the Jedi. If Jar Jar is a sith lord there should have been way more evidence.,StarWars,cy0na2r,2,t5_2qi4s

Thats pretty much the main audience so Im happy about that. It gave me what Ive wanted for a long time. Also interesting you were disappointed with Kylo Ren. I loved his character. Almost like a confused young man with anger and emotional issues. It made him unpredictable and I got the feeling he was capable of anything. Especially after that.... Scene with Han Solo. Episode  to me felt very cold. Almost like the actors were just moving from  green screen to the next. The force awakens felt real it felt raw. ,StarWars,cy1353f,1,t5_2qi4s

Make him a woman make him be tempted by the light rather than the dark etc. Thoroughly enjoyed it though and its set up nicely for the sequels. Nice humour throughout. Kylo Ren was a sympathetic villain in the same way as Darth became in III. Not sure about the big baddy Snoke ... he seemed a bit Harry Potter. ,StarWars,cy29o2h,5,t5_2qi4s

5970685,0,t3_3x7y8a,Feels like other JJ Abrams films I have watched previouslyGreat action scenes looks cool good setting but lacking in depth and parts of the story are omitted quite two dimensional in that aspect.Barely anything about the Republic is mentioned and what position the First OrderRepublic are in nothing really told us about what happened in the last  years we have to buy books for that apparently.I know what Im saying may not be popular but it felt as if there was sometimes a bit too much humour so it came off more as like a really good fan fiction doing fan service for  years of no Star wars and as such whenever people think about the movie a bit more they realise it kind of lacks depth.In saying this it was very fun to watch and was cool seeing the saber fight with Kylo just felt a bit weird in the change of pace at the end.,StarWars,cy2add4,14,t5_2qi4s

5973766,0,t1_cy23ax5,The camera work is lazy as hell for a start. Any first year media student would have been more creative than to have shot  reverse shot with a master. The cinematography is boring and borderline arrogant. Reeked of a director who just wanted to get them over with.The dialogue was mostly cringey  Anakin youre breaking my heart. Youre going down a path I cannot follow being a prime example. The performances were wooden probably because despite the actors talent they were acting in front of blue screens  of the time. I mean hell ALL of the clone troopers were CGI. How can you act opposite nothing and make it believable? As a result of this the films have aged really poorly as well. Some of it looks more gamelike than the new Star Wars Battlefront.Also the plot holes were huge. Bringing Anakin from the safety of Coruscant to the front line of a war for no reason except the plot needed it being one of many examples. Jar Jar Binks. The overchoreographed lightsaber fights where none of the fighters are actually trying to hit each other they just want it to look flashy.ObiWan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker share about  minutes of screen time over all three films and only for about  of them do they actually seem to like each other. Yet were supposed to be convinced they are the best of friends?? All because we are just told and not shown how much they mean to each other?The needless inclusion of Chewbacca in RotS.The creepy Anakin  Padme love story.The lackluster villains whose only purpose is to have a cool fight at the end of each film. A single villain would have worked better to actually develop some character. I know people love Darth Maul but thats a purely surface level he looks cool kind of love. I mean what is his actual character? His motivation?The change of the force from a mystical energy to something scientific.Creating inconsistencies between the originals and prequels like how did ObiWan know RD for nigh on  years and completely forget him in A New Hope? The fan service of having CPO in the movies that meant they had to do a cliche mind wipe to avoid creating huge plot discrepancies. The big battles between clones and droids that mean nothing and have nothing at stake.Poo and fart jokes.....The ending of Phantom Menace had too much going on to care about s of it. four things happening was excessive and distracting. Even Lucas himself knew that in hindsight.I dont hate them by the way but dont be naive enough to think all the hate they do get is because its the cool thing to do. No the films had massive flaws and pointing them out isnt being part of a circlejerk. ,StarWars,cy2ox2r,2,t5_2qi4s

5973982,0,t1_cy2cvxj,Considering just how important force users are in the lore and all the rumors about the relatives and children of  the original characters the spoiler points arent exactly mindblowing. Basically all the potential spoilers have been discussed to death in the fandom. Also the Expanded Universe played around with similar ideas even if it may be entirely retconned now.But nothing beats the big screen Star Wars experience.

It made great sense because Kylo was out of control...I mean no one else is really rocking a lightsaber so how many fights could he have been in before? So he kept swinging.  That lightsaber of his was cool though and the sides werent just exhaust.  Also I knew Finn was going to get messed up and knew that was him that Rey was crying for.

5977988,0,t3_3xbpya,Ok. First off your spelling of Rey is distracting. Second youre entitled to your opinion but I disagree.  Call backs to New Hope for sure but its not like its the Hangover II.  Kylo Ren is the first interesting villain for this series since the original trilogy.  I dont understand this point. First off there could be more to Fins back story but I still thought he was acting as if he was well aware what the First Order was capable of he was capable with blasters and close quarters combat.  Fencing is an art doesnt mean I couldnt swing a sword at people and potentially harm them.  No.  again dont know her full back story  how do we know she has no force training? Seems like KyloBen kind of unlocked something when he was trying to see the map.  Did Captain Phasmas screen time really enter into your nine list reason as to why this movie was awful? This may be a stupider reason for not liking the movie than  colors of lasers changed in  years who cares? Hes created one monster who nearly wiped out all the Jedi he was isolating himself so he couldnt do that again or go through that pain again. Plus if he were to be out in the open and get killed then the Jedi are extinct. ,StarWars,cy38u5q,12,t5_2qi4s

And besides that I distinctly remember in the Clone Wars that they were able to extract entire seperatist battle plans from the head of a tactical droid. Why didnt they just do something similar here? Edit And then the whole part with the map didnt make any sense either. You could just take BBs section of the map and line it up with other known maps of the galaxy and locate it that way. One might argue that the galaxy is huge and that the one R had wasnt the whole galaxy but a recognizable piece of it but that doesnt mean Resistance technicians couldnt just run scans of star maps until a match was found.,StarWars,cy3d7db,1,t5_2qi4s

Luke was afraid of becoming like Vader and being tempted by the Dark Side and thus sent her away to an undisclosed to him location to protect herthe Jedi Order.B She was born of midichlorians like Anakin as to bring balance to the force. Luke was in exile and the only Jedi. The Force knew that Kylo Ren would complete his transition to the Dark Side with killing Han and thus spawned in advance the creation of Rey to bring balance. ,StarWars,cy3fr4s,3,t5_2qi4s

Vader was just a monster for most the OT and Anakin was written so poorly that I couldnt really see him as a normal person though honestly I love the PT despite its flaws but with Ren hes this confused conflicted individual who has NO IDEA how to use the power of the Dark Side. People have griped about his tantrums but I see it as hes this kid who has only been trained by Jedi who wants to use the Dark Side of the force and all he hears is how anger and pain bring the power so he just goes apeshit thinking it will make him more powerful.

5983384,0,t3_3xd12j,Holy spaceballs. This movie was amazing! I suspected from the beginning a more KOTORish style especially with the SB Base and specifically the theme of the Resistance Fighters mainly Poe and this left me with a big smile.Also seeing it in dx also the first film ever to see in this format increased the viewing experience from a  to a . The chairs were moving in perfect sync with the shakings of the camera or important parts of the screen and that made the ending duel bloody brutal and with a lot of weight in it a superb cinematic experience that I enjoyed for the first time in my generation When the iforgothernamesorry creature that attacked Finn and had its legs torn water fell from the ceiling and it felt as gooey crap from the monster. Overall this was a very fun day thank you JJ Abrams you didnt fail to deliver thats something not many can do.

If I was John Boyega I would be upset if I never got to use another light saber again. As Rey trains with luke to become a Jedi I think Finn will go on his own search or train himself and accidentally find out hes Force sensitive and then be sent off to where Luke and Rey is to be trained. I can just see the episode  poster and its off Rey and Finn with there sabers in some badass looking Jedi gear.

5983669,0,t3_3xd12j,I really enjoyed the movie overall.  Not perfect lot of plot points from ep but still great.  I have nothing else to add that hasnt been said x already other than an easter egg I noticed that hasnt been pointed out.  Did anyone else notice when Finn was on the Falcon digging through parts for Rey he pulled out the hovering orb that shoots lasers at Luke from Ep then proceeds to toss it?,StarWars,cy3znxo,1,t5_2qi4s
5983693,0,t1_cy3jxt4,I love your breakdown and I think it makes a lot of sense. I dont like the idea that that Rey is a Skywalker. Its too obvious. I loved the idea that Anakin Skywalker was the chosen one that would bring balance to the force and eventually he fulfilled the prophecy. I really hate the prequels but I loved his arc from unnaturally force sensitive child to growing up and being seduced by the dark side and eventually being brought back by his son and finding redemption before he died. Having said all of that I think Rey is the second coming of the chosen one I.e. Anakin Skywalker. I think they really downplayed the title of the film The Force Awakens. I think that Rey was able to resist Kylo Ren not only because she is the chosen one but because the Force has awoken and is actively guiding Rey she not only was able to resist Kylo Ren but was able to look into his mind the way he did to her. She not only saw his feelings but also knowledge of the force. She was able to hold her own against Kylo at the end because she had been in his mind and the force was working through her. When the ground split in two separating Rey and Kylo I felt like the force wasnt done with either of them. How did Anakins light saber call out to Rey? Has there been a precedent for light sabers having sentience? I dont have those answers but my tinfoil theory fits in because the saber wasnt necessarily calling out to Rey but its reincarnated master. Though he may not be force sensitive I think that Fin is also being manipulated by the force in some ways. He got his ass handed to him but he held on for at least a few blows. Anyways Ill take my tinfoil fedora off now. ,StarWars,cy3zs0k,1,t5_2qi4s

5984279,0,t3_3xbl9a,But to me in a way he is like Vader. In all the movies before this AnakinVader is seen in his rise to the dark side and his death in the dark side and his actual death. We never actually see what Anakin was like in his first few years as Vader Except maybe in the old EU or the new EU. To me Kylo Ren is actually sort of how Anakin would have been maybe a year or so after becoming Vader mainly dark but still struggling with both sides of the force. The only difference is in these movie you dont actually see Ben Solo being an angsty teenyoung adult but he probably did have a sort of similar fall although without seeing the whole story this is all speculation. just my thoughts.,StarWars,cy42jrc,1,t5_2qi4s

Perhaps fin is force sensitive and well learn that later which allowed him to be different from the other indocrinated troopers.  Not every answer had to be in the one movie.Captain Fasma is also supposed to have a bigger role in future films.  I will agree she took down the shields too easily..however we dont know her character or motivations yet.  Kylo Ren was the best part IMO were tricked into thinking hes badass then come to realize the very human aspect behind him when his mask comes off.  Hes acting just like a teenager with a lot of power and being made angry by the dark side would.  As for the fight i felt similiar but you can also remember Storm troopers did get melee training as shown by fins fight with a trooper.  Ren had just killed his father and taken a bowcaster to the gut.  But i will agree he could have been taken out more swiftly.Otherwise i think perhaps expecting too much development time for things.

I really want to see more about them.Also Kylo Ren is an interesting guy. Throughout the movie I think starting at when he speaks to Vader you begin to see him not as a strong Sith Lord but as what he really is an acolyte. Ive called him weak quite a bit in describing him because as of this movie he is weak. He doesnt have a really deep connection to the dark side but definitely not the light side he just wants to be strong and be known. Hes not particularly wise isnt totally intune with the Force a lot to learn and isnt extremely strong though you could tell that he was physically stronger than Rey in that battle which shows how wellchoreographed the fights were.That being said Ren doesnt seem like hell be that way for long. Hes absolutely going to be taken in by the Supreme Leader and trained more and he will come back more powerful but we have Luke now so its okay.Im so giddy ,StarWars,cy4alx4,1,t5_2qi4s

Also that scene in her force vision with all the bodies and the Knights of Ren... if Kylo massacred the new order Lukes exile makes more sense.

5989568,0,t1_cy4qysz,Thats one way to see it but i think most would agree that he has way too normal person traits. Like his infatuation with Rey? I just dont buy it. The argument that he was just not used to the freedom so he went over the top might be true if he had a sense of freedom before or during his training as a storm trooper. It is not plausible that after being taken from his parents and trained his whole life that he could have any amount of normalcy. However for the sake of the movie i can see why he acted the way he did.EDIT i just dont think he was developed logically. He suffered from a PTSDinducing experience but seems not affected by it at all. I just wish that we could see how it affected him for longer than just a few minutes. After he meets Rey he seems completely normal again. Kind of disappointing for me. I wanted a little more development.,StarWars,cy4rhu6,1,t5_2qi4s

5989686,0,t1_cy4jrca,Yeah. But at the same time what else are they going to do? Ford probably only did the movie in the first place because they said You get your wish we kill Han. At some point he wont be doing it. Han is not about to be portrayed by another person I mean in the main story and if he was in one movie and not the next there would have to be some kind of explanation as to what happened. And anything they come up with to write him out of the story would probably be crap and not nearly as fitting of an end as to what we got.,StarWars,cy4s1sn,8,t5_2qi4s
5989739,0,t3_3xfv3i,I like the new style. Its a good balance between technical plausible swordplay and character expression. Kylo Rens wild strikes reflect his emotional instability and Reys relatively tight motions convey her focus and trust in the Force. The prequel stuff is technical in a choreographic sense but fairly useless in terms of actual swordplay. Theres an attackblockattack rhythm that doesnt represent the ideal use of a long twohanded weapon ideally one should have offensive and defensive components in each of their actions. The original trilogy and TFA both do a better job of conveying the single tempo nature of the twohanded sword in both Eastern and Western martial traditions than the prequels. A great example is when Rey is parrying Kylos strikes in a panning shot as shes retreating each of her parries keeps her point aimed at Kylo preventing him from closing too much distance as shes constantly presenting a threat that he must bypass. If you want to do some reading on the ideal use of a twohanded sword then youll want to look up the likes of Johannes Liechtenauer and Miyamoto Musashi. Both left manuscript evidence of their highly successful approaches both placing great emphasis on ensuring that one is parrying and attacking in the same unit of time. Liechtenauer himself didnt leave any books behind but there are plenty by his students Peter von Danzig and Sigmund Ringeck are popular sources for their relative completeness. ,StarWars,cy4sary,2,t5_2qi4s

5990339,0,t3_3xiede,Oh yes entirely. Could go two ways. This could turn into an homage remake series which looks like itll be fun and good. Thatd be okay. I hope though that this is a buildup to subvert the expectations that well just more rebooting with . This movie had no surprises every twist was predictable pretty far in advance once you realised it was a new hope rebooted. So now if they really want to mindscrew us theyll continue that pattern for the first half of ep and then once were completely ingrained in the reboot mentality theyll turn it entirely upside down. Were all going to be expecting the equivalent I am your father reveal. The only way to get us to say thats not true thats impossible is to utterly pull the rug from under us. Im not sure how yet.

5990571,0,t3_3xguab,I wanna start by saying I really enjoyed the movie. Overall I think this movie nailed it. While I was watching this movie it felt quintessentially Star Wars  which was something that didnt really come through on the prequels. However there were a few things that stood out to me. These may be nitpicky  but these are thoughts I had while watching the movie  not things I was actively trying to find wrong with the film How quickly Rey consciously became badass Jedi. I thought the interrogation scene was actually done extremely well  I can easily see resisting that interrogation as being a subconscious  struggle. I also dont have a huge issue with the lightsaber duel. But the mind trick on the stormtrooper...I just dont get it. It was jarring seeing her use that when previously she didnt even know the jedi existed. I get the rationalizations maybe she had previous training etc. If one of those rationalizations turned out to be true I wish they would have resolved it in this movie rather than us trying to make shit up for  years to fit the story. I could have much more accepted that scene if the mind trick had not been so obviously intentional  maybe something along the lines of Rey screaming Let me out of here! or something similar and the stormtrooper complying  still achieves the goal of showing her connection to the force without being...strange Finns humor  My guess is that they are trying to use Finn to replace Han as the source of sarcasm. However Finns humor felt so...unrealistic to me. When Finn said some of his jokes I would lose my immersion  I suddenly became hyper aware I was watching a move. In particular Im in charge now Phasma and Why you going like this huh? Why? Why you doing that? Why you going like this felt really weird to me. However I thought Hans jokes felt much more natural Move ball  Thats not how the force works  maybe thats a result of a more well known character. Finns willingness to kill stormtroopers  Another poster mentioned how quickly Finn was willing to kill stormtroopers after turning traitor. One day Finn is comforting a dying comrade and the next he is grinning while murdering a hangar full of stormtroopers  troopers he has grown up with and trained with his entire life. Also according to Phasma this is Finns first occurrence of noncompliance  so it doesnt seem like this is something Finn has struggled with for a very long time. After writing all of that I wanted to write what I liked  to cheer me up Kylo Ren  The voice the acting the writing  sensing his struggle was so easy Acting in general  I thought all of the actors did a great job. Even though I didnt like some of the dialog Finn  I still thought those lines were delivered very well BB  I didnt expect to like the little guy so damn much Im one of the few that actually liked the score but thats never something that stands out to me,StarWars,cy4w81n,5,t5_2qi4s

They really need to flesh that out in the next one or things could get very shallow very quickly. Without a clear view of the overall political situation the fighting risks devolving into one group fighting another just for the sake of it and thats no different than any mindless action movie with a paperthin plot.

5993696,0,t1_cy58xpp,I was talking with someone today about levels of force sensitivity. Since it surrounds everyone it is reasonable that anybody could tap into it if only for a moment or a small amount. Also genetics obviously play a huge role in force sensitivity which results in some mixed feelings that I have about midichlorians you mentioned prequels. While they are kinda unnecessary from a plot perspective it still makes sense. Its like a genetic marker a signal that can be measured to a seemingly accurate degree. Midichlorians arent the force just beings that accumulate in force sensitive areas. Regarding the decanonization I have a better idea. Make a bunch of that stuff myths and legends that spread after the rise of the empire. It could also be attributed to some sort of imperial misinformation spreading like some CIAtype shit. Then nobody knows about the force or by extension midichlorians. Midis become a degree removed in universe from the canon if that makes any sense. But there will always be some keeper of ancient knowledge on some planet that knows about all the dumb stuff in SW canon. My question is if Star Wars canon exists and nobody in Star Wars knows about it is it still canon?Sorry for the rant.,StarWars,cy5aydv,1,t5_2qi4s

Its quite possible that he was actually born as a woman but had a sexchange operation. Its quite possible that he is attracted to small children. Its quite possible that he is a vegetarian. Its quite possible that he is a homophobe. Its quite possible that Lando Calrissian is in love with Han Solo. Its quite possible that Han and Chewie had a homosexual relationship with one another. Its quite possible that he is insert any number of different random presumptions. Do you see now why its dumb to make completely unsubstantiated assumptions about the character without any evidence to support those assumptions? Im not saying it would be wrong if he was bi or anything like that Im just saying that it is ridiculous to presume about characteristics that we have been given absolutely no evidence to suspect. We could sit here and list an infinite number of things he could possibly be but unless were given a reason to assume those things then were just being stupid.All weve seen so far is that he likes Rey. So the only reasonable assumption we can make from that is that he is in fact straight.

5995203,1,t1_cy5hj3k,I appreciate your comments.I most certainly did avoid parts of the internet for a few days before going to see the film. Social media movie related sites and anything I thought would even vaguely have a chance of spoiling the movie. Star wars is indeed very much worth it.However this wasnt people accidentally spoiling it by getting over excited  it was a deliberate attack on multiple completely unrelated forums check out the other forums AgentPao is a moderator off  League of Legends for example  I think it should be safe to go to such subreddits without fear of spoilers and as previously stated using honey trap names to get people to click on things they think are warnings is abhorrent. Deliberately setting up sub forums for the sole intent of spoiling the movie a few months down the line is completely off the map. Perhaps I under estimated the lengths such individuals would go to to spoil something for other people but then again I dont think theres ever been anything quite as big as episode  in terms of anticipation. I know I wont be making the same mistake next time although as I said it didnt really spoil it for me.Whats more important though is that this isnt just about me  those posts spoiled it for a lot of people for no reason other than personal gratification and  or a fucked up ideology. I think what youre really saying in practical terms is that people should just avoid Reddit completely because theres no other choice? Personally I dont see any other way  you cant defend against such attacks people PMing people with spoilers for example. I dont know how the mods would feel about people essentially boycotting reddit when a new Star Wars film comes out  Im sure investors advertisers and other people who rely on clicks would take a dim view of that ? Im a bit hazy on how reddit is financed TBH. Anyway the mods worked really hard to prevent spoilers and did remove the posts after they were reported but it was too late for a lot of people.Ill say it again  AgentPao should be permabanned or at least have moderating rights rescinded to show they wont tolerate this behaviour and to that effect if anyone has a contact address let me know. Cheers and thanks for your comments! ,StarWars,cy5i2rk,6,t5_2qi4s

5995831,0,t1_cy5kqlg,True enough but Mark is  years older than his twin Carrie. From the first film youd guess she was significantly older as Luke was very childish. Its a pretty common Hollywood tactic to have men play much younger characters. I think its because men who are actually young dont usually have the range necessary for a dynamic character whereas women are naturally more inclined to projecting maturity beyond their years. Of course my personal theory is that ben and rey are twins and luke is their father so Im a bit biased. DEdit forgot to mention that ben is given a lot of childish characteristics. Frequent tantrums frustrated crying indecisiveness a desperate need for approval from his elders etc. Im the same age as Adam driver and I put all that behind me in my early s. Its a bit cringe worthy to think of myself acting this way now when Im expecting my first child in a few months whom we are naming after the baddest bitch in the cosmos Leia!!! but I can vividly remember every one of those personal immaturities from my early twenties. ,StarWars,cy5l1kr,2,t5_2qi4s

5999045,0,t1_cy5ydt2,Im going to try and break down what a lot of people have been saying about chewie.Hes a Warrior with an intense sense of honor. In such that he wont betray his friends and will give his life for them. He normally isnt emotional and usually a rational thinker. He emotions can take him over though like any other sentient being.I think after he shot Kylo massacred those Stormtroopers and prematurely blew the charges possibly not right away could have went on killing Stormtroopers we dont know  his rational side kicked in and he thought Oh shit wheres Rey? And Finn? I gotta find them. And so he rushed to the Falcon and finds Rey with Finn. He lands picks up Finn and then they GTFO of dodge.,StarWars,cy607fm,13,t5_2qi4s

I assumed at that point the post is considered fair game for spoilers Ive not seen any other posts that then cover the whole text of the post in a black spoiler tag block... Im sorry if you read the text which has spoilers but the title alone shouldnt really be that much of a spoiler as Reys lineage has been discussed since before the movie came out and Im not saying anything definitive in the title as I truly have no idea as to the answer.  Im not sure why you would have read the text of a post that is tagged spoiler though?  That was kind of the point of tagging as spoiler in the first place.,StarWars,cy6343j,2,t5_2qi4s

Because while the prequels got mixed reviews by everyone they tried different things and some worked and others didnt.Considering many of the scenes in TFA was a major retread of ANH and ESB so many of the plot points are outright callable from a mile away.Which JJ did kinda screw the next director over because they simply have to do so much different while JJ got away with homages and throw backs so fans ate it up.,StarWars,cy6h2bt,9,t5_2qi4s

Im furious at Abrams for not giving the flamethrower trooper in the Jakku village attack a proper backstory and a character arc. sI thought the scene was good. Im a sucker for Stormtrooper variants but from a storytelling perspective it raised the stakes for the Kylo fight and helped build Finn as a truly heroic character.

Why is Rey such a force natural? She is Wedge Antilles secret daughter.. Kylo Ren rejects humanity and human judgement and becomes an animalized ascetic. He refuses to do anything human he stops wearing clothes sleeps outdoors forces himself to walk on all fours never uses spoken language and only eats things he can catch with his teeth.A drastic spiritual conversion living only by the law of the wild.. Finns jacked up spine makes him use cybernetics. He becomes more machine than man but good  a reverse Darth Vader.. Leia fully awakens her Force powers and turns Snoke into a Benjamin Button. He reverse ages and Leia absorbs fetal Snoke into her uterus becoming an antimother for the Light Side she takes birth rather than give birth.. Poe becomes a bountyhunter and rounds up First Order officers like Aldo Ray trapping Nazis in Inglorious Basterds.. BB and R form a symbiotic connection and become a singular machine organism. They grow to unlimited size by adding machine parts to their bulk until R is the crust of a planet like Starkiller base. CP lives inside them.. Chewbacca runs a a spaceship graveyard in orbit around Kashykk. The cloud of spaceships hides a fleet of fully functioning fighter ships that Chewbacca keeps for a space militia.

I vaguely remember them mentioning Hosnian but its so fast and minor that it didnt stick with me enough to make an impact.Can you get through the movie while not knowing that info? Sure but the lack of it or overly quick glossing over hurts immersion because I sat there thinking Hold on a sec... rather than being engrossed in the next scene.gt Plus not explaining everything is a good way to set up an organic mysterious universe.But they did exactly that with the bookscomics. They explained everything so there is no mystery but just didnt tell you that in the movie. And anyway that mystery hasnt existed since A New Hope came out and I dont expect it to exist again.

Kylo Ren is the religiously devoted and committed to what he knows intellectually is right but is being tempted to fall by his emotions.

My thought was that scene where kylo and his knights are killing Jedi and Rey is on the ground isnt a flash forward but a memory and she is shown as adult Rey but in reality its just a representation of her as a child. Kylo still was struggling with the pull to the light side in this movie so its not too crazy to imagine he couldnt bring himself to kill a young girl and instead chose to leave her on a remote planet.,StarWars,cy8z8zo,2,t5_2qi4s

The Empire has done wonders for the stars and planets that it is in charge of.We only view them as the bad guys because we have a forced perspective of the protagonist being who we bonded with. The Empire is not killing anyone randomly they are letting species live and let live. They let the outer planets govern themselves as long as they dont mess with the status quo inside of the Empire. The rebels are the bad guys. We as a populace dont think so because we are viewing it from the eyes of Luke Skywalker.The rebels are unable to get a sizable number of fighters with them.

Then Poe has to bomb the shit out of it with his crew to weaken it further and then have someone perform a challenging trench run and fly inside the machine and destroy like seven more parts of the ship before flying out and having it blow up.It wasnt like some of the previous movies where it only takes one shot to blow it up.

The novelization clearly states that after killing Han Kylo thought he would be made stronger fuller yet in that moment he somehow felt weaker.  Its difficult to portray onscreen those emotions but he was most definitely absorbed in thought doubt and fear after Hans death and was the only reason Chewie was able to get the shot through to him.,StarWars,cya1pb8,11,t5_2qi4s

Sifo Dyas  an army QuiGon the prepare for the sith which no one believed and Dooku leaving the Jedi.Palpatine may have been grooming Dooku to replace Maul as he was already pulled away from the Jedi becoming one of the Lost  before Maul died but there is nothing that I remember that places him as an apprentice before or at the same time as Maul and there was a  year gap so for all we know it happen right after Maul is killed. Maul does come back and while Dooku is around but Palpatine had believed Maul was dead and Maul even ties to kill Palpatine with his brother Opress. If anything is was Plagueis and Palpatine that broke rule since Plagueis plotted to kill his master Darth Tenebrous before he was ready and planned to live forever with Palpatine who did the same to Plagueis and also planned to live forever. Palpatine even when so far as to train Darth Maul and got around the rule by saying he was merely a sith assassin while Plagueis was still alive.While everything above is still considered cannon the below may not  beside Bane existing and Rule of two which Bane stated to Yoda that there can only be two sithThe old republic era is before the rule of two is created. Darth Bane created it after the New Sith Wars when the former old republic now called the Galactic Republic and Jedi wiped out all the sith but him.

If Jupiter blew up in our own system we wouldnt see it for thirty minutes. If Pluto blew up we wouldnt see it for nearly  hours.It was needless especially in a world where forcesensitives can feel things across the galaxy. Did Han need to look up and see a dot get bright? Couldnt Maz have just had an ObiWan on the Falcon moment when Alderaan blew up?It was lazy. As much as I love the film I think if they had like one more rewrite and a slightly more lax schedule it couldve been a strong film.As it is its a good star wars story but they played it safe and introduced some silly plot holes that are only explained by a rushed production schedule.,StarWars,cyaj9rz,1,t5_2qi4s

6035150,0,t1_cyaijn4,Oh definitely.He failed training new Jedi and to him this is a massive failure. With no one to turn to he goes to find the Jedi Temple.In his state of mind he might not be able to to communicate with Force Ghosts or more realistically we arent using force ghosts because they sort of make any challenge in the world a bit anticlimactic when you can just ask Yoda for advice.If Rey is going to Luke and he hasnt found the Jedi Temple yet he wont be exactly happy to abandon that course of action and go challenge the First Order. With the news of Han dying and with Chewie there as well hell reluctantly return and talk to his sister saying he needs to focus on finding the Jedi Temple as its the best hope. Possibly some disagreement with the resistance and how they need his help fighting the first order. Him and Rey will go in search of said Jedi Temple Either a clue or the temple itself depends on the pacing and encounter some sort of conflict there. Theyll get split up and Luke will get paired with Finn or Poe Dameron Maybe both. Not sure who Rey would pair with probably Chewie and one more. This way Rey gets to learn and talk to Luke and things can happen there and then Luke gets to talk with our other characters. Meeting up in the last act of the movie with Rey where she applies the knowledge shes learned. Finn and Poe Dameron can also learn and talk with Luke this way as well. ,StarWars,cyaq1dy,4,t5_2qi4s
6035371,0,t1_cyaor8m,gt used a mind trick a force pull and blocked a probe.She did invade the mind of Kylo Ren and saw how powerful he thought Vader was... so is it a big jump to think Rey stole the use of those powers from Kylo Ren. Or maybe since she learned that the Jedi were legends maybe she also heard of their abilities as well.Oh btw... Luke can use force pull in ESB without any guidance.

6035419,0,t1_cyaqx2h,Now that you say that Im pretty sure I heard that about Vader on some bonus disc materials from the OT.You could be right in this instance and you are right in general but in something as simple as this it could have just as easily been intended too.It wasnt until Obi Wan met Luke because of R that he learned of his powers and that he didnt have to be a farmer anymore lol. Then Vader kills ObiWan perhaps with the idea that Luke will go back home discouraged if he even knew it was Luke or felt some force sensitivity.Another theme in all the movies is how these people with past relationships dont always want to outright kill each other when it gets down to it they prefer to try to turn the other to their side. Vader could have been waiting until he inevitably met his child or children if he knew there was twins... so that he could turn them or in fact feared the inevitability of the situation and intentionally put it off.Not trying to argue just food for thought there may be a canon explanation out there...Your anecdote is interesting though and I will have to watchread some more on the early development. I remember Luke was originally called Luke Starkiller I think and then the Force once permeated from a crystal  which turned into the crystals in the lightsabers....Fun stuff.edit grammar clarification.,StarWars,cyaras1,3,t5_2qi4s

I understand your point though. What I loved the most about the prequels was the world building and all the incredible planets we were able to see existed in this galaxy. The problem with sticking to real life locations and sets is that you really cant show a planet like Coruscant or Kamino without the help of CGI. Like you said hopefully well see them take more chances in VII and IX and blend some models and CGI locations into these beautiful sets. Theres only so many desert snow and forest planets we can handle before the series starts to become stale. ,StarWars,cyc4lfr,2,t5_2qi4s

6049154,0,t3_3y8vjb,I wouldnt be opposed and in fact Id like to see what they could have been had they hit their full potential. That said I wouldnt really want the changes to be too drastic in regards to the overall story. The underlying plot at the heart of the Prequels is actually pretty interesting and IMO any remake should really focus on elucidating that underlying plot improving the dialogue and of course improving the directing. Some more drastic changes that Id be OK with would be the inclusion of Dooku and maybe changing that name into Ep I in some form and to perhaps bring Maul back as Grevious in a sort of parallel to Vader whereby Palps is testing lifesaving equipment on his pawns. Also Anakin really ought to be an older teenager in Ep I so the romance subplot can begin there instead of being jammed into Ep II. ,StarWars,cycjqlb,2,t5_2qi4s

6049261,0,t1_cyck12v,Thats such an exaggeration it hurts. Does it have the same structure? Of course its an homage. But it has so many new elements to distance itself and establish itself as a new thing. Besides it being similar to a new hope is sort of the point its about the First Order not learning from the mistakes of its predecessor. Kylo Ren is a Vader fanboy and its destroying him. They recreated the deathstar bigger and badder and it ended the same way. Besides can you imagine the position JJ was in? Nearly  years of fandom. He couldnt have done anything right if he tried. If he relied to heavily on the OT people would criticize him for being unoriginal. If he tried too hard to be new and different then people would criticize it for not being enough like star wars. He didnt necessarily strike the perfect balance but he did a good job in my opinion.,StarWars,cyck8n2,9,t5_2qi4s

So while becoming one with the force and retaining consciousness does cheat death I think at that stage you are even more at the mercy of the will of the force. And so sacrificing one self like Kenobi did still requires a great deal of faith in the force trusting against all biological instinct that giving up your life is what the force wills.,StarWars,cycn6r6,9,t5_2qi4s

Before the Awakening spoilerss Rey has spent a lot of time using a flight simulator that she salvaged for herself which allowed her to fly hundreds of models of ships. She flew this so often that she got to the point where she would purposely mess up a bunch of things to see if she could save herself from dying. She also flys one other real ship that she salvages and repairs hoping to get something like  portions for it in trade. The people who help her repair didnt want to stay on Jakku though and as soon as Rey landed and went to deal with Unkar they took off and left with the ship. The book also brings up how she has to fight off competition for salvage constantly which is why she is so skilled with the staff blisters are a rarity for the salvagers on Jakku.  She speaks multiple languages because she enjoys meeting all of the people who come to Niima outpost to buy the salvage.As for her knowledge of the Falcon the movie clearly shows that she helped Unkar do some repair work on the ship when she talks with Han about the compressor on the hyperdrive and how she told Unkar it was a bad idea. ,StarWars,cyct0ca,1,t5_2qi4s

Artificial gravity and stuff would take over. Droids would be deployed and start bringing him in. Alarms would go off since the place was about to blow up telling all systems to prepare evacuation particularly the sick and wounded...if theyre still valuable to the Empire.

Gonna have a hard time seeing the lightside as the underdog unless something crazy happens andor she goes to the darkside. Kylo getting his ass beat.  I know he was injured and blah blah blah but I feel like there will be a lack of suspense in the next movie unless he comes back super baddass. But even then Rey could just learn from him again and do the whole anything you can do I can do better. The main story feels like a reinterpretation of A New Hope. Hopefully Rian brings more originality to episode . The lack of Epic. When the Resistance attacks Starkiller all we see are TieFighters and XWings.

There are always going to be elements from these movies that get rehashed you have too  its Nostalgic  but it offered a lot of new elements as well. One that comes to mind is a plot point where a storm trooper defects and betrays the First Order and helps a resistance pilot escape. I was drawn to Finns Character and am eager to learn more. Same goes for many others Kylo Ren Poe BB and Rey are going to drive this new trilogy forward. Does this movie have similarities to the old ones ? Sure they do. The original Star Wars was a mixture of older elements from Films that Lucas enjoyed too. I can picture people who Grew up on Flash Gordon pictures in the s being like Star Wars is just a remake of Flash Gordon bull shit. Its not as good ,StarWars,cydf7dy,2,t5_2qi4s

6059140,0,t3_3yj07c,I think she is a solo and Han didnt realize it at first. I think Kylo Ren is the one that stashed her on Jakku and possibly mind wiped her hence why he immediately freaks out when he hears a girl from Jakku helped Finn. Perhaps Leia and Han gave both their children to Luke and just havent seen their girl in so long and think she was killed with Lukes other students. There was far too much foreshadowing about Rey and Han becoming father and daughter so quickly how broken up she was over his death and that motherly hug she got from Leia at the end. To me it seems like Han figured it out part way through and knows by the time Maz asks about her. I think him offering her a job is exactly what Han would do to reconnect with his estranged daughter. He is always bad at dealing with feelings and such and doesnt like outright connecting with people.

Star Wars is going to have its clunky moments. The dialogue might be off at some points the action will be a little over the top and the jokes will be just above dad jokes. Part of the magic of Star Wars is its cheesiness.The story of the OT is just your basic heros journey. Its been told in cultures all over the world so its going to be familiar.

What we see is a halfhearted struggle between the two over the saber just after Han says he would do anything to help Ben. What if Han realised he had to die and turned the saber on himself thus preventing Ben from doing it and thus preventing Ben from absolutely being damned to the Dark Side? The choice in camera angles was interesting and Im not ruling out the chance that Han turned the saber on voluntarily. All we see is Han dies Ben says thank you seemingly truthfully and Han touches his son one last time. Ben doesnt make an easy remark about Han being a fool. He seems very affected. What if this was all to ensure that there still would be some light left in him and so Han could sort of fulfill his promise to bring our son home? ,StarWars,cyekg15,44,t5_2qi4s

It could just be the force is choosing her as a successor or something. She doesnt have to be related to him.. Watch Empire again. Or even A New Hope. Both movies had very short training times in universe. Luke was only with Yoda for the time it took SoloLeia to get to Bespin and get captured.

If theres a Community Goal a lot of players will flock to the areas the goal is at. If theres a conflict zone in the area youll get more players. High and Hazardous Resource Extraction Zones? There will be players. It also depends on the time of day too. You cant just expect there to be players everywhere in a game with literally billions of locations to visit. You have to know where the traffic will be. Also the AI isnt incredibly smart but now that they made it so they can have their own wings its a lot more challenging and they tend to use slightly better maneuvers.Maybe you shouldve actually learned to play the game the way its meant to be played and give the game another shot since its had half a years worth of updates since you last played it before you go spouting your outdated views.,StarWars,cyhdy7v,1,t5_2qi4s

And in one case a meteorological feature.Star Wars is lightsaber fights.Star Wars is massive space stations having that one weakness.

Perhaps there was more to it in the deleted scenes but as it stands  the halfsection of the universe where Luke is hiding given to the old guy in the desert the missing section that anyone with a map couldve been like oh watery planet with islands is in this missing section given to a comatose Artoo who will awaken without any real catalyst  is not compelling.The whole map ordeal reeked of Lost a planet Master ObiWan has. How embarrassing and Kamino being erased from the archives. Essentially The map is two parts not a brain teaser by any means.

6095725,0,t1_cyids24,gt She has seen the New Jedi being slaughtered. One may say it is only a vision but then why do we believe the scene of her being left on Jakku are actual memories? Who is to say that being abandoned is an actual memory and the other things are visions? What if she actually saw the slaughter because she was there as an apprentice to the Dark Side a masked anonymous Knight of Ren.gt We can argue age but its unclear how old they all are exactly and when things happened as far as I know.This doesnt make much sense to me. You say that the age argument isnt good but in your timeline you have. Rey is a Knight of Ren as a ? year old. So she would have to be younger than ish? When she turns on her caretakers? seems pretty unlikely.. Rey is left on Jakku as a  year old maybe younger.. The Force Awakens Rey as a  year old.Also as far as I can remember Rey appears in the Ren vs New Jedi scene as a fully aged present day Rey whereas in the Rey left behind scene she is .

Something would happen and youd be blown away by how amazing it was. Like the opening scenes in Episode  with the space battle and the demise of the invisible hand. Its just amazing.The OT did world building really well. I like to use the opening of Episode  as an example because you see the tiny rebel ship engulfed by this enormous star destroyer. It tells you everything you need to know about the universe in one fell swoop. The good guys are struggling to fight off the enormous power of the bad guys.The prequels just had some awkward dialogue which i think gets blown out of proportion honestly but other than that i think they do better. The lore they introduce expanded the scope of the star wars universe exponentially. The clone wars alone as an idea has spawned entire TV shows and movies dedicated to clones.

It definitely hasnt aged well  e.g. Ewan McGregor on a lizard in RoTS . Compare it to Fellowship of the Ring  which imho looks awesome even today but used modelsbigatures as well as CGI effects.

6116642,0,t1_cyklnns,Im really not a fan of the prequels but I feel like people hating on the lightsaber fights are just doing it for the sake of taking away one of the only good parts of them. Theyre fantastic. I still prefer the original trilogy fights but that doesnt make the prequel ones bad theyre extremely different and pretty hard to compare to be honest but nonetheless are really impressive. As far as ObiWan amp QuiGonn Vs. Darth Maul and Anakin Vs. ObiWan go at least and the RotS Dooku duel to a lesser extent. Sure theyre choreographed and much more dancey than the originals but that makes sense these are jedi at the prime of their powers and training theyre basically space ninjas. Lucas was always inspired by Kurisawa and other Japanese ninjabased films and the prequels reflect this much more than the originals did since the fighters in the originals are all either old and tired or young and untrained. I do prefer the more brutal duels of V VI and VII but theres no denying that I amp IIIs final duels are perfectly choreographed and a huge spectacle for the eyes and the ears thanks to Mr. Williams.,StarWars,cykwd99,27,t5_2qi4s

The humor was definitely part of it maybe most of it honestly.  A lot of it just struck me as rather contrived.  Hed ignore obvious plot points or be less then genuine in favor of making a funny point or just making the movie look bad.  This makes for an amusing review but not a good one.I think a bigger thing might be that I never liked how although I havent seen this as much lately so many redditors just got lazy discussing the movies and instead would just link to his videos and say Here watch this instead of making an actual cogent argument for themselves.  Which is not a reflection upon him or his reviews but has definitely affected my perception of them.Saying he has a film degree is really just an appeal to authority it gives credibility to his criticism but it does not make his reviews good.  Plenty of people see the flaws in the movies.  Im sure even Lucas sees the flaws in the movie now.  Its easy to criticize after the fact.,StarWars,cyl52xm,2,t5_2qi4s

Not allbecause obviously theres places the movie hasnt been released yet..which presents its own problems but most. For this reason Im glad spoiler tags for this are a thing until...home release? Isnt that what mods here said? At any rate it doesnt excuse being an asshat. The fact remains that there are people that for whatever reason havent seen it and we should be respectful and not intentionally spoil it for them.This leads me to believe that the people that are still doing it are the even more desperate cries for attention and people that think theyre being funny when in reality theyre just sad.Seriously were running up on a month of this movie being out and people are spouting off spoilers like theyre edgy? I cant be convinced that theyre not adolescents trying to be cool like how some of usme included used to get super drunk at parties to try and fit in but were just irritating little asshats to everyone else.Edited in additional comments.,StarWars,cymjlgg,4,t5_2qi4s

6138758,0,t3_3zl8ge,You know a lot of people will tell you that the idea of a walking skeleton as you see it in a horror movie or video game is impossible but they are wrong. They argue since the skeleton has no ligaments it shouldnt be able to move but they obviously dont understand ethereal entities. You see an ethereal entity can manipulate matter within our plain of existence we know that. They can knock a flower pot over ruffle curtains make people feel cold. The one thing they have trouble with though is taking a shape. that is why when they appear without possessing something they are usually blobby masses of light. So you see the skeleton isnt used for locomotion an ethereal entity uses the skeleton to take a shape. So its not the ethereal entity being moved by the skeleton its the entity moving the skeleton. And do you know why this works? Because it is fiction that is why. Look I know its fun to do math and its fun to analyze stuff like this but at the end of the day it is fiction. You have to suspend disbelief. Besides this is easily explained by redundant inertial compensators. Its fiction there is always an answer. Also assuming the density is equivalent to earth is a bold assumption. I mean the damned thing can fit half the mass of a sunlike star in its bowels. ,StarWars,cyneuup,1,t5_2qi4s

Or Obi Wans family sought out Luke for training.Either way either Reys mother or father could have been an apprentice under Luke. But when Ben turned to the dark side they were forced to abandon Rey to protect her knowing that Ben would come after them.In TFA during Reys flashbackforward after touching Lukes saber we hear Obi Wans voice at the end saying These are your first steps..  or something like that.I dunno I just think it would be an interesting twist and not so obvious as her being a Skywalker.Anyone else have similar thoughts?,StarWars,cynn0p8,3,t5_2qi4s

6147120,0,t1_cyo9nel,Im not a big fan of the EU except SOTE rocks so I really cant comment on that but agree that they could have established the trinity in a different light. All of the characters seemed to have failed each other but I tend to think having them fail was the only way to advance the story. IMO its interesting that things didnt work out for anyone  years after Jedi I just wish that FTA could have shared a little more exposition as to why and how... but its like I said Disney could have gone in so many different directions and chose this one for some reason. Maybe because they wanted to cash in on nostalgia? Maybe because this is part one of a terrific  part story. Due to the nature of how many questions TFA raises than answers we wont know how effective this new story will be is until its completed... but to be frank I dont even know if these new films will be a trilogy or if they will rely on anthology films more than the OT which would blow like Marvel Studios has done. To me no matter what the sequels try to do the OT will always be special because it was a culmination of a concoction of so many things happening all at once. Lucas was determined to tell his story without studio interference. The studio was constantly pressuring him which forced his hand to do things he didnt really want to do. Lucas couldnt focus on the remainder of the trilogy due to the business that became Star Wars so he handed it the sequels off to other directors. etc. etc. I can go on and on but the reality is that Star Wars was dare I say destined to become what it is today. A highly commercialized blockbuster less than an epic scifi drama. It might not ever be what it was in the s even if Lucas told the story himself prequels proved this. It saddens me in a way but I can also understand why. At least worst case scenario Disney can instill some direction into this thing and make the films fun enough to enjoy. Im hoping that the next film can add depth to TFA like TESB did for ANH. Maybe it wont but maybe it will crossing my fingers. ,StarWars,cyod2zc,1,t5_2qi4s

6149217,0,t1_cyokly1,No it didnt. I believe TCW implies the Mandalorians were originally a warrior group that were fearsome and powerful. At some point they then diverted from what we normally think of into a peaceful pacifist society. The Mandalorian Death Watch opposes the pacifist government these pacifist Mandalorians are referred to as New Mandalorians implying that the old Mandalorians were the classic Mandalorians everyone imagines  the Death Watch wants to basically resurrect the old bloodthirsty war culture.According to Wookieepedia the above is correct. And since the New Mandalorians were led by Satine rather than before that means the pacifist culture is relatively new. The following is not canon but makes logical sense the actual pacifist New Mandalorians existed only for a short period of time under Satine. Prior to that Mandalorians likely had already started to settle down and wage war far less frequently. This made it possible to convince a large portion of the people to just settle down completely and atone for their warmongering ways of the past by becoming pacifistic in nature. Of course this somewhat radical change was not loved by everyone who have swung back and doubled down on traditional values far more fiercely than they ever had before in recent memory. This erupted into the Mandalorian Civil War.This pacifist utopian society only lasted for awhile and perhaps would have continued to exist if not for the manipulations of Darth Maul and his influence on the Death Watch.,StarWars,cyolo08,0,t5_2qi4s

6150642,0,t3_3zr5p5,Rey  Shes very clearly the hero archetype but shes also broken in some ways from the abandonment of her parents.  Shes used to being on her own and often seem to prefer it that way.  Shes a lot like Luke in that she yearns to be a part of something greater.Finn  Hes a fish out of water with a heart of gold.  Despite him being a supporting actor the audience is told a lot of information through him.  I never really saw him as naive as much as just ordinary.  Hes not a force user and doesnt have any amazing skills.  He just tries really hard.Poe  Hes a funny and relaxed pilot that loves his job.  He enjoys fighting the good fight.Kylo  An unstable wreck being pulled in different directions by the temptation of the dark side and the light side.  He can talk the talk by he cant walk the walk so he relies on a fake persona to appear threatening.BB  Hes like a golden retriever.  Hes innocent and extremely loyal to the people  he loves.Maz  Quirky but incredibly wise and smart.  Shes one of those smart people who are able to maintain a very human personality and connect with people.Snoke  Honestly hes the most twodimensional out of all the characters.  Hes clearly into being evil but there isnt a lot going on with him.  And Im actually okay with that.  Kylo causes the main friction between the characters there isnt a whole lot of room for another villain.Phasma  We really didnt get to see much of her but I think shes a lot like Kylo where she enjoys bullying people but can be quickly disarmed and pushed around.Hux  There isnt a lot to him either I think hes more of an extra with a name at this point like Tarkin.  Hes there like Phasma to serve a role to the plot.  You could have easily put in a random First Order extra in his spot and nothing would change.

It shouldnt come down to this point but they wasted so much time and energy marketing Phasma as a badass new villain and gave her almost nothing worthy of that time.

6165677,0,t1_cyqchgh,gt but she was labeled by many in the New Republic as a warmonger.I have a feeling that some of these people are being controlled or manipulated by Snoke. They used whatever clout they had in the senate to keep the Republic out of the war to allow the First Order to grow. They didnt have enough clout to prevent Leia from organizing the resistance. But now with the senators on Hosnian system killed they might move to take control of the republic and turn it into something like an empire again If they are working for Snoke they might have been warned to leave the Hosnian system before blowing it up. And they can use the destruction as an excuse to invoke emergency powers like Palpatine did. The resistance will then become isolated.Just my theory on how things might pan out in the next episode. ,StarWars,cyqh2i5,1,t5_2qi4s

He used the force to enhance his already good piloting skill. The above user said that ANH established that the force can grant users new skills.

6200837,0,t1_cyu9ixa,Ive gone over this in other threads. Basically the Imperials severely underestimated the primitive natives and didnt do their research. The Ewoks have a history of fighting  tall ewokeating monsters native to Endor called gorax. Thats why their villages are all in trees. Thats why they have traps and siege engines all over the forest. Thats why they are raised to be warriorhunters instead of farmers or nomads. The other factor is that there was one legion of troops on Endor while the ewoks managed to get every ewok tribe on the moon to join their cause. This is because the Empire razed an entire ewok village to build the shield generator and the ewoks were rightfully pissed off. They had been planning to attack but werent quite ready until the Rebels came along and gave them a tactical advantage and lots of intelligence regarding their enemys capabilities. Finally all one needs to do is look at Custers defeat at the hands of savages or the Zulu nation completely spanking the more advanced British Empire in open warfare. If you underestimate an enemy because theyre primitive you can be surprised when they show a ferocity and skill in battle that your own civilized troops cannot match.TLDR  When  cannibal ewoks rain down upon you swarm over you rip off your fancy helmet and bash your brains with rocks you appreciate the value of never underestimating an opponent. ,StarWars,cyugvxw,1,t5_2qi4s

This also provides a way into the redemption story for Kylo.

And the first order was deemed to not be a major threat since the republic had signed a peace treaty with the empire after the battle of Jakku calling for a ceasefire between the two effectively making it a Cold War. The first order was a splintered group of the empire that slowly grew in size from the shadows. And the republic secretly funded the resistance to keep them at bay anyways. The resistance and republic were on top of everything until the first order crippled them by taking out the republic and Jedi arent warriors so Luke didnt need to be on the front lines. So for the most part I saw it as both Luke didnt know about things going on as well as him not being immediately needed. ,StarWars,cywbrux,2,t5_2qi4s

I absolutely love the new series and think that TFA is up there with ANH and ROTJ for me not quite ESB but I think the new ones will be equal to or even surpass it. My concern is the obnoxious tumblr fandoms and stans who make absolutely EVERY fandom they touch cancerous. Like ummm in my headcanon Poe and Finn are all sweaty with their shirts off and Kylo comes and things get heated between the three. Im all for fanfiction but they just make annoying crap like that and they always feel the need to ship characters and live vicariously through the fan fiction they write about officially licensed characters having orgies with eachother because these fandom weirdos cant get any in real life and have to resort to polluting fanfiction sites with crappy stories about romance between two characters they didnt even create or they have to incorporate it with their other fandoms and be like LOOK ITS A STAR WARS STEVEN UNIVERSE CROSSOVER FANFIC. I didnt word this as elegantly or put as much thought into this as I could have so if my point is lost on some of you I understand. Anyways just throwing my bit out there.EDITJust look at the Supernatural fandom. The content these tumblr folk create are hardly if ever related at all to the source material. Its all crap that could happen in any other setting with any other characters theyre just obsessive weirdos and wish to incorporate their favorite characters into some stupid thing they thought up like Finn and Poe go to Subway and have a good lunch then they hold hands at Knotts Berry Farm.,StarWars,cyyw0um,-1,t5_2qi4s

6245428,0,t1_cyzhz69,I thought I put in an explanationof my reasoning in here.  I havent used reddit too much and I probably didnt post it right which is my fault  But here is my reasoning.  If you noticed in the movies people in the Star Wars universe do not utilize the same alphabet we use.  The citizens of the Galactic Republic use  weird symbols and squiggly lines to form words and sentences which is a completely different alphabet than our own.  Look it up.  Their alphabet is called Aurebesh.  I do not even think they have a letter that looks like X.  So since the letter X does not exist how would they know what the letter X looks like? This same logic applies to YWings AWings ect.  Thus resulting in the question how does the Rebel Alliance know what these letters look like if in their own universe they do not exist?,StarWars,cyzjcs8,1,t5_2qi4s

6254599,0,t3_419862,Obviously I think well discover Reys parentage and Finns backstory will hopefully get a little more fleshed out. I think were going to see Kylo Ren come back and he could have mechanical augmentations to his body in the same manner that Vader had considering his injuries at SKB. I think most of the movie could have Kylo out of sight maybe training with Snoke and getting more attuned with the dark side.Luke will struggle with Reys training at first because I have a feeling shes straddling the line between the darklight sides of the force closer than some think. I think it will take something momentous to finally convince her that the right path is that of the light side. Though she could be a truly balanced force user and find a way to utilize both.Really I cant even speculate too much. Its all so vague right now and I really think our first teaser trailers and actual trailers will give us a better hint at the direction  though it could all just be a tease lol,StarWars,cz0kvx0,1,t5_2qi4s

6261383,0,t1_cz19z6e,Alright I dont know how much of this information you know already but Ill give it a shot at explaining it.In the first film Han Solo says he made the Kessel Run in  parsecs. The way he says it makes it sound like hes referring to a parsec as a unit of time like saying  seconds. The thing is a parsec is actually a measurement of distance.The Kessel Run is a dangerous route that smugglers take to avoid being caught by the Empire and apparently the route is littered with black holes. To make it through safely ships would need to go out of their way to weave between these black holes to avoid getting sucked in kind of like how you might have to backtrack a little in Frogger to avoid the cars.However Han Solo claimed his ship was so fast that he was able to get dangerously close to these black holes without getting sucked in. This probably shaved some time off his travel but more importantly it shaved off a few parsecs of distance off that journey as well.This all goes back to the picture. If youre fast enough you can take the shortest route.,StarWars,cz1cm2j,3,t5_2qi4s

6304198,0,t3_41y3rt,I liked it a lot. PreClone Wars with the way RotS portrayed it it seemed that Clones were just soldiers that seemed to blindly follow orders because thats what they were made for. The Chancellor was the highest ranking position for the Republic so I could see why they listened to Palpatine and turned on the Jedi.But after watching the Clone Wars I couldnt really believe something like that anymore. Throughout the series you could see that the Jedi and Clones bonded throughout the war and the Jedi really cared about their Clones and the Clones liked their Jedi Generals a lot. You could hardly believe they would want to or be able to just turn on their Jedi. There were lots of episodes and Arcs that focused on the Clones independent thinking. So it would also be hard to believe that they would just blindly follow orders when the Umbara Arc challenged that. So all in all I was pretty satisfied with the the whole chips explanation. Only makes Order  all the more tragic now that we know the Clones were affected by it as well.,StarWars,cz67t40,31,t5_2qi4s

6324059,0,t3_427va7,When Lucas always mentions that critics always hated Star Wars even the OT at time of release people think hes lying but hes not. He might be practicing in a bit of hyperbole but its true that Star Wars was never a critical darling until TFA. They have high tomatometer scores now because half the reviews there are retrospective reviews which will obviously be more positive or original reviews that happened to be positive that the publication is comfortable posting. Because the newspapers and magazines that published negative reviews back in the day arent republishing them online now after the fact because they dont want to look silly in hindsight.The author of the Ring Theory did a short study where he gathered as much critics reviews he could grab that were released at the time of the movies from major publications at the time of release and said funnily enough the OT would have a lower average than the PT. EDIT Found the link I was talking about. Thats not me saying that the PT is better thats preposterous. Just more the point that Star Wars never got love from the critics traditionally. The positive view of the OT is largely a populous fan movement more than a critical one. Eventually there were too many of us saying these films were good where critics couldnt avoid agreeing without looking silly.You have to remember a lot of these folks are the type that probably view George Lucas and Spielberg as folks who ruined Hollywood with the advent of blockbusters. There were also plenty that appreciated the films like Siskel and Ebert but it was a much higher mixed split than most people realize.Although the landscape has changed it still happens today to a degree. I cant recall someone like Tarantino ever saying a single word of praise to Lucas as a filmmaker even though he was contemporaries with all the folks he does bring up over and over like DePalma Coppola etc. Probably for much the same reasons that a lot of these film critics would too. I think he honestly doesnt care much for the films. Thats not to say I dont like Tarantino or even these more arty films that these critics prefer. I do too. But apparently some people like said reviewer cant like both it seems.,StarWars,cz8h671,5,t5_2qi4s

Jar Jar is the actual worst. Ive come to accept that most of the terrible acting we see in the prequels is more of a reflection on the director and no longer harbor any annoyance towards the actors. They did the best with what they were given. Yes even Hayden. That doesnt forgive how terrible the movies are though. I I recently decided to watch The Clone Wars and it is everything the prequels werent in my opinion. Everything they could have been.

I was never a huge fan of most of the postROTJ Legends material. I mostly enjoyed the Thrawn trilogy and thought he was a great character but even those books had some stuff that didnt feel like Star Wars to me Luuke Skywalker the Ysalimiri Jorus Cbaoth etc. When the thing that is held up as a shining example of the BEST that the old postROTJ EU had to offer still has some serious problems you know that there is room for improvement. So Im optimistic about the new canon. There are other parts of Legends that were super kickass and theyre still just as fun to read as they always were. I dont think Star Wars in any medium gets much better than the first  issues of JJMs Knights of the Old Republic comics for example. Canon shmanon its still a great read.,StarWars,czco39n,2,t5_2qi4s

You could do a Star Wars show without ever going into space.  Imagine a Star Wars political thriller.   Anyway just because its in space and uses CGI doesnt mean the budget has to be insane.  BSG and The Expanse are great examples of this.  I think Disneys and Kathleen Kennedys biggest problem is that theyre so afraid to move away from known characters right now.  Rogue One was a step in the right direction but I feel like the Han Solo and Boba Fett movies are two steps back.  I like the animated shows but feel like they leave a lot to be desired.  There is no real drama its like watching  minutes of cheesy dialog and overacted action sequences.  The characters arent really that likable for that matter.

Yoda has to physically fight different because his size matters. He has to exert himself so much more than his opponent because of his size. Yes the movie shows him doing it but the original trilogy implied that he shouldnt have to. This is like the difference between neo dodging bullets and stopping them in the matrix. Which one is more powerful?gthe trains younglings about lightsabers as wellAgain thats kinda what Im arguing is bad about the prequel trilogy.

6509049,0,t1_czsjgy0,But it doesnt play out like that in the book. From the moment Leia meets the prince she starts behaving like a lovestruck teenager because hes just so dreamy. Meanwhile any time that Han tries to remind Leia that hes her boyfriend she starts acting cruel and condescending to him. Then when the Prince saves Leias life during an ambush Leia is so overwhelmed with love and gratitude that she agrees to marry the prince on the spot completely forgetting about Han.   The book could have explored how much of your personal happiness you should be willing to sacrifice for the greater good but it didnt.  Leia didnt agree to the proposal for the good of the Republic she agreed in a moment of passion after being saved by a handsome suitor. This is why people dont like her characterization in the book.  She callously kicks Han to the curb for someone richer and betterlooking. ,StarWars,czsl33v,27,t5_2qi4s

6509669,0,t3_44s712,Depends on what he defines as wins and losses. I definitely agree with you. The Light and the Dark balance one another out so that neither can be stronger than the other. By the same idea one cant exist without the other. Kind of a YinYang relationship. The Light Side generally is stronger in maintaining peace balance and defense. The Dark Side is generally stronger in power chaos and offense. What it comes down to is what you personally view as strength. Some argue passion is stronger than peace or harmony stronger than chaos. Like you said the Force isnt inherently good or evil its the choices that are made with it that are the good and bad. Looking at the Force through the historical cannon it seems as though the Dark Side is strong in the short term but the Light Side is strong in the long term. The Jedi have taken considerable hits from the Sith yet theyve prevailed. At the end of the day in the OT its the Light Side thats won. But at the end of RotS its the Dark Side thats won.The SW Universe is really a game of oneupmanships between the Sith and the Jedi. With your cousins specific example of a Dark Side win with Yoda and Sidious the actions that follow led to an ultimate Light Side win with Anakin defeating Sidious later in the game. Almost all the wins and loses with the Light and Dark Side are like this meaning theres no real winner or loser or stronger or weaker side. ,StarWars,czsnecd,3,t5_2qi4s

6529448,0,t1_czuolak,Theres also no hard evidence that the vision Rey saw of Kylo Ren and the Knights of Ren was the destruction of Lukes academy.  People think this because theres a building in the upper righthand corner that looks like a temple and because thats pretty much the only largescale slaughter weve heard of Kylo Ren doing himself.Things to consider     In the script it refers to the man Kylo kills during the vision as a warrior and I believe Ive heard clansman from someone on reddit.  No mention of apprentice padawan Jedi etc.   We dont know that Lukes academy had a temple at all.  People might be mixing it up with Luke later going to seek the first Jedi temple.     People think that Kylo Ren was defending Rey from the man he kills.  But in the other vision sequences shes looking at events she had no part in this may be the same and her perspective just happened to be in front of Kylo Ren killing a random guy. Even if you believe this was the Jedi academy all the bodies surrounding the Knights look to be those of grown adults which would kinda support the theory that the students were older.,StarWars,czup343,2,t5_2qi4s

6541950,0,t3_458gws,I feel this will be explored. But not the end of the trilogy.Luke instantly realizes Rey is his daughter. Once he finally decides to tell her she gets extremely upset at him and leaves. Shes upset because she feels betrayed that he was never looking for her and that she had to grow up on the planet equivalent of hell for her childhood.This is all further fueled by temptation from Snoke. Rey hears lies about Luke he killed her mother and other terrible things. Rey begins to head towards the dark side.The twist is that she isnt the unbreakable good we expected.That character is Finn.Once Rey leaves. Luke is desperate to save her. As her and Leia are really the last people he actually cares about.People complained that Rey being a Skywalker was dumb because the films are beginning to imply that you must be a Skywalker with a High Midochlorian count to become a powerful jedi.Finn volunteers to help Luke. And they begin training. Finn wont turn. Hes seen the First Order. Luke cant go because that is exactly what Snoke wants to lure Luke into a trap.In the climax Finn fights Kylo. Not sure about what Reys role would be in this scene.Finn dies as Kylo strikes him down. Finn lets too much into his fighting and created weak points that a fully trained Kylo could easily exploit.Rey instantly realized her mistake. Begins to think shell be trapped in the same way she was on Jakku.Luke shows up and we get the fanservice. He demolishes Kylo in a quick lightsaber battle by using the force to knock him out and away. Potentially fights Snoke. Youre not taking this one or something. This entire scene is just Luke being the badass Jedi Knight we all wanted.I dont think Luke will die.Thats my general outline of Ep.  predictions.,StarWars,czvzo6t,17,t5_2qi4s
6541995,0,t3_458gws,I believe any turn to the dark side for Rey would necessarily involve her killing Kylo Ren.  I know the bad guys arent Sith anymore but I still think thats how the dark side works.  To be the man youve gotta beat the man.  Palpatine got Anakin to kill Dooku and tried to get Luke to kill Vader.If there were a Rey dark side storyline and personally I dont want one but I think it would go like this Rey has some sort of falling out with Luke.  Maybe it would be a why did you abandon me? or why didnt you tell me? sort of thing.  Or something that just happens in episode .  She fights Kylo Ren and kills him and then Snoke shows up as someone who seems like he might be able to offer some answershelp.  This sets up Episode  where Finn aided by the force ghost of Luke Skywalker is the galaxys last hope against The First Order and Darth Rey.  In the final sequence Reys prophecy that they will see each other again comes true only it is as adversaries.  Finn ultimately wins and is somehow able to redeem Rey.,StarWars,czvzu8b,3,t5_2qi4s

RD and CPO though are done BB successfully replaced them and they are only around in TFA for nostalgic reasons I guess they will slowly disappear until they are only background filler like Ackbar in TFA.Luke could die in IX propably by Snokes hand or some sort of catching the bullet for Rey. If they somehow succeed in crossing him out of the equation as person who could fight evil then he might survive since our only hope is Rey having Luke as a fighting jedi on her side requires him to be out of the equation when the final confrontation happens  Yoda died because he was finished training Luke AND because it makes clear that if Luke fails nobody could train the other hope  Leia. I dont think they would have to go so far with Luke but if he can fight then he has to die if not and he is basically just a teacher then he might aswell live with the implication being that the First Order would find him if Rey fails.Of course Rey wont fail and a living Luke could play a role in the potential next trilogy.,StarWars,czxshz8,11,t5_2qi4s

It takes multiple jumps to go around a black hole cluster that makes hyperspace calculations near impossible.  Han jumped through the black hole cluster in a series of short jumps around the more massive black holes.  If I remember my Legends correctly.  So yes he made the run in a shorter distance than anyone else had or has ever done.  Mostly cause hes a cocky crazy SoB.

Either way as you say different strokes and thats cool. I really hope you enjoyed the build up and hype and the movie was as good as you hoped.

In Darth Vader  its made clear that Fett is being hired through Jabba the Hutt as an intermediary. Vaders line when Fett shows up is something along the lines of You two are the best the Hutt has?

6623285,0,t1_d04b7ls,EDIT NOW WITH SOURCES  gtRepublic senators were war mongerers. Not the Jedi. Its not mutually exclusive. SOURCE All senators are war mongers doesnt imply all war mongers are senators. It can be both.gt They didnt even agree to their roles as commanding officers in the GAR.Which is strange because your next sentence is... gt They were obligated because they felt it was their civic duty.... Which means they literally did agree to their roles as military officers by your own admittance. They serve in the military without ever questioning it SOURCE The Clone Wars. The only Jedi so far who has directly discussed not approving of the Jedis role in the Clone Wars was Depa Bilaba SOURCE Kanan Issue . These roles as military officers were a direct contradiction to Mace Windus sentiment that they were keepers of the peace not soldiers SOURCE Mace Windu Attack of the Clones. To take this up  a notch the Jedi had padawans acting as commanders in the GAR. Ashoka Tano and Barriss Offee do it in nearly every episode of The Clone Wars SOURCE The Clone Wars SeEp Weapons Factory The clones they lead had been bred and trained for war nonstop for  years SOURCE Attack of the Clones. If Padawans who are  lets say  years old reasonably are commanding the likes of Rex which Ahsoka did many times SOURCE The Clone Wars were going to have to assume one of two things   Either padawans were given a vigorous education in warfare allowing them to still be better educated on the subject than the clones. If this is the case  it shows how far the Jedi had fallen since they were teaching them padawans more about war than about the Force. Alternatively   The Jedi were so blinded during this time that they wanted themselves as the heads of the army regardless of training anyone which would  again  make them too consumed by war. SOURCE These are assumptions but Educated in Warfare or Not educated in Warfare are the only two options to my knowledge. If you can come up with an alternative please do so.Regardless of which one is right  and it is a dichotomy the fact that Padawans were serving as commanders is evidence for a deep rooted affiliation with Jedi and War.gtThe Jedi discovered the army but it wasnt their intention to use them.This is blatantly false as they did so on Geonosis. SOURCE The last  of Attack of the Clones gt That vote came from the senate after it was discovered by the Jedi that the CIS were forming an army against the republic. The Jedi had already gone to a planet they probably shouldnt have been on and then  when those people who shouldnt have been there were going to be executed  sent  Jedi before the clones ever arrived  to intimidate and fight the Separatists? SOURCE Attack of the Clones gt The Jedi wanted to send their own to rescue their own but it was the senate that voted to use the Clone army as a show of force against the CIS.First of all  the Senate didnt vote for that.  They voted to allow Palpatine emergency action. Kind of like how the Senate gave Bush the ability to run free In Iraq without actually voting to go to War. Source  We also have the quote from Mace Windu in the Attack of the Clones script that says The longer we wait the stronger Dookus armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now. Clearly the Jedi wanted to use the Clone Army and didnt have the approval of the ChancellorSenate. Windu had to fall back on sending two hundred Jedi. Regardless of what the Senate voted for the Jedi were always going to Geonosis.Secondwhat were arguing isnt The Jedi didnt want to use the Clone Army which Ive shown above is the case regardless were arguing about whether or not the Jedi are warmongers and your statement that The Jedi wanted to send their own to rescue their own proves my point for me. gtYou somehow misinterpret what Im saying and call me the inept one? lolAs Ive shown above at the very top  I misinterpreted nothing.

Walking Dead has also done similar stuff though IMO that is the show just emulating the comicbooks. I  oppose uArrrgaming because Hans death wasnt gratuitous and IMO it wasnt for shock value either it had serious build up with the characters served very well in that. In Game of Thrones things like the Red Wedding was kind of out of nowhere the scenes were given more context and impact after the fact but overall didnt have much build up IMO. I think if TFA was gratuitous they would have killed off more characters at once.

6646027,0,t3_46nbmw,OT fans are perhaps becoming more vocal because Star Wars fans have something new to talk aboutfocus on. For years the most recent Star Wars films were considered a disaster. Disappointment is too small of a term. It was and still remains a stain on the series and film making to various degrees but a stain nonetheless. Now we have a new trilogy. The population of Star Wars fans now has something new and good in the rear view ep  and many things to look forward too. Before that it was really bad films and really bad Star Wars stories that we had in our rear view. So that gives room for the fans to breath a bit and let the minority and it is a minority of OT fans to speak their minds.Personally I think the Plinkett reviews are amazing and expose the films and more importantly the story teller as unworthy. ,StarWars,d06r9j6,-1,t5_2qi4s

6706572,0,t3_47gjm6,gt Rey is nobody. This seems to be reddits favorite theory for some reason. But look I get it. You want a powerful force user whos not a Skywalker. Lets walk through why this doesnt make senseWont happenIf you dont know why a theory may be the favorite and you are aiming to disprove it either you havent done enough research on it or you are being dismissive. Neither does you credit.gt Theyve put too much focus on her not knowing who her parents are for her to be nobody. If they just go Oh yeah your parents are Phil and Lilly from Coruscant surprise! That has no impact at all on the audience. Youve built up the mystery of her heritage. Making her parents no one special is simply too boring for people. Its bad filmmaking if they ended her mystery on that note.Really? I see this as a perfect source of dark side temptations for her. She clearly has parental issues and continuously keeps hoping to encounter her family again. Maybe they were shitty people or something really bad happened. Maybe she never gets proper closure theyre dead or perhaps even unapologetic. It is also a pretty shitty mystery imo if one of the most common guesses regarding her heritage is right. If they try to make it s big twist it will a hurt the trilogys ability to stand on its own by pulling even more from the OT b not really be that effective of a twist Vader was so shocking because no one guessed it and it seemed so outlandish that the th had to notable amounts of time to confirm this was true. c raise an enormous number of questions regarding Luke because it just doesnt fit his character. If the screenwriter wasnt lying when they said  was going to be weird then it wont be sticking with as many of the franchises traditions besides parental issues because there seems to be no way around that one. If Luke being Reys father is handled like Kylo Rens parents casually in the middle of other events than why didnt they have Luke saydo something to make it certain at the end of the ? You get all the speculation albeit focused on how this could be possible rather than whether it is the case and dont have to burn screen time for what has to be a big reveal given Reys parental issues have been made a focus but would feel rather repetitive or just a waste of potential.gt The evidence Ive already stated above.As others have pointed out some of those points are reading an expression far farther with the intent to fit this desired narrative. uajscherer in particular you already responded to them.gt The films are about the Skywalkers. For some reason people suddenly have trouble coming to terms with that fact. The main films are about the Skywalkers the EU shows the rest.Damn I feel bad for Kylo Ren. Despite being related to Anakin apparently not having the family name formally is enough for everyone to ignore that.gt If you want a character to learn the force well without having a special heritage look at Finn. He potentially could work to become a Jedi in Episode VIII or IX. Theres plenty other characters in the films that are powerful with the force without being a Skywalker. Its not unreasonable to give someone with such strong force powers as Rey her lineage as a Skywalker.Strong force powers like Kylo Ren who successfully does things we havent seen? The most common point I see in arguments for Rey is Lukes daughter posts is that the trilogies are about a Skywalker yet they all seem to brush aside that there is a Skywalker as a main character. Weve had a Skywalker start good and go bad weve had one start good and manage to stay good so maybe this time around they are shaking it up a bit and having the central Skywalker start bad?gt The evidence lines up too perfectly for Rey being Lukes Daughter to not be the case. Im sorry if youre vocally against this theory. But the evidence is in this theorys favor .Uh wow. That is presumptive. Didnt read anything in there that was from an official source that explicitly stated Rey is Lukes daughter so stating evidence favors this  is a rather big jump given evidence can also be viewed differently. Also makes me instantly think you dont have much desire to debate regardless of the fact you have responded in this thread especially given your opening that you are  convinced and your post reads as such.,StarWars,d0d0mtu,31,t5_2qi4s

Luke in Episode IV is aged .  Rey in Episode VII is aged .Theyre all decent mechanicstinkerers.  Anakin built CPO and his pod racer.  He fixed things for Watto.  He fixed things into his adult life as shown in Episode II after he killed the sand people and talked to Padme.Luke fixed RD.  Its implied that he can fix things because he lives on a desolate planet and this is an important skill when resources are scarce.  He was going to Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!Rey is implied to be a great mechanic for the same reasons as Luke.  In fact she survives on her own and gathers old technology so is likely better than Luke.  She fixes the Millenium Falcon in a way that surprises even Han.

As a life long fan I think Star Wars is overdue for a bittersweet ending. A lot of events and their consequences have been alluded to in films but been left except to explore in novels and other media. The SW story films give them a chance to show a situation where winning success in the mission does not mean survival which is just dark and realistic enough to make the events in the series that much more meaningful. ,StarWars,d0duncc,20,t5_2qi4s

6715956,0,t3_47lo5v,I was  for ANH  for ESB  for ROTJ.  For TPM I was .  Why the PT is so hated by many GenXers like me is hard to explain to younger folks.  The OT werent just movies they were cultural events unlike anything that happens now.  They were before widespread cable tv video games personal computers the internet and mobile devices. Today we are amused to death.  Infinite options and outlets.  Everyone microniched and tuned into something different at different times. The only shared cultural events similar these days are negative ones like wars terrorist events etc.  There really arent shared entertainment cultural events anymore.  Not like back then.  Not even close.  My point is that when GenXers say that the PT was a massive disappointment I am not sure Millenials can relate no matter how it is explained.  It is not a character or the effects or the story or actors or any one thing specifically.  It is the massive suspense and expectation of the second coming of SW finally after what seemed like decades.  If you didnt experience the OT the way GenX kids did then you didnt go into the PT with that incredibly high standard and expectation and so the PT would seem like what they are okay movies.  But when held up against the impossible standard of what GenX kids experienced with the OT they are a joke.,StarWars,d0dzkre,4,t5_2qi4s

6720242,0,t3_47n1o1,My reading is that he assumed that Luke had already been bitten by the dark side temptation and just needed another push to go over the edge. The dark side is very tempting. What saved Luke was his own goodness and the realization that in cutting off his fathers hand he had become him. It took a great deal of effort to resist that urge and pull back. This is what is beautiful about this entire sequence imo. A lot of the struggle is internal and needs to be inferred.

Sadly outside of the costumes many of the weaponsprops were clearly Master Replica items and the helmets and many of costumes were certainly not screen used. Was any of it? I dont think the hero props make it out of the archive often if at all. But I dont think that had any impact on the experience. Which was great. everyone there was cracking little jokes and one liners from the films. It made the event so much more enjoyable. I went through it six times  each way. Took over  pics and plan on going back again. Another highlight was the Jango and Boba suits standing next to each other in the same display. Visiting the event inspired me to start replica prop building. Your collection of figures will feel utterly valueless after spending time at the exhibit. If you cant make the show I suggest the book that accompanies the exhibit...it is loaded with pics. Youll treasure it. If you can make it... Be sure to take a moment and kneel beside pregnant Padmes sarcophagus and pay your respects. It makes a great photo op.  Lolol.  will go again!

Poe is a great pilot so are Han and Wedge and numerous others. not to mention Boba Bane Vizla and other badasses with no force ability. why cant we have awesome characters that are good at stuff because of their trainingabilitydesire to be the best? is that not probably a better example than theyre special because theyre born that way and are thus better at everything? i like the force they should be the main part of the story and theyre fucking awesome with laser swords and telekinesis and all. but i seriously think that there need to be some badasses that dont rely on the crutch of a metaphysical mutation to be the heroes.end rant. sorry to go off like that but im kinda sick of people grasping for straws when it comes to explaining why someone is good at something without reverting to because Force. let them be normal people rising to the occasion show what the normal people can be. ,StarWars,d0ia1tt,2,t5_2qi4s

When Dooku figured out he wasnt going to beat Yoda that way he drew his sword.  What did you want Yoda to do let himself get hacked to pieces?You can argue that he could have used the force to fling crush or otherwise kill Dooku but since youre big on pointing out how Yoda talks about the force lets remember who it was that said Jedi should never use the force to attack or kill.Sure he became a bit hypocritical something of a specialty of the Order when he fought Sidious but he probably both thought the threat was great enough to justify it and had little choice since he was like the only person in the galaxy at that moment who had even a chance at stopping Sidious.Lastly why should the force seem that much more powerful?  It was never grandiose in the films.  It was the expanded universe and games that really jumped it up and arguably they took it way too far in some instances.

QuiGon was kind of a rebel and didnt mind respectfully clashing with the Council while ObiWan didnt really come into issue with them. OW in fact was kind of the ideal Jedi of the era I know he had the thing with Satine but once that didnt pan out he accepted his duty and threw himself into it wholeheartedly. OW was innately something Anakin was not. Though OW and Anakin were like brothers I think Anakin would have identified more with QG and maybe confided in him more. QG could have been in a better position to then guide him through his inner demons and find peace on his own terms not the Councils.. QG was a big believer in the Living Force and could have imparted on Anakin a better sense of appreciation for all living things no matter how seemingly insignificant. Anakin as we see him has fierce loyalty to his friends but can be harsh and not always understanding towards others. Hopefully QGs lessons could have stemmed that and enabled him to appreciate that maybe saving his wife wasnt worth killing all of the Jedi.,StarWars,d0mhoi5,7,t5_2qi4s

The attack occurs in  prior to mobilization its a WMD like a nuke and the three branches of government are on a Hawaiian vacation on Oahu.Quite something to wrap your head around. They not only have to organize a rearmament campaign they have to reestablish a effective central government.My guess is that the members of the NR will initially blame the Resistance and Leia for provoking the attack by but that after the FO starts their offensive and curb stomping whoever resists them that opinion will change. Who knows they could end up electing or  asking Leia to take up the Chancellorship since she may be one of the highest profile politicians around and because she foresaw threat.

6971857,0,t3_4b6idx,In order to answer this question you have to answer a few other questions first Was Vader the most powerful force andor swordsman at this point? Was Sidious bested by Mace Windu?Its all a coin toss up to opinion interpretation stat sheets and of course Lucus interviews. But my opinion. Vader was definitely more powerful than ObiWan at that point in RotS. He had strength youth and the ragefueled Dark Side to give him an advantage in his fight with ObiWan. He lost not because his strength or connection to the force but because ObiWan knew his Padawan very well. He had more experience and knew what Anakin was and wasnt capable of. Add in Anakins reckless behavior and impatience and ObiWan BARELY squeaked a victory. Could he have beaten Sidious? Not a chance. Sidious might have toyed with ObiWan but he would have flattened him. . Four Jedi Masters went to arrest Sidious. Three went down in seconds after they arrived. Either Mace Windu was either VERY much their superior swordsman or Sidious was toying with him. Now heres the thing. Sidious had no way of knowing when Anakin would show up or even IF he would show up and find him battling the Jedi. He even said that they arrived earlier than expected. This leads me to believe that Mace Windu actually was the equal of Sidious at least in lightsaber combat. Sidious was playing a dangerous game risking his life until the pretense that he could either survive whatever the Jedi threw at him or the Jedi wouldnt kill him until he could use battle as a pretense for force a decision out of Anakin. As it turned out thats exactly what happened. If either Yoda or ObiWan swapped places both may have been killed. Or Yoda may have killed Anakin. The results for either encounter would have been worse for the following movies and Star Wars history. ,StarWars,d16ligq,1,t5_2qi4s

My ORIGINAL belief was that it took an immense amount of emotion to get to the point of having the door open to that ability.  It is really the only big power they dont seem to have in common after all.  That is the Jedi cant manifest it because they wont feel the emotions they can control them.  Its similar.  What would happen if a Force user manifested immense amounts of LOVE for instance?  Would it manifest as lightning?  Would it manifest as fire or as light?I could be way off base Anakin would be the argument against it.

The scene where he watches the fire in the village at the beginning too is so emotive without him doing anything although that was more to do with JJs direction. Obviously everyone talks about the lighter thumbs up but the scene leading into that gag is my favourite to be honest where he keeps glancing between the two and beeping indecisively.

Thats the thing that makes me think this would be Obiwan heading into the bar and looking for the horniest chick in the place.Obiwan Kenobi having children is the single worst idea I have heard for Star Wars in a long time and that includes the moronic theory that Snoke is a timetraveller where Snoke is Plagueis and where Kylo Ren is actually Revan.For Obiwan to have a child is irresponsible. Obiwan would have taken care of the child and its mother he would have taught the child in the ways of the Force even if it wasnt Force sensitive wouldve taught it how to be good and how to appreciate and respect the Force despite not being able to use it. He wouldve had Luke check in on this child at some point or maybe even have him take the child on as an apprentice or as an instructor of some sort.He would not have had a child for a number of reasons. He was dedicated to righting his wrongs meaning he was dedicated to protecting and teaching Luke after failing with Anakin. He had a child in a way with Luke. He desperately wanted to raise Luke teach Luke protect Luke... Theres simply no way that hes wholly devoted to Luke while being a deadbeat dad at the same time.Its irresponsible storytelling. It goes against everything that Obiwan Kenobi has been known to be since . Its a slap in the face to those who respect what Obiwan Kenobi is and what Obiwan Kenobi is is a man who is dedicated wholeheartedly to his mission and his order. Having a child who is inexplicably absent throughout the OT makes absolutely zero sense for the character of Obiwan Kenobi and anyone with any sense of storytelling whatsoever should realize that.Even Legends which brought back Palpatine from the dead and Force storms destroying whole planets and a ship the size of an Xwing with a magically impenetrable hull that could blow up a planet was never dumb enough to give Obiwan Kenobi a child.,StarWars,d1g1kpc,1,t5_2qi4s

7130215,0,t1_d1nsx2r,First off rLightsabers. We could have more people there.UltraSabers is the entry level of the lightsaber hobby since their most basic sabers are  and are more durable than what Hasbro pumps out. They were my gateway into collecting sabers but I stopped buying their things after they started stealing designs and sound effects all sounds that are included with their sabers wired for sound were stolen from saberfont.com where people paid for the effects. US is looked down upon by the majority of the community for their piracy so if you go to forums such as FXSabers.com and theCustomSaberShop.com you best not talk about them or SaberForge.Speaking of SaberForge SF recently raised their prices by  without better quality or customer service. At the moment if you want a basic saber with lights youre paying  pre shipping and youre gonna wait  weeks for it to arrive or worse the company claims they lost it in the mail when they didnt even start working on it. The owner of SF steals designs from smaller companies such as Solo Sabers intending to simplify their designs and selling them at a lower cost and also bans people anyone who badmouths his company on his forums and deletes bad reviews. Hell if your saber arrives damaged theyll more than likely blame you. Even rSaberForge doesnt like them making the header SaberForge sucks. I got lucky enough to find a few of their sabers on Craigslist instead of waiting four months and the seller complained about how they got his order wrong and asked him to pay  in order for them to switch out the color.If you want good ones that dont look dull like what US offers or deal with the possibility of SF pretending they lost your  lightsaber in the mail go for Vaders Vault theyre a good company that many like and are now better priced than SF. I have yet to hear anything negative from them and their sabers are brighter than anything SF or US offers.Vaders Vault also has a customization line but since TFA was released they had to close that until sometime in . If you want to make one yourself I say you should go to The Custom Saber Shop instead. Theyre also reputable having run the custom lightsaber business since .,StarWars,d1omj1q,3,t5_2qi4s

7170889,0,t1_d1t87z7,gtNot sure why Rey is so offensive to you.Ive never heard casually interested viewers or people who arent Star Wars fans complaining about Anakin and Lukes power. Ive heard some people complain but most people dont seem to care.However the backlash over Rey seems much more violent and widespread.And Id say the feats she achieves are nowhere near as unbelievable as Lukes and Anakins. Luke guides a pair of torpedoes into a m wide port using the Force after spending one minute trying to deflect blaster bolts and never using the Force again until the end. He outclasses the best XWing pilots in the Galaxy with no training. Anakin is even more ridiculous. By the age of nine he is podracing something no human had ever done in a podracer he had built himself out of junk which was the fastest podracer ever made. And then he went on to fly a Naboo Starfighter hed never seen before definitely having never piloted a starship or probably even seen one through a droid base he was unfamiliar with and blow it up.Rey does a mind trick after seeing inside Kylos head and learning that you know mind tricks exist. She flies a ship shes unfamiliar with well something Luke and Anakin both did but unlike them shes slower to learn it and doesnt fly well at first rather than being excellent from the get go. She crashes she scrapes it she struggles to takeoff. She then flies it through a Star Destroyer with which she is very familiar she knows its structure and layout where she can fly through and where she can get out of it. Neither Anakin nor Luke knew anything about where they flew until they did it and they flew the ships perfectly from takeoff with no errors. Thats way more unbelievable that what Rey did.She fights an angry unstable opponent whoa has been shot with a weapon that onehitkilled everyone it hit up until that point. He is definitely bleeding out and has internal injuries. Its amazing he can even stand up let alone fight. I guess his clothes are armourweave.b is unfamiliar with fighting an opponent who has a lightsaber. Rey is too but dont forget that Kylos training is not complete and he will only be used to fighting opponents who have blasters.c doesnt want to kill her. Him wanting to take her alive and her wanting him dead immediately gives her a massive advantage in terms of aggression and commitment she is the first to attack and once she opens herself fully to the Force and lets it guide her he doesnt have a chance. Hes injured inexperienced and not fully committed to the fight.And remember Rey is someone who we know is experienced in handtohand thanks to her staff and how easily she takes down the two goons and Finn who was definitely trained in handtohand as a stormtrooper.So actually most of her feats either pale in comparison to her lineage I believe she is a Skywalker and are in keeping with what we expect from a protagonist in Star Wars or are fully explained within the film.Calling her a Mary Sue is a pretty lazy complaint about the film. Its easy to make a better structured argument than that.But I attribute much of the backlash against Rey to sexism. Because when a man was extremely competent in Star Wars right from the start it was accepted by most casual viewers. Now that a woman is about as competent as quickly suddenly its something to complain about from almost everyones POV. Because competence and success strength and power are seen as uniquely masculine traits especially when the character is not a sex symbol or overfeminine.,StarWars,d1t9gu3,16,t5_2qi4s

7175040,0,t3_4dqo9v,Looks fucking amazing. I have to admit that before now I was only kinda lukewarm on this movie. I mean Star Wars is my religion I was going to see this either way and I had no reason to think it wouldnt be good but I was a bit worried about what basically amounts to another prequel in the Star Wars universe. Even ignoring the more glaring problems with the prequel trilogy one of the most prevalent and inescapable issues was how small it made the universe seem because of all the references to the older movies they continued to make.Its impossible to tell with one trailer of course but this seems like a really healthy balance between old and new. Loved seeing Mon Mothma and the construction of the Death Star but the new characters were also a welcome sight. This really did feel both nostalgic and new which I hope is how the final movie will feel since thats the balance these Star Wars Story movies need to hit at least until we get one thats far removed from any of the trilogies like an Old Republic movie or something.Also I love that they recast Mon Mothma. Dont get me wrong there was absolutely nothing wrong with the first actor but these characters need to be bigger than the actors that play them if this franchise is going to have the kind of longevity Disney wants it to. This sets a fantastic precedent in my opinion.,StarWars,d1tqhr9,2,t5_2qi4s

If its ONLY because theyre women I got some bad news for you...And yes my argument is if theyre going to lose a handful of dudes who think All The Main Characters Gotta Be Male that Disney is fine with it if it brings in a flood of female fans. The amount of men for whom the main character is a woman is a dealbreaker is way lower than the potential female market. TFA was a runaway blockbuster hit. That math speaks for itself.I read not Disney actually AM arguing you shouldnt want what you want or at least that you should think critically about WHY its what you want. You get  main male characters in TFA an undefined amount of male characters in Rogue One...whats the issue? Is it really so rough that ONE of the main characters in each is a woman?

As for Korun Korun are a race of Force sensitive jungle dwelling tribal peoples who are the descendants of Jedi who crashed there millenia ago. They are not generic black guy with racist stereotype with african jungle man tropes. Theyre a fully fleshed out people that Mace Windu happens to be a member of. Theyre dark skinned because of course they are how many jungle dwelling equatorial peoples do you know of that do not have a high melanin concentration in their skin? Not many I can tell that already. Saying all black people in star wars must be korun because korun are dark skinned humanoids is a racist assumption in itself. Lando calrissian is from Socorro. Hes human. Captain Panaka is from Naboo Hes human. Mandalore the Vindicated is from Clan Lok which is probably from planet Lok.

7188594,0,t1_d1s3ltv,Theres a big and interesting question on if the appearance of sentience is sufficient for us to call it sentient Turing test.  That said the theme of artificial intelligence and droid sentience is not really one central to the movie stories.  I think it is intentionally left this way.  The society isnt really judged by the writing so much as simply presented as a backdrop for the largerthanlife stories.Droids are simply treated as other characters.  The idea of their sentience isnt specifically addressed but in all important ways they are treated as equals to other characters... well equal to Wookies at least not quite on the level of humans amirite?.They are treated as slaves in that they are possessions and dont have distinct rights of their own but theyre just machines.  Its easy to see the slave connection though because despite being machine possessions they are treated by everyone around them as sentient in how they interact with them.This very subtle theme of slavery and castes is seen again in the prequels with the clone wars.  The separatist droid army are just droids so who cares if we murder them all... its not murder right?  Well what about this other army of Clones?  Like droids they are constructed and programmed for a singular purpose and they all look alike... so is it OK to send millions of them to die?  If a clone trooper decides he wants to be a pacifist or a painter what do they do with him can he even make that decision based on his programming?  The clones are clearly human but they have no more rights than droids.  What about faceless Storm Troopers then are they human do we care about their deaths?  Its important to note that we only ever see good guys in armor remove their helmets to reveal their faces Cmd Cody before order  not after Luke and Han Vader after turning good Fin and... Kylo.  I know Star Wars The Clone Wars is now canon and it removes some of the ambiguity left in the movies by specifically dealing with these themes in some great ways.,StarWars,d1va5fl,1,t5_2qi4s
7189368,0,t1_d1vbw9k,gtWe got an arc with Han Solo in the very first film.Which is exactly why Harrison Ford began to hate playing him halfway through filming Empire. Dont get me wrong I like the character but here was no where for him to go. They developed him completely within the first movie. At least in Empire his sacrifice could lend some emotional weight to the story but hes basically a generic action hero by Return of the Jedi.Luke on the other hand changes in each movie. He is a naive wideeyed teenager from a backwater planet who has grown up listening in awe to stories about the greater galaxy and is only able to accomplish incredible feats and conquer the bad guys through what is essentially his faith....just like Rey in TFA. If Luke was like that in each film of the OT he would be SO boring. But hes not. In Empire we see his flaws hes arrogant a bit entitled and too confident in his budding abilities. In Jedi we see him try to correct those flaws after he was humbled in the previous movie. That is character development that encompasses three movies.I just think its silly to think that Reys finished developing as a character. Weve only just been introduced to her and what weve seen of her development thus far mirrors Luke and hell even Anakin in A New Hope and the Phantom Menace respectively. Her story has only just begun.,StarWars,d1vdbus,1,t5_2qi4s

7220433,0,t1_d1yh064,Luke being her dad doesnt really make sense IMO.When she was told about Luke she seemed to only be familiar with him as some sort of mythical story figure which would be rather odd as she was certainly old enough to remember who dropped her off and if Luke was her dad she would certainly have been old enough to remember that.Also none of her extended family showed any recognition of her in the slightest. Kylo would probably have recognized her if she was his cousin Along with her being the daughter of the man he spent so long training under and Han would have shown some glimmer of recognition if she was his niece.The third reason it doesnt really make sense is because it doesnt really make a lot of sense for Luke to drop his daughter off on Jakku to live as essentially a slave when he has the connections to have her sent literally anywhere he wants.Theres nothing to really indicate that Rey is Lukes daughter beyond Luke having a strange reaction to her at the end.Personally the theory that I like the most is the Reincarnation theory.,StarWars,d1ywpdl,1,t5_2qi4s

7222384,0,t1_d1z2cx2,I disagree first off Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo IS a Skywalker so the potential is there for him to be just as great as any other Skywalker. And Snoke literally says    gt It is time to complete his training.    Which implies that we havent seen Kylo at his strongest. Lets not forget that Kylo hasnt lived up to his full potential due to the fact that hes struggling in a sort of ForceLimbo too much light to fully embrace the darkside. Remember when he says    gt Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again the power of the darkness and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me Grandfather and I will finish what you started.    When Han Solo asks Kylo Ben to leave with him hes truly conflicted for the first time. Thats why he says    gt Im being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain... I know what I have to do but I dont know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?    Its clear that Kylo believes he has to kill his father in order to fully embrace the darkside. So this idea that hes a lowimpact villain is completely intentional because throughout TFA its clear his character was struggling internally...    Now this notion that he couldnt even best a novice fighting with a lightsaber for her first time is quite debateable. Personally Im of the belief that Rey amp Kylo unexpectedly created a ForceBond between each other during the interigation scene. This allowed Rey unbeknownst to her to access much of Kylos training like how she used the mindtrick on the stormtrooper to free her. And remember that during the forest duel it was Kylo who was was beating her rather handily right up until he said    gt You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force!    To which she replies    gt The Force...    I think that was the moment she realized she could access much of Kylos power if she just allowed the Force to guide her like Maz had advised her earlier. If Luke had shown up to save the day then Reys force abilities would not have been fully awoken.    Personally I love the direction they are taking us with these new stories because the next time we see Kylo Ren hes going to be an absolute monster both in appearance amp ability and I think that ForceBond between him and Rey will have A LOT to do with the story over the course of  the next two films.,StarWars,d1z4phk,38,t5_2qi4s

Thats of course ignoring the torture slavery and various other war crimes.Balance means destroying the Sith.  Anakin could have done this without becoming Vader first but the Jedi fucked it up.  Due to all of this I will be a little miffed if Snoke is some kind of Sith meaning Anakins entire arc was for nothing.

7231960,0,t1_d201f3x,Yes. Exactly. Yoda is so powerful he doesnt need a weapon. The PalpatineYoda fight shouldve just been a straight up wizards duel and he should have never fought Dooku. It just breaks the character.There was a master in Old Republic timeline from the old EU who imbued his staff with the force instead of using a saber.

7241585,0,t3_4elk4g,For one it doesnt make a whole lot of sense. Han and Leia never mention Luke leaving a wife behind when he disappeared or even that he had a wife or if that was part of his motivation in leaving. Also if Luke had a child wed have gotten a mention of it and itd be fairly common knowledge in the Resistance at least. And Luke having a secret daughter? Pretty dumb and I swear if one more person says Oh but what if KyloLuke wiped her memories when she was left on Jakku? No that is not going to be a thing we have zero indication that there are devices or force techniques that would allow someone to remove memories.Not only is the memory wipe theory unfounded in canon its also lazy story writing at its absolute worst. I would believe it if the sequels had been written as fanfiction on tumblr by a thirteen year old. The sequels would become an absolute joke and Id beg for Jar Jar to take us back for ever thinking that a story that relies on fucking mind wipes for its main question.And there is the simple fact that cannot be undermined by any plot contrivance without retconning a shitton of Star Wars Luke either A. Left a child on a planet to scavenge for herself with only the supervision of a greedy alien who is one step up from Watto. or B. He thought she was dead. Only Luke would know if she was dead or alive I am fairly confident a very powerful Jedi would sense whether or not his own daughter was alive. Leia completely untrained in the Force sensed Hans death so yeah Luke would know if his daughter was still alive after Kylo got done murdering the other apprentices.And if someone is saying Luke would abandon his daughter to live as an orphan scrounging for parts just to get food then they didnt watch the Star Wars I did.,StarWars,d21bdai,27,t5_2qi4s

Finn and Poe could go full marriage license. Phasma could be Reys mother too. Who knows. I like having an open mind about where things can go rather than say that this one thing needs to not happen because its obvious. What else is obvious in the films? Palpatine being the emperor the whole time? Who saw that one coming? Anakin turning to the dark side? R and PO being the slapstick comedy duo when we need it? Unheard of.

The First Order isnt really a rational organization  theyre violent fanatics staffed by brainwashed soldiers obsessed with the hateful ideology of the Empire and they want to return to the good old days of order in the galaxy even if they have to burn it the ground.

7307409,0,t3_4fgxnz,. Plenty of force users come into contact with the dark side. Thats literally the danger of it you can get close very easily. Many jedi turn dark because they accidentally delve too far into it.. I struggle to accept any proof that involves fighting style because it wasnt until very recently that anyone bothered to standardize Star Wars combat styles. The difference in fighting style between the OT and the sequels wasnt a deliberate shift to signify anything. The OT just suffered from physical limitations and different choreographers. This isnt even guesswork the fighting in the OT was inspired by Samurai combat kendo and the works. The sequels involved a lot more acrobatics and onehanded techniques. Because of this I dont think its reasonable at all to say Rey is fighting like Palpatine because in the movies Palp was either a slow moving old man or a crazy old coot bouncing around the room. Rey showed neither of those traits.. Ep VII did have a lot of nods to old material including stuff from the Legends. But to suggest that a nod would be SO central to the formation of a character is a bit of a stretch. Revan and Bastilla are no longer canon and to draw any similarity other than aesthetics is a little too much.,StarWars,d28swmw,2,t5_2qi4s

7310181,0,t1_d25ekie,Not that I disagree that Rey is a Skywalker andor a Solo but thats really not the overarching story of the saga...at least not if you go by the only movie from the saga released so far.With Luke a huge part of his motivation was to find out more about his father from this weird unfamiliar wise Jedi who seemingly used to be best friends with his father. He then also finds out that the man he has to defeat was the one who killed his father. The quest to finding the history of his father was the driving force behind Lukes adventure.In this story while it is established that Rey is strong with the force and that her origins are unknown the only spot in the movie where her desire to find her origins is the scene where shes at the basement in Mazs bar place. Its a pretty significant scene but its not the focal point of the movie. She doesnt seek revenge for her parents. She is told to let go of them. There is no old master who used to know her father at least on face value we only assume that because we know how Star Wars works by now. The main family connection in this movie is Kylo Ren being Han and Leias son. The main story is the battle against him the attempt to bring him back from the dark side and the quest to search for Luke.,StarWars,d29494d,1,t5_2qi4s

The problem with TFA is it did not explain this well at all its in the novels that are in the Journey to the Force Awakens line of books amp TFA Visual Dictionary. So if you never look into the books or do research on your own then it easily looks like a plot hole.This is a direct excerpt from the Visual DictionaryThe Resistance is a small private force created by Princess Leia Organa to keep watch on the movements of the First Order. Though she petitions the New Republic government for support she finds the politics of the Senate too slow and too mired in selfinterest to be of any help.

Why do I care about a story if once it runs its course it becomes completely irrelevant since you can just switch to another universe. I care about one SW universe and everything that happens in it.

7399015,0,t1_d2j65gi,LEGO Designer here. This is not true. The GB firehouse was built by Marco Bessa as a personal project for himself while developing the LEGO Ideas Ghostbusters car. His version of the firehouse was then made into a set. The designer of any set might have a look to see if any fans have approached the same model and we might see a part usage or interior layout that is interesting but thats it. Im not sure how then building something in different colours using different parts can then be called theft. The model was always going to end up looking like the firehouse from Ghostbusters. The parts are LEGO bricks and model is at the same scale and based on the same real world object then of course there will be some similarities.By the way this Star Destroyer is amazing its absolutely mindblowing. Congratulations to Raskolnikov on a fantastic build.As for it becoming a LEGO set if it is  parts and it looks like more to me then my guess would be it would retail at minimum  probably more as it would need to be packed into around  of our biggest boxes the Death Star ones and come with a lot of building instructions.

Finn could have given the informations about Starkiller but he wouldnt have a reason to go there himself without Rey needing to be rescued.The Resistance would still try to destroy Starkiller and Han would help them since hes the one who find a way to bypass the shield. But without Finn he and Chewie wouldnt think to capture Phasma and thus would use the explosives to disable the shield. Meaning they wouldnt have them to open an entrance in the Thermal Oscillator.Then the Resistance cant destroy Starkiller Base. The Xwing are destroyed the First Order open fire on the Ileenium system bye bye Leia Ackbar and maybe Finn and Rey if they didnt leave in time.

7463151,0,t3_4hl0ya,Well we got a lot of questions to answer and new characters to meet but based off what we have in VII here they might not be going past IX but I will bet my left foot they will so this is a tight ending with some little morsels in case they do wanna keep going The Republic and Resistance win the war for the galaxy against The First Order. The galaxy is in rough shape but without and reasonable threat left like a renounced Empire or extremists the future looks bright. Kylo Ren usurps Snoke at a point and kills him once he learns more about Vader and how the Sith operated. Kylo becomes incredibly strong and near impossible to stop. He is never redeemed and is slain at the end by a combined effort between Rey and Luke. Leia dies at some point in the trilogy potentially the movie before IX to set up even higher stakes between Luke and Kylo. Finn becomes an idol revered in the Republic for his courageous departure from the First Order than helped win the war. He joins Poe and the Republic Armada in scouring the Unknown Reaches Poe becomes the lead general in the Republic Army. He is tasked with mapping out the rest of the Unknown Reaches set up for future movies what could be out there? Luke decides it may be for the best to let the Force naturally flow throughout the universe and not try to mold and tamper it for their own benefit. He roams the galaxy and teaches the younger and disenfranchised generations about the Clone Wars the Jedi Anakin Skywalker the Galactic Civil War and the War for Galactic Control. Rey becomes incredibly powerful and agrees with Luke that it is best to let the Force become one with everyone and keep it in a natural intampered state. She agrees see Luke again one day and joins Finn and Poe on their expedition.I could have the shittiest ideas ever but I wouldnt know. I was spitballing here.,StarWars,d2qiiqb,10,t5_2qi4s
7464672,0,t1_d2plufi,gt Luke Listen I cant get involved. Ive got work to do. Its not that I like the Empire. I hate it but theres nothing I can do about it right now. Its all such a long way from here.Its never explicitly stated but its understood there are  Jedi Knights. Ten thousand in a galaxy of hundreds if not thousands of worlds. Thats billions of people. Do you seriously expect the Jedi to police every single world with those numbers?gt The Force is actually telling QuiGon to take the mother but like most Jedi QuiGon doesnt listen because he lacks faith. So he forces the die to give him Anakin.Im not sure where you got this from. QuiGon had suspicions about Anakin not Shmi which were confirmed when he had ObiWan do the midichlorian count. At that point he decided to take Anakin with him and tried to have Watto bet on him. Remember he originally proposed to take both of them but Watto refused.gt Anakin was the one who got dragged along to a warzone and ended up destroying the command ship.Ill concede bringing him along might not have been the best idea but Anakin was in QuiGons care at that point. QuiGon probably felt at first that Anakin was safest with him although he did decide to tell him to hide in a fighter later on.I must agree with other posters it really does look like youre clutching at straws to push the idea that the Jedi are malevolent.

As a result it didnt need a subtitle  it was a single book that covered all the Star Wars movies in existence. The other ICSes were released as the movies they tied into came out. TPM was heavily marketed as Star Wars Episode I rather than The Phantom Menace to emphasize its nature as a the beginning of the Star Wars story. A lot of TPM merchandise and tieins are subtitled with Episode I instead of The Phantom Menace. After TPM the Episode subtitling was abandoned so AotC and Revenge of the Sith are just labeled with their actual subtitles.,StarWars,d2wuj8l,3,t5_2qi4s

Not possible though. It would be nice to see Maul vs Obi Wan again on the big screen but it probably wont happen because most of the fan base will scream bloody murder at noticing that Maul is still alive. The Halo franchise started to go crazy and just bring in all that universes lore into the main series and that didnt go down well with most of the fan base now a lot of people hate it because of that.

7522500,0,t1_d2wx7vz,I dont think that everything pre TPM is canon is confusing but there are some really stupid people out their Im probably one of the few people who doesnt want them to bring back stuff from the classic EU thats my main reason why I dont use the term Legends. Since I have seen nothing besides Tarkin maybe but that one was written James Luceno so that kinda doesnt count that has convinced me that the story group has any clue what makes the classic EU great and how to deal with it. I havent seenread everything but most if not all of the time its either name dropping and still mixing things up like MalachorSith TemplesRule of two or Anakin teaching a modified version of form IV two block blasterbolts Why didnt he teach form V that is modified with some elements of Ataru to increase the mobility? And to be honest the moves looked more like form V than Form IV or straight up ruining the characterbackstory like they did with Depa Balliba or Quinlan Vos.  And I actually like what they did with Depa in the beginning. They kept her past vague and it made completely sense that she switched from Form VII to form III which was described strangely by the grand inquisitor.. But if they bring other stuff back and they do it right Im the first one to admit that I was wrong. And while Im not a fan of the general idea Im happy for everyone whos hyped to see his favourite characters return to canon.,StarWars,d2x9ryu,1,t5_2qi4s

He could be Plagueis Bane or someone weve never heard of before it doesnt matter since his existence wouldnt cheapen Palpatine or seem implausible. He would have to have some residual ability with the Force to influence minds but no corporeal form means no rehash of the Palpatine showdowns from Episode III and VI instead the battle is fought in the minds of our heroes and probably Kylo against Snokes influence. And his messedup head and mouth could just be a projection of the damage that killed his physical body leaving his weird Force ghost form to wander until it was able to affect the galaxy again through its own holocron projection.

Good shape compared to what?A dark jedi in good shape is like Vader fighting Luke in ESB. Confident in control unconflicted full of selfassurance and ambition. The dark side eats that shit up.

What I meant was that after his success many fans felt like Lucas had become like the old studio heads that had caused him to go his own way and eventually start his own company. Lucas made exactly what Lucas wanted to make Im not denying that. My point was that with the prequels many fans felt like he had sold out rather than caring about the story or quality. He was vilified into a caricature of a greedy uncaring studio head that just wanted to make money instead of the kind of films fans wanted. Of course Lucas wanted to make money thats his job.

Who is it? When will we see this princess? I am intrigued. We see beautiful Carrie Fisher  maybe thats the princess! She is charismatic and I hope she is... Then there are various elements more or less confirming that she is the princess and the viewer is satisfied by the resolution of the mystery.This happens over and over in every movie. Who is ObiWan Kenobi? Why is he special? We dont know! Ah then it is satisfyingly explained. He is this old hermit!

7654679,0,t1_d3c87oj,And that convoluted scenario requiring the introduction of several characters and plot lines is more simple than Rey not having any notable heritage at all and simply having been abandoned by shitty parents? What does everyone important have to be connected to the Skywalkers? And dont give me that Star wars is about the Skywalkers or it rhymes. Those quotes from Lucas were from before the acquisition by Disney he had no intention of ever doing an Episode VII. The new trilogy doesnt need the hero to be a Skywalker especially when theyre already represented by Kylo. All of the evidence of Rey being Lukes daughter is speculative reaching based on nothing but the desire for it to be true. She has memories of Kylos betrayal No she doesnt. Thats a Force vision not everything the character sees during one is something that happens while they were there not even if its something from the past.Anakins saber called out to her and chose her over Kylo. No the Force called out to Rey and drew her to the saber. Sabers do not have a will. The Force can call out to anyone not just Skywalkers. Rey was able to call the lightsaber to her while Kylo wasnt was because she had a clear and focused mind while Kylo clearly did not. The movie cut away from Han telling Maz who Rey is so he obviously knows her because shes Lukes daughter and it cut away to save the reveal for VIII. No Its just a waste of time to show Han recounting what we just watched when they could be showing us new stuff like Rey finding the saber. Those are the big pieces of Rey Skywalker evidence I see thrown around and I can refute each one rather easily. Of course this doesnt mean she isnt Lukes daughter just that the evidence for it is flimsy at best.  ,StarWars,d3caloe,1,t5_2qi4s

I definitely think the events are linked.Plus I find it interesting that Hux not Snoke is the one to give the speech and order Starkiller to fire. Youd expect that someone with the title Supreme Leader would be a more public figure. And Hux seems to be somewhat loyal to his troops  he doesnt like it when Kylo Ren questions their loyalty.

7806965,0,t1_d3t00vc,I strongly disagree with you about Luke. Luke has a very strong arc throughout the trilogy. I feel like many are throwing Lukes character arc under the bus in order to save Reys. A comparison of the two shows it doesnt hold water.The key to a Mary Sue character is FLAWS and FAILURE as in a Mary Sue doesnt have either or at least not enough of either. Luke has plenty of both.Lukes failures are legion He gets beat up by the Sand People and bullied in the bar. He is saved both times by Kenobi. He suffers a number of failures blocking the laser ball he is mocked the whole time by Solo. Luke has a minor success at the end but the success is minor enough that Solo can dismiss it. Kenobi gives Luke the kind of encouragement you give to a child who learns to ride a bicycle without training wheels when it is clear that the child will shortly be racing a bike against professionals i.e. Vader looms. Luke saves Leia but screws it up and is bailed out first by Leia then the droids. While trapped Luke is saved from the tentacle monster only by the start of the compactor.This is only A New Hope. His training with Yoda in ESB is marked by one failure after another. He is almost eaten by the ice monster and is saved from freezing to death by Solo. He loses the final confrontation with Vader along with his hand. Through the first two acts of ANH Luke is the least impressive of the main characters. Kenobi has saved Luke three times by this point and while dead was a Jedi Master. Solo is seasoned and depicted as someone who can take care of himself he shot first!. Chewbacca is terrifying. Even RD doesnt respect Luke and has been more useful to this point. When Leia joins up with them it is clear that she is a much stronger personality than Luke. She immediately takes charge butting heads with Solo over leadership not Luke.By now it should be clear what Lukes flaw is. He is young immature and not to be taken seriously. Even as late as ROTJ when Luke has come to save Solo he is incredulous that Luke is trying to save him saying Luke cant even take care of himself much less rescue anybody and scoffs at Lukes delusions of grandeur.In contrast to these others Luke lacks gravitas. Up through the second Act of ANH the viewer has been given no evidence that an adversary would respect or fear Luke certainly not in comparison to Kenobi Solo Chewbacca or Leia. At this point Luke is all about potential with little to no payoff to show for it.Another indication of Lukes immaturity is the succession of father figures that come and go from his life Uncle Owen Kenobi and eventually Yoda and Vader. It isnt until he confronts Vader defeats him and then saves him that Luke shows he has matured and no longer needs a father figure to guide him.Moreover more is made of Lukes success at the end of ANH than is warranted. He doesnt exactly distinguish himself in the dogfight over the death star nor in the trench run. He is saved from certain death no less than  times by others. He also gets hit twice in addition. His use of the force is minor instead of using the computer to aim he learns to trust and use the force. It is simply a matter of aiming not pushing or guiding.In the end the miracle isnt in the shot Luke takes to take down the death star its that something so large can be taken down with one shot. Indeed this becomes so routine that two nonforce users take down larger death stars in subsequent movies.Destroying the death star was a tremendous accomplishment but in the context of the films it should be seen for what it was a minor step on Lukes path towards maturing into a Jedi Knight even if it was a major step in defeating the Empire.,StarWars,d3tkcyo,2,t5_2qi4s

There is wayyyy to many factors that go into making a movie like this and theres a lot on the line for this movie since it takes place right before one of the biggest movies of all time thats shaped pop culture today.

7837944,0,t1_d3wvgtq,My theory is that Vader never truly became a Sith.He had practicaly been raised by Jedi who placed a very specific image into his mind of what a Sith supposedly was. A monster.When confronted by the first Sith in millenia they never questioned wether their asumptions were right or not and kept telling their students that Sith did evil for the sake of doing evil. Anakin never looked at what the Sith truly were he never tried to understand the Sith code and simply became the unfeeling monster that the Jedi thought Sith were.Anakin was well on his way to becoming a moderately decent Sith before Mustafar after which he retreated into himself destroying Anakin Skywalker to escape the pain which is the exact opposite of what a Sith is supposed to do. He discarded his passions and became an unfeeling enforcer of the Emperors will which caused Palpatine to resent him due to the lost potential.

7842130,0,t1_d3xc308,Okay I can see were not going to agree with respect to internal conflict. Lets even forget about the Mary Sue definition and criteria and all that stuff since thats obviously getting in the way. btw I dont concede any thing on these points this is simply for the sake of a productive argument.Lets keep it real simple External conflict. Character arcs have various facets. An inner struggle overcoming fear whininess etc. and an external struggle beating the bad guys. Lets keep it to the latter since this is something that is more clear cut and easier to argue.Second and third acts in action movies are dominated by tryfail cycles with respect to beating the bad guys. Rey simply doesnt have enough of them. All wellwritten action characters have tryfail cycles with respect to EXTERNAL conflict beating the bad guys. Name me one that doesnt.An action character that has a compelling inner conflict but doesnt have a compelling external conflict with a bad guy is not a well written ACTION character. Some crime dramas are constructed with compelling inner conflicts and weak external conflicts but no wellreviewed action flick is ever constructed this way.So keeping this in mind lets argue this thesis Rey is a poorly written action character because she overcomes her enemies too easily in TFA. And by overcoming I dont mean in terms of overcoming fear or some other internal struggle. I mean in terms of defeating the bad guys.Note the following points of comparison between Rey and Luke limited to the respective first films TFA and ANH Luke gets beat up by a Sand Person and bullied by a couple thugs in a bar he is saved by Ben Kenobi both times Rey beats up two thugs by herself before Finn can help her. This was an opportunity to show that Rey is weak and needs further training. Nope. Lukes force abilities are limited to deflecting lasers from a training device and aiming a torpedo Rey has advanced force capabilities including force control of a person dueling the mind of another force user and defeating Kylo Ren in a light sabre duel even though he has far more training than her in the force he can stop a freaking laser bolt. Most importantly these skills help Rey defeat or otherwise get the best of Kylo Ren and a key stormtrooper There are many quieter moments on the death star where comparable proficiency in mind control of a stormtrooper might have come in handy for Luke. Luke gets trapped on the death star though not captured Rey is captured and trapped on the death star. Luke saves Leia with help but they are trapped almost immediately. It is Leia who gets them out of the initial jam Rey saves herself. Luke is almost eaten by the tentacle monster and is saved from crushing by RD Rey saves Finn from a tentacle monster her unleashing of the monsters helps everyone escape from the clutches of the two gangs. In terms of respect of other characters its no contest Luke is viewed as the least capable of beating bad guys by all the other main characters in ANH before the climactic battle Kenobi condescends to him this little one Solo calls him kid Leia doesnt take him seriously as a potential leader RD doesnt listen to him Rey in contrast is respected almost immediately by Solo for her abilities in a tight spot Finn learns very quickly she can take care of herself. Lukes reputation is low because he has shown he cant take care of himself in a tight spot to this point in other words he has failed a lot to this point Reys reputation is high because she is good at everything and overcomes external enemies at almost every turn and even when she does fail to do so the one time she gets herself out of trouble. Luke doesnt get a chance to face Vader in a duel but he would almost certainly have lost if he did Rey defeats Kylo Ren in her first ever light sabre duel.,StarWars,d3xiv1k,1,t5_2qi4s

Even with the intentional parallels its impossible compare ANH to TPM in an applestoapples way not only because of the differences the films but the differences in the times. In the same way its impossible to compare Vader to Maul. If ANH had been made with Maul instead of Vader would Maul enjoy the same popularity as Vader? Impossible to see but I dont think I would have been equally intimidated by Maul as Vader. You didnt see Vaders face he was almost as tall as the wookiee he KILLED people left and right and without obvious or at least justifiable provocation. He killed people before breakfast without getting out of bed. Even knowing where the story would eventually lead Maul was easily my favorite character from ep. I unfortunately had very high hopes for him pre release his potential was so high but he didnt really do anything in the film... sure his fights were exciting to watch but so brief. He killed Quigon but I cant even remember he killed anyone else. Vaders THREATS were memorable. Other characters made attempts to convey that they were intimidated by Maul but it was obvious that Vader was intimidating right from the start without the flash and gymnastics and fancy new doublebladed lightsaber.

Was that pilot the first canon Chiss weve seen? Im glad to see them not categorizing aliens based on trilogy since it makes sense that a race this big would have a ton of diversity.Regarding the race I love this premise.

8051549,0,t3_4pfaqp,Im glad they put some effort into the characters instead of just making the film all about action and technology. It makes me really look forward to seeing the film and finding out how these characters are realised. I really hope we learn more about the specific motivations of the rebellion beyond the fact that they are fighting against a violent Empire. What do they believe in that they feel is being threatened by the Empire? Are they simply afraid of the Death Star or are they angry at the way the Empire treats its citizens in general? What do they want in place of the Empire and do they all agree on this matter? Or do different bands of rebels favour different alternatives? Answering these questions would bring more depth to the Star Wars universe.

8073909,0,t1_d4nizrk,My dialogue was a little over the top but not more so than the dialogue in the original film. I think it wouldve made more sense to have him gradually tap into the dark side under Palpatines instruction instead of having him suddenly be consumed by it prior to fighting Obiwan. Thats actually the whole reason I think Palpatine or the film makers shouldve had him kill the Separatists first. It would be psychologically easier for him to commit a mass killing against people he hated and then progress from that to killing innocents especially once he had already allowed the dark side to enter him. It wouldve made him easier to relate to. In the canon version of the film Im left wondering how he couldve done that without already being a horrible monster from the start of the film.As for the tactical issues Im not saying that the temple shouldnt have been attacked prior to the attack on the Separatists. I just dont think Anakin would have been able to slaughter the younglings as his first dark side act. A number of things couldve happened instead. If the younglings had already been taken from the temple Anakin couldve been ordered to attack a temple he knew to be occupied only by adults who he felt had mistrusted and excluded him. An attack against such adults would be more justifiable in Anakins mind. Even so he might have only been capable of ordering his clone troopers to carry out the attack as part of Order . Palpatine would notice that he had not killed the Jedi directly and at first he would be disappointed but then he would recall Anakins slaughter of the Tusken Raiders in response to them torturing and killing his mother and it would give him the idea to have him kill the Separatists instead an act he knows Anakin is capable of. It is also entirely possible for Palpatine to attack the temple without Anakin being involved at all but there is a value to having him attack the physical representation of the organisation he had once been part of as a way of denouncing them.From a film making standpoint Anakin shouldve faced more trouble after his turn to the dark side. So I like the idea of him encountering a stronger Jedi defence at the temple. It wouldve given him an opportunity to demonstrate that power of the dark side that hes always going on about. More conflict and challenges are a good thing from a story telling standpoint. However Anakin cant return to the temple after going to Mustafar because he has to be defeated by Obiwan on a volcanic planet and physically become Vader. Unless of course he goes back to the temple as Vader and ends to put it mildly a conflict that was waged there for a few days during which he underwent his transformation and his children were born. It wouldve been cool to see Anakin in his Vader form actually do something as Vader instead of just staring out a window at a Death Star that was being built although that was a pretty awesome image on its own it just shouldnt have been all that Vader did.At the end of the day though Star Wars aint mine and Revenge of the Sith is a rather compelling film in spite of its flaws. It could definitely have been better but Im glad that it exists and gives me something to think about. Likeable or not Anakin Skywalker in all his forms is one of the most fascinating characters in all of fiction.,StarWars,d4nl0ge,1,t5_2qi4s

8118073,0,t1_d4sj239,What you say is true.  But where Lucas had his own ego Disney has the committee.  The dangers of directors with complete creative control is that while they have the ability to take risks they might go in a direction that audiences dont want it to go. Thats certainly what happened with the prequels.  Lucas had control of everything and while those movies were absolutely unique they ultimately werent what most audiences wanted to see.The danger of the committee is that by having too many cooks in the kitchen you get a watereddown and ultimately unsatisfying product.  The committee guarantees that the product wont be embarrassing.  But neither will it really have the ability to surprise.  For me the Marvel movies are perfect proof of that.  Pretty much all of them are watchable and fun to a degree.  None of them except for maybe Iron Man and Captain America  really pack much of a punch.  They all feel rather by the numbers.  Professional competent and ultimately rather forgettable.  But thats just my opinion.  Lots of people obviously love those movies.,StarWars,d4sjlqx,2,t5_2qi4s

This was also made before Vader was decided to be Anakin.However because the OT has established with one line spoken by ObiWan and one scene Vader flying that Anakin is a great pilot and tbh Vaders flying wasnt visually anything that special the prequels have to spend an awful lot of time setting that up. Anakin wins the podrace destroys the droid control ship drives for the majority of the Coruscant chase sequence flies in the battle over Coruscant and lands the Invisible Hand. Thats not even counting Clone Wars and other nonmovie stuff. All for something that essentially goes nowhere in the OT. Now I do like a lot of Anakins flying feats in the prequels not to mention the flying scenes in the originals so Im not complaining. But thats a pretty major part of his prequel identity that was demanded by a couple minor elements of just one OT film ANH.Additionally theres nothing at all in the OT to indicate that all Jedi were particularly skilled pilots. I think that was an outgrowth of it being one of Lukes traits which is never important again after Hoth and one of AnakinVaders traits which is never important again after Yavin. However by the prequels and especially Clone Wars content just about every Jedi is a skilled fighter piloteven ObiWan who hates it.,StarWars,d4w352g,34,t5_2qi4s

The reason I think this is just a bad artistic choice rather than any deliberate storyline is that both Kanan and Ahsoka had their sabers since before Order  yet their blades still look thin and pointy. If we are to believe the bad crystals explanation wouldnt we expect everyone to have a thin blade except for Kanan and Ahsoka? And their blades would be thicker.

8278621,0,t1_d5cbtke,gt We barely know anything about the Sith HolocaustThe fact that it is called the Sith holocaust and the intent was to ensure no remnants of the Sith Empire remained should tell you enough about what happened.gt And if you want to talk about eye for an eye moral justification lets not forget that the only reason why the Sith Empire existed was because the Jedi spared their dark Jedi brethren you know the ones using Force alchemy to create armies of zombies and abominations to kill shit after the Hundred Year Darkness. Said Sith Empire then blitzkrieged the Republic eons later the moment two Jedi found Korriban. Thats how the Sith repaid the Jedi for their mercy.The Great hyperspace war was motivated by a desire for conquest and as a preemtive strike against the Republic since they did not believe the Republic would tollerate their existence if they found out about the Empire.  In no way does this justify genocide.And when the Sith Empire had the Republic at their mercy after the sacking of Corruscant did they return the favour and try to exterminate trillions?They didnt. They signed a treaty leaving the Republic in charge of half the galaxy and restoring relative peace to the galaxy.And how did the Republic pay them back for this mercy? By keeping prisoners of war locked up decades after the war ended and by trying to break the treaty every chance they get most notably on Balmora.gt Revan did and Revans kinda batshit crazy. Yes there was a Republic fleet there guarding it but it wouldnt be the first time that Revan convinced a bunch of Jedi to follow him on his Machiavellian and obviously dark side leaning quest to massmurder the enemy assuming those Republic soldiers and Jedi even knew the full extent of his plans.So you are saying they were Just following orders?gtisnt even canon anymore. Heresy!gtAs far as new canon is concerned Sith atrocities and acts of evil outweigh Jedi ones by a lot.Exclusively recruiting toddlers using them as child soldiers when they are thirteen years old and buying an army of slave soldiers are bad enough without even going into the morality of forcing people to do what you want by taking hold of their mind. Tough the Sith dont hold the moral high ground in this era either.In the case of the Sith holocaust and onwards tough the Sith are justified in their hatred and quest for revenge.,StarWars,d5cdx42,1,t5_2qi4s

8281744,0,t1_d5cn15n,Except the audience is clued into that almost immediately  we see Palpatine and theres no effort to make him wear a mask or something that would actually lead us to think hes anyone but the Emperor the Jedi basically point out that theres something else going on here and then we meet young Palpatine who makes a power play in the Senate.I get what youre saying but it unfortunately wasnt in the shadows at all  they never made any attempt to make the blockade legit or justified or inject any grey morality into it. Shit they even had a throwaway line about people being put in prison camps so thats a pretty blatant way to turn the audience against the TF. There was no phantom menace because Maul wastes no time flicking out his red lightsaber and making it clear to absolutely everyone that theres Sith involvement. Theres no discretion in that.Imagine if Maul hadnt showed up. The Jedi believe this was unusually bold but also stupid that the TF failed and the Senate had a bit of a shakeup. Instead theyre on edge because the Sith guy reveals himself and the Jedi know Sith come in twos so theyre on their toes now. The menace made every effort to be as unphantom as possible.,StarWars,d5crznb,1,t5_2qi4s

The Jedi themselves were growing fat in their hubris and mired in the political nonsense of the Senate. The slate needed to be wiped clean for both the Repubic and the Jedi themselves to grow. And frankly every time Skywalker came to Yoda for advice Yoda gave him horrible advice. He didnt do this with Kenobi just with Skywalker.I do appreciate your speaking on Kenobis failures as a teacher. Ive felt for quite awhile now that Kenobi wasnt necessarily a poor teacher he just wasnt ready to teach yet. Theres a certain lack of respect between the two which I believe stems from how close in age they are. Skywalker was only... what  years younger than Kenobi? If even?

Tarkin is really interesting can get a bit dry from time to time but its overall pretty solid. The Bane Trilogy is no longer canon but still quite good.

I get that the TV show humanized them but from the movies alone it was hard to feel the gravity of the war when most of the deaths that were shown were clones and robots. It is also hard for me to grasp the supposed cunning brilliance of Palpatines plan when it was shown to entirely rely on nearly every character to act illogically and stupidly countless times a plan that completely falls apart if just one character acted like a real person or if basic logic was applied.Fantastic idea poor execution....which just so happens to also be my four word summary of the entire prequel trilogy. ,StarWars,d5t1z0f,2,t5_2qi4s

The Separatists were only following Palps through Dooku and Dookus apprentices. As long as he seems like he was on Palpys side Dookus Separatists wouldnt be wiped out because Palps is trying to prolong the war. Neither side was making any serious headway against the other in a way that would win them the war. If Dooku ever saw a way to outmaneuver both Palpys plans for the Republic and the CIS he could take full control of the Separatists and make serious strikes against the Republic and nobody but Palps would know any different.

8452166,0,t3_4vdofx,TPM Im going to have to with the duel with Maul. Honestly its the only part I can specifically remember that I enjoyed. The music just makes it amazing. Related I also enjoyed ObiWans promise to Anakin at the end you will become a Jedi.AOTC My favorite scene might be the deleted one with Padmes parents. Im not sure why. Or Shmis death and the slaughter of the Sand People  its the first glimpse at Vader. Say what you want about Christensen but he did the pure anger scenes well. ROTS ObiWans and Anakins dialogue throughout the whole opening act Dont worry we are still flying half of a ship Another happy Landing. Second is probably the Luke to Beru Leia to Breha and Bail short moments. There is just so much hope.ANH Leia sassing Tarken and when she takes over her own rescue. ESB I love the battle of Hoth but I gotta go with the Luke V. Vader with the oh so iconic ending. So much emotion ROTJ Just once let me look upon you with my own eyes. The first time I watched Star Wars was the last evening I spent with my father. He was blind and his health wasnt too great but he said every single line of the Luke V. Vader duel and Anakins death.TFA Thats a hard one. BBs and Finns reunion with Poe. Just so much friendship. OR The final scene when Luke is found and the pain is just palpable on Lukes face though depending on how VIII goes I may have to rescind that. Though Hans death gets an honourable mention. I went into it kinda thinking that Han was going to be the one to get ObiWaned but EVERY TIME I WATCH IT I think it maybe wont happen but it does and it is so well done by the actors. ,StarWars,d5y228i,2,t5_2qi4s

While some were excited to have seen the film one was quoted as saying that the character design is weak the leading actress is not beautiful the leading actor is not handsome and action scenes are like children fighting. Although having goodlooking charismatic actors has some importance in the U.S. I dont think Ive ever seen the attractiveness of the actors used in a critique like that quote does.

Audioonly changes with the opening crawl changes being the notable exception.As for all the differences between the mm and mm prints Id call them both original neither is a postrelease modification.  It was simply released in  different audio mixes as a direct result of the mm being only a stereomatrix surround mix while the mm is channel.

Im open to the idea that some powers will pull you closer to one side or the other because of some limit on how they can be used.  Like a healing power can almost only be used to help someone which is almost always a good thing so it makes you more light than dark.So Im fine with Luke knowing dark side abilities he just wouldnt use them often if ever.,StarWars,d76meei,1,t5_2qi4s

Hux should have had a better scene where he abandons the base before it gets destroyed in direct contrast to Tarkins complete belief in the Death Star rather than the SnokeHux convo we got.

If its not Rey saving him from certain death its Han. If its not Han its Rey. If its not either of them its Chewie. How am I supposed to keep liking a character when the plot wont stop acting like he cant even get dressed by himself without nearly getting himself killed?Were not even given a satisfying reason for him turning away from the FO. He sees one of his stormtrooper buddies die in his first battle and then decides hes just going to mow down the rest of his stormtrooper buddies with a smile on his face whooping and cheering the whole time? How the hell did he go from I was raised from childhood to follow orders and fight for the First Order indoctrinated with their ideals and discipline to IM IN CHARGE NOW PHASMA IM IN CHARGE! in at most a handful of days?There are so many interesting things that could have been done with this character concept especially with an actor as talented as John Boyega and all of them were thrown away to turn him into Reys sassy black sidekick stock character.

Choosing to watch a pirated copy of something is someones choice and whether you or I agree or disagree with them doing that we are not entitled to judge people as doing something shady. Say someone wants to try getting into The Clone Wars but doesnt have a subscription to view it legally. I think its actually kind of OK for them to watch the first few episodes free and if they like it to pay for it rather than splashing out on a subscription or a DVDbluray for something they might not even like.

8979561,0,t3_53749j,I relate to Kylo Ren. Bens the child of two galactic heroes and celebrities. His mother is clingy but also doesnt really have time for him. His father is emotionally distant at best and physically absent at worst. Both of his parents pawned him off on his uncle because Uncle Luke has more in common with him. Mom Dad and Uncle Luke conspire to lie to Ben about his grandfather for the first twentyfive years of his life. They dont tell him the truth when he becomes an adult. They wait until the entire galaxy except for Ben knows his familys greatest secret and deepest shame before his mother tries to tell him in essentially an email so she can do some damage control. Because its the biggest news topic in the galaxy  he either learns it from her in a recording or he learns it from HoloNet news and gossip. Somehow Ben finds his way to someone who he thinks doesnt lie to him. Someone who tells him that even though his grandfather was seen as a monster he performed even his most vile deeds for the greater good. Ben has been raised to heroworship his grandfather anyways because Luke does. Now he can heroworship his grandfather without having to justify it. He emulates the grandfather his mother and father and uncle hid from him. He becomes Kylo Ren. Kylo Ren was betrayed by his family. This drove him to the dark side and like his grandfather he struggles with attachment. Snokes plan is to try to force Kylo to do intentionally what Vader did on accident  to cut away everything hes attached to. Kylo Ren succeeded in killing his father but he failed at killing his attachment. He struggles with all his effort to emulate his grandfathers mistakes. It cant be that he isnt powerful enough. Hes got the blood of Anakin Skywalker running through his veins. But he doesnt have Anakins ease Anakins personalityupbringingexperiences. He doesnt have what drove Anakin to become Darth Vader. He sees that as Vaders strength and he doesnt have it. Hes not good enough will never be good enough. He knows something about Reys past. That much is obvious. Hes nervous around her. He visibly drops his guard by removing his helmet. And when he forces his way into her mind she senses what drives him. Youre afraid that youll never be as strong as Darth Vader!So yeah I understand Kylo Ren. I relate because my relationship with my parents wasnt much better than his excluding the patricide of course. That doesnt mean I approve of his choices and actions. It definitely doesnt mean Im emo or trying too hard to pretend to be. It means I see a guy with problems who didnt know how to deal with them so he created a worse set of problems for himself. I relate to Kylo Ren. ,StarWars,d7r7frq,3,t5_2qi4s

8985113,0,t1_d7rcz68,Agreed. But I feel like hed be more of a Starkiller figure. A Grey Jedi. As cold as that mind trick was mind tricks are still not a Dark Side power. Vader confirms this in the new canon graphic novels. The Jedi use it as a little grayarea tool of pacification. But the Sith arent about pacification theyre about domination. Slight difference but big enough to point out I cant see Ezra ever becoming that way. Not yet at least. Im not putting it beyond Ezra completely to use things like Choke or Lightning but its hard for me to see him there just yet.

8995785,0,t1_d7rice7,I have a feeling Episode VIII will explore more of the nature of Light vs Dark. Rey knows pretty much nothing about it so Luke will have to explain it from his perspective now. Plus now we have a Dark side user that is not Sith and his master where we have no idea where his motivations lie.My theory is that the Dark side is not as rigid as the Sith code and the Light side is not as rigid as the Jedi code. I dont think Luke will be a gray Jedi in this sense but I also dont think he will advocate for complete emotional detachment like the Old Republic Jedi. Luke will be a complete advocate for the Light side but hell understand it differently as doing the right thing or something. Something more active rather than passive to match how he interacted with Yoda and ObiWan in V and VI.One minor point to think about is that Luke wanted to convert Vader in VI not to the Light side but what he understood as the Good side. This is mostly semantics but thats sort of a summation of where I think Lukes beliefs lie now and where he will steer Rey.,StarWars,d7t5jwp,1,t5_2qi4s

But things change in our fictional worlds just as they do in real lifegt The fear of loss is a path to the Dark Side. Rejoice for those around us who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy the shadow of greed that is. Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose. we all know who said thisMy first Star Wars was a hardback Dark Force Rising that I found in a trashpile in the rear of my apartment building twenty years ago. Not my first Star Wars book it was my first work from the GFFA. Back then I didnt know the difference between Captain Kirk and Captain Solo between the Executor and the Enterprise. But boy did I learn after. I remember racing to the library to get Heir and then going through every Star Wars book on the shelves and then waiting for the next book to be released that year. It was Darksaber. Yeah. I was excited for Darksaber. There was a Jedi who was a vine or some plant thing. Dorsk moved a fleet. I cringe now but I loved Waru and Hologram Fun World and Centerpoint and Anoth. Ive always loved the World Devastators and Daala everthwarted and Hans grifts on Nar Shadda and Hobbie and Janson messing with each other. I eventually convinced my mom to take me to Blockbuster and she actually tried to sit through ANH with me to make sure it wasnt too bloody or sexy she quit watching got bored when I kept pausing the tape to rattle off every characters backstory from Tales From the Cantina... good times.

Rebels is a little different since its not telling the story of what the characters from Episode  were doing prior to Episode .Fact Rex is not canonically in the OT movies.  Fact We dont currently see Rex anywhere in any stories after Rebels.Literally everyone on the Ghost crew fits the same parameters.  Every episode we dont know if theyre going to kill someone off or not.  Did they introduce Sabines friend so they can work her into the show and kill of Sabine?  Ive noticed Hera wasnt really present in the Season  premiere is she going to take a backseat so people arent as upset when they kill her off?But Rex doesnt fit that category at all.  We know hes going to survive anything the show throws at him just because Dave said he wants Rex to be on Endor.I dont doubt theyll manage to tell a good story but Filoni did a huge disservice to any stories involving Rex because we know hes going to come out of it without a scratch.,StarWars,d820qsq,1,t5_2qi4s

The banter in the beginning of ROTS implies that theyve been through events that have lead to a genuine friendship but the major issue is that we never see these events. There are three films i.e. about six hours to show what Ben truly means with the line and he was a good friend and all the audience gets are a few lines in the final installment that simply serve as an implication of what good friends they have become.This is particularly insulting considering that they spent nearly all their shared time in the previous film bickering and bitching at each other and they barely had any screentime together in the first one. Yes TCW TVseries made their friendship apparent in a welldemonstrated manner but the fact that someone other than the filmmaker has to fill in such an important detail isnt exactly a point in the films favor.,StarWars,d86ntds,1,t5_2qi4s

Everyone on earth deals with racism and sexism in one way or another the people who perpetrate it the people who make excuses for it and the people who refuse to take any position on it one way or another which is in its way the most damaging position of all. Just look at the news these days for a how to on people without shame can use the tensions between the races and genders to empower themselves politically. It makes sense that a wholy unscrupulous person like Palpatine would come up with a convenient scapegoat for all of the Empires problems in order to present himself as the solution. In this case its all of those weird freaky aliens that you good citizen always knew were up to no good deep down. It feels good not to have to be PC and try and conceal how uncomfortable these... things... have always made you feel doesnt it?  You dont really want them deciding your fate do you? Are you going to let them control you because they will unless you join me to stop them! And thats what really makes someone or something bad. No one is bad for bads sake unless you are Palpatine who just doesnt care people have reasons why their badness isnt really bad or at the very least why its justified. One race really IS better then the others its proven by history! or sexism with but men are just better then women its evolution! They never think they are the unreasonable ones no matter how much their attitudes are clearly hurting others. Palpatine was a monster but he had a whole machine around him that allowed him to exist and the people who ran that machine have some sort of story of their own to tell.

Played one character up to level  which was not very far but far enough to get a good sense of the game. In all honesty I thought it was a pretty boring game. The game play mechanics as stated earlier are very boring and repetitive and it just turned into a huge time suck for me. I cant spend  hours at a time playing anything anymore really let alone an MMO.I was a huge fan of the KOTOR games and while the story elements of TOR are great there just wasnt enough there for me to warrant spending money and getting into it seriously.,StarWars,d8p7sh5,8,t5_2qi4s

9279360,0,t3_57hvyh,I see someone already mentioned Plo Koon but Ill add that his technique was also noticeably different from how the Sith do it. The latter is usually a big messy storm used to torture or kill people Plos in the short story in Jedi vs Sith The Essential Guide to the Force is basically a very precise singletarget stun gun. One shot paralyzed a man without harming the little girl he was holding hostage the second shot knocked him out.I know Plos use of lightning has made it into some games that tend to make it look bigger and flashier but I prefer the story version. It feels more like a legitimate alternate form of lightning coming from a different mindset than the Sith but even then the Order was worried about his wellbeing for having used it rather than I want Jedi to do the Palpatine thing too but its fine because reasons.,StarWars,d8s84wp,6,t5_2qi4s

9286055,0,t3_57k6ne,I think Windus thing is he understands cold logic well but not emotional logic. And hes the second in command of the Jedi Order.So when theres a nine year old in front of him hes not thinking our words could make the nine year old distrust us but more he is years above our cut off age for joining could be an issue and the only Master who wants to train him already has a knight and the rest of the Council agreed. Same thing happens in RotS Anakin is unstable and just said that his friend and mentor for the last  years was a Sith Lord. The operation is going to be dangerous anyway and if Anakin is not  committed to taking Palpatine down then bringing him on the mission is a bad idea. But if Windu took emotional logic into account and didnt imply that the Jedi didnt ever trust him he would have seen that leaving Anakin alone to brood would have decreased his stability. ,StarWars,d8t2p1w,1,t5_2qi4s

His goal is not ultimate power but chaos. He sided with the Empire for a time then realized the Empire isnt helping him reach his goals fast enough. He worked alongside the Rebellion as he knew they would be victorious in the long run. He also knew this would allow him to befriend Luke and over years begin to change him. Eventually Luke Han and Leia came to realize Wedge is a dark side user manipulating them the whole time. While helping the New Republic Wedge was actually forging the First Order. He was also seducing Ben to the dark side. Luke and Wedge battled and Luke won. With no experience with a lightsaber Luke gave him a massive gash in the head.

After the Empire fell at the Battle of Jakku the remaining Imperial loyalists splintered. Some fled to the Unknown Regions regrouped and became the First order. Others entrenched themselves in the few remaining areas that the Empire held before Jakku and remained there. The treaty that the New Republic and the Galactic Empire singed was called the Galactic Concordance. Part of what the document did was end the Galactic Civil War but it also confined the Empire to certain regions crippled their ability to form a threatening military and forced them to pay war reparations. Currently not a lot is known about remaining Imperial systems but they still exist and are said to be locked in a cold war of sorts with the New Republic. ,StarWars,d8vaf60,2,t5_2qi4s

He loves Leia he would never leave her.gtAnd especially not for smuggling again he is better than that now. gtLuke is ruined as well.He does what he never would in the OT. Where others saw despair he saw hope.Thats how he saved Anakin and helped him fulfill his destiny.He was supposed to be everything the old Jedi council wasnt.Luke was the last hope after all.gtHe would neither leave his friends just like that remember Cloud City? Luke went rushing there because of his friends being in danger. He wouldnt run off to a remote island with no way of contacting him. Thats just not in his character. gtAnd Leia she fought her war she was supposed to help restore and be a part of the New Republic not go back doing what she was forced to do during the Empire. She was done she now had a life with Han. gtFor the state of the galaxy its also destroyed IMO. Everything is back to how it was in the Original Trilogy.Theres still the Empire and theres still the Rebel Alliance.gtI wished for what youre describing the good guys being the big now The New Republic vs the smaller bad guys The First Order.

It tells us volumes about their relationship and all of that is conveyed just by showing how Vader acts around his master. Theres plenty of things to be inferred there.The fundamental flaw of your argument is that you are assuming that Snoke is the Darth Vader if the sequels. Hes not. Kylo Ren is. Snoke like Palpatine is the behindthescenes manipulator.

9508121,0,t3_5ayfm9,Here is my take.  It took the targeting computers a little to lock on and get a proper firing solution for the vent.  When getting the target lock they have to have the vent lined up somewhat for an extended period of time.  This would make them sitting ducks for the turbo lasers that are all over the surface of the Death Star.The trench leading up to the vent is not defended by turbo lasers.  So a long run up the trench allows the pilots to get a lock with their targeting computer.Fun fact  In the original cut of ANH that was actually Lukes second run at the exhaust port.  During his first run he used the targeting computer and it didnt go in.  He also tells Wedge Get out of here you cant do any more good back there a few minutes before Vader hits him and for no real apparent reason what so ever.  However Wedge just stays flying with him for awhile gets tagged by Vader says Sorry and leaves. If you want to see what Lucas original vision of the trench run was I recommend watching this video.,StarWars,d9l2tyq,3,t5_2qi4s

You have to keep in mind that these are only guesses.   But I would be very angry indeed if they ended IX without addressing every major mystery.  For your Rey problem have you tried Rey as a clone   Its my new personal favorite.   The gist is that the First Order wants to raise an army of Dark Force users and they found Lukes hand made some clones and dropped them off on various desert planets under the supervision of Junk dealers in order to replicate Vaders upbringing.   ,StarWars,dap1i5q,1,t5_2qi4s

9843947,0,t1_daqo29q,Yeah Im a little torn because I both agree with you and disagree with you. I think the tone youre expecting is what the episodic movies have had and will continue to have and if they ever stray from that tone I think a lot of people will be mad. The episodes have always been full of action politics very personal stories about finding yourself Luke Anakin Rey Kylo Ren even Han and a little bit of destiny thrown on top. Mix all this together and you have stories with adventure humor sadness loss intrigue and so on. But Rogue One because its the only nonepisode we have to work with so far has a very different mission. Its telling a story of something we already know happened for a fact in Star Wars spies stole plans to the Death Star. Its not funny its not mystical. Its about a very dangerous plan to infiltrate and steal something heavily guarded. To make this story as bumbly and lighthearted as the episodes would undermine the actual story theyre trying to tell which I think is one thats worth telling. So well have to see in just a week or two what the reviews say. I think itll end up being violent for a Star Wars movie because most of the movie will be action as opposed to scenes of the Jedi council sitting around and talking but not overly violent in general. ,StarWars,daqott3,1,t5_2qi4s

To use your example once the enemy fleet arrives the blockading fleet would detect them and be able to cut off any attempt at sending smaller ships to the planets southern hemisphere to initiate a ground assault. At the very least they could detect the invading ships doing that and direct their troops on the ground to respond accordingly. Basically the blockading fleet doesnt have to spread their ships around the planet in order to prevent an invasion because as soon as any fleet jumps in and starts making moves theyll be able to figure out what the fleet is up to and counter it.,StarWars,db375yo,11,t5_2qi4s

This is how you do a good imperial turned republic character.Elara still acts and talks like an imperial. She slowly decided that the empire wasnt all that it was made out to be in her youth  mostly due to the evil and brutality of the sith and the moral differences with imperial command. She constantly questions her choice along the way and when she meets her old comrades she is sympathetic towards them and tries to convince them to join the republic.

But hopefully after this new Trilogy is over they will start expanding on the background lore more like they did in the Legends universeI suspect this is the biggest reason obviously too much supplemental information about the TFA era could give away reveals that they are saving for the movies.  And if it is true that there is a secret to Reys parentage they may not want to show too much about the postEndor era either.  I imagine that once VIII is released that they will expand out the canon quite a bit.  And then after IX we will get a much larger expansion.,StarWars,db4ub6j,4,t5_2qi4s

Somebody somewhere is going to say that a single reactor discharge from the Death Star rips a whole in reality and transports all those caught in the blast to the netherworld of the Force. This can only happen because the Death Star uses Kyber crystals and they have a special connection to the Force that allows this to happen. Jyn will return when Luke and Rey explore the first Jedi temple and find the reverse Star Wars equivalent to the Veil from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

As far as the Leia issue. She never said what her point of origin is. Vader knows shes a member of the senate and Leia is just trying to make a last ditch excuse to keep from being arrested a diplomatic immunity type argument.

10002151,0,t1_dbb9xru,This might be a stretch but Im wondering if the Dark was intentional. The whole movie is about basically finding Hope. The characters especially Jyn dont really have any hope for the future for most of the movie hence the dark scenes. You start out the Movie in a grey and misty area or kindve a neutral point between light and dark. You could say the darkest moment in the movie marking her lowest point was the scene when her Father dies. Yet from Yavin  Scarif onward the visuals start to get lighter kindve a parallel with the hope Rogue One has that they can get the plans and save the Rebellion. Finally you end Jyn and Cassians story with a fade out of blinding light from the Death Star blast. Symbolic that even though they dont know if they got their message out both truly believed and had hope that they helped stop the Empire.Just spitballing though.,StarWars,dbbb4qw,8,t5_2qi4s

The key is that he doesnt have a Jedi master to properly teach him the ways of the Force.With a Jedi to teach him he wouldnt need to do that at all and he could use a lightsaber as well.

So the Emperor is clearly bad. But was the system itself bad? Could it have redeemed itself with a series of good emperors who continued to enforce order throughout the galaxy?I feel like the Rebels can easily be viewed as a band of Robespierrian terrorists with religious zeal added for fun if one is openminded enough.

10016201,1,t1_dbd3iza,I dont really see your point considering characters like Darth Vader and ObiWan have had pretty significant arcs yet everyone is clamoring for anthology movies for them instead of a Han Solo one. I think its purely because people dont trust Disney with their casting.Let me ask you all this why would Disney hire a person who they werent absolutely confident could portray Han Solo? The backlash would be astronomical. They are aware that the role is sacred. They cast Alden because they believed he could pull it off. Furthermore I think the character of Han Solo is hugely deserving of the anthology treatment. How did he become best buds with Chewie? Did he have any adventures with Greedo? Any romances? Why are people rejecting this potential treasure trove of new Star Wars lore? Is it because they want his past to remain a mystery... for some reason? Is it because they dont trust the Star Wars story group to make a cohesive backstory?Look I absolutely trust the Star Wars story group with Hans backstory. So far they have seamlessly connected the shows with the films. Also Lawrence FUCKING Kasdan is writing the Han Solo film. Theres literally no reason for people to reject this film other than the stupid traditionalist motto of Harrison Ford should be the only person to play Han Solo!!! ,StarWars,dbd51fe,5,t5_2qi4s

When a Rogue died it was a pulpy sorta eh its war this happens. When a Wraith died it tore you up. They had personalities and flaws and hopes and dreams and aspirations. Grinder was a dick but he was admittedly kinda funny and he had his own moral ambiguities with slicing. He didnt deserve to get offed the way he did. Faelyn was constantly trying to prove herself overshadowed by Luke Skywalker being from her home planet and too wrapped up in her own flaws to see how good she was. She also helped pull Myn out of his depression like a champ. Jesmin wasnt given a ton of time but she was nice enough and did her best to help out. She tossed around some flack and she desperately wanted to be more than just someones niece. And Ton... Tin Phannons death will always be the best part of Legends. It didnt go quickly or easily. Its impact didnt end with his funeral pyre. He was that perfect foil to Face and the guilt that he carried around with him in that scar and in his heart. Ton was that pessimistic narcissist that was so deeply depressed but still had so much to give. God damn I need to reread the Wraith Squadron books again. ,StarWars,dbde85m,1,t5_2qi4s

The characters are decently acted and written  nothing spectacular but they dont need to be. The movie is a plotdriven narrative and while the characterizations are minimal they are enough to believably drive the story.

After that is unknown. Theres a shot of Krennic walkin around in the water facing a crash ship and dead Stormtroopers but if you look carefully the skyline is really bright similar to the ending scenes When the Deathstar fires on Scariff and we see Kassian and Jin holding each other.

10101146,0,t1_dbo3fvi,As the story goes the Force Unleashed production staff asked for a Darth name for Starkiller. George Lucas responded that it would make sense and he would be happy to give them one and suggested Darth Icky or Darth Insanious. The developers thought he was joking and sat there in awkward silence waiting for him to say nah just playin but instead George Lucas moved on to discuss other points. The production staff avoided using the names without offending Lucas by saying that they decided to push the name off to the sequel as they felt the character would not have yet earned a Darth title. By the time they pushed out the sequel several years had passed and between personnel changeover and George Lucass memory the names were forgotten and thus avoided entirely.For all intents and purposes he wasnt joking and he had a bit of a history with suggesting names for characters which were often quite ridiculous. Lucasarts once developed a game called Fractured which was based on a unique IP unrelated to Star Wars etc. During the development process the team settled on the name Mason Briggs for the main character as part of focus group testing etc. Sometime after the game was previewed and the protagonists name was made public George Lucas came down to Lucasarts to inspect what they were working on and give some creative input on their projects something he did periodically. So he watched a demo of Fractured and he loved it... EXCEPT he hated the name Mason Briggs and instead suggested that they name the main character B.J. Dart because the character darted around quickly when he moved. The team thought he was joking but he was deathly serious but they were all like no way are we naming our protagonist B.J. Dart so they reformed the focus groups and took Lucas input etc. and eventually renamed Mason Briggs to Jet Brody. Coincidentally or not George Lucas has a son named Jett.,StarWars,dbo6xvs,3,t5_2qi4s

Rebels and Rogue One certainly show that Lucasfilm is willing to still deal with the Prequels as part of the canon.gtIm not ignoring it Im questioning how it can both take so much training to learn but be quick enough to learn before you fade into The Force.How do we know that the training was quick? We know from various canon sources the most obvious one being Mortis in TCW that the Force can alter perception of time. For all we know Anakin might have spent an eternity perfecting the art.Also we learn from TCW how Yoda learned to become a Force ghost and its pretty difficult.gtWell then as daughter of The Chosen One Leia may have unique circumstances herself. If Luke can hear from dead ObiWan in the first movie without getting much more than a few days training and Leia can kind of see them at the end of RotJ then it stands to reason shes special too.Being able to see a Force ghost isnt the same as being able to become one though. Ive always thought that Force ghosts can choose to reveal themselves to anyone with possible restrictions based on Forcesensitivity and level of Force training.,StarWars,dbrdq6q,1,t5_2qi4s

Thus just as Galen and Orson have a history that stretches back many years so does the Rebel leadership.Thus the general may well know Galen from his previous work. He knows how smart Galen is. And just as Galen has managed to fool Krennic for so long so also Galens actions have convinced the Rebels that hes completely dedicated to the Imperial warmachine.Mon Mothma is a Senator and she essentially wants to haul Galen before a senate subcommittee to answer for his actions. The general on the other hand finds it far more practical to cripple the Empire by taking out a strategic asset and probably thinks the politicians are being too weakhanded in how they deal with the Empire.At least that is how I interpreted that whole scene.,StarWars,dbwn58d,10,t5_2qi4s

All in all it felt like they focused more on saying hey look at all these old characters and references to the original trilogy more than progressing the story in an interesting direction.

The blacks in TFA are richer deeper. Theres a stronger contrast overall too and most importantly it had that trademark Star Wars texture that was missing from Rogue One. Dark is not the same as washed out. I think they went for that look intentionally because it does evoke a sense of bleakness but imo and i know im just some shmuck on the internet it was a bad call.

The first time we see the Force used in an unambiguously physical way is when Luke pulls his lightsaber out of the snow in ESB.The two questionable cases are Force choke But is Vader telekinetically squeezing peoples throats or is he reaching into their minds and making them think they cant breathe? Ben distracting the stormtroopers near the tractor beam controls But does Ben actually produce a sound down the hallway or does he make them think they hear a sound?

10191535,0,t1_dbz9ioc,I obviously am just a fellow fan theorizing but Im not sure Im on board with positive emotion giving power to the dark side.  Let me offer two pieces of evidence I think support this view Kylo Ren.  His positive emotions towards his family are literally weakening him in the dark side and seducing him towards the light and he has to force himself to veer hard in the other direction to prove himself to his teacher. Darth Vader.  This one is from Legends but I think it was a really interesting view into Vaders life.  Theres a scene in Shadows of the Empire where he is meditating in his castle and focuses his pain and anger enough to temporarily heal his lungs and skin just through sheer power.  Sadly the joy and relief of being able to breathe deeply again shakes his control over the dark side and his wounds immediately reopen.  He is never able to feel happy and still be powerful enough in the dark side to maintain his healing.,StarWars,dbz9mie,3,t5_2qi4s

TFA is like a bimbo whereas R is a beautiful demure woman. TFA tries too hard to look and feel like SW whereas R sticks to the formula from the previous OT albeit bumpy and creates a gritty and exciting atmosphere without having to try too hard. R doesnt feel forced and it flows nicely.Now the movie isnt perfect but its the best thing weve had in the SW universe since ROTJ and maybe ROTS  still need to rewatch.

Heres another video detailing what Ahsoka would have done in those upcoming seasons be aware that this video contains Rebels Season  spoilers.While I fully recommend watching the whole series if you dont want to or dont have the time please check out this list I made with episodearc rankings of relevance.

10210343,1,t1_dc1chxf,I really want to get into the mind of someone who prefers the prequels over TFA... The second godfather has pretty much the same plot and a lot of the same dramatic elements as the original film and yet its sometimes considered the superior one because the emotional punch of the film goes further.The OG trilogy largely just meshed a lot of influences together from flash Gordon like serials to the characters and plots of akira kurosawa films like hidden fortress. I can definitely agree that TFA borrowed alot and suffered as a result but find people who say the prequels have anything to offer besides art direction and window dressing baffling. Lucas didnt take any chances in the filmmaking of that film at all  theres a clich and horribly flawed romance completely artifical and goofy battle scenes another couple of light sabre fights in cg rendered factories no interesting character arcs or choices for obi wan or anakin or any of the major characters...I just dont get it. I mean hats off to the art designers and sfx guys they did a great job but the director writer is meant to move his audience emotionally take them on an adventure? Not just walk us through some mac  rendered deviant art and dance with glow sticks....if he had maybe been more a producer figure and bring in new talent for the script and directing the film as he did with empire I think the prequels could of been great theres so much potential there but I as they stand I cant find anything remotely interesting about them...maybe I am taking crazy pills....,StarWars,dc1eec5,1,t5_2qi4s

Lukes mission throughout the OT changes from avenging his father in ANH to saving him in ROTJ. He accomplishes that Vader turns to the light side by the end of the film i.e. he returns to who he really is Anakin Skywalker.By forcing Hayden Christensen into the end of the movie it completely cheapens this. It suggests that Lukes accomplishments and Anakins redemption didnt happen even though we know they just did. If the original intent was as you suggest that the force ghost appears as when Anakin turned to the dark side the filmmakers could have done that in the original cut but they chose not to i.e. they could have found a young actor to play Anakin Skywalker in the scene they did not.

10261861,0,t3_5mvyp5,Most of these just cant work. Not because of plot or because it ends a duel too fast but because in canon every Jedi and Sith produces some sort of force field around them that counters Force attacks. Thats why people dont get force pushed or force pulled or force choked all the time in all the fights. Pretty much the only time you can get a good force attack on someone in a duel is when you create an opening by having a good counter to an attack which then allows you to push or pull or whatever force move you want to do,StarWars,dc78kll,1,t5_2qi4s

10261994,0,t3_5mxq09,Honestly I dont find either satisfying. The chips make for something of a gap in logic when it comes to Anakin for all intents and purposes a Jedi leading a battalion of clones and triggering Order  to get them to kill Jedi without killing him. It also makes it seem strange that Rex and co could actively prevent themselves from carrying out Order  with knowledge gained beforehand why didnt they spread that knowledge to other clones or even Jedi? But complete free will doesnt makes sense either thered be hundreds of Jedi escaping thanks to commanders who just couldnt bring themselves to follow through on the order.The weird thing is we already had the explanation given to us in Episode II theyve been altered at the genetic level to make them completely obedient. The trick is that its not obedient to their Jedi commanders but to the ultimate source of authority  the Supreme Chancellor. I would have written it as a compulsion just as the chips were. Once the order is given they are forced to obey it due to programming conditioned deep into their subconscious from the moment of their creation. And by the same token when Palpatine orders the st not to kill Vader they have no choice but to accept that order and carry it out even as they carry out the order to kill all Jedi.You could then have a few clones like Rex who have developed exceptionally strong willpower resist the compulsion. I guess things inside their brains make them do it is just easier to explain to kids though. So I prefer a mix of the two. No physical chip nothing to dig out or detect and Order  is just ostensibly one of a number of contingency orders but when Palpatine gives them an order they follow it with the same compulsion and perhaps even lack of lucidity that we see the chip produce in TCW. You explain why the commanders could possibly turn on their close friends and you build on what we told in AotC and you avoid some of the plot messiness that comes about from Rex and co having to physically learn about and dig out their chips.,StarWars,dc7944d,25,t5_2qi4s

On the other hand children love WWF and the movie was made for children so maybe flashy ridiculous mock fights were a good choice.Watch a bit of fencing from Rio on that tiny strip of land with all kinds of limitations there is a ton more action happening than in any of the open world fights in the prequels.It would be interesting to see a more brutal fight like the Terminator  Arnold and the T fights or the Alien versus Predator or like the OP suggested Bournelike in which it feels like two people trying to hurt each other and there is a raw physicality and the environment is damaged like the bathroom first  kill scene with Bond... but these are DISNEY movies well now they are anyways and the target demographic will always include little kids so I doubt our bloodlust for gnarly lightsaber battles will ever be sated.,StarWars,dc8hg95,0,t5_2qi4s

Luke tried to train a new generation of Jedi and failed he tried to train his nephew who was too old by traditional standards but more importantly had attachment to his family. Assuming he learned from this mistake it makes sense that hed leave his kid at a young age and isolate himself and let the force bring new Jedi to him.

And it seems that because he hadnt taken a break for quite a while his Division HQ reluctantly signed off on it. Or something like that. But heres where it gets interesting The stations data records show that he took an unauthorised backup of the plans in his droid. They dont know how he did it without any red flags being raised at the time but krennic killed him the very night he got back to station and the place was kind of a huge mess after the rebel attack so I guess no one pursued it.

10351815,0,t1_dch0f0f,TOR would be a lot better if it hadnt adopted the MMO style combat and instead had a Jedi Academy style combat if not an Exanima or Warband style. Those three games have the best sword melee fighting Ive ever seen. No other game that I know of competes. Exanima is physics based so you apply the momentum in your swings its tricky to learn but once youve got the hang of it then any other melee game will seem cheap in comparison. Youre able to control which direction you swing how hard where you want to hit youve complete body range you can hit your opponent from head to toe. You can stab as well.Warband is rather well known it also allows you to control your swings and to a certain extent how hard you hit. But Exanima still blows it out of the water.Jedi Academy is also rather well known. I still play it today on EFF or JOF and enjoy dueling Im going to be sad when JAs dwindling community finally fizzles out... dueling people is a completely different experience than dueling AI. Jedi Academy also allows you to control your swings and has different stances for hard hitting or fast and softer strikes. Exanima would fit TOR the best due to the camera being similar to TOR.Here is a video of some combat in Exanima   MMO style combat where its just click click click and an automatic animation plays while you stand there is the most boring combat system ever... No personal skill required at all. The only way you can win that is if you have better armor or have a stronger character or a healer to help you. In Jedi AcademyWarbandExanima its all about personal skill you armorweaponcharacter isnt what determines the fight its your personal experience in the melee combat of the game that determines whether youll beat your opponent or not.,StarWars,dchfspt,16,t5_2qi4s

10353683,0,t1_dchn1cp,Ok. I feel like youre a troll at this point for calling me out for being condescending when youre the one who opened by asking me if I knew what a pun is. If you dont see how thats condescending I dont know what to say to you. Youre right that strictly speaking a double entendre is not necessarily a pun because it isnt necessarily in a joking context however I said it was a type of pun because you very clearly thought that puns had to be the misuse of a word when that is not the case. gtA pun uses the incorrect word because it sounds the same or the wrong definition of a word. You  gtDo you know what a pun is? Also you lol.So yes I made an oversimplification. A double entendre can be a pun is a better way of saying that. BUT thats not even relevant here. The question is whether or not Vader spoke a pun. Now your argument seems to be that he wasnt making a joke which is ridiculous and not even the reason why you thought it wasnt a pun to begin with. You are the one who decided to correct someone for thinking it was a pun and then be super condescending to me. You clearly didnt understand that a pun could be exploiting two meanings of a word until just now. I am not going to argue whether or not Vader made a joke with you because he clearly made that word choice deliberately and you have been thoroughly unpleasant to speak to. Youre done man. Anyone reading this can see what happened here and what the objective truth is. Youre right I misspoke about double entendres because they dont have to be in a joking or deliberate context. I can admit that. Please admit at least to yourself that you tried to correct people on the definition of a pun and were super condescending to them when you misunderstood what they entailed. Youll be less angry that way.,StarWars,dchnfe9,3,t5_2qi4s

10381255,0,t1_dc8dwnp,gtThe Sith dont exist in the OT. It is a concept exclusive to the prequelsDestroy Vader and defeat Emperor the two darkside users at the head of the imperial hierarchy responsible for eradicating the jedi. doesnt change a thing in my argument.gtBoth of these were not really in play when the original Star Wars was made they were added later as evidenced by the relatively small role Vader has in ANH and how Leia is written to be Lukes love interest in ANH and how she kisses him in Empire. Everything else Obi Wan doesnt tell Luke is from the prequels.Im referring to the OT in its original context which means all three movies in the original trilogy not just the original Star Wars. The original Star Wars movie is different altogether I agree but since the critiques are being levied on the prequels solely and not just any Star Wars movie post its important to look at it in the full context.So in the context of the ORIGINAL TRILOGY as a whole ObiWan lies aboutDarth Vader killing AnakinAnakin wanting Luke to have his lightsaber when he was older Anakin was not even aware of the existence of Luke as Luke was hidden when he was bornLeiaPretty much everything surrounding Lukes birth and Vaders origins is in the context of the OT as a whole fudged up by Ben in Episode IV. So I have no clue why people are getting upset that the prequels didnt show a loving Anakin saving his lightsaber for his son when it would have actually clashed wthe continuity given in ROTJ. gtAgain youre talking about stuff that is introduced in the prequels. In the OT Yoda was Bens Jedi Master. Its not that Ben was lying to Luke its simply horrible continuity keeping.No Im saying that the story created in the prequels is not actually that contradictory wthe OT if you look at it as a whole and arent just seeking for inconsistencies the prequels renditioning of events may have with your fandom. The point of the OP is to suggest that the backstory Lucas created in the prequels actively undermines statements made in the OT and makes the characters in them look ridiculous and out of place which simply is not true. Its just a scenario of fans being upset that their specific vision isnt what exactly happened theyre free to think that just like Star Wars fans may have been upset to see that Anakin and Vader were the same person that Palpatine was a darkside user as opposed to a puppet controlled by governors and that Vader was the sole darkside practitioner as a fallen Jedi but its just silly to say no internal logic exists in ESB and ROTJ just because it went contra to those initial perceptions.gtSo at the time of writing Vader was simply some dude that betrayed and murdered Lukes father who knew about Luke and who wanted him to have his lightsaberWhat exactly is your point? Again unless youre upset that ESB and ROTJ also engaged in horrible continuity keeping no point consistently evoking how the original intent of the original Star Wars was contra to that of episodes  and .gtI mean Ben teaches Luke to let go of his actions and focus on his feelings let the Force flow through him. Tell that to a little kid with a lightsaber and hell probably end up cutting someone or himself while clumsily playing with it.Actually its nothing like this. Its wellestablished in TPM that most Jedi are trained from infancy or early childhood and those kids are around age  or so. Therefore its assumed they have a lot of discipline as students already.Like granted I admit there is excessive fan service Chewie and Yoda whyyyyy and certainly lapses of continuity but nowhere near the disaster some fans like to put it.,StarWars,dcks2le,0,t5_2qi4s

10388408,0,t3_5oo1ia,Kenobi Story Concept Open on Tatooine. Kenobi is speaking with Lukes family. Kenobi heads into town and is in a Bar listening to chatter when he hears the empire is searching for remaining Jedi traitors. Kenobi is noticed and has to flee Tatooine to get the empire away from Luke.  Kenobi feels the presence of his old master QuiGon. He finds an old jedi temple and meets QuiGons force ghost. Gui talks to him about one last task Kenobi must complete before he can watch over Luke. Kenobi must find Ashoka Tano. When he finds her it is after she she has adopted her two new white lightsabers and is running from the empire. Kenobi explains what happened with Anakin and his kids and they discuss the fall of the Jedi order and Ashoka comments that maybe this was balance maybe the jedi has grown too large and caused imbalance. They work to defeat the empire and end up running into commander Cody. After that Kenobi comments that maybe both sides are wrong. Introducing the concept of Grey Jedi.  Kenobi and Ashoka then meet with Bail Orgona and discussion sparks about maybe this should be the end of the Jedi and Sith as they are the galaxy is in need of real change. Then it moves to talk of a real rebellion. Kenobi leaves saying he cannot be part of it his duty is elsewhere. I like the idea of seeing Kenobi who was very loyal and trusting to the Jedi meeting with Ashoka who abandoned the cause and having them discuss what had happened what it means for force users. I feel like it also fits in with what is happening with Star Wars currently where we are seeing it move more towards the idea that the force is everywhere not just with Jedi and Sith. It also sets up the Rebels storyline with Ashoka and Orgona. Edit so within the Ashoka Novel it kinda tells what happens so this story line wouldnt happen. Instead after kenobi hears quigon in the book he could set off on a journey to find and aid ashoka while she and bail are beginning to rebellion. Then have the story follow them coming to a new understanding of the force and becoming more grey jedi. ,StarWars,dcllad5,2,t5_2qi4s

10390682,0,t1_dclrzo4,Now that one comes down to personal preference. There is no question that ESB is objectively both a better movie and a better Star Wars than TPM.But for me it just has to be the Maul fight. It is for me one of the best fights ever all forms of mdia included. There is no fight in Star Wars thats even close. It does have faults its ending being a major one for example though.Essentially Im a sucker for worldbuilding fights and comedy and TPM delivers the best out of all star wars movies on all three again french dub helps a lot in making Jar Jar and gungans in general bearable.I have to say though that Rogue one makes a very solid case for itself its probably the best Star Wars in terms of worldbuilding and it has very good comedy. It only lacks a proper fight.Note that any action is not a proper fight most of the action in R is just an fx showcase  its entertaining but thats all it is and aspires to be. The only proper fight scenes R has are the blind monk scene on Jheda the revenge for his death by his machine gun friend and the Vader scene. Of wich one is mediocre revenge scene one is ok monk scene and one is exceptional Vader scene but all three are both too short and two onesided to contend with the Maul fight or even the OT fights.,StarWars,dclul1m,3,t5_2qi4s

10394152,0,t1_dcm87ay,Ventress backstory is the biggest one I can remember though Im sure theres some mental gymnastics that can be done to reconcile that.I seem to remember Illum being depicted rather differently in the  series. The destruction of the crystal cave in the  series isnt as much of an issue since you could just say the cave in the  series is a different one.Grievous in general is depicted differently more in line with his ROTS depiction than his CW depiction and gets his cough shortly before the Battle of Coruscant in the  series while he has it from the getgo in the  series set earlier.Assuming the placement of CW within CW is correct theres continuity issues with ship designs ROTSstyle Jedi starfighters being introduced prior to the beginning of CW which uses AOTCstyle ships and if you shift it CW any earlier you have the continuity issue of Anakins scar and hair though his hair is a bit of an issue either way its ROTSlength when Padme sees his scar for the first time but in CW its somewhat shorter. Of course all that is cosmetic stuff that can be more or less ignored by the viewer.Im also pretty sure that the battle on Mon Cala in CW is implied to be the first battle on that world in the war while CW shows a battle on Mon Cala much earlier.Thats all I can think of right now but Im sure there are more.

10421638,0,t1_dcpcj5r,One thing I hate about the prequels is it took this vast universe they created in the OT and made it feel smaller somehow. This seems impossible because of how much expansion they did in the prequels of the Jedi temple and everything. But the constant visits to tattoine and all of the cameos like chewbacca CPO RD and anakin skywalker in episode . In my opinion anakin didnt need to be in episode  but thats a whole nother argument. All these cameos and returns to planets from the OT makes this huge galaxy seem like its only filled with these  or so main characters and everyone else is just there.In the force awakens there are two great scenes where an original track plays loudly synonymous with something epic. For example when Rey calls Lukes lightsaber with the force for the first time and it lands in her hand and kylo ren and rey both look shocked and surprised as that epic theme weve all heard so many times before.The second and probably one of my favorite scenes in VII is when Kylo ren is talking to darth vader and he gets up and you see the damaged helmet revealing who he was talking to and you hear just one faint section of the imperial march and its just such a perfect moment. Its the perfect moment to put that track in the movie and it was awesome that there was a spot to put it in the movie.I loved all of the originals and TFA and I would certainly put all  of them above rogue one and the prequels. The prequels are definitely fun but in terms of being good movies they all are flawed so much more than the originals and it just stands out so much more here. Jar jar binks midichlorians and frog leaping yoda are all things I didnt need to see in star wars movies.I thought at first yeah your comment is long and then I looked at mine when I was done lolEDIT Nevermind yours got longer haha,StarWars,dcpd1ay,1,t5_2qi4s

They only went there for part of the story. gtand all of the cameos like chewbacca CPO RD and anakin skywalker in episode . . Chewbacca while a little bit of a stretch was okay by me. Star Wars has plenty of cameos from known characters.. CPO and RD werent cameos.. Anakin wasnt a cameo in Episode .gtAll these cameos and returns to planets from the OT What? Tatooine is literally the only OT planet to return in the PT besides Alderaan for a short scene to set up for ANH.gtmakes this huge galaxy seem like its only filled with these  or so main characters and everyone else is just there.The OT was no different.

10457764,0,t1_dct0btl,gt Im hoping The Last Jedi is just referring to what Yoda called Luke before he passed.That actually makes a lot of sense. He was called the last but that could simply be considered of the old way so to speak. The force will continue to make children force sensitive so the ways of the force will never be truly lost meaning the Jedi and Sith will always be fighting to varying degrees. But Luke was the last learn under ObiWan and Yoda the last surviving masters of the Jedi counsel whos protection has lasted at least as far back as the old republic.There is still Kanan and Ezra whos fates are undisclosed by VII I like to think they were at the other end of the Galaxy doing stuff but Kanan never reached the rank of Knight until over a decade later and since the book A New Dawn good book by the way is canon most of that was avoiding the force no mater what. Those two have a more unorthodoxcowboy way of fighting mixing in blasters and tools. I consider this and how they learn from the neutral party Bendu at clearly being on the Light Side but not exactly functioning as a new Jedi Order.,StarWars,dcthqku,14,t5_2qi4s

Where are you getting your definitions from?gtRemember that Luke killed presumably a shitload of other prisoners onboard the stationInadmissable. You have no information on that one way or the other. For all we know Leia was the only prisoner on the Death Star. gtand other staff who really have nothing to do with the Death Star aside from the fact that theyre stationed there.What does this even mean? What are you talking about? If theyre stationed on the Death Star they obviously have something to do with it. Most militaries are not in the habit of stuffing their bases with useless people. Any personnel manning the Death Star would be military and as above therefore acceptable targets in a time of war.And again you have no concrete information on this. Every single person we see walking the halls of the Death Star in ANH is wearing a uniform. Unless you can cite me a source that specifically says there were civilians on board the Death Star your claim is unfounded.gtA New Hope promotes specific terrorism contrasting the bad terrorism of using the Death Star to blow up Alderaan with the good terrorism of Luke blowing up the Death Star.Neither of these things are acts of terrorism.I dont believe we have an apt term for what the Death Star blowing up Alderaan is.

I suppose they could keep Luke around in a minimal role but I would think they would want to close out his story. Obviously we have to get through VIII and IX first but are they going to do another sequel trilogy?   Obviously its a huge cash cow for Disney and they wouldnt want to let the brand die but I would almost prefer if they did an Old Republic prequel trilogy that is removed from the main Skywalker saga. ,StarWars,dcxwneq,1,t5_2qi4s

10574939,0,t3_5rcy05,Well in my opinion its because he is seems to be obviously a sith or dark force user and the Sith have always had rule of two so the logical conclusion Palpatine didnt successfully kill Pelagius.

10638394,0,t3_5s7c4l,I think the first titles in the trilogies are best. They dont give as much away about the plot of the movie  theyre more subtle in their foreshadowing of what is to come. And they foreshadow the rest of the trilogy instead of just what happens with the movie. I think AOTC and ESB are very similar attempts at titles. They both just say what happens at the end of the film. ROTJ and ROTS like Return of the King just give too much away I think. ,StarWars,ddd9or6,2,t5_2qi4s

I agree with you that people are judging one work the films using information from other works extended universe. In this scenario intent is the biggest factor. What was the filmmakers intent? I feel it does them a disservice to negate what they were trying to do by applying a bunch of stuff made up aftertheact to their film. Windu had his color because thats what the filmmakers wanted not because of what some other unrelated future author wanted. People go back and reinterpret the films with this new meaning which is not what the makers intended. At this point one could just come up with whatever headcanon they want and it would be as equally unintended. So someone who explains his color by saying that Windu straddled the dark side is equally as valid as someone saying it is because a space unicorn sith trampled him when he was a child and his resulting bruises were purple and thus he chose purple to never forget and it would be on equal level because both those things werent intended by those telling us the story.

With such an arc and after what happened with that character  the love of his life seemingly  I doubt hed ever move on especially after what happens to Anakin and Padme and his continued commitment to the Jedi Order.His sole purpose on Tatooine has to be to protect Luke and anything else would lead us to question his offer at the end of III and his presence in IV in my opinion.Again just an opinion and Ill be the first to hold up their hands and admit I was wrong but currently I dont think theres enough evidence to make a strong case for it let alone explain it in less than  minutes onscreen.,StarWars,ddevsmb,2,t5_2qi4s

He grew up with a Jedi Master as an uncle and there is no way that Luke didnt start training him early on.  Furthermore it is firmly established that upon leaving Lukes training Ren was skilled enough to defeat all of Lukes other students and at least evade Luke himself.  That speaks to a very high level of skill.  Perhaps Snoke has more training in the Dark Side for him but in terms of raw combat ability Ren should already be well trained.I could buy him being shot holding him back if there was any indication of it in the fight itself.  There is no evidence of him favoring one side him wincing in pain when hit there loss of function of any of his limbs or any other sign of a specific injury.  Instead he simply fights poorly.  The only time that any note is drawn to the wound during the fight scene is him pounding it before the fight.  This looks exactly like he is attempting to enhance the pain for the purpose of increasing adrenaline flow and further connecting himself to the Dark Side.  This provides nothing but a positive benefit to him and no indication of the wound being a hindrance is shown.,StarWars,ddh4gry,1,t5_2qi4s

All of those things contributed to TFAs lack of intrepidity.At the same time while I love cool new starships and designs as much as anyone good storytelling and characters mean more to me and if Disney were to focus a little less on things that make great toys in deference to making better films Id be okay with that.,StarWars,ddnct7u,4,t5_2qi4s

We also dont know what degree of legal autonomy the Jedi are given. Perhaps Windus actions were legal perhaps not. Anakin implied it wasnt but we dont actually know that.

So they definitely had a better understanding of the Endor forest than the Stormtroopers. They used guerilla tactics to catch the troops off guard. The element of surprise shouldnt be underestimated. This also plays into their familiarity with the environment. While the weaponary they used was primitive traps such as the logs countered the ATSTs quite well. Ewoks are small creatures which makes them difficult to spot. The Stormtroopers probably had no idea what was hitting them half the time.  Dont forget the Rebels!,StarWars,ddutxmi,1,t5_2qi4s

The Organas could still take Leia and make her a princess and Luke could still get the shit end of the stick and be a dirt farmer. It could either be that Anakin never knew Padme was pregnant in the first place or that Palpatine lies and tells Anakin that the kids are dead so that he is solely focused on doing evil shit.

I mean that is the basics of Star Wars right there. Thats from ANH the very first one made.  So saying that Force corrupted his mind and what not is valid. You are literally denying an integral part of the Star Wars galaxy. Dont tell me that Force is bs when thats what Star Wars is all about.And that was the point about his fall. He fell to the dark side all for nothing. He expected glory and everlasting life with his wife and it didnt happen. Thats what makes his character so tragic.

Attack of the Clones  the climax of the film is a massive battle featuring you guessed it clones.Revenge of the Sith  Palpatine successfully gains a new more powerful apprentice exterminates the Jedi Order and assumes control albeit temporarily of the galaxy. A New Hope  a new force user emerges and the Rebel Alliance brings hope to the galaxy by destroying the Death Star.The Empire Strikes Back  two hours of watch the three heroes from the last movie get their asses kicked by the bad guys!Return of the Jedi  could either be referring to Luke completing his training or the fact that Anakin is redeemed in the end either way this is the only film of the saga that has a title that could be argued as having a level of ambiguity at this point.The Force Awakens  The force has been largely dormant since Lukes selfimposed exile.

There are a ton of these inconsistencies and it is part of what ruins the prequels for me. I loved the idea of Jedi Knights being this almost secret society like The Knights Templar that had been secretly guarding the republic and hid in the shadows thought to be an ancient religion. The prequels scrapped this and placed their temple in the middle of one of the most densely populated planets. Which is why Han now seems stupid for not believing in jedi or the force along with everyone else. Im not here to start a prequel debate but that cant be denied.

They fight with the same style they get stuck doing the same moves there are at least  or  moments I can think of off the top of my head where they are doing the same thing at the same time cancelling each other out.

The Force allows people to do a bunch of things see the future react more quickly jump higher influence people feel emotions over interstellar distances persist after death.To me the sisters represent an expansion of Force powers and a weakening of the universe. The limits of the Force are continually eroded and you end up with a magic system that does whatever the writer wants it to do at that point in time. Rather than the witches relying on some special illusions or mind suggestions they straight up use potions and magic to do things weve never seen before. I hate it.Its not hat Im grumpy about exploring what the Force can do either  on the contrary thats what I think the films should be doing to a far greater extent. I didnt love the Mortis arc either but I love the concept. But the witches are not my Star Wars and I reject them from my head canon. Star Wars should not do everything I even think cloaking is going too far. There should be physical limits to the Star Wars universe just as we have limits.

10977686,0,t3_5wq2a4,I do feel as though that there needed to be more in the game but what there is I enjoy. And some of the arguments against it make little sense to me. The lack of a campaign story mode being a major crime for a battlefront game for example. Battlefronts original story mode was a glorified string of multiplayer objectives that werent even canon in the Legends continuity. Basically it was Titanfall s storymode but even less canon so why people are upset about there being no storymode is beyond me.Another one that makes little sense to me is when I see people angry about the lack of maps and modes when they were abundantly clear in the marketing what the game would and would not have. Mind you that doesnt mean that I wouldnt enjoy more maps and modes but some people act like they were lied too.Overall I find the hate the game gets to be excessive. It was a skeleton in terms of content but I found it to be a solid skeleton with the promise of potential for future games.,StarWars,decaq7s,3,t5_2qi4s

11004234,0,t3_5x34ph,Ok.  Everyone speculating about Vong.  Lets have a talk about the Vong.  There is no story that needs to be told there yet.  The Vong existed because EU got stale and there were only so many stories you could tell about Imperial Remnants.  So the EU introduced a brand new species from another galaxy far far away expanding the Star Wars universe.  Vong challenged and changed the understanding of the force.  Current canon.  We are in a state of REtelling everything between ROTJ and TFA as well as between ROTS and ANH.  There is much that is unknown.  We are still fleshing out key concepts like the force.  As well as the Empires rise fall and aftermath. There are now countless stories that need to be told without introducing an EU conceit that was meant to expand the known Star Wars universe. Anything related to the Unknown Regions will most likely by supporting supplementing explaining the origins of the First Order the mysterious power Palpatine senses the observatories both from Empires End and  dare I say it  Snoke.  Theres no room right now for Vong.  Personally Im way more interested in the above which are NEW stories than warming over and rehashing OLD EU stories like the Vong.That being said Yay Thrawn!   ,StarWars,defarad,36,t5_2qi4s

They dont usually die as the armor is made to so you can survive to fight another day. Also there are breaks in the armor so you can have natural movement of your joints otherwise you couldnt run or bend limbs or anything. So those weak points in the armor is where the rocks and spears the Ewoks use is where the stormtroopers are getting killing from.

Very good show BTW more than two hours of great entertainment.He talked about when he got the gig they drove him to Pinewood and he saw them filming the Darth Vader scene.  THAT scene.  He said the four and a half weeks to compose was very challenging but hey its Star Wars.  It was easy to find inspiration he said.We were in the alley behind the theater waiting for the garage to open while they had the stage door open to load the equipment truck.  I saw him he saw me amp the kids and came over for that photo.  He told them they should pick up a musical instrument and practice every day cause music is an important part of our lives.  He was very gracious you can see that in the photo.Later on I looked at his film credits and practically shit when I saw he composed The Incredibles.

So we know Jedi are not above lying their asses off when it serves their purpose.At best the Force can be used as insight to gather hard facts to present to non Force Users. Just saying The Force tells me x is the case wont cut it.Which is why Windus actions in Revenge of the Sith was wrong on many levels. Non Jedi wont understand why being a Sith Lord is a bad thing. To outsiders its just a different religion. Without supporting evidence they played right into Palpatines hands.

11239222,0,t1_df5eym0,Comparable but definitely a different game.  Xwing is a deathmatch whereas Armada is objectivebased.  Certainly killing the shit out of your opponent usually not always results in winning the objective too but its relatively uncommon in most cases to table an opponent in Armada.Armada requires significantly more planning ahead and prediction of the flow of the game owing to the command dial mechanic.  A ship executes commands to do things like repair and change speed but those commands are planned out in advancein some cases half the game in advance.  So you have to predict which ship you think is going to take the brunt of the enemy fire and plan to repair it well ahead of time.Xwings stack of preset maneuvers templates are replaced with a single adjustable maneuver tool.  You can adjust the yaw of your maneuver on the fly but are constrained within a certain set of limitations based on the particular ships characteristics and its current speed.  And remember you can only change speed if you have the command queued up to do so which significantly limits your agility if youre not careful.I could go on but those are kind of the biggest differences off the top of my head.  Armada is definitely a slowerpaced game requiring a little bit more patience and foresight than Xwing and lacks the lets throw it on the table and bang out a game or two advantage of Xwing.  On the other hand bringing to fruition a victory two hours in the making is pretty sweet. ,StarWars,df5y6ym,7,t5_2qi4s

11250539,0,t1_df6qt27,One thing to keep in mind is that Star Wars space combat does not play by the same rules as a traditional wet navy. gt Youre not wrong but Star Wars ships in general have a poor armament layout. As far as I can tell there is no firing position that allows an ISD for example to fire more than half of its armament at an enemy vessel. If firing a broadside half of its armament is obscured by the ship. If firing headon the lead turret on either side of the superstructure the banks of  turrets on either side towards the rear of the vessel would obscure the three turrets behind it etc.Those arent mounted on a flat surface they are mounted on a slope that allows all turrets to shoot directly ahead of the ship. You can notice it in this picture or in this one from a Bellator class or perhaps more to the point if you play the starfighter mode of swtor and fly straight at a harrower youll see every single turret on it.An Imperial Star Destroyer has enough firepower to execute a Base Delta Zero all by itself. Firepower is not an issue for this vessel.gtThat still doesnt change the fact that youve stationed  infantrymen thousands of pilots and starfighter maintainers  Starfighters and support vessels and dozens of tanks and walkers as is the case with the ISD aboard a vessel which is intended to be in the thick of it.gtIRL an aircraft carrier is not intended to engage other surface combatants directly rather its designed to strike by way of its aircraft compliment from hundreds of miles away well out of reach of any danger posed by enemy guns.gtWhy? Because losing a single  billion ship with another  billion of aircraft on it not to mention the  highly trained personnel needed to keep both the ship and the aircraft operational is enough to cripple a nations military if not their economy. Ergo you do everything you can to avoid having to send a carrier into a direct brawl with enemy destroyerscruiserscarriersbattleships because if an enemy ship comes within gun range of the carrier someone fethed up thats why carriers all have an entire fleet of dedicated warships and escorts to protect it at all times.The Empire ruled the entire known galaxy and had a recruitment pool spanning quadrillions. Losses on this scale are nothing to them.In Star Wars fighters and bombers arent just used for long range force projection they serve an important role in ship to ship combat such as intercepting enemy fighterbomber squadrons that might evade the heavier weapons on the mothership and delivering their own payloads to enemy ships. In a ship to ship engagement those fightersbombers will be deployed to fight in support of the Star Destroyer. They will not be in any more harms way than they would otherwise be in the line of duty and they will be exactly where they are needed without the need to traverse potentialy thousands of miles between a safe zone for dedicated carriers and the engagement.Any fighter that gets deployed needs to be within reach of the ships slugging it out or else they wont do much good. And if any dedicated carrier such as the Venator Secutors Gladiators Quasar Fires and TonFalkclass escort carriers wanted to be of use they would have to be somewhere close by often within range of enemy fighterbomber wings or worse enemy turbolasers.It makes sense that theyd put a hangar on an Imperial Star Destroyer since its TIE fighters are as much part of its weaponry as its turbolasers. Any other uses for these TIEs is a bonus.The carriers have to be in harms way to be of any use given the nature of space combat in Star Wars and the reach of the weapons involved they might as well build a hangar in the heavily shielded and armed Star Destroyers that are going to need fighter support in the first place. Shields compensate for any percieved structural weakness this brings and for anyone that doesnt want fighters after all there is the tector class.Star Destroyers were designed to be absolutely massive vessels capable of dealing with any problem the Empires enemies might throw at it and its massive size was a deliberate design feature in the words of TarkingtThe average citizen has no grasp of numbers nor a head for calculation. I maintain that the effectiveness of the Star Destroyer stems from not only its massive firepower but from sic its size. When citizens look at a Star Destroyer and then compare it to the craft which might be mustered to attack it they have a tendency to dismiss such a notion as suicidal rather than approach the problem tactically.This left plenty of mostly unused internal space for activities such as housing Stormtroopers and walkers which are used both in boarding actions defensive and offensive and to turn the Star Destroyer as a whole into a rapid response package capable of dealing with any problem instead of having to wait for reinforcements which could potentialy result in disaster for the Empire given the delay and which are more prone to ambush.Take for example the battle of Hoth. If the Empire had to call in reinforcements for a ground assault when Admiral Ozzel jumped in system too soon the base would have been completely evacuated by the time they were ready to mount a ground assault. The Empire won a decisive victory and if it werent for the troops they brought with them all they could have done is watch the Rebels slip trough their fingers again.TLDR Because having ground forces readily available can potentialy win wars and fighters being important to the function of a capital ship the Empire decided to combine them all into one package since replacing those assets is far easier for the Empire than replacing the Destroyer would be.,StarWars,df78d7u,2,t5_2qi4s

Obviously when you compare Anakins fight with ObiWan in ROTS to Vader and ObiWan in ANH its like night and day. Anakin is insanely acrobatic in ROTS and barely moves his arms in ANH. I know there are reasons for this both canonical and realworld. So the first couple seconds of this scene show Vader blocking every single blast fired at him with precision and ease while also barely moving a muscle which for me totally merged Anakin from III and Vader from IV and cemented them as being the same character.

Obviously this isnt ideal but when you need to introduce a lot of characters this works because you cant take so much time for backstory. One of SSs problems. Want to know what movie did it beautifully? Guardians of the Galaxy. I recently watched Stuckmanns review for GotG and he said that every single character had depth to them. I see the character flaws in RO but to say that Drax has more depth than Cassian lets say is horribly wrong. Im not saying RO is perfect its flawed but this blows it out of proportion. This is precisely why we need film criticism however. This video criticizes a movie harshly and allows for people to talk about it and form their own opinions after it.

11334261,0,t3_61oodc,I think either Ackbar or Raddus is very very likely. Raddus himself probably doesnt fit the description of a beloved old face just yet but given his importance in Rogue One he seems like a cert regardless. And while he seems to be heading up the Mon Cala contingent as of Scarif I can definitely see him bringing Ackbar along for the ride as either a subordinate or an equal in a Rebels appearance.Given that were also very likely seeing Yavin in the early stages of next season I think Garven Dreis and Dutch Vander are very likely after their appearance in Rogue One. Their appearance would also ideally open the way for Porkins and Wes Janson to enter the Rebellion from the Tierfon Yellow Aces. I would especially love to see an episode of Wes Wedge and Hobbie bonding and becoming friends. Beyond that General Rieekan maybe? Nien Nunbs a possibility too the new canon seems to be playing up his importance a fair bit and the Sullustans were important members of the Alliance in Legends.Id also love it if we could get some more Wookiee involvement. I dont believe weve seen any since the very first episode and Id love to see some cooperation between the Rebels and some sort of Wookiee resistance movement even if we dont get any Wookiees joining the Alliance itself. It would be a great opportunity to bring back Tarrfful as another bridge to the Prequels too.Looking beyond the Rebels Id agree that Boba Fett stands a very good chance of making an appearance. At this point Cad Bane seems equally likely on the Scum side of things given his popularity. Now that theyre free to tie in a few more things to Rogue One Id love to get a few episodes dedicated to an Imperial perspective as the Death Star nears completion. Motti and Tagge bickering away Tarkin and Krennic at loggerheads Yularen in the middle of it all Galen Erso doing his thing  maybe even establish the beginnings of his relationship with Bodhi Rook?Granted that seems unlikely. Rebels has demonstrated a stubborn unwillingness to develop episodes that dont include at least one of the Ghost crew even if their appearance arguably hurts the episode Twin Suns Through Imperial Eyes.,StarWars,dfgpvw6,1,t5_2qi4s

11450639,0,t1_dftv9bp,I think one could still make that argument. A lot of what people liked about Star Wars came from original coproducer Gary Kurtz. He was the one who was always pushing for more pathos sincerity heavier subject matter bittersweet plot arcs etc. George was all about geewhiz adventure the visual spectacle of it all and the ability to sell toys to kids. Kurtz left production of Return of the Jedi. Then we suddenly get ewoks Han alive and well etc. So I think even though George was the catalyst of Star Wars and its ultimately his baby its still possible that he might not fully understand why other people like his creation so much.,StarWars,dftx5n0,2,t5_2qi4s

11457350,0,t3_63d63q,I expressed this elsewhere but heres my take on poor Hayden One can give a bad performance and still be an otherwise good actor. Yes Georges writing was poor and damaged Haydens performance but lets not try to change history and pretend it was actually good stuff. I like Hayden quite a lot and feel bad for him but Im not going to deflect the fact he still didnt sell what he was given. He was badly out of his league and needed a director that could bring out his best in spite of that but it didnt happen.Good actors can make the most inane trash work see Alec Guinness Harrison Ford Ewan MacGregor Hayden couldnt pull it off which is his responsibility. I dont hate him for it and I know he had a lot going against him but he still failed to make the vast majority of audiences accept that take on the character.That all said I very much want to see Force Ghost Anakin in The Last Jedi. It would be so nice for them to give Hayden another shot with better dialogue and direction and best of all hes had more experience with acting since the PT days so hes no longer so out of his league. also obligatory statement that I consider Matt Lanter the definitive Anakin Skywalker,StarWars,dfuokym,2,t5_2qi4s

11458812,0,t1_dfut26f,Strategically the Death Star is superior. It can be fired without any collateral damage the draining of a sun and can hit far more precise targets a single planet a city or even a starship. The Death Star is also much more mobile and capable of defending itself. The first Death Star was only destroyed due to its main designer sabotaging it AND the miraculous presence of a prodigiously gifted Force user who could hit the exhaust port. The second Death Star was attacked before it was finished.Starkiller Base was fully operational when it was attacked and had no trap laid in its design yet the Resistance still destroyed it. If not for the above mitigating factors both Death Stars would have been invincible.,StarWars,dfuuk5z,7,t5_2qi4s

11459383,1,t1_dfuwkqq,Yes characters are what makes you love the movie but we were not discussing that...  indeed its hard to come up with original plots and thats why original plots are THAT valuable and thats what gives the prequels some artistic value... they feel quite original despite the obvious shortcomings Anyway if you want to talk about original characters... Rey is obviously a rehash of luke  frustrated teen with unknown past living in the desert gets a mission from an outsider and finds out he has force powers. Similar comparisons can be made for other characters but this is the most obvious one,StarWars,dfuww8d,1,t5_2qi4s
11459991,0,t1_dfuludm,Id read a forum that someone suggested a great reason for the Star Killer base that would also have helped establish the resistance force as well.  The base was actually developed by the New Republic as either some kind of tool or weapon in secrete they were leaning weapon.  I like the idea of it as a tool  a mobile planet that could rearrange stars and planets to make more habitable star systems.  The idea went on that there were factions of the New Republic that saw this as a threat to galactic safety.  This weapontool was too dangerous and could easily be used for malicious purposes.  A resistance force designed to counter Star Killer base and the New Republic began amassing  think a sort of insurance coup  but would have signaled another civil war.In comes the First Order  a secrete former Imperial fringe force that had secretly and visibly been working within the New Republic as a member in a sudo name fashion  possibly with Snoke as its leader.  The First Order have taken control of Star Killer base and are planning on using as they do in the movie  to destroy the New Republic government in one swift stroke.To keep the physics a little better dropping a new star into the habitable zone of an existing star system would cause immediate destabilization of the system and the planets within.  Massive tectonic shifts as the new gravity well of a star would tear apart the planets.  That or borrow from the Yuuzhan Vong and pullpush moons into the planets.Maybe that would have been too much like the expanded universe but at least it could have had a plausible reasoning behind its conception construction and implementation.  Not to mention the funding and labor required to complete such a project.  AND it would fall into the same theme of the movie with Ben  something good turned and made into something evil.,StarWars,dfuzdqq,1,t5_2qi4s

Bloodline is my top recommendation to people wanting to get into the canon novels. Its a good Liea story and Rian Johnson apparently had some input on a scene or two in the book so we know its going to tie into The Last Jedi in some way. ,StarWars,dfv9r5d,2,t5_2qi4s

Tarkin blowing up cities to plug leaks was established early on in R. Tarkin manipulated Krennic into destroying Jedha to stop Bodhi from getting his message out to Saw. So thats already a part of his character. What happened is that Tarkin shows up in the final stages of the battle but didnt check that plans were sent.

Ewan and Karl brought in their own acting but they also stood true to who these characters were. Thats something few can achieve and why many recasts arent that good.,StarWars,dg2v0qo,1,t5_2qi4s
11529543,0,t1_dg2g0ti,Geologist hereThe concept intersects with some interesting stuff. The material as you go deeper in a rocky planet is superheated due to the pressure of the overburden. On Earth we find that with depth the material is liquidgtplasticgtliquidgtsolid due to the pressure and nuclear thermogenesis from the core. As you remove the overburden you are depressurizing deeper material and it will reverse its way up the mentioned chain. At a certain depth the hole will likely refill with magma ad infinitum. With a hole that large youd need to pressurize the walls to prevent them from becoming liquid in addition to supporting what looks like half of the planets surface to prevent ruptures and volcanism around the edges of the hole. Weirdly complicated way to build a moon.      ,StarWars,dg2vj8r,2,t5_2qi4s
11530256,0,t1_dg2xn7p,gt Trek uses things that could always be explained by science  even if theoretic in nature.By and large scientific explanations in Star Trek are done after the fact and the same could be done with Star Wars if the people involved cared.  Though the Alcubierre Drive was dreamed up as a means of FTL travel that warps space the inuniverse explanation for warp drive is actually closer to the Star Wars hyperdrive in that they both put the ship in a realm subspacehyperspace where FTL is possible.Ill get into pseudoscientific arguments because I like arguing but when actually watching something Id rather see the writers focus on creating a good story than on creating bad science.,StarWars,dg2yg25,3,t5_2qi4s

The lake is in balance.Then you dump a few hundred gallons of crude oil into the lake. The lake is now out of balance. You return it to balance by getting the oil out not making sure the lake is  water and oil.This is how the Force works or at least how Lucas envisioned it. The Dark Side isnt a part of the force its an unnatural force that throws the Force out of balance.EDIT To clarify Im not saying the Jedi were in the right. Their dogma and overconfidence ultimatley blinded them leading the the fall of their order and the Republic. That being said the solution isnt to make Rey a totally badass Grey Jedi who is totally a good guy but also uses force lightning because she totally uses both sides guys!,StarWars,dg9cnkz,13,t5_2qi4s

11590595,0,t1_dg9e787,Perhaps the point is that we sometimes need to move beyond the concept of good and evil as they are far too polarizing at times. Balance of light and dark doesnt mean a wonderful person standing by while a terrible person murders someone which is what some people here are saying.  Like you dont allow the Death Star to exist just because you have a planet creating machine.  Thats polar that is the opposite of balance. If the concept of the force moves in a Taoism style direction the true path will be to let all aspects of life flow naturally.  At rest you are at peace when you encounter an extreme in one direction you naturally gravitate towards the other direction to bring things back to peace.  This is more realistic then idealistic I imagine but it also is a concept that can lead to greater compassion and acceptance of all aspects of people and of life. Take Rey and Kylo Ren.  In Ep VII she called him a monster.  We know he feels the pull to the light and is not completely evil.  Would it be better for her to continue to just view him as a dark evil character and her as his righteous opposite?  Would it be good for her to kill him even if hes not pure evil?,StarWars,dg9svqm,1,t5_2qi4s

11598136,0,t1_dg9qvtv,OK dont even try and pretend like Star Wars was in some kind of dire situation after the prequels. This is revisionist history to try and make The Force Awakens sound better than it was. I absolutely lived this  I know what youre saying is not true at all.The prequels were terrible. But they still made a ton of money. Revenge of the Sith was critically wellreceived and ended the trilogy on a high note that made people want more. And everybody since the s has wanted to see a sequel to Return of the Jedi. If anything the prequels only pushed the original trilogy further into the public consciousness. Pop culture and especially the internet had made love for Star Wars grow exponentially. The original Star Wars has always been mainstream and universally loved. But weve been living in the Age of Fandom for quite awhile since at the very latest the early s where it is not mainstream accepted and cool to be a geek. Everyone remembers Star Wars in their childhood now whether it was the originals rereleases prequels or animates series. There was no way a new Star Wars movie wasnt going to make loads and loads of money. Especially one that finally had a diverse cast and could make more types of people feel like they were included and consider themselves fans too. Do you remember how much the internet exploded when Disney announced it was buying Lucasfilm? Or when the trailers dropped? Or when the ticket sales crashed? Star Wars has always been in full force. Just previously is was impeded by George Lucas being a human. So when he sold it over a studio machine could easily pump things out much quicker. But there was no dire situation. Star Wars was in good health. Fans would have accepted any sequel marginally better than the prequels with open arms. Star Wars books video games and TV shows had all been going strong before Lucasfilm was bought too.TLDR  stop repeating this lie. Star Wars has always been in full force since the birth of the internet and has only expanded its power with the passing years.,StarWars,dgano6e,1,t5_2qi4s

Now I just wish they would venture out beyond the scope of this time period and do something really crazy interesting and new.  Watching this movie kind of gave me an existential crisis regarding what even makes Star Wars Star Wars.  It needs to be more than just TIE fighters Xwings Vader and Death Stars.

11621105,0,t1_dgd7taz,Not current Star Wars canon. Current Canon Star Wars ships are incredibly durable but their weapons are pretty weak. Just reading Thrawn the other day and they performed an orbital strike with full powered at something like  points and people a few rooms down in the next building were totally fine. There are other examples too.Trek weapons power is actually pretty evenly matched at about  Megatons for a Photon Torpedo and  MT for Quantums.I think the big loophole here though is that Star Wars shields are pretty bad in current canon. They cant fire ion cannons or turbolasers through them according to Thrawn and possibly Rebels at some point... Meanwhile PostDominion WarNemesis Trek is incredibly strong.

To use the OPs analogy if its a pool then its a pool with separate swim lanes and they all start at the steps and go down to the deep end.Regarding the Balance I always viewed it like Highlander rules. Less JediSith means that the Force reaches out harder to those people to influence them and if they open up to it the powers it rewards can be great.

11629030,0,t1_dge1n52,gtSidious offers them power influence wealth great reward for blockading the planet and he will make sure the Republic turns a blind eye while they force a settlement on their favorable terms. Does this happen during the movie? I dont remember Sidious saying anything about giving them power influence or wealth for blockading the planet in Episode I. If nothing else the Trade Federation is run by businessmen. Theyd be smart enough to get a contract and a paper trail they could use against Sidious if he betrays them before they ever put their lives on the line for profit. We dont see anything like that.gtThe pretext is some trade dispute which means Trade Fed. is seeking money and to expand their coffers eg taking over Naboo enterprises is just greed.What is the trade dispute exactly? Is the nature of the trade dispute ever mentioned on screen?gtHit on it slightlythe Senate is bureaucratic and corrupt. Several systems feel they dont have a real seat at the table taxes are too high etc etc so they look to secede from the union. Remaining Union states are affronted and fight back to keep them in the systembattle for money territory and status. They unite in front of a common enemy not strange at all. If Brexit was being more hardline and just pulled out of EU closed borders stopped all shipping through the local seas and started arming themselves for largescale war be more analogous.None of the systems in question have an army and neither does the Republic until the clone army miraculously appears out of nowhere. In spite of that the Republic is still ready to go to a war that until they find out about the clone army they have no conceivable way to win. Why? The Trade Federation has no reason to close borders and stop shipping because again theyre a trade federation. Separating from the Republic to get better tax rates or shipping terms or tariffs or whatever would make no sense if the first thing they do after separating is to block off trade routes. That would just be cutting off their nose to spite their face. gtPalpatine coerces someone into putting his name forward for candidacy of Supreme Chancellor following the Vote of No Confidence a surprise to be sure eyeroll and manipulates situation to amass a coalition to win him the position along with a strong sympathy vote created from the Naboo situation. He then stirs up the antirepublic factions into war and convinces the senate to grant him more and more executive power in order to control situation and to extend his term of office. Undoubtedly this is through manipulation and extortion. You say undoubtedly but none of this is actually shown in the movie. Palpatine is said to be a master manipulator so were supposed to assume that he must have manipulated the other senators. But we dont actually see him do that. We dont see him building a coalition. We dont see him coercing senators or manipulating them. What we actually see in the movie appears to be a huge gamble by Palpatine with uncertain payoff that looks brilliant because it happened to work. But flipping a coin and calling out heads doesnt make you smart if you happen to be right. A smart person makes sure theres no coin flip at all.In real life the vote of each representative and senator is known long before the vote ever takes place. Voting blocs determine the vote of  of the senators and the remaining  at most are swing voters who might be persuaded to break with their normal coalition if they can get something for their district. Everything that happens in the senate and the house is just showmanship because no senator is going to vote against the best interests of their voting bloc or their district without very good reasons. Based on what we can see of the Star Wars Senate votes are decided based who can persuade the most people with a dramatic speech or an impassioned oneonone conversation. Thats not even close to realistic. Plans that rely on the success of those speeches are fundamentally flawed because not everyone can be persuaded easily by emotional appeals. Especially not the most powerful men women and aliens in the galaxy who were all important enough and strongwilled enough to be selected as representatives of their people.,StarWars,dge5vpl,6,t5_2qi4s

When Lando cant get the job done they send in the droids to try to intimidate Jabba. When that doesnt work Leia and Chewie arrive. Leia clearly believes that she can escape with Han without having to bring Luke into the picture but when that fails the final contingency commences.

Why would Luke ever think this? This guy has been fucking up shit as the evilest dude in the galaxy for  years but naw hes probably got a soft spot. It just seems so forced pun intended.   Also the whole Leia is his sister thing comes out of left field for no reason. Yes I know its subtly alluded to that there may be another Skywalker in Empire but it also just seems so arbitrary. I actually doubt that the intent was for Leia to be his sister in Empire because of that kiss they share. I think Lucas decided he needed to have a story reason for Leia and Luke not being together the hero has to end up with the girl right?. So he was like yeah theyre brother and sister see?.

TCW was was kinda bad at the beginning but as the show progressed the animators really learned to work with it and it looks awesome.

11770157,0,t1_dgu4mmp,gtThe trade blockade to start chaos in the senate. This came across as disconected from the later movies as the relevant situation appeared to be resolved by the breaking of the blockade.My honest opinion is that the story of TPM should never have existed as a mainsaga film because it is a movie that serves exclusively as an introduction to a few characters killing off the interestig ones which could have been condensed into the first act of a movie that started the Clone Wars.gtSidious manipulating his way into power.What do we see? Hes a senator He tricks Jar Jar into supporting him for Chansellor with no other details. Everyone is cheering him declaring himself emperor because... reasons?gtThe creation of the Clones.That whole thing was way more convoluted than it needed to be. Why create a Secret Army plotline that raises all sorts of questions like how fucking gullable are these people? A more straightforward plot line where Obiwan an Anakin are deliberately sent to aquire an army would have served most of the same plot purposes while keepig the two main characters together in order to flesh out their relationship and the politics between the Order and the Republic. Maybe bring up the orders dislike of using the clones or something instead of apparently embracing a slave army whole heartedly.gtThe manipulation of the senate into thinking the Jedi are bad and tried to kill Sidious.This was actually stupidly abrupt. Why is the senate suddenly so willing to believe the Jedi who have been close allies to the Republic for a thousand generations suddenly turned traitor? We needed more transition between Valued Allies and Enemies of the StategtOrder .Are you kidding? This was practically a Diabolus ex Machina to the point that they had to retcon in control chips through Clone Wars.Same problem as above where the shift from allies to enemies is just way too abrupt.gtThey did quite a good job. Ive never seen the clone wars and understand how the fall of the republic and rise of the First Galactic Empire happened.  You might be able to understand it but lots of important details and transition phases between Allies an Enemies were missing. Far too many to claim that the fall of the republic was covered in any significant detail.

11781000,0,t3_683lgn,I thought they should do a dark Darth Vader show that takes place a week after ROTS in the style of Clone Wars. I think it should be a fever dream of sorts that is full of regret pain and visions of the past present and future. Darth Vader should have very dark private moments like trying to  cope with the immense amount of pain and discomfort hes in. Imagine a scene of Vader in his meditation chamber where hes trying to ignore the needles and fabric against his skin and just breaks down yelling at the top of his lungs. He could have insane breaks where Mace Windu and Shaak Ti and all of the Jedi and innocents hes killed just surround him taunting him. This would be very sad because James Earl Jones is getting rather old and might not be with us come  years from now. This would be a beautiful send off.,StarWars,dgvex4n,1,t5_2qi4s

Its like the universe is aligning to make sure these few not particularly competent or interesting people come together so the plot can happen. Its about as deep as a saturday morning cartoon. By contrast we may not spend as much time learning about the characters in Rogue One but what we do see of them is consistent and interesting. They have intelligent and believable feelings and thoughts about their situation and the things they say and the choices they make are sensible and realistic given the scenario. They feel like actual people. The ways that they manage to defy the odds and gather the information and resources they need to win feels earned and believable right down to the part where they dont actually survive their mission.,StarWars,dgyk8kt,3,t5_2qi4s
