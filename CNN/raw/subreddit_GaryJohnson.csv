1235671,0,t1_ci8m6qf,gt Doubtful. Perot was only let in because Clinton and Bush both thought he would hurt the other guy more. That was my point. That is he had enough presence to matter. Johnson was going to get  and that was not up for grabs so why debate him? If a minor party candidate had enough presence he could push himself in no matter the CPD. Without it the CPD does not matter. Let us say that instead of the libertarian as the minor candidate it was someone with a real following among the religious right a sizable voting bloc. Say a Huckabee or something with some money behind him. Even if he polls at a serious  he would matter. The Democrat would talk about letting him in. Everyone would know it was not a principled move but so what. The Republican would try to resist. That would be a story. A guy with  is not such a story and no one really cares.And to be clear the Democrat incumbent would love to have Johnson in the debate. He would treat them both as Republicans and try to pin the most outlandish libertarian positions on the GOP candidate. Johnson in the debate would have been good for Obama.gtYou dont get to pretend other parties can qualify and then refuse to allow them in. The real issue is simple we have First Past the Post. That means there are only going to be two meaningful candidates. The debates are insignificant in affecting that. The CPD is the broker the guy who arranges the furniture. ,GaryJohnson,ci8mocb,1,t5_2rxc8

Why?  Because people like you say that its not possible for them to win. Of course its not possible for them to win because idiots like you say shit like that which convinces them that voting for their preferred candidate is worthless.

Now I think Libertarianism is great but he needs a more unifying slogan and we can look into the past for that. Trump love him or hate him came up with something spectacular borrowing Ronald Reagans Lets Make America Great Again slogan from  and just making it Make America Great Again. Now if we roll with Make America Sane Again that just gives more attention to Trump and frames Gary as the NeverTrump candidate. We cannot allow him to become that as it just frames the debate as the Establishment VS Trump which is why Trump is even popular in the first place. I propose we look back into the past and find something that works and twist it to our means. We can take things like Bob Doles The Better Man For A Better America and twist it or Dwight D.

7855579,0,t1_d3z0c4g,Im with you.  Self reflection is good.  That is still a shit video that shows Gary inexpertly try and explain something and get shot down.  Did you figure out what he was trying to say?  No of course not.  The only person who said marijuana cures Ebola was the shrill host.  Gary was obviously trying to make a point about marijuana being some possible component of treatment likely something boring like using CBD to reduce nausea  and that the government wont let them because of the insanity of marijuana being a schedule I drug.  The host had him on to talk about that but in reality it was just a shitty ambush where he screamed over and over trying to pull it out of context.  One assumes he eventually failed hence the cut part and Gary explained his position.If your point is that Gary isnt the greatest speaker in the world we agree.  He is a nice guy who absolutely sucks at shouting down douchebags like that show host.  In fact it is pretty clear that his greatest interviewing weakness is when hosts do exactly what this one did where they cut him off and make accusations he starts to explain his position gets cut off with another accusation and he again starts to try to calmly explained his position.  The interview end with it seemingly like he agreed with the hosts accusation because he failed to shout the  host down and give his position.  More media savvy douchebags learn that the key is to raise your voice and talk over the host and keep doing it until they relent.  Gary just isnt good at that and it lets people make attacks like this where they just keep repeating an accusation and he fails to shout them down while denying it.  This clip shows that in action.  It isnt like Gary calmly explained how marijuana cures Ebola by attacking its evil spirits.  A guy screamed that at him and he failed to make him stop.So if your point is that Gary sucks in a hostile interview we agree.  If your point is that Gary is insane and thinks marijuana cures Ebola you are a bigger sucker really blandly boldfaced media manipulation.  ,GaryJohnson,d3z1dqp,1,t5_2rxc8

7876272,0,t1_d41bs9t,Thanks! My brother is a finance major and a Libertarian himself so that coupled with my general curiosity to read as many views as possible rSocialismVCapitalism was a good subreddit for this however I unsubbed a while ago due to it being a big aggressive in a lot of threads has led to me knowing quite a bit about capitalism.One of my main reasons for supporting a more leftist fiscal policy is rooted frankly in my upbringing and religion. Im a Catholic and Ive gone to a private Catholic institution so Ive always been taught that we should care for one another. As I mentioned though I do totally understand the merits of capitalism and a more conservative fiscal policy is not something that would drive me away from a candidate. I went to a Kasich town hall when he came to my area and I was listening to some of his solutions and I really liked some of them. For example he was talking about a government entitlement program that required a certain amount of hours worked in order to actually have the privilege of the entitlement. I think thats a great system because it gets people out there and gets them working but they can still feed their families.,GaryJohnson,d41d64t,7,t5_2rxc8

8005528,0,t3_4otiaj,It is not apparent that we need gun restriction. George Washington himself said that the public must be armed and armed and supplied with proper ammunition so that they are able to defend themselves from anyone including their government.The main reason that gun restriction isnt a good avenue is that it kicks the door wide open for government tyranny. Mao Hitler and Stalin all started off with banning guns. After you ban guns the people are helpless but if they are armed there is hope. Look up the Sobibor Concentration Camp escape during the Holocaust. Jewish prisoners stole guns and  of them broke out of the camp and it later shut down. That is a small taste of what an armed populace can do against tyrants. Gun restriction also wont really stop gun violence or violence in general. People will use other weapons available to them and criminals will get their guns illegally. The only people who will obey a ban on their firearms are law abiding people who genuinely keep those guns to defend themselves. There are also solid stats that there is no correlation between gun control and homicide rates within states and states with more gun control measures more often then not have more problems with crimes than states with less. There are also a myriad of other issues that Im sure you support Johnson on.

8110416,0,t1_d4rkcxf,Antidiscrimination laws are those which mandate equality by making it illegal to discriminate according to some criteria. For example forcing a christian bakery to bake a cake for a gay wedding.Discriminatory laws are active laws which have a discriminatory effect. For example Jim Crow laws or even the war on drugs. Libertarians believe in absolute equality of all people in the eyes of the law but they believe private individuals should be free to discriminate according to whatever preferences they have and others are free to react if it becomes a public issue. The reason for this is that they dont want to have the government be the enforcer of morality.Gary Johnson is different in this regard because he does not think businesses or individuals should be able to discriminate according to certain criteria. gtDoes this signify a party shift away from antidiscrimination in the platform? How would a Libertarian government in  approach these kinds of issues?Gary Johnson has shown a very moderate and pragmatic response to politics. I dont see him doing anything radical.

People will say this or that in surveys but the temptation to choose someone viable in the polling booth or just abstaining is a real factor.  Johnson winning any state signifies a Trump implosion nationally. Hillary captures Florida Virginia and Pennsylvania among other states and gets way more than  electoral votes to win. Its not enough to just take a state from Trump that hes expected to win given Hillary is already projected for . Congress isnt going to give the Presidency to a rd party.

8566828,0,t1_d6ccn8t,gt guns are solely designed for killingNot true.  Sure they may have been originally designed to kill but they have evolved.  Guns have a safety feature that is specifically designed to stop them from killing.  There are plenty of features and cosmetic details on guns that were designed that have nothing to do with killing.  A BB gun can not kill a person nor can a pellet gun.  A . would be a very poor choice as well.  These are all examples of guns that are not designed solely for killing.gt guns are by far the most prevalent application of technology for murderingOf course it is!  That is the main tool used by militaries.  However the lack of this technology is not going to prevent murder.  People were still killing each other and having wars before the invention of the firearm.gt We may as well put reasonable restrictionsThe problem with additional restrictions is  Where do you draw the line and at what point is it an undue burden for the good citizens?  And how do you prevent that line from moving and further infringing in the future?  Why not focus on adding restrictions to society in areas where greater gains could be realized like automobiles?  Force people to take more tests jump through more hoops and do background checks to prove they are skilled drivers and wont use the tool to kill someone.  gt bans on unregulated sales at gun show Gun show sales account for a tiny fraction of those used in crimes.  Can you point me to a statistic or instance where a gun show purchase was used in a mass shooting?  I would not be surprised if some of those purchases were used in smaller crimes but I can not recall an instance where one was used in a mass shooing.gt have you ever seen a wellintentioned civilian with a gun stop and active mass shooter anyways?Personally I have not.  However it does occur.  Here is the first google link as an example  You dont hear about them because the media doesnt sensationalize them like they do the shootings that succeed. Also if people are intent on killing someone there are likely two main paths.   Kill specific people  Look at Ft. Hood for example either case.  I would also argue that most gang crime and war would fall under this. Kill to cause terror  Here people are being killed solely to kill people and the shooter doesnt know them. In the second case that is typically the mass shootings we see and hear about on the news.  If someone such as a religious extremist decides to kill people they are going to want to maximize terror and will therefor go someplace where people are unable to defend themselves and fight back.  It is a basic tactic for anything  maximize output for minimum input.  Terrorists dont go to the local NRA chapter military base or police station since they will be met with considerable force  resistance.  They attack places that are not expecting it and are unable to defend themselves such as schools society seems to value the life of the young more than the average person congregating groups where people are doing recreational actives shopping movies etc and places with religion meanings planned parenthood churches etc.gt statistics show you are much more likely to be harmed by a gun if you own oneThis is essentially a meaningless statistic that can be applied to anything in your life.  Peoples lack of personal responsibility in their private life should have no meaning on the lives of others.  Statistics show you are more likely to be harmed by if you haveownuse.

Tomorrow Trump could finally just come out and say something gameending instead of edging toward it like Fk the sand niers on live TV and plummet. We could get a surprise endorsement. I got sick to my stomach when the Ohio stuff happened and they finally relented. Ive never gone on a date let alone had a girlfriend. But I have no way to  prove to anyone that tomorrow isnt the day I meet the love of my life. I could force it to happen by staying indoors but so long as I work hard at just living my life and being myself I leave a space for positive stuff to grow.We havent even used all of our weapons and next weeks early polls will be lagging behind this next wave of effort.Its fickle. Its not steady and its not exponential. But we could easily grow soon and could easily have it be the case that well spike later out of nowhere.As someone else kind of mentioned he could miss every single debate and still get a better popular vote not poll vote turnout than last cycle. Its all progress.He might be stumbling in terms of presentation here and there but to me its like watching Agents of SHIELD. I know it can be cheesy I know the writing is all over the board.

His main reason for voting for Trump is the only reason I could understand because Hillary is the embodiment of political corruption and he cant in good conscience vote for her. I wanted to vote for Hillary because shes more of the same. At least we can try again in  years. But she cant do much more damage than what any other corrupt politician has already done. Trump on the other hand... I can imagine America being a smoldering pile of ashes at the end of his reign. The fact that Johnson is a level headed incorruptible average guy fits the bill on both those fronts. But we both really side with the libertarian platform we have since first learning about it from Penn and Teller in . We are both historically republican but hate the hypocrisy of the party.

8882272,0,t1_d7fbwna,No. We need unions regardless. Unions are there to help protect the worker from the company. If you enjoy overtime paid vacation sick days the current minimum wage safety and health rules insurance and k benefits you have benefited from unions. As for state and local minimum wages who has more resources to negotiate and bargain and resist lobbyist influences? The feds or states? States are more susceptible to lobbyist influences and are easier to influence by big business. You remove the federal minimum wage and eventually without the presence of unions cities and states will remove their minimum wage. There is a reason that every country which has successfully implemented a no minimum wage standard has supported unions. The common worker can not have their voices heard otherwise. We went through this shit in the beginning of the th century and Johnsons policy ideas are regressive to that era. ,GaryJohnson,d7fiuq7,1,t5_2rxc8

8951320,0,t3_52b2ey,My letterTo Whom It May ConcernI have followed the increasing popularity of Gary Johnson and William Welds ticket in the past few months and redacted good space for personal reason to write. Im writing today to add my voice to the majority of Americans who wish to see Johnson on the debate state on September th.Although Im not a polling expert it is my understanding Johnson is often elided from the first and second question in polls artificially depressing his numbers. It is my belief that if all polls included Johnson in the first question he would have surpassed  percent weeks ago if not earlier. The  election has developed amid unprecedented distrust in election integrity and disinclusion of Johnson and Weld has thus far added to that ongoing discontent among voters. Moreover Johnson and Welds support remains exceptionally high among putatively undersampled young voters and among our armed forces.Johnson and Weld have accrued three major newspaper endorsements and have state ballot access by contrast Donald Trump has not received any major endorsements of a journalistic nature. Purportedly inconsistent poll methodology coupled with the tickets clear mandate in terms of public interest will hopefully prompt the CPD to invite Johnson and Weld to debate as roughly twothirds of Americans polled support.I understand that public demand is high and I apologize for contributing to a volume of queries. However it is vital that Johnson be included in the debates to ensure all American voters are presented a free and fair choice in November.

Its worse to have bad actions and horrible rhetoric that inspires further bad action on the part of the citizenry.  Most people are unaware or willfully ignorant of the bad things the government does but whats shocking is when people support a candidate like Trump who explicitly says horrible things.  Thats a whole other level of depravity in my opinion.   IMO Trump is the  equivalent of George Wallace.  Now sure Trump isnt advocating for segregation explicitly but given the racial progress you would have expected since  I dont think any serious candidate ever would but its worth noting that David Duke who is even more extreme than Wallace is loudly supporting Trump.  Wallace got  in  and Trump is almost triple that sometimes even more than triple that in some polls.

It also points to HRC winning this election. At the end of the day most conservatives have been willing to accept DJTs misdeeds and insanity in the interest of preserving the rest of the platform. To be honest DJT polls better than GJ. That may be a result of polling shenanigans marketing and fear of the other candidate winning but thats the truth. So conservatives are faced with voting for GJ which will hand the election to HRC most defecting now will vote for someone other than DJT just to be able to sleep at night and which will spell disaster in a very real sense when she gets to choose  SC justices and drive this nation into further socialism and on to more wars.,GaryJohnson,d8k2enn,5,t5_2rxc8
