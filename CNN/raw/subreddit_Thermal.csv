4102069,0,t3_37jvt7,I have the original Seek Thermal and its pretty neat but it isnt really designed with prolonged use in mind. Because your phone must be on while youre using it expect only a few hours of use even with a fully charged battery. Also while you might be able to identify something from a distance of more than  feet you have to be much closer ish feet in order to see what it actually is because of the low sensor resolution. The XR version should improve this but I dont know by how much.,Thermal,crnv0cv,2,t5_33yzh
