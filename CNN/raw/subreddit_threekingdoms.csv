5448219,0,t1_cw80ln5,Well that depends. What do you normally like to read? What kind of books normally turn you off? RotK very much follows the classical epic sort of structure where the main characters become larger than life archetypes that can shape the world almost by force of will. Expect a lot of pompousness and melodrama and expect that even though Mr Hero is a grand general and does tons of politics he might have a short sideadventure about accidentally eating a commoners wife while hes moving from one town to another. Common comparisons would be to the Illiad or to something like Beowulf.That being said some people I know who couldnt stand trying to read those novels loved RotK so its hard to judge. RotK certainly benefits compared to those particular examples in that its written as a novel not lyrically so its much easier to actually read and process.ampnbspThe complexitynumber of characters is fine. Theres a TON of characters in RotK but they all break down into a handful of main characters who youll know immediately and almost everything will be about them to some degree some secondary characters who are the recurring advisorsministersgenerals of the main characters or tertiary characters who appear once make a petitiondie in battle and are never seen again. The vast majority of the characters are those tertiary ones it was a grueling time only a few politiciansgenerals were shrewd and capable enough to survive for long and you should find yourself falling quite easily into a rhythm of mentally keeping track of the main characters and not worrying about the origins of the tertiary characters who pass by. Of course when you get deeper into it you can find all sorts of cool bits like on a reread realizing a tertiary character is actually appearing briefly many times all over the country where on the first read you just thought it was a new minor character each time.,threekingdoms,cw829gl,1,t5_2sxs8
