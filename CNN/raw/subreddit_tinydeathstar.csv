189996,0,t1_cey9xm7,Unfortunately it never seemed to fully update on my iPad.  The version I am running on my iPhone never attempted to update so perhaps it was a bug.  ,tinydeathstar,cf02wdz,-1,t5_2ywwp
202156,0,t3_1wfctx,I got the same issue after the game forced me to link it with my google acct.,tinydeathstar,cf1gvq2,1,t5_2ywwp
364008,0,t1_cfigm49,Yeah thats why Im thinking its got to be a bug of some sort. Both my fiancee and I have been playing since release me more than her but Ive evicted so many bitizens while working towards level  workers on all levels its quite surprising that there are no level  retail workers. Perhaps its Android only. I wonder if the others in this thread are on iPhone.,tinydeathstar,cfihtwh,2,t5_2ywwp

578505,0,t3_20gznk,Yes! Has crashed each of last  times Ive clicked it. Used to only crash once or twice before loading. Thought that it was bc on iPod Touch but I guess not.,tinydeathstar,cg613pa,3,t5_2ywwp
701429,0,t1_cgjg4b1,Yep  Ive probably done it  times across  different TDS games iPad and iPhone and Ive only gotten  level.  Its insane.  If you actually paid for the bux youd end up spending probably  to get  level.,tinydeathstar,cgk06x3,3,t5_2ywwp
