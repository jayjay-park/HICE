1208579,0,t1_ci5ftk8,Just porting it is a lot easier to say than actually be done. It runs on a completely different code than Bitcoin and most altcoins so many applications for coins like Monero need to be completely revamped or started from the bottom.   Not to mention the fact that Monero is aiming to be anonymous so DarkWallet isnt really necessary. ,Monero,ci5l0ct,1,t5_31hbr
1210049,0,t1_ci5qo8o,Ive seen it demoed but its largely irrelevant in this instance becausegood design this is largely subjective but I have seen nothing to indicate that DarkWallet is somehow intuitive to new and unfamiliar users. Its not terrible but I wouldnt go so far as to view it as good enough to reuse  emulate.multisig Monero already supports this in the protocol tooling to use this will come as the Monero client improves over time.avatars and a Lobby room to chat Monero exists outside of the infrastructure that already exists such as IRC Bitmessage and so on.

You have a few beers and hamburgers and everyone has a blast. Now the fire marshal comes over the next day and says that its illegal for you to have a bonfire but he just wants to know who else brought wood for this bonfire and since its on your property youre culpable for their actions. You being the good friend you are say Whatever its my property and all the wood belonged to me give me a fine. The fire marshal then says Listen I can have a team of investigators come hear and analyze the chemical makeup of the remnants of your bonfire. We can determine  an approximate area for each remnant of wood go through your email contacts and get a pretty good idea of who brought what and how many. So do you still wanna play hard ass with me? Because someone at that bonfire is being booked for arson. Is it you or someone else?Monero You and a thousand strangers send your wood to a undisclosed locations all over the world and its fabricated into wood planks containing traces of all the wood used and then redistributed to buyers across the globe.

IMO Monero was not made to help the government track us all at levels unimaginable before Bitcoin it was born from the unknown and its fate at large still at speculation again listen to the podcast. Legally speaking as the anonymity is at protocol level and Monero has view keys to allow regulatory compliance it will be treated much colder than Bitcoin but theres nothing they can do to ban unless they make encryption itself like HTTPS and stuff illegal. I like to think Monero as an encrypted GPG email able to send real money to anyone I want to send the entire world do not need to know Im sending or to where and for the first time in history of mankind we can do it digitally decentralized thanks to Monero and its Cryptonote base.

5626988,0,t1_cwuirz8,ok I see.When implementing the damn good damm algo please consider keeping downward compatibility. In Bitcoin Electrum v showed how not to do it  they dropped! support of that earlier supported BIP in their v and replaced it by a new proprietary one.gt The one option just hash it with a userselected password is a bit of a weak implementation. It gives you deniability but gives you no way to easily check that the password entered is correct which leads to a bad user experience for the greater majority of users.Well I think for me this is exactly the right thing. Sure it doesnt give the user a feedback if the password is right. But on the other hand this is perfect for plausible deniability you can have  proper and  fake accounts if you want with some demofunds on it and a horror for a bruteforce attacker because he has to check every passwordtrial with the blockchain instead of getting an immediate response password incorrect.By the way BIP works the same when using a password. Also there any password with the same  or  mnemonic words will yields another seed  no way to tell if the seed is right or wrong probably its right if there is some balance on the addresses.PS Little Reddit experiment log  log   hmm none of these yield a subscript.

For the benefit of the younger crowd on this site your arguments resemble the Betamax versus VHS format war that I vividly remember and learned the lessons of. Betamax was technically the best system. The general public didnt care and VHS decisively won the war. What I see is your primary competitor Dash already has a decent GUI and has Trezor implementation. I know because I have some stored in my Trezor and it was very easy to use. Im all for Ron Pauls support of competition in currencies but if the GUI and hardware wallet support take too long youre Betamax.

Far more often advertising achieves its goal with more subtlety than grabbing your attention with a particularly memorable ad.  Good campaigns are typically designed to produce a mindshare presence for a particular product by just making you aware that the product even exists or simply reminding you that it does.  Every time you are exposed to the products name or icon or image it garners a little more mindshare.I first heard about Dash from an ad.

All this mixins are real most likely as they come from same blocktx or close to each other. And this happens because the person making this tx does not have any other outputs. All ouputs are from last few days. Probably a new user or a new wallet used.   This txs has no columnar pattern. Its impossible to see which mixins could be real and which could be fake.

9489000,0,t1_d9ip9gz,I agree that a known nonexponential monetary inflation is not a bad thing butgtAnd even something used as a currency can be a great store of value. The issue is where its primary demand lies. If something has a finite supply or diminishing supply it will be used to store value more than to trade goods and services. This leads to hoarding which leads to reduced liquidity which leads to more hoarding and you have a deflationary spiral.Never in human history has been recorded such a phenomenon. The only deflationary spirals we have knowledge of are debt deflation events that is the contraction of credit after an exuberant expansion. Ironically this events come from the expansion of credit through inflation. So you could say that monetary inflation is what sets the scenario for debt deflation.But never ever in human history has happened that we know an event where there has been monetary deflation due to the process you have described. The issue you are not taking into account is that a currency starts being so scarce that it can not function properly as currency people will find a substitute. At that point certain demand for currency will switch from the old currency to the new one or more than one. Lowering demand for the old currency will make it less valuable. On top seeing that another currency is starting to be used could scare savers and they could want to diversify lowering even more the demand. If you think about it It really is a bit silly to assume that people will keep trying to use a currency that has become dysfunctional and not look for a substitute but we and economist of the last  years have become so used to live in a monopoly of currency that it is even hard to imagine people using different currencies and not the one. Btw this is one of the reasons why crypto is so great it is making people relearn that currency does not need to be a monopoly.As a personal note it is a bit ugly to call savers hoarders. There is nothing wrong with saving it is actually noble and prudent. Sadly the need to fuel bubbles in the last  years has produced a change in values. And imo it has not been for the good.,Monero,d9iq0dt,1,t5_31hbr

Thats what is to be expected for CLI and corresponds with the market share of Linux OS.There was also the analysis based on the blockchain itself recently which showed that it is literally not used for anything yet but sending and withdrawing coins tofrom exchanges i.e. trading. Blocks are rather empty.If a coin with so low adoption like Monero is  it just shows how bad altcoins in general are with regard to adoption. Which was confirmed by that payment company forgot the name recently which said that almost nobody is using altcoins for payment.Long way to go until any adoption at all and it wont happen without creating some usabilty e.g. really good GUI wallets for all popular platforms.,Monero,dbrsa25,1,t5_31hbr

Candidate addresses are set up with viewkeys held by the registrar.When the LN transaction closes out all funds are returned to the voter registration address.

This would be bad for the exact same reasons that warrantless metadata collection reveals enormous amounts of information.With Kovri broadcasting and relaying of transactions will be routed through IP instead of the clear web. The nodes you are connected to for the purpose of broadcasting and relaying transactions will not know your IP address at the expense of a significant increase in latency. High latency is only expensive for miners due to increased block orphan rate so blocks will continue to be relayed as they are now.,Monero,dg5lraw,7,t5_31hbr

11611525,0,t3_65n0kn,LN was a great idea twisted by a horribly corrupt and abusive company. Its designed to support micropayments and machine to machine transaction channels. This idea of using it for real discrete transactions is completely orthogonal to the original intent and marketing of the network. Its completely disingenuous.Youve been around for what a year? You dont even know whats going on. You probably dont even know about the rampant censorship in the main Bitcoin communication channels and how everything got started.Just be aware  nobody is interested in hampering Monero for their own personal gain. We are and have to be extremely distrustful of institutions corrupting what is a fair and well run development process. Technologies here can stand on their own merits and should be introduced as needed when the time comes.

11689194,0,t3_66slyd,I doubt much. edit maybe a brief dip followed by recovery. XMR has already proved itself as the only currency worthy of those who absolutely must have private transactions. When multisig is added est. later this year many stores will add XMR to the currencies they accept. I suppose this is the main reason why other stores havent added XMR...just my guess.If someone is using a publicledger coin like BTC on a darkmarket they should be more concerned about traceability and ask that XMR be added,Monero,dgkzkxm,8,t5_31hbr
