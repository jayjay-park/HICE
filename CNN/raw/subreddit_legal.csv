278676,0,t1_cf8zkr1,Sorry Ive got so many questions!  Ive never been in a hit and run nor have I been hit before by a drunk driver thankfully so I dont really know what I am supposed to do.  They have the guys license plate  witnesses one being the manager of the bar that he was at the other was a guy that saw him leave the bar driving drunk and also saw him hit me... they have not caught the guy.  Would the DRAM shop law cover it even though I was not injured?  Also any ideas as to where I should go from here?,legal,cf9nbal,1,t5_2qhsb
350387,0,t1_cfh1cb6,Your theoretical defense falls up because of the fact that even though the officer was wrong about the specific part he thought was nonstock you did have an unauthorized modification made to the car. If not you would have gotten the fixit ticket signed off by the mechanic rather quickly.Like I said the place to debate that was with the mechanic doing the inspection not the judge. The judge wasnt going to give you the benefit of the doubt if you wanted to challenge the officers credibility if you hadnt been able to get the fixit ticket signed off. Since you had trouble getting the ticket signed off the judge was justified in concluding that the ticket was valid.Your defense seems much like someone who gets a ticket for carrying an illegally long knife only to argue That knife was legal your honor. The one in my boot that the officer didnt find was the illegal one.What difference does it make that the airbox was legal if a mechanic who inspected your engine agreed that it violated the law that you were cited for violating?,legal,cfh32y8,2,t5_2qhsb

483329,0,t1_cfv77rf,A religious title is given usually to indicate someone who has gone through training and selfdiscovery to be recognized by their peers as an authority. In the matter of the ULC and similar churches these titles are sometimes sought in order to give the person the right to officiate marriages.As an example I am a Reverend Doctor in the Universal Life Church. This was the culmination of a journey of selfexploration and theological research. I feel comfortable referring to myself as a minister because I am of the belief that I could teach and guide others in a spiritual capacity.You may want to consider whether you became a minister because you want to be a religious leader or just because the internet said you could. If you just got the title so you could add a title to your name then the title really has no weight. In that case why should anyone care?,legal,cfv7hpd,3,t5_2qhsb

986216,0,t3_253ddf,It depends on what you told the therapist about what your recorded conversation consisted of. If your therapist felt as though you or someone else was in danger heshe has a moral and professional obligation to disclose the information. By the same token the school administrators are also required to uphold the same obligations. The police could definitely obtain a warrant to search your phone regardless of whether or not anything had been found. Theyll argue that the information you stated was on your phone had been deleted and will obtain their warrant and then use software to extract deleted information pertaining to your disclosure. If you were brought to court your lawyer could argue among other things statute of limitations since you stated it was a past crime and could argue that since you hadnt been mirandized anything you said prior to being arrested if you were isnt admissible.
