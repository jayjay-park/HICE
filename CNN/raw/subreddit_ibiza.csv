10903847,0,t3_5vqqk2,Hi there.Its called Cova Santa and its one of the very best spots on the island. A quick google image search will show you.For any of the big events you really need to book in advance. Even with tickets itll take you a while to get in as the queues are mad. Unless you get there really early I mean while there are still plenty of families with kids there early youre going to have a long wait and an uphill walk from the parking areas. But it really is a special place.I hope you and your friends have lovely time. ,ibiza,de4nk9l,3,t5_2rncx

11545110,0,t3_64ric1,Dont quote me on this but I think most of the opening parties start memorial day weekendend of may. Im sure there will be a bunch of seasonal workers there partying but youll be missing most of the good parties arriving that early. Check out Ibiza Spotlight for events ,ibiza,dg4n24m,1,t5_2rncx
