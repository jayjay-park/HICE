2288712,0,t3_2lffsd,Short answer  no.long answer  soon hopefully we just need old people to die research to be done and people to realise that its a huge source of income. people will generally ignore their moral opposition to something if it means they get a big ol chunk of money.,ExplainLikeImHigh,clulnk7,26,t5_2sqg2

4136039,0,t1_crpkl5f,I disagree with above.  Kids are more brutally honest then anyone.  If you are a real uggo all your peers have been telling you since kindergarten.  Bet.  You ever hear a kid that just saw his first black person or amputee or something?  Why is that lady brown?  why does that man only have one arm?  Loud as fuck in the grocery store embarrassing the shit out of their mom.  Grade schoolers have even less tact with each other.,ExplainLikeImHigh,crrq7b1,3,t5_2sqg2
7394497,0,t3_4gjudh,idk its like a bunch of programmed codes that enables technically a mechanically and or digitally structured entity to exercise and or express intelligence. To exercise intelligence is to use whatever tools youve got eg. humans have the  senses to draw out a logical conclusion. To express intelligence is to make a choice based on the said conclusion and act upon it. But then you can say that the way you deposit a check through your cellphone is using AI. It is true that this string of codes is able to use the visual data from the camera analyze the patterns on the piece of paper and match it to preexisting database to produce a successful deposit but is that what we would like to deem as intelligence? Average Joe on the street hears artificial intelligence and they will imagine something that closely imitates human behavior. It takes humans years of trials and errors to get them to the present moment and to do what they do well and when a nonbiological entity is able to achieve something equal to or greater than or maybe even close to equal! what an average Joe can achieve it is captivatingly fascinating. So we like to consider what mimics the logical process of a human being. The thing is we cant build an AI that does not use human logic because we can only code functions that we understand how and why they work the way they do. Of course youd be able to achieve much more productivity with an AI as they dont necessarily have to have any other processes of human biology except logic. AI doesnt need to sleep cry vent laugh eat shit and yadiyadiyaha. But we all know that the scifi fantasy part of our imagination wants manifestation of an artificial consciousness instead of intelligence. A being that identifies itself as an individual and exercises free will. Capable of being unpredictable. Capable of learning and understanding abstract ideas and emotions. So we can superficially say that AI can be many different things to people in different industries but my standard for an AI is more than enough with this being able to deposit a check with my cellphone.tldr AI is dope.edit grammelling,ExplainLikeImHigh,d2ipenl,2,t5_2sqg2
