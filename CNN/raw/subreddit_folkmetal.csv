1565965,0,t1_cjcdn8l,Thats not the problem its the part where there is literally nothing in this video that separates it visually from any other Eluveitie vid. I get wanting to showcase the scenery and nature but if thats your goal then make those sweeping landscape shots last longer and have more impact. Let us fly over the mountaintops and climb through the forests dont just show us footage of the band pretending to play a song for the millionth time.,folkmetal,cjckfba,3,t5_2s8f5

2307435,0,t3_2lpaar,Great cover! The instruments are a bit out of sync sometimes around  for example but overall it sounds very nice.I like the idea putting Tumman Virran Taa before Smoking Ruins the transition was seamless.It sounds like youve got some talent as a multiinstrumentalist.,folkmetal,clwwyxv,1,t5_2s8f5

3540965,0,t1_cpv7gn2,Wait... what? Someone from faun left for schandmaul? Who was it? I know Elisabeth Pawelke left... Im not sure about schandmaul though unless its a different singer from faun...On faun though I think they sound fine with either of the singers. I only know of Elisabeth and... the new one I think her name is Katja? Its kind of nice their music isnt so... for lack of a word... dark.Edit TIL faun fans and nightwish fans have something in common. Never thought I would say that. Just my two cents no offense.,folkmetal,cpvw53l,1,t5_2s8f5
