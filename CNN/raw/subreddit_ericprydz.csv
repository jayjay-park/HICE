87887,0,t3_1uq6x4,Why is everyone assuming hes going to release a new album? I hate to burst the bubble but the degree to which this is unlikely to happen is nearly infinite. Think about his release schedule his history with LPs his propensity for keeping IDs unreleased and untitled etc. Once youve regained your rationale think about his lack of merchandise the likelihood that EPIC wont stay gone his knack for planning largescale stakesraising blowout parties etc. Its just so much more probable that hes booking a giant tour designing some special merch to rival rericprydzs organizing a concert to ends all concerts or something else. Im not saying an album cant happen but considering he released his first  years into Pryda I doubt there will be another sprouting  years later. ,ericprydz,ceofnzp,2,t5_2u5r3

I think I actually used a Pyda kick in the track to be honest. PrydzGod!This is all amazing to hear and I might start producing again because of this.

5971110,0,t1_cy2aua0,Yeah I attended EPIC . as well and quite frankly Im glad I did because I wonder if well ever see Prydz in a big venue like that outside of a festival. It was the perfect experience with the right amount of people on the dance floor. Its hard to see him at a club and not have it be packed to the point where you cant move. Terminal  has a lot of space but in different areas. There is a main floor and then two levels of balconies on the sides. The main floor will surely be packed so the best spots might be the balconies but make sure to get there early. I went on a Thursday night for Duke Dumont and the place was packed and hot. I decided to fly out to LA for his EPIC . show at Palladium so well see how that one goes as well! If he by chance does one in Amsterdam at Gashouder I would definitely fly out for that!!!,ericprydz,cy2cdjp,2,t5_2u5r3
