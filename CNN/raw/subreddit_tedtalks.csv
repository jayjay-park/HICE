600985,0,t3_210irr,I was hoping for more of response than terrorism is bad and we need to do all we can to stop it. The speaker made a great point when he mentioned the chance of being killed by terrorists is less than the chance of being killed by lightning.  Im all for the NSA protecting us from nuclear annihilation but this blanket response of trading Constitutional rights for a feeling of security needs to stop.,tedtalks,cg8l33b,4,t5_2qi7j

Humanity is protected by Federal Regulations with Medical Rights and Privacy Rights that can be used by anyone in the world with a medical record in the USA.Tell the FCC about Net Neutrality amp Healthcare Regulations amp Net Neutrality is about the cost of communications. If an ISP Internet Service Provider can charge more for Netflix and other services how much cost to call a doctor?Federally Protected Medical Rights give you a voice in the battle for Net Neutrality. You have the right to choose how you communicate with your Healthcare Provider Business Associates and Covered Entities.  The legal definition of Covered Entity extends to anyone that can access your health information or identify your health services.ISPs are able to access and identify your traffic on the Internet. This makes them Business Associates and enables you to use your Medical and Privacy Rights.You have the right to tell Business Associates to stop accessing your information. This puts a stop to them charging you more for Netflix and other services.They are prohibited from retaliating by disabling or denying service. These rights and protections are written into Federal Regulations. Please sign the White House Petition! If you have any questions we have been researching this topic for several years for a Human Rights documentary. amp ,tedtalks,cmjcppx,2,t5_2qi7j

3460484,0,t1_cpmoq5p,It is long but I think her Vanity Fair piece is well worth a read. It would offer a lot of clarity and nuance to the concerns you seem to be having here.Imagine someone is attempting to establish some sort of career or make a lasting mark on the world. Then to have the sum total of ones career achievements be a month of a Jenny Craig campaign that got pulled early for the same reason theyve been unable to get hired anywhere else . . . well a debate over the semantics of what counts as being hired is unhelpful to say the least.,tedtalks,cpmpyk7,4,t5_2qi7j
