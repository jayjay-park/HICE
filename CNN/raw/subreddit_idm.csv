73555,0,t3_1uw3du,Them what kind of music do you listen too?Me idm! Stuff like Aphex twin.Them never heard of it whats it stand for?Me intelligent dance music...And then I sound super pretentious for not only having a genre theyve never heard of for a favorite genre but the name having intelligent in the title. Then I try and back pedal by saying I actually prefer the term braindance because calling a genre of music intelligent sounds so I sound even more pretentious... Bleh.
