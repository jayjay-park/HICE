But the simple fact is that this is the way things works. Compare that with a scene in a movie.

356364,0,t3_1xgokh,gt I could just use a guide to find out where they were if so inclined and knew they were all available to me rather than having to maybe do my own research.You cheated and therefore thinned the reward for yourself. For example if there is a code you can punch in to get all items in the game it will never be as rewarding as obtaining them yourself.The rare items you talk about in your MMO example most people never get to experience either. Youre targeting the most hardcore of players first to beat boss the . if you will. So its not really a fair comparison. For example you could grant a rare item for the first person to beat a boss after the games release and give out a special item. It may even be fascinating to read about but most people will never experience that. Its a moot point to most.My observation is youre trying to target the wrong crowd. Youre trying to reward the hardcore players instead of the majority of your audience. What if in mario only the first person to beat the game ever got fireballs. Cool story but doesnt really matter to most players at that point.Just throwing a different perspective your way as food for thought.,gamedesign,cfhpc6e,1,t5_2qimq
375024,0,t1_cfjjhwi,I also feel that customization is a big reason  building your dream city with a milllion tvtowers or your dream pizza with one pepperoni and salmon. If making cool things happen is really hard then planning how to make your budget or whatever just right and seeing your plan work out can be really satisfying. So I guess making room for the player to make their own goals is pretty important. And often also finding the right balance in whatever you are building can be really fun. You have to build the right buildings to make your city work but everytime you fix one thing another thing becomes unbalanced and so on. So what Im trying to get at is probably that the most important thing is to create a solid system where all the parts affect each in a meaningful way while still keeping the game challenging. I guess that actually goes for most game types but hope it helps anyway. Sidenote Ive designed a few of those game for iOS  Theme Park for EA is probably the most famous one I worked on.

My second thought would be a game that requires you to focus on one thing specifically but you would also need to be peripherally aware of your surroundings.

595534,0,t1_cg7ewit,Itemization  To be honest this kind of item effect is exactly what put me off of the game. Increasing your damage is fine and all but it really doesnt change the game play at all. For comparison lets look at a D item and a D item.For a D item heres the Manticore This crossbow is quite good but all it does is give you damage. It does give an awful lot of damage and you will kill things much faster... but thats about it. For D at least prerework for items you just looked for damage boosts or defense boosts from stats or resists. Good items were all rather similar in effect.For comparison lets look at the Buriza Wow! Hits freeze targets?  chance to pierce? Those are some interesting effects. Suddenly all my skills give me crowd control and piercing hit synergizes well with a few of my skills. I can build around this weapon.The most exciting modifiers for me at the very least are often not those that just give a damage boost but effects that actually alter my skills and how I can go about playing the game.Enemies  Ive played a bit of the rework just a bit of level  torment and to my knowledge havent come across anything with resistances. Its very possible that I just didnt notice the resistance which doesnt speak much for the change...Regardless having resistances present in a game usually doesnt mean you have to respec. For D in particular it is supposed to be a party based game. If something resists your damage type you can have your friends take it out for you or even your mercenary. Worst comes to worst you can always just run past the monster.In D there were items and skills that you could utilize to reduce monster resistancesimmunities so that if you built or geared for it you eventually would be able to deal with most monsters. Alternatively you could choose not to pidgeonhole into one element and never have to deal with monster immunity having access to more than  skills was definitely relevant here.,gamedesign,cg7ysh9,2,t5_2qimq

659203,0,t3_21mzcq,There is was? this company called  systems they came up with an algorithm that would watch gameplay stats during alpha and tweak the cost of castingattacks based on usage. So if everyone used fireball cause it was OP the algorithm would nerf that ability and boost every other ability by a little bit. This would go on for months and the idea would be that you would keep running this until it hit equilibrium then your game was balanced. You would then lock in those numbers and ship.I always thought that the algorithm could be kept in the game and worked into the lore. Something like what Aegar posted where each element of magic becomes weaker by a little bit when its used and all other forms become stronger but for the world instead of each player. This way theres no such thing as looking up the best minmaxing since the more people using the build the less effective that style of fighting is. But that will still hit equilibrium even in a live game so you add three other factors.Each particular move has a few attributes that it shares with other moves. For example direct damage moves are giving better than average performance but fire is being overused. So the firebolt spell is going to give you better damagecost less than the AOE Gout of Fire overused and causing the dip in Fires worth or the placed Fire Trap spells ice traps are popular. This Best if there are many attributes more than the two in the above example and there are tons of variations of attacks and it takes directed grindingpractice to unlock specific ones.Non damage effects like fire causes particle effects that make it hard for the caster to aim Ice can only be cast while standing still Electric attacks can only be cast while in the air etc so that the player is limited to the skills they actually have like the ability to aim or predict enemy movement. This way you could be the only guy in the game who can bunny hop head shot so your attacks are more powerful since no one else is watering them down.New moves are introduced and old ones put in the vault which throws everything out of whack for a while and the game becomes figuring out the new world order now that Ice is out and Wind is in.Obvious drawbacks are that respecing must be simple if not downright easy. Something like Loadout where you have to earn a gun piece through xp but then you can use it whenever with whatever gun in whichever loadout you want to use that day.TLDR Every time a move is used the world becomes a little more prepared for it and the power its drawn from weakens so the move becomes a tiny bit less effective. The game becomes either finding a playstyle that no one else uses adding an Explorer hook to the usually Killer centric PvP world or becoming a loadout day trader a Social player who knows what is overused and underused this week and rides the bubbles and crashes in power use.,gamedesign,cgf78ua,2,t5_2qimq
712639,0,t1_cgl2kex,well then wed probably gravitate towards actual player skill getting better. In that case the fighting mechanics of the game would have to be very fine tuned so that you can only get far in the game if youre really really good at it. You can include customization and material items that are tierless and have it be up to the player to decide which set of items is actually best for them. Games like these are very difficult to make though. They require months of playtesting at the very least.If you want to make a game like that I would look at something like Spelunky which again is not quite an RPG but operates on this principle in a d platformer setting and most items arent really tiered you get them randomly times so theres no natural progression.

GTA shenagins or fastpaced FPS games focus on this.  Your chess destruction falls here.Strategic games have meta mechanics that our mind must master.  We can plan out complex strats in chess this way.Creative interaction relies on having potential not to simply interact but to build.

How do you convey interactability without outright telling it to the player.

1162463,0,t3_27fruu,Sure idle games are games.  How idle are we talking though?  Fantasy football and tower defense games can be considered idle.  So could slot machines and horse racing.  Some of the games that are normally considered idle games e.g. Candy Box and A Dark Room are not idle games just pointandclick games.What is and isnt an idle game isnt really well defined either semantically or conceptually.  Conceptually there is no such thing as an idle game because a game is inherently interactive.  But that doesnt mean there arent games with ridiculously little interactivity e.g. slot machines.  They just tend to have little merit and expectantly wont garner much respect from designers who are trying to create meaningful experiences.A Dark Room is a great game.

1163195,0,t3_26msge,I dont believe there is an optimal number of choices for a player but I do believe there is an optimal level of complexity in choices and choice branches for each player player. Why  of choices alone cannot be the core designIf a game offer   or  choices but each choice is easily calculable in the mind for any player then the process of determining the optimal choice isnt interesting. The more choices you add the more it just becomes a big homework assignment for players to do in their minds.Why complexity and depth of choice is a better design philosophyChoices are only fun if they are meaningful and have the right level of complexity too difficult and its no longer a choice but rather a guess too easy and there is no choice but just one right answer. Thus we should try to design systems that allow for different levels of choice analysis for different player types. Players who want an easier experience can analyze and make level  choices where as players who want a deeper analytic experience can think more about the level  choice outcomes what new they will lead to those new choice potential outcomes and so on and so forth. Design like this allows each players experience to be better tailored. Players who want to think a lot can and players who dont want to think too much dont have to and arent punished for it. Tangent about game balance in competitive strategy games As far as game balance goes in a competitive strategic game I would say the deeper and more complex a player is able to correctly make decisions the more they should be rewarded. However the rewards should be diminishing in order to keep competition healthy and close among the playerbase overall. That is the biggest benefits to making choices come from the lowest level of analysis where as the benefit amount gained from deeper analysis is much less in comparison.,gamedesign,ci0h8w4,1,t5_2qimq
1182597,0,t1_ci0j6rr,gt seRe  Agreed that in general games especially console have recently past  years been more and more focused on visual fidelity rather than actually gameplay. Re  I agree with you from a technical perspective story cant add to a game because story doesnt actually interact with the game. Its not a mechanic and therefore cannot effect anything within the game. However from the perspective of player experience which is all that matters right? it can be important. The way I look at game design is to first think about the player experience Im trying to create and then go about designing mechanics user flow UI etc around that. If story can lend itself to better create the user experience Im going for then I think it should be considered carefully as well. Re  I dont  agree that people play games to play as you say. I think people play games for the experience and sitting and watching cut scenes is part of that experience. Often cut scenes perform another necessary function in a game a relaxation period. Example In Starcraft players might be engaged in an intense mission for upwards of  minutes. If there were no cutscenes or interludes then players would have no rest period and the game would likely be too intense and players would  selfimpose breaks on their own.

For the messenger hawks does it limit the amount of movement by a turn or by time? What I mean is it a Turn Based Strategy with a limited amount of movementorders per turn to prevent long turns which it sounds like or does this add a sort of ATB style system to an RTS? Do the Units get to be controlled manually or are the orders set and they perform them by an AI? Are the kings present on the battlefield? It sounds like it since you want it to chesslike  King falls game over etc. I would suggest giving the Kings names stats and abilities of their own however not super strong units you would want to take out like in Warcraft  Are units preset in an area or is there an economy macro game associated with the game? Preset would require Micromanagement to be a big factor and hardautomated controls could be seen as a detriment to the player. If you lose because of controls the user will not like the game even if the controls are the feature of the game. How long is a match supposed to last? Since you want an RTS and not turn based it would mean that if  it takes a considerable amount of time it has to be done in a single sitting assuming multiplayer or with save files etc. Im of the belief that iPadIOS games are best available to be either fast or paced at your speed so I would suggest turn based combat. What is your monetization structure for the game? What are the elements for growthimprovement that will get the player to continue to play the game? Why should they keep playing? What world do you want to build? Is this a high fantasy DampD style monsters and magic game or a Game of Thrones almost entirely realistic with elements of supernatural rarely available?I have been thinking about this off and on for the better part of the day and there are a lot of things that would be interesting to add to it however Id like to know if were on the same page for a lot of concept ideals.,gamedesign,cidtb3j,2,t5_2qimq

1414567,0,t3_2abxqa,I  disagree that failure in a game needs to be under the players control or the game becomes onerous.Id suggest a game like FTL as a counterpoint.  There are situations you can get backed into where there is absolutely no way that the player can win a battle or continue in the game running out of fuel being one of the big dangers on that count.  But despite the fact that you can easily end up failing by no fault of your own you just took a path on a map that didnt have fuel options or you ran into a string of encounters you couldnt win etc. you as the player realize clearly that you just got put in a situation that was impossible and you load it up and try again.  In a significant way I think that games where failure states are nearly inevitable are better projections of what life is like.  There are times in life where things are just shitty.  Games that mirror this allow us to train ourselves for the perseverance that we need in the rest of our life instead of coddling us with an illusory amount of control.,gamedesign,citlfhi,2,t5_2qimq

When you are rendering all you need to convert to a float is an objects position orientation and size based on the position your rendering at. Also you can scale down everything to be able to render to fit nicely within the acceptable bounds of a float. For physics you can convert the scene into a some sort of Rtree using the fixed point number to find the best broad phase points to convert objects to.,gamedesign,cjdpe00,1,t5_2qimq
1632496,0,t1_cjkwafo,Exactly. This idea of not having an actual concrete goal beyond be better than ever is fundamentally flawed. Especially since its often used in singleplayer games and to even have the necessary uncertainty for a game to function longterm they need some sort of randomness. This makes reaching a highscore a matter of restarting enough times to get a favorable randomization. Further once you get such a particularly favorable seed youll basically almost never win again because you cant beat that score even if youve become a better player actually i.e. feedback is messed up. Then matches last longer and longer the higher your average scores youre in a sense punished for playing well. Every game has an optimal match length determined by the length of its tension arcs. And a highscore survive as long as you can game doesnt respect that at all. In the end just having highscores often results in the player playing designer and choosing a goal somewhat arbitrarily. Do I go for one more point than before? Or just for as many as possible? Am I content with a top  rank? Who knows. All in all I dont think its ever a good idea to use the highscore model instead of prescribing a goal thats tightly connected to your core gameplay concept. The latter is of course a complex problem and thus part of a good game designers job.It all gets worse when you add strategy decisionmaking to your system. You cant quite form longterm strategy too well around this idea of get a highscore. Youre missing a clear and coherent match structure. The most important aspect though is that risk management becomes completely trivial. If your goal really is to reach the highest score ever you just maximize every possible risk obviously.

1657693,0,t1_cjn4mkv,Usebased systems can work if implemented in a way that rewards the player in the same way traditional systems work.Lets say an enemy awards  XP total.  Each attack with a sword takes a portion of that  total and adds it to the temporary sword exp pool.  Each fireball its hit with adds a portion of that  to the temporary fire magic exp pool.  And each time you cast heal while fighting that enemy takes a portion of that  and adds it to the temporary healing magic exp pool.  When the fight is done the temporary exp pools get added to your actual experience levels.  You hit the enemy  times with a sword for  of its HP hit the enemy  times with a fireball for  of its HP and healed yourself  times for  of your own HP.  Total work done by your skills is  with sword damage being  fire magic damage being  and healing magic being .  Using this simple example Swords gets  exp fire magic gets  exp and healing magic gets  exp and the character level gets  exp.  You can also tweak this by adding multipliers to the exp gain in each category or changing how work is determined each fight to better balance it.I dont see how this system can be exploited.  Since each fight can only award so much exp theres no way to farm actions for more exp.  For instance you could farm healing potentially by just healing yourself over and over but you couldnt get more exp than the enemy is worth altogether so why not kill it faster and move on.  The designer can adjust the exp rewards so that the optimized method of progression is to simply kill the enemy and move on to the next.Another issue is what the skill levels do.  Skill levels should be tied to accessibility more than power.  This way you open the game up to jackofalltrades types.  Do you want to use the meteor spell?  At fire magic level  itll cost you  of your mana.  At fire magic level  it costs you .  Do you want to wield that greater zweihander of demon slaying?  Youll miss your attacks  of the time at sword level  but only  of the time at sword level .  You could also group skills into larger categories and smaller subcategories.  Melee weapons skill group is tied to the accessibility of all melee weapons with the sword sub category adding a small bonus to sword damage or hit chance.  Use a sword the exp is added to the melee weapons and swords use an axe exp is added to melee weapons and axes etc.I think usebased systems can be very fun and rewarding its just a matter of balancing them and implementing them in a less exploitable way.,gamedesign,cjo45oh,2,t5_2qimq

1834549,0,t3_2fjcek,Ive always liked Soul Caliburs counter attack mechanic. They call it Guard Impact .It is very hard to pull off and requires a lot of focus and reading the enemys moves. One of the reasons it is hard is that you have a very and I mean very short period of time to deflect the incoming attack. If memory serves the window you have for countering can be as short as .s ms.The result is that you break the momentum of the fight for a while and have a chance for a free attack albeit a minor attack which really balances itself out.It can either help you get out of a tight spot and allow for repositioning or break through obvious attack patterns.You should definitely check up some videos of that. It is much better when in seen in action.,gamedesign,cka9b2x,2,t5_2qimq

1942298,0,t1_ckmhv0t,Hey Im EU. The description that ulordswaglett has given you of our team is pretty superficial based on first impressions. I suppose the post is more about a rant of the members rather than the real underlying problem. Organization and structure. I dont really have a problem in admitting that Im a tad shallow when I have to assess from first impressions. Ill try to address some of the issues you brought up. gt gt Who cares if the lover Im really pissed you dont use names... and NG pick each other up? If thats what makes them comfortable and work better then whats the problem?I really dont have a problem with this at all. If it makes them work better they can get married in the club. Ill ordain the wedding myself. The problem is they distract each other too much and prevent each other from doing work. gt EUs ego is ridiculous and while I dont want to assume youre the same you seem to be on his side so I can draw conclusions that you probably have similar views and behaviours otherwise youd be as angry as I am about this feedback.This post isnt a genuine representation of the situation. The problem is the wording of it all. We have a skewed perspective of the whole thing because we were present at the meeting. The problem is my profiling of the entire club seems to be the dominant topic in the post rather than the actual problem which is promoting structure and organization.gt My advice is that both EU and yourself need to act more maturely and more open to other peoples existences. Or just quit because I sure as hell wouldnt want to work with EU from what Ive seen here.Yes we do indeed need to work more maturely. As you can see from the previous paragraphs Im a shallow motherfucker if all I have to work on is first impressions. gt Outside of your teams obvious leadership issues if you have a problem with ideas guys and no doers then you just have to look harder or try converting the ideas guys into doers. If someone is passionate theyre probably willing to learn. Youre not working at Valve here you cant expect to find great programmers artists and designers just wandering around school. All of these fields take years of experience and your expectations are too high.When making this club our expectations were not high at all. We didnt expect professionals to show up with portfolios rather we were preparing a way to teach the entire club the program we were using and how we were going to approach the whole thing. We just expected people to actually give a damn about making a game. We didnt get passionate people we got people who tote around an idea and want others to make it into a game. However Im not going to rest until I can make all of them into legitimate doers who not only have the knowledge to make this game but to make games in their future careers.Overall the post is incorrect. The members arent the problem. The actual problem was respect of fellow members organization and discipline. The meetings we had were complete clusterfucks. People interrupting each other constantly not respecting others opinions and general disorder. As you can see from the original post we have some ideas to quell it and promote organization. I may be an asshole but I can damn well assure you that Ill treat everyone in this club with respect that they deserve. Im not above anyone in this group and I wont let that idea stand.Sorry for the bad impression. Hopefully I can change it over time.

1995217,0,t3_2hk1e7,I like what you call the MaB style. I dont think you want to force players to tack upwind all the time. In a map view this can be abstracted as a slowing down when going into the wind. This is how games like Sid Meiers Pirates or New Horizons do it. You could even show all the tacking if you want but just make it automatic in the map view.For the battle mode it doesnt matter as much you can decide what you want. Personally Id love to see a more realistic example since Im so tired of games getting even the basics of sailing wrong like what the fastest point of sail is for a triangle sail.Sailing can get very tedious in games.

2084195,0,t3_2ir6ak,The answer really depends on what kind of idea youre talking about. If it was a tweak to a feature or aspect we just have someone throw it in. In this case it seems like youre talking about a premise for a whole game?I think one of the best ways to get to all of your core mechanics is by stepping through the flow of the core loop of your game. This could be a level in a platformer or shooter a session in a mobile game a mission in an open world game. Its pretty variable.Be specific The player chooses to fight with the NPC. The player selects between rock paper or scissors. The players choice is displayed. The NPC makes a similar choice which is then displayed. Victory is determined by the following algorith rock gt scissors gt paper gt rock. Show the results of victory.Now you have a text flow. Make a mockup of how the screen actually looks at each relevant stage. Now you should have a list of interactions that you need to happen visuals that have to be made so on. Then you get to prototype based on this outline and youll find out even more things youve forgotten. Then you get to play it all through and probably change everything. Welcome to game design. If its really complicated to program play through your core mechanics with paper. Even flipping through a bunch of mockups in the correct flow is better than nothing.If youre looking for anything more specific in terms of design tools and tricks it would help if you could specify exactly what these ideas of yours are. At the very least scale and category. I offer the same caveat that all inexperienced designers need to hear no one is going to steal your idea.

Perhaps then if anybody here finds it a waste of time they could share it with their game design interns or aspiring designers at their alma mater to those that will embrace the chance to include winning a competition on their portfolio as a source of pride. Or to those who will find the fun in it.Although I do have to ask if this is seen predatory and negative why does the graphic design industry continue to do it? There must be people submitting.Do you really see a business model here to steal away your thoughts run away with them and make billions? Quite frankly I would not be making a Text RPG if that was the intent. In fact the whole focus on the Text RPG was to create a game that was legitimately all about the story because I am all about the story in a game no flash just emotions and meaning behind everything  something the industry fails at or the gamers dont demand enough of.Any other opinions on this competition as it has moved away from an announcement to a legitimate design question nowWhat are the pros cons and legitimacy of starting a competition targeted at a small portion of your games design?To that point what about having players pay for your alpha game to essentially test it for you for free and paying you at the same moment?

2581373,0,t1_cmuahcv,Huh. Ive been reading allot about Dwarf Fortress and as soon as I read Rabbit Town a spark went off and a smile. And youre right my mentions are strategy games. However Im not sure if its what Im looking for  maybe it is.I keep having these wet dreams about building what I call to be a living world. A semi idle part hardcore game as in deep learning curve. Heres what Im currently thinking about. Heres my  minute pitchYou as a player are a devil. You mirror yourself onto a world in the form of reflections or basically characters. Theyre you but they can die while you live. You can have many or few whats best depends on how you want to play the game.Each reflection is equivalent to a hero in say WOW or a champion in DOTA. It has its own gear bags to carry stuff skills spells and so on. Basically an RPG character that grows stronger over time via tasks. A reflection draws energy from you to perform a said task. Tasks like crafting fighting and even moving across the world all takes time to complete so anything your reflections do hence you draws both energy and takes time. Your reflections can be grouped and thus you can roam as a party. You can have multiple groups if you want big or small. However f you have lots of reflections youre going to need allot of energy. Without enough energypool to make use of your force theyll be idle and unused. So theres a balance there to be adaptedmanaged to your liking.Now to gain a bigger pool or energy you need to persuade a villagecity that youre the god to worship  the alpha and omega. The people NPCs will worship you only if you gain enough reputation. You gain reputation through gifts maybe quests maybe by fending off an attack. The more villages you maintain the more energy you gain also bigger energypool. On the other hand the more you have the harder it is to defend.Reflections can permanently die and losses all hisher stuff. Anyone can corps loot them. A village can resurrect but that will put your energy gains on hold for the duration. And the stronger the reflection to be resurrected the longer the resurrection takes  so its an energy and time investment of sort.Theres no instancing just proximity. Any given reflection can only move charge up a spell so fast. So the goal is to have an almost Heroes of Might and Magic setting but instead of instanced fights between two or more players its out in the wild and anyone can join in. However because its heavily time oriented one can plan for events ahead. In example I this player a group of  about X units away from me  given their level I can assume heshe reaches my village in maybe  days. I can either reinforce it with more troops engage midway or flee. Its supposed to be highly tactical but slowpaced. My wish is for us older gamingdudes to be able to play something inbetween everyday chores.A village has NPCs. You want to defend them because every NPC is a worshiper  aka. an energy source. You can bring weapons armour to give your little worshipers some defence power. In other words if youve done your work your village might be able to defend an attack without you being present with your reflections. This basically creates in my mind player generated world bosses. They have just the same limitations as a reflection time. And whenever an NPC is doing something its time not spent in church. Which again negates your energy income. You cannot control NPCs move command but you can teach them stuff such as crafting recipes you know the standard MMO stuff but different and you have no part the actual doing. Your reflections you can take anything you want from the villagers  but overdo it and they might loose faith in you. Better yet maybe you find a rich village with allot of ltwhat you needgt gain their trust if possible take everything and leave it behind to crumble.Im imagining a VERY simplistic graphical representation. I dont care if its coloured pixels running around or ASCII characters or x sprites. I would much rather have gameplay depth than graphics. The less graphical stuff I tend to the more gameplay mechanics I can work on. I do however have a thing for nice looking and usable interfaces  but as far as ingame eye candy goes Im actually a little bit against it. Huh must be my age. My target is browsers anyway so...The ultimate long time goal is to develop a living world which youre a guest off. Trees grow over time theres a summerwinter cycle maybe and so on. If youre away for to long  all that is yours could be lost or it might as well have flourished nobody knows. Obviously the AI would be super simple and theres a lot of other technical issues Ill be dabbling with. But I dont have to worry about latency and I dont have to worry about graphical representation. Theres allot CPU into the continuous math obviously but that can be managed I believe like with sparse AI refresh rate. Population can be very low and yea Im a believer . Nothing Ill be done with within a month or two well maybe an technical . alpha . As I said in my OP this is to become my new pet project.So what are your thoughts? Maybe I painted a bit to big of a picture and I sound like the Im R biuld a MMO  if thats the case that wasnt the intention. Im foreseeing a maybe  players! And that would be enough awesome for me.,gamedesign,cmvitrt,1,t5_2qimq
2593583,0,t3_2ph4uh,This is a highly subjective question.  Using a heavy gas like chlorine the key factor is where are you?   Are you in a lowlying closedin area?  If so and if the parts per million of chlorine are fairly high the difference between going unconscious and dying are minuscule.If were talking a ventilated area its unlikely that unconsciousness will occur because the chlorine cannot accumulate in sufficient quantities.For the sake of argument however the MSDS lists chlorines STEL short term exposure limit at roughly  PPM.  STELs are usually in minute increments.   PPM is a fairly low amount assuming some kind of chlorine tank leak. So I suppose to answer your question in a roundabout way the low levels of concentration will begin affecting a person within fifteen minutes  start there and lower the time based on the amount of chlorine.  Do keep in mind that this is nowhere near exact without knowing the type of building the wind conditions if there are levels in the building or area lower than where you are the humidity and various other factors.

2680192,0,t3_2qkzd1,The concept of collection has nothing to do with it. The generic item is simply a marker for levelchallenge completion. You could increment a wholly abstract counter after each level is completed and youd accomplish the same mechanical effect.The choice that designers make here is between more or less structured learning experiences. The overworld map ala SMB  presents a dependency graph of levels the player must complete before being able to get to some challengethis means that the designer can design levels to convey the appropriate information for the player to have all the mental tools he needs to solve a certain level. The compare against a challengescompleted counter model is much looser and harder to reason about. A player might never do the challenge that introduces and trains them on a mechanic that theyll have to use later in the game to overcome a certain boss or some other chokepoint in the flow of the games levels.Disclaimer What follows is an abstract argument made by someone who neither plays nor designs the kinds of games under discussion. Its not meant to be some definitive commandment.I would make the argument that working based on counters instead of a level dependency graph damages the designers control over the players learning process such that its a worse overlying structure in the abstract. The overworld map style of overlying structure allows for tighter control and a more incremental tight difficulty ramp while at the same time letting the designer include optional challenges that the player can access at willl once the designer thinks theyll have the appropriate skillset based on what theyve completed already. Players have less choice in such a system but having a choice to potentially harm the difficulty ramp of the game doesnt seem like something acompetent designer should allow.,gamedesign,cn8f71p,3,t5_2qimq

3485298,0,t1_cpp2ifv,Well youd have some bonuses from state religions assuming you have one or more from cultural and racial similarities from policy alignments. Say you are both proponents of religious tolerance andor free trade. If you are both backing the same candidate for something whatever the position may be. Your opinions on magic and science may play a factor. Fostering may be an example of a personal relation. Youd have grown up knowing the ruler of the state in question and youd have a personal bonus there on top of the bonus for the fostering agreement. Im not sure if that qualifies as an answer. You get a relations boost from keeping your word both with that agreement and any agreement that is states have an opinion about whether you honor your word. Youd probably have bonuses from your actions similar to policy but also your alignment. Two benevolent rulers would have an opinion of the other based on how they treat their citizensnoblesetc.    As far as character focused stuff Im not sure you have to dive down to the CK level. Perhaps you foster your heir to someone like a liege of your favorite vassals but you could foster just as you marry hypothetical family members. Im not going to keep track of everyones nieces necessarily but when you have a marriage made to cement relations it would just be implied that it was something like that. And the same for hostages. As to how you deal with the fact that a player has no attachment to nonexistent characters its more the opinion everyone else has if you break trust. So you break treaty hostages may or may not get whacked but after two or three times people no longer trade hostages with you. States that trust you more would probably get a smaller penalty if you sacrificed hostages to a state neither of you had much opinion of. You may have an option to rate the importance of hostages when making the agreement and you both get a higher opinion bonus from that. Similarly an abstract rating of a foster trade.For scale overall Id expect a large map youll choose the size you want to have over  no seriously maybe up to  provinces. Compared to say the  in EU. On the other hand concrete characters may amount to perhaps  in the late game and at most perhaps  in the beginning. Although many people make lack a machine conducive to the largest maps. Assuming that every province was an independent state which is extremely unlikely youd have a ruler and heir I think  or  guild leaders and maybe  or  factors or merchants and then like rulers of religions or magic schools in maybe  in . So say  on a truly massive map but again super unlikely.

3804319,0,t3_33zkho,I disagree with a lot of what Frank Lantz says in this blog.For all four of the examples of games he brought up his argument that it didnt make sense for the games to be successful went something like this  The games core mechanics are suchandsuch.  These are inherently bad mechanics.  But this is a game designed entirely around those mechanics!  So the game was successful in spite of its poor design.So for example he tells us that boss battles and nice graphics are bad mechanics. Shadow of the Colossus was built around those mechanics so by rights it should be a bad game. But somehow it isnt!I think this way of arguing is wrong. In my admittedly limited experience its wrong to say that any particular game mechanic is inherently good or bad. Just about anything can be used as a core mechanic from boss battles to instantkill headshots to picking up trash Katamari to praying to the RNG gods Mario Party  Orange Juice many Bejeweledstyle casual games. So when Lantz picks out some game mechanics and says No good game design should ever use these mechanics I disagree with him.Furthermore good game design again in my limited opinion is taking these core game mechanics and focusing on deepening these mechanics as far as you can. So a good game like Shadow of the Colossus takes a couple of mechanics  boss battles jumping puzzles and good cinematography  and plays them as far as it can. Thats how the game gets its impressive minute struggles with the Colossi and why its so successful. Likewise League of Legends and CounterStrike are based around their highly complex combat and instant kill mechanics. Lantz even says that explicitly at one point  Luckily for us CounterStrike wasnt made by sensible designers it was made by unreasonable people who kept this unbalanced ingredient and evolved the rest of the game around it.In contrast a poor game tries to include too many game mechanics at once or does not adequately explore its core mechanics. Licensed games for example get a poor rep in part because they frequently try to be a mishmash of multiple actionadventure genres at once and end up exploring none of their mechanics in any particularly interesting ways.,gamedesign,cqpx8ji,1,t5_2qimq

Because playing games I like to complete a worlddungeon before I leave unless visiting other areas unlocks a hard restriction like obtaining a key for some locked door etc.Edit Thinking about it there are some cool ways to go about explaining the need for the different fuels. If it is a space game then they would travel to location to fill up on gas however the players race cannot survive within the area due to weather or lack of oxygen atmosphere.

4147432,0,t3_386lrt,I was just thinking about this after beating Ocarina of Time for the th time recently.  The Water Temple in that game is notorious but for different reasons that the typical water level issue I think.In OoT you have a blue tunic that lets you breathe underwater so time limits are never an issue.  The reason many people get frustrated in that level is because there are many small keys that are easy to walk right by and the level is so big that you may not find where you missed one.  This is made worse by the fact that changing the water levels is such a pain.  There are  spots at which you can change the height of the water in this dungeon spot A lowers it to the bottom B puts it in the middle and C raises it to the highest level.  Whats extra annoying though is that you can ONLY reach these spots in a particular order.  If the water is at the highest level and you want it to be in the middle you have to go to spot A lower it to the bottom then go to spot B and raise it back to the middle.  This means you are extra punished for missing or forgetting anything.  Even if you play the dungeon completely perfect you still end up going through this ABC cycle at least  times.  Its frustrating and its boring at times. I think water mechanics like limited breath puzzle objects that float or sink in water swimming to an area that couldnt be walked to etc. can all be interesting.  But too many developers just make water levels a dragged out pain where you walk slowly and you have to do a bunch of backtracking and bullshit that isnt very entertaining or challenging.  ,gamedesign,crt0tvz,1,t5_2qimq
4242553,0,t3_39hdeo,Your aforementioned game isnt necessarily a stream lined system. You complained about memorizing higher quantities of buttonskeys yet from what I understand I havent played El Shaddai you have to memorize combinations of buttonskeys. Maybe this is stream lined but it is still memorization. Essentially any actionreaction game Not puzzle or strategy games requires memorization of some nature. Reflexes are just muscle memory. Game sense is a memorization of timing within the rule set the game grants. On another note about stream lined control systems. Look at the Wii Sports games and other Mii based Nintendo games. Most of them excluding the Metroid Nintendo Land attraction have simple control systems because. They are motion controlled.. They have limited buttons.. The game reminds you which buttons to use throughout the experience.I individually consider the button lay out the aspect rather the soul of certain games part of the design and essential to the experience as in Monster Hunter while in other games a hindrance even an obstacle to how the game is supposed to feel Cant remember any examples atm..,gamedesign,cs3uc71,1,t5_2qimq

Id be interested to see a more expressive approach to the comparison of and discussion of the influences of RTS games like Warcraft on the mobile games like Clash of Clans within the analysis to give it depth and direction.   Think of what points you wanted to get across by discussing these games in the first place and work towards communicating them within each part of the analysis.  Throw in a lot of things that occur to you or you found clever or interesting as well.  This will also facilitate discussion.   Taking into consideration who your target audience is and using a tone and style that you would when talking with them also helps to give it the right feel.   Of course you should also get someone to give it a read through before you post as well to catch simple errors and give you their general feedback.

4592222,0,t1_ct9fi64,gtIt sounds like you are making a puzzle game and not a narrative one so you need to think about game mechanics and fail conditions.I disagree somewhat but overall you are correct. The narrative comes from understanding the events leading up to the murder. Yes some of it becomes evidence but there is a story behind each character and the family which is revealed throughout. Think something like MidSummer Murders where the story of the characters isnt necessarily vital to the mystery but often provides more interest to the viewer than the mystery itself. in b Checkovs gun not necessary when red herrings are a part of the story.gt If I fail in this game then it has to be due to me presenting the incorrectinsufficient evidence to the grand jury. As a result the grandy jury will declare the person I accused innocent whether or not this person was actually the culprit.Correct. Although the options given in the Parlor Scene will depend on what evidence the player keeps in the evidence locker. Its not just having the right evidence it is drawing the correct conclusions. Ive talked a fair bit about this with a mate that is a Snr Detective Constable. He lead me to the driving factor in the game assumptions. All the characters will have the evidence to present a case but will all bar the real culprit have one or two assumptions that are unfounded. IRL these assumptions will have a case dismissed or have the culprit found not guilty. That is what I want to replicate. Your suggesting that rather than ending the game on failure throw back to the investigation?

As a game ages and players know more about the game removing some of the luck from the game serves to better distinguish between good and bad players while leaving room for variation in games.Its a pattern you see in a lot of games early League of Legends had lots of room for randomness that no longer exists most notably age based dodges but also the change in Ashes passive v compared to v both stacked while you were out of combat starting at your crit hit chance and capping at  v was used when you attacked giving increased crit chance v was used at  giving you a guaranteed crit. Likewise Magic the Gathering has done a lot to smooth out land drops fetch lands dual lands etc. and as Poker has matured its moved from Fivecard Draw and other Draw games which have high levels of luck to HoldEm and similar games which have much lower amounts of luck.To answer the question from the OP I would start your game with some features of luck Maybe lower damage by a bit across the board but include critical hits which deal lots of extra damage as well as adding randomness the   you suggested but plan on taking it out at some point in the future.,gamedesign,cti26w0,1,t5_2qimq

I once wrote a design document for a client and he insisted I used user story even though he was never going to read it or need it because thats what he read one day in some popular business magazine and without any knowledge immediately assumed it was better. It was not  pages for what usually takes just  or . I thought I was going crazy writing all this unnecessary information down just because he lacked any kind of imagination on his own. I know its nice to read for nondevelopers but youre not making a document for nondevelopers and your time is very valuable to spend  pages on what could have been .

If you just want me to list the main thing that made the gameplay snap together in every good game Ive ever played well be here a while.  Every game has at least one gameplay thing going for it and Im sure I could point out a hundred such cleverly designed things in each of the best games Ive played.The really really really good examples of this are things that then became genre staples.  Like experiencing limit breaks for the first time in Final Fantasy  or the ability rotations with cooldowns in World of Warcraft.  But even looking at a mostly derivative game like Dragon Age  that does little different from its predecessor I can point to multiple things that are done well like The way you find an ingredient source in the wild and then you have  more of it forever to craft with makes the exploration feel a lot more rewarding and removes all the grinding from the crafting system.,gamedesign,cy58slc,1,t5_2qimq

6206268,0,t1_cyuuw5t,I agree with you to a certain point.  you are absolutely correct when you say game play is king.  i really am kicking myself now for not including in the video that the responsiveness and game play should still take precedence over animation and different animation blends.  that being said i still believe its very possible to have a balance between the two. at least when objects are moving dynamically they should have some sort of unique movement instead of a LERPd set of movements.for instance just on the topic of jumps.  you are right that the prince of persia jump would be totally unacceptable but at the same time the original mario jump which is widely known as the best platformer of its time is not LERPd as well.  when coming up with game feel i wont say that what i have in the video here is perfectly the answer because without being able to play a game its definitely entirely different.  more so i just want to believe there is a happy medium between the two ideas.with the way the Q would be setup it would be easier to hit someone going out and possibly harder to hit them on the way back.  without being able to fully test it im not sure if this is necessarily bad or just different.  if anything the things like foxfire or khazix jump are examples like you said could be adjusted and changed as the outcome doesnt really change as much.  so i cant say i can convince everyone that on skillshots it would be a good idea but at least opening the discussion for other aspects of the game would be good.  the last part is a bit of my insider knowledge and a bit of my experience in the industry as well.  i believe that riot does have user experience people there as well as great animator and even good designers.  but not one person that can encompass all  of those in a single role of design.  as the animations have good timing the client has some decent user experience and the design of the game is relatively balanced.  in my experience many designers dont come from animation or art backgrounds so these ideas on timing escape many people and many times people in companies dont get up and talk to each other.  so helpful information although available doesnt get talked about.  When it comes to the design i critique it so heavily because of the fact that the art and everything else is improving but game feel is actually getting worse in some aspects of league.  it was what made me quit because the characters i played felt less responsive.  so my goal in this video was to sort of point that out.  it is a little condescending though i wish i didnt make it so much that way looking back.when making this video i actually though about Ekko but whats cool about Ekko is that his Q is still LERPd and not like mine.  there just happen to be  different LERPd speeds. one on execution one when it expands and another to return.  its actually really clever and works really well for the type of spell he has.   however i dont think that solution could be used everywhere.you bring up a lot of good points and although i see where people are coming from i would really like to see it be played around with in game before i totally say its not possible.  if it feels clunky or unresponsive i will absolutely admit that changes shouldnt be made then but i think we can still make some abilities feel better and more polished.  ,gamedesign,cyv34hp,2,t5_2qimq

6380835,0,t1_czex2xq,gtGrinding in a game means repeatedly taking an action that grants you an ingame benefit while theres no significant risk involved. That means you are guaranteed to gain the affected resource while losing almost nothing. Its a completely safe way to success basically.What if that action is the game as it is in darkest dungeon? Or as TB suggests a football league.gtGrinding in itself is not interesting as it poses no gameplay challenge whatsoever to the player. However for the same reason its usually an optimal strategy giving you benefits with basically no significant potential disadvantage involved. An uninteresting strategy like that should never be a good or indeed optimal one.Are you defining grinding as an uninteresting action with no gameplay challenge or are you saying that any action which forwards your game without risk is uninteresting with no gameplay challenge?Unlocks based on achievements in basically any roguelite is completely risk free. Playing binding of isaac unlocks more items there is no risk involved as youre simply playing the game.gtinstead of just having to change one option in the main menu.An option menu difficulty in my opinion is a rather terrible way of adjusting difficulty. A weaker player choosing a lower difficulty will feel inadequate as the game bluntly tells you that youre playing on easy mode. And if said player plays on hard he will get frustrated. A way to adjust a difficulty in game by simply playing the game is much more seamless to the player. And players can set their own objectives such as finishing the game faster with less grinding if they feel they have improved after consecutive plays.It is true that when an optimal strategy presents itself players often take it. But Darkest Dungeon for example doesnt actually let you grind lower missions forever your heroes get strongerand refuse to go on lower level missions.  Also take for example Binding of Isaac. And optimal strategy could be to restart the level in order to get the best first item in the item room. People do this because they are trying to unlock real platinum god. But once they have unlocked everything they stop. They just play the game and have fun. There is no reason to grind restart the best first item because thats not what the game is about.You also seem to be alluding that the players objective is to win the game. Its not and shouldnt be. It should be to play the game and enjoy it. If the fun in a game is dungeon crawling then dungeon crawling cant possibly be opposed to the players objective. The objective isnt to finish darkest dungeon as soon as possible so you can move on to the next game thats silly.,gamedesign,czexl44,1,t5_2qimq

6501621,0,t1_czrri9f,gtIn option two what motivates someone to gather wood when they could choose not to and still have their needs met?If the needs of their community are already met and there is enough warmth and food for everybody there is no need to incentivize these people to work. When there is not enough heat or food to go around members of the community will be socially incentivized to address the issue. People might work longer or harder until things get better and if they see other people choosing not to work at all in this time of crisis they may come to resent them. Emphasis on choosing those who are unable to work do not make that choice. Those who do work might make it clear that those who choose not to must work and if they dont they may be ostracized. Or perhaps theyll be monitored closely and only allotted the resources they actually need and none extra even after the scarcity is resolved. Or theyll be run out of town. Or killed.How drastically a community would react to those people depends entirely on the severity of the crisis and the culture of the community. There are social mechanisms and there are also forceful violent mechanisms but I think its a mistake to assume these people will need to be dealt with in the first place. gtIs a sense of community duty strong enough to motivate the workers choose to work?There is more at play than ones duty to their community alone. Whether it is even considered a duty depends on your philosophical perspective. It makes sense that people would dislike working and prefer being lazy when they spend most of their free time working or the work is hard but there will always be some people who choose to work. People enjoy hunting why couldnt they enjoy hunting to sustain their community? Or instead of simply doing work as usual people may take time to innovate. They might design better saws or safer ways to climb trees or better ways to grow food so hunting isnt even necessary. Every culture instills particular values and behavior into its people but it can be difficult for us to realize the values that have been instilled in us. For a society like this to emerge among or from within a capitalist society people must undergo fairly large shifts in perception but thats only because its so contrary to the capitalist worldview.Its possible youre also overestimating the amount of work that actually needs to be done. Sure asking everyone who can to work  hours a week is asking quite a lot. But to ditch the whole fire analogy and to talk about the real world it should be noted that a lot of the work people do isnt necessary. We produce so many unnecessary products and services and a lot of the time this is just to make some company money. We do this because we need to earn money to survive. If the only work we had to do is the work that actually sustained our existence and people could use their free time to go above and beyond people could work on projects that theyre passionate about.I know this sort of thing sounds impractical and maybe impossible but I encourage you to entertain the notion and read more about it. Even if you dont see it as a viable in the real world its at least interesting in theory. Anarchy Works is a good introduction to Anarchism and its organized to address very common questions and criticisms much like what youve asked here. It also cites a variety of societies as realworld examples of these principles.Or if you think that kind of reading is too dry and political Id also recommend The Dispossessed Not as an argument for Anarchism but as a cool SciFi novel which includes just one example of what an anarchocommunist society might actually look like flaws and all.,gamedesign,czrteps,1,t5_2qimq

6791463,0,t3_48rks0,Hi there Im not a gave dev but I am a project manager with a wide variety of experiences in IT and medical research and I have a background in fundraising for business ventures.  First of all keep in mind that any business plan is essentially a sales pitch to an investor.  So you want to focus on how will you not only get your money back but make additional money as well in your message to them.  That does not mean you spend the whole time talking about money but rather how will these really awesome game features attract customers and induce them into opening their wallets.        Personally I disagree with the sentiments that you do not need to fully flesh out your business plan GDD.  You might not need specific numbers relating to how long this or that takes but you better realize that those numbers will interplay with a productionexperience flowchart which will absolutely impact gameplay.  So the more system pathways you lay out if not only in rudimentary detail but decently thought out concept the better chances you will have to avoid situations that would require new features to be added or entire systems abandoned just to ensure the game is both playable and fun.  It will happen anyway it happens in all projects but it will help you minimize the number of instances something like this happens which will be a BIG differentiator between the companiesprojectsteams that fail and those that succeed.  Also keep in mind that it is better to show  game systemsfeatures that are clearly well thought out than  features that are not. Other successful business people will take note of this.  One of the big sentiments from the developer side of game design is something similar to slap it all together and well fix it later which is fine for programming and probably for whatever executive is forcing that mindset but not ok for project managementwhich is what youre attempting to do.  TLDRFlesh out the game concept and the flow of the gameplay.  If there is an economy how many currency sinks and injectors do you have?  If there is crafting how many item classes and how do they interplay?  Can you buy the crafting components at a market place?  Do you only have to quest for them?  How do those items then impact the economy?  Do you allow for market pressure to increase prices?  Do you keep things static? you can always fiddle with the specific numbers and details lore for example at other points but if you dont have a decently conceptualized and diagrammed system you will run into unforseen problems that probably could have been prevented.

And Im talking noholdsbar wild ideas. Is the company going to sell healthy food? Be a monthly box of sex toys? Maybe well sell toys to kids or make animated storybooks! Put down all the ideas. It doesnt matter.From there choose which one grabs you. Youll know it when you find it. If none of them really resonate with you then theyre probably not the idea for you to spend so much time on.Another piece of advice and I know this ones hard to hear is about the fallacy of sunk costs. Its great that you have so much working. But if it doesnt get you to the end goal of the game you want to make scrap it. Keep it in the back of your mind for later games as every game idea can come back and be useful in the future. But it doesnt have to be useful now.As you know by now games do take a ton of time and effort and whatever you invest that much effort into has to truly speak to you.

Pisses me off.             GAMERS.         IF YOU DONT CHALLENGE YOURSELF THEN WHATS THE POINT?       Edit    Seems Ive struck a nerve here... Enjoy your rants people. If you think that games shouldnt punish you properly for dying thats fair enough. MOST games need to implement a better death strategy other than respawn and carry on or lose something that doesnt matter respawn and carry on.      FYI. Ive played Rise of the Tomb Raider and many many indie games... I completed RotTR in record time because I didnt fear death... Players should always fear death  otherwise what is the point of including deaths at all...?      Anyway I dont care enough to argue with you all  this is my opinion... Thats all.,gamedesign,d1372v9,-2,t5_2qimq
7098023,0,t3_4cqpn7,Here watch this video. Its basically exacty what youre talking about The key phrase in that video I think is asymmetric alliance  she needs him as much as he needs her.Id say the one aspect that video doesnt cover about good companions is how effective it was that Ico had to manually pull Yorda around by the hand. That physical contact helped the bond between the two amazingly.Also Shovel Knight spoilers! have you played Shovel Knight? Because the story of Shield Knight is amazing and heartbreaking and the final battle is amazing. Why? Because Shield Knight helps you after you helped her. You both need each other and youre both sacrificing for each other.Of course theres another way to look at relationships altogether. That of Brothers or GTA  where you control the different characters in turn. This is a different experience altogether as you dont necessarily view one as the companion to the other. Theyre more equals. You really have to think about if you want this to be from the viewpoint of one character or both.Also extra credit time go play this classic game about relationships and learn a ton ,gamedesign,d1kxjp2,3,t5_2qimq

So you sort of visualize the importance of planets. The planets seem too close together some of them even touching. It would be nice if there was more space to see when unit groups are traveling. For the zones that add bonusesboosts see if you can add add some symbol somewhere to communicate this eg a production boost zone could have very faint repeating factory texture in the background within the zone area or perhaps there could be icons at the border or maybe the border could look like a gear instead of dotted line Add some colorsymbolsorganization to separate the buttons into groups by type or tech level if theres some clear division here not sure if there is See if you can fix the jitter in the unitgtdestination lines somehow You could try making a parallax background to make the game look less flat a bit of depth feel to it. It could scroll around automatically over time or follow mouse somehow. Not sure if you had this but being able to add automated paths for units where all units move from A to B automatically as they appear in the source is useful especially if you increase the scale of the game If you can make the map scollablezoomable thats nice too even if the map is small by design.

7317914,0,t3_4fju1q,A big part of the mind games revolves around the operant conditioning of the opponent. Street Fighter Yomi and such contain a huge amount of decision points. Understanding what type of decisions the enemy is more likely to make based on their system mastery and game knowledge allows you to use more efficient options against them.            RPS example I play rock. Every time. Around five rocks in you try paper. You win. Next game I play rock. You play paper. I play rock. You keep winning by playing paper. Twenty papers beating rock in an average player feel like selecting paper rewards them. Then I play scissors and win. Huh you say. Unfortunately the  papers didnt matter the one scissors did  it allowed me to land the combo that killed you and won me the game. In a fighting game however its just one game of RPS where your mind is also keeping track of a dozen others. You teach the opponent to play paper when you play rock in that situation and then take advantage of it in a fastpaced match where they play paper on reaction at a critical juncture.      The mixup or the  is a situation where the enemy has to choose between two options. Putting the enemy into a mixup creates a state where I have a  chance of landing guaranteed damage. In optimal play everyone would be playing perfectly safe reacting in time and defending against every attack. The mixup forces a decision point with a chance for damage. It gives an opportunity to roll the die often skewed to the better players favor. Every time after I do a sweeping kick I follow with a low kick. You learn to block the low kick after a few tries. Then when the situation comes up again later your lizard brain blocks low while I consciously choose to play an overhead move that makes you take damage if you block low and gives me a huge advantage.    Testing the opponent is also a lot more about evaluating the other players game knowledge and reactions rather than their personality. You throw in a risky move that they block to see if they know that their specific character can get a little bit of damage in as a punish if they use a specific move in response. If they didnt use it you get a data point that says you can play a bit more aggressively against them because your system mastery is one step above theirs. You confirm this with a few more probes and then adjust your play style accordingly. This generally allows you to apply more pressure in the game. This also increases the value of approaches like frame traps where the opponent feels intuitively like they have a good opportunity to attack but get punished if they try.    There is also a very strong narrative component to fighting games but usually its the tilt that makes a weaker players focus falter. Youve learned to play paper to my rock then I play scissors and win. Youre dumbfounded how did that happen? Did he outplay me? Did he know Id block low? A player concentrates tells himself to be careful so he wont get fooled again. Then the situation comes up again he figures he knows what the opponent is going to do but its a ! He chooses wrong and takes the damage! Oh no the enemy is inside the players head! The enemy knows what the player is going to do! Doomed! He has lost! And that sort of demoralization often leads to misplays that the stronger player capitalizes on.   Its not magic its just basic psychology.  ,gamedesign,d29zwlq,12,t5_2qimq
7319897,0,t1_d29z0xs,I disagree. In the case of rock  paper  scissors the game is only interesting because its not entirely random. The ability to predict the move of the other player whether through social skills or watching emerging patterns and leading the other player on yourself creates a dynamic that couldnt be achieved if one player played in an entirely random fashion.Either player playing entirely random would have the result that both players would win roughly  of the time over a long period.The goal is to gain enough skill in prediction to win gt  of the time which is entirely possible in any nonrandom system. I think you mean that the outcome has to have some probability distribution as opposed to being completely random we can predict it but not perfectly in order for it to work. This is true. However manipulating the probability of winning is what gives competitive games their kick. Its what makes them fun  theres a social dynamic to it and we can attempt to manipulate our opponent in clever ways. ,gamedesign,d2a7zzz,2,t5_2qimq

8153316,0,t3_4qvq4l,I would disagree about one tiny point. You can violate the conservation of mass especially when youre trying to work with the last principle about exaggeration. And you can also fudge it a little because of ambiguity between D change in area and D change in volume.Like conserving mass would be about conserving volume so if you squash a ball along the Y axis to half its unsquashed height strict conservation of volume would say you need to double something else to compensate. If you treat something as D shape then youd double the width on the X axis. But if you treat it as a D shape youve got two axis to expand along X and Z. If you double on both axis then strictly speaking youre doubling the volume but youre keeping the onscreen area the same. If you wanted to keep the volume consistent youd increase it by about  along the X and Z axis but then the onscreen area might appear to shrink. So you do have a little room for fudging just based on whether you decide volume or area is more important.Theres also some examples of Loony Tune cartoons where things do become much larger for quick movements to make them read better. You can see this also used in some games for example a lot of the Smash Bros series. I found this example of Marios attacks from Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Note how his hands and feet increase in size when he attacks. The Illusion of Life was written by Disney animators which tended to be a little more conservative with exaggeration than the Loony Tunes animators.,gamedesign,d4wpncf,3,t5_2qimq

8360453,0,t3_4u27c9,First without challenge there is no game and inventory management is a complex system that offers great opportunities for building challenge into the game.Constraints such as limited inventory size are critical here.There are problemsolvingstrategy challenges high level stuff. Like trying to organize your stuff better by using named containers or putting similar items in same area in an inventory grid. Or trying to evaluate which item you should throw away which has massive complexity  as it depends on what you intend to do in the future what other items you have and how they interact and the properties of the specific item etc.Then theres execution challenges. Like getting headshot in an FPS. In an inventory system these might be rearranging the items sorting them somehow switching a different item to the hotbar things like that. Its not a complex problem but through practise you can improve at it so its a challenge of sorts. You get a reward when you neatly organize your inventory. Feels nice. Probably the sort of challenge that doesnt last very long though.That would be a good opportunity to introduce inventory upgrades or otherwise change the gameplay to reduce the amount of inventory micromanagement. Like automated systems to move inventory instead of doing it manually less numerous items to deal with valuable single items instead of piles of lesser ones. Challenges should evolve as the player improves their skill. Otherwise it gets boring and player moves on to another game once frustration grows too high.Having to retrieve items because you couldnt fit them in inventory is a problem. The solution is to either expand the game to make that retrieval process interesting like encourage players to combine retrieval missions with additional ones  like maybe they can bring building materials and set up some base there as well or make it impossible to retrieve items immediately afterwards despawn them or prevent returning until much later when it feels like a new mission againThe fact that the player has to frequently go through and think aboutanalyze the items they are carrying is important. It reminds them of what items they have. It forces them to think about the future and their plans you cant evaluate value of items if you dont know what you might need them for. It forces them to analyze the properties and uses of items in different situations also relative to other items. Having to work with ones items builds a strong mental model of how the game and the items work.,gamedesign,d5mlx7a,2,t5_2qimq

8440658,0,t3_4spfzf,Greetings medovejI have designed many match threes over the years and some even went platinum in sales. The ask is pretty broad but I thought I would give a few pointers as I am not sure what background you are coming from and not all rulesets are the same and the tone you  are going for. In general match s vary very minimally while providing greatly differing feelings of pace and fun. Pieces that only fall from the top. vrs some that can fill diagonally. The term puzzle is loosely defined as puzzle modes are generally built backwards if they are meant to be solvable through pensive thought. My tips are going to be from the variety of game rulesets where new pieces are able to come into the board.Tip  Make seeds for your randomness. This basically allows you to recreate the same experience with multiple sessions. This has a few advantages in that you can test progression with different play styles. And always play every level with different types of users in mind. Test test test play play play and when you have played the level so much that you can almost know what will happen. Test and play it some more. I got so fed up playing levels before the games launched I never played them when they eventually went liveTip  Collect data with monte carlo simulations. Generally having an AI that plays many many many boards and collecting stats is a big help. Comparing a random clicker archetype to a biggest grouping play style can reveal holes in the design. Knowing the average number of moves that can be made with  colors is a big help. How many times in  puzzle a big pay off can occur. Sometimes I would create layouts that felt good at the start but quickly destabilized as randomness took effect. Invest in these basic tools. The tools almost always have to use the same code so it is an incremental level of production to get this.Tip  Create grab bags for your distributions. Guarantee a certain number of colors rather than relying on an implementation of random calls. Ie fill  red gems fill  blue gems fill  yellow gems  green gems. Shuffle peel and refill as needed as opposed to it being made like this  if  dice roll lt it is red.  else if dice roll lt  make blue. This style almost never produces truly organic feelings and is always harder to tune as well.Tip  Dont throw all the colors in at once. Allow for the initial board to have fewer colors and as moves are made throttle this up. Same goes for bonus  blocking pieces.Tip  VARIETY!! Vary board sizes pieces anything to change feel every so often. I try to create several motifs to puzzles. Motif  might be a tricky center but simple edge. Or a narrow path on the right and wide field on the left. Or a level that show cases bombsshufflesrow removals column removals. Then string these levels together but dont make every level so different than the previous that it feels like a new game. This ensures that the player doesnt hit a monotonous patch. Tip  Difficulty curves should have valleys and peaks. Level  for example should be harder than level  overall but if level  is a particularly hard boss level then  should feel easier than the boss for a few levels. I refer to these as cool off periodsTip  Sometimes a big bonus level is fun. Lets say the previous level had  colors when you play  levels in a row all of which had  colors think about triggering a level that has  so the player who blasted past the first few levels can revisit that nostalgiaTip  Create a road map of player perception across the span of your progression. A simple example  Game starts first  levels is learning the game rules. Level  has a power piece. level  continue to use that piece. Then make a puzzle with a nifty trick involving the piece. Then have a cool off period. Afterwards add a new piece etc. A different example would be   lt resource gathering levelsgt pay off level boss level treasure level new color etc.Tip  Every so often make  level that breaks the rules if pieces normally fall from the top make only  level come in from the bottom. This is very effective at keeping retentionTip  Build a puzzle backwards. That means start making the puzzle with the last move intended. Then place a turn that would have happened before it and repeat until the initial board is setup. This namely guarantees that at least one solution always exists regardless if players find other paths to solve things.Tip  Sometimes a visual layout trumps a mechanically sound trick. An example would be making the board look like a UFO even if it means the start of the level becomes trivial to solve.Tip  When stuck always show a hint. This is just a standard default feature but so many match s dont do this and they almost always suffer because of it. A x grid of colors can be daunting after playing for  minutes and sometimes your eyes just cant see the one match in the corner of a board that hasnt moved in a while. Most players attention tend to be focused in the same general area as their last match was made as such if the game goes  seconds with no valid input pulse shake particle effect the piece or area that can help themNote I will have some more tips later and will correct my grammar as I am just typing blind and have to beat traffic now,gamedesign,d5wmd9q,2,t5_2qimq
8456301,0,t3_4vhaav,Hearthstone is by no means a perfect game but I think its doing it an injustice to not mention what it gets right. It succeeds with flying colours at creating a CCG that is accessible and visually very readable cohesive and engaging. A number of great mechanics in Magic The Gathering were ditched to aid accessibility and clarity  for example in Hearthstone you can only play cards on your own turn. On your opponents turn there is no interaction which means turns happen quickly and with little confusion for new players. You quite heavily criticise the quests for incentivising winning. However any kind of play x games quests would be bad for the game because there is a concede button.

You may reply that youd have to complete a certain amount of turns for a game to count towards quest progress.

8506879,0,t1_d64fm9v,gt Or for fallout  to have a perk that raises weapon damage somehow? you know how to shoot bullets faster?That could be attributed to the fact that fallout was an rpg before it became a shooter. The idea comes from the tabletop mentality that stats are used to abstract concepts such as skill. The perk is saying that your character not you is now better at handling guns.It does get very weird when you interlace stats and skillbased shooting together because those two do contradict each other on some level. Is my damage output a manifestation of my shooting skill or of my characters stats? Well both.I had the same problem when playing Morrowind. Youd hit a bad guy with your sword youd see it physically connect yet the game would tell you that it had missed due to the dice roll.,gamedesign,d64wygl,2,t5_2qimq

Most journals are read through digital libraries like JStor ACM or Elsevier and are free at any computer on a university campus.  Getting a journal article published in a reputable academic journal is a long haul.  The way youre talking about your work maybe you should publish it on medium.com.  If it is serious academic literature then drop the pretense and focus on meeting the rather high standards for academic literature required for a journal article. If you havent read a bunch of journals youll probably not have the writing style required to meet their expectations jump in and start reading  go to Google Scholar and look up Bartle and get crackin with your lit review.If you know how to do the standard of research required to publish to an academic journal you should know how to look up which journals are relevant to your topic. Again Google Scholar is a great place to start look up interesting articles where theyre published who they cite and where those are published.  DOCUMENT ALL CITATIONS! You may need them later.

8790009,0,t3_50gm9t,Two words subtraction defense.By having whatever DEF stat you use reduce a static amount of damage from EACH enemy unit you can emphasize burst damage a lot better. The blobs general units will likely have low ATK andor DEF so subtraction defense would gimp them and leave a spammer likely unable to answer a defensive brick nearly as well.Im helping to balance a TBS named Shattered Throne. Its in early access available for  will be  at official release. Anyway it uses subtraction defense which is to help counterbalance Combo Points but even with DEF values having me feel that theyre at half amounts rather than the half effectiveness model that the Dragon Quest series uses DEF is still useful especially given that range units have low ATK making damage impunity something they need to worry about even with Combo Points because it is capable enough of determining whether a unit can live in open fields for long or would need to hide in thick forests whenever they can.Shattered Throne also designs around an RPS triangle of sorts in its intended metagame Creativity beats Formation Blitz beats Creativity Formation beats Blitz. However we dont want to overencourage utility tools because thats a balance error made by many games that causes extra power to become redundant.

9073597,0,t3_54jzww,Permadeath should be an option imo as you didnt mention if it is or not. If its an option a lot of issues will be solved. Just turn it off newbs! Anyway...In XCom you can predict the enemys location and their next move based on a lot of information the game provides. And a term between new info and change of plan is pretty short move one pawn to get new info use that info on the second pawn etc.In case of Doorkickers or a similar game Frozen Synapse style game you cant use the info you got immediately so it feels unfair if permadeath kicks in. How could I have predicted that there would be a squad of enemy right around the corner? Thats unfair! This game sucks!I think the solution is to give players more toolsoptionsactions to gather information so that they can actually predict that there will be a squad of enemy right around the corner. In this case the fault of not predicting the opponents move correctly is solely on the players. You should have thrown a probe before going around the corner! You should have peaked around a little bit! Or we could even go meta  You should have gathered information in previous mission or did a recon mission earlier or paid some credits to get info! etc.But then again I cant find any description about the limit of information players can get so maybe youre thinking about revealing the whole info for players such as locations of enemies their patrol path their sight and range etc. In this case your simulation mode might be enough for players. Although planning the whole mission at the beginning of the mission would be really really hard even for experienced players with a lot of information so that kind of gameplay should be optional or reserved for an achievement. I think people like it when the time between action and feedback is shorter. In this case action and feedback would be a mission long which may be a pretty long time! But then again if its like Hotline Miami short then maybe you can just let them do it again and again... oh wait you wanted permadeath...Anyway these are just my thoughts.,gamedesign,d82hzfc,1,t5_2qimq

9190679,0,t3_566gr4,Ignoring game design and technically learning I think what would be helpful is to go into this with the right mindset. Here are a few lessons I have learnt from my failed projects.. Dont try to make everything perfect the first time. There will be systemsart in your game that you will discover actually dont contribute in the right way to your game. You need to be prepared to recreate or ditch these. If you sunk a lot of time and effort into them already then you will have a hard time with that.. Try to get the core of the game working as quickly as possible. Dont work for ages on making a procedural dungeon generator or even a main menu if your game is actually about combat. Spend that time iterating over the combat trying to find the fun. Once your core game is working you can add supporting features.. Use things other people have made already. Especially in the early stages of your game when no one i going to see it except you and maybe a couple of friends. Grab a plugin that already does something you want then tweak it. Use assets from some of your favourite games Spriters Resource is a good place for that.Remember nothing is final until you decide it will be. You will learn a lot from these premade systemsassets that will aid you when you get around to making the real thing!. Have fun. If you are in a looser mood because you arent pressured to make things perfect the first time around it will become more of a fun process.Take all this with a grain of salt!

9328480,0,t3_586iuy,Okay first you should strongly think about ditching the game design degree for something more general. Computer Science or Math are both terrific degrees that cover  of the same shit depending on what you want to do or at least will open the same doors and are highly useful in industries outside of Video Games if you ever feel that you want out or have trouble getting your foot in the door in the first place.Yeah yeah. Comp Sci is obvious but Math??????Yes. Math.Math is for you if youre determined to be a designer but dont necessarily want to touch the engineering side of things.How?Game Design is about logic and Game Theory. Its a subschool of Math and Game Design is built on it at a very very fundamental level. A BS or MS in Math with an emphasis in Game Theory is like a Game Design degree for big boys and unlike a Game Design degree from a for profit school or a Video Game Development emphasis from a state school its actually worth the paper its printed on an emphasis in games from a state school isnt that bad because youll still have an actual degree in comp sci to back it up. Just make sure the degree the program is based on is actually worth something.Im very very very serous about the Math here. This advice comes from people I used to work with who actually make AAA games for a living I used to work at Electronic Arts. Knock their business practices all you want but their engineers are topfuckingnotch.Of course on top of all of this if you want to get into the industry you need to actually make games. Mod something in your free time or invent a board game or card game.Pro Tip Almost all video game prototypes are physical at some point unless its part of a regular franchise like Battlefield or Battlefront. If you walk around the developer cubes at any game studio I frequented Maxis in particular the one thing you see more of than Anime and JRPG memorabilia is card and board game boxes.All modern video games that arent direct ports of card games are descended from board games.

The whole concept is that its something to do on a road trip or on a walk. If that gets too complicated and the bar is way lower for that due to the limitations of the real world the game may suck.Conflict between players in a game where people must coordinate in the real world is especially bad. Niantic has gotten away with it in two ways. First in both GO and Ingress team members cannot actively compete with one another. All conflict is over nonhuman targets dehumanizing players of the game since they canot be singled out and targeted. Second in GO all battles are against nonhuman targets.

9527692,0,t1_d9n9wce,Thanks. Good points in your response.First a question when you watch a high score run in Spelunky are you excited to see all of the Ghosting or do you sort of tune it out until the next area? If youre not excited to see the Ghosting perhaps that says enough about how much more interesting it can be. Making a round path to traverse is something I consider to be simple when you have bombs and ropes. Bombs make paths open and ropes allow you to move up and down. So if you have enough gear you can just clear the space and do your business. Also you dont need a round area if you can just climb a rope high enough and then jet back or climbing gloves back around the incoming ghost. While its true the ghost is a one hit kill so are spikes and pits. Because spikes can be destroyed and pits can be managed with ropes and jetpacks players learn not to be afraid of these obstacles. Its the same with the ghosts. Its the dynamic interactive and unpredictable elements in Spelunky that are scary. Those are the things that can cause a chain reaction ending in death. The bombs and ropes and many other items in Spelunky are upgradespowerups. Theyre designed to undermine the challenges in the level. Ghosting is redundant and of relatively low risk because players can effectively change the level. ,gamedesign,d9nhmsy,3,t5_2qimq

If you look straight forward or slightly up you will quite likely not see it.The developer said this was an intentional choice to teach players who are bad at navigating to look down and figure out whats stopping them.Teaching through environment which experienced players can easily run through but new players have to get used to the new controls is a powerful tool....and soo much playtesting to make sure everything is working as intended,gamedesign,daatywq,2,t5_2qimq

Swarming tank enemies because together they have mil health doesnt mean it will make a fight last longer it just means theres more of them to one shot. More dumb enemies can make a game take longer but not harder. You need variety. Better AI mixed with a single harder unit is a perfect fix to that type of thinking. ,gamedesign,dbzucan,3,t5_2qimq
10209037,0,t3_5m3eru,A Theory of Fun is a great read. Not really game design but understanding competition The Inner Game of Tennis The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance I recommend this book for a lot of reasons but if youre making a competitive game I think its important. Its a book about tennis so there are details that arent about design but its about understanding the internal thought process of competition. If youre making a competitive game understanding how players think inside of your game and understanding the dynamics between player interaction.Another thing I dont think books are the best way to get better at design I think that playing games with the intention of understanding the design of the system is more important.,gamedesign,dc1920b,3,t5_2qimq
10274622,0,t3_5n4bla,Another example of an anyone can choose any skill game is The Secret World.  Similar to what you describe for your game you have a limited number of powers you can have in your bar at any time even though you can select from many.  The limitation to this is that if you want to use a power from a set you have to have the appropriate weapons equipped you can have two primary weapons and an auxiliary weapon at any one time.  You continue to gain experience points and skill points through end game content eventually unlocking all the powers in the game.The practical upshot of this system is that its very easy to switch your role in the game whether you want to heal tank or be a damage dealer.What ended up happening with The Secret World is that people found the powers that worked best together and made de facto classes which they post online so that all you have to do is gear up and pick the right powers on the way.The drawback to this is that ultimately it doesnt end up being much of a free system since even though you can have any power you usually dont.  Speaking from experience trying to freestyle gets you killed when youre pitted against relentless enemies and unforgiving bosses.  You wont get invited to very many groups if you try to freestyle.  In my opinion its a balance issue of providing too many options that just arent as mechanically valuable and so get left by the wayside.  Those powers end up feeling like filler and are usually just hurdles to jump over as you purchase more powers in the same tree to get to the coveted power you desire.The incentive to collecting all the powers is that when you have powers that match the games suggested power sets which arent as optimized as player created ones you unlock costume pieces.  For collectors thats really important.  For competitive players having all the extra powers really just slows down the game.Id say that you if you want to have a wealth of powers to choose from be careful to ensure that they are all useful in some way or another throughout the course of your game.  A good example of this is from Fallout New Vegas.  Even though its not a power selection game like the one youre talking about you do have a wide range of skills and perks to choose from and the particular set of skills and perks you choose alters the dialogue options in the game providing a slightly different experience for each playthrough.  For a video explanation of this you can check out this Game Makers Toolkit video analyzing how one sidequest in FONV can be done in several different ways based on your choice of skills and perks.  Not saying your powers need to hold as much narrative weight but the concept can translate well enough to mechanical application I think.,gamedesign,dc8omy5,9,t5_2qimq

10376558,0,t1_dck5u59,Yeah I got it backwards in my phrasing... But the thing is that the focus on this thread is the drinking mechanic because thats what Im currently thinking about in my ground design for what this game should be about. Couch gaming Short sessions with easy and natural breakpoints for pausesending the game to do something else Party setting  Drinking?  Nudity?  Truthdare esque things?Im well aware of that... The question about drinking is one I realized that I wanted to add into another idea for a party game or rather party platform maybe and I wanted some tips on what would work and what would not.The idea at large is you have a computer connected to your TV as a host. Each player joins in by connecting through their browser to the host. The phone then acts as a dynamic input device which may be a virtual gamepad select the answer from a list or any number of things.Using that input scheme would also lend itself rather good to asymmetric games and all sorts of stuff.Other than the input scheme Ive decided that basically short sessions with pauses in between is the way to go. Maybe even a procedurally generated goofy narrative could work.Drinking would be a modifier where say if I go with the narrative route and so the party came to the well of youth. Lucy took  drinks from the well and yes suddenly everyone looked much younger! but if the drinking modifier is off that wouldnt happen. My focus in this thread this is basically how do I design this aspect thats responsible with drinkingAnother modifier could be undressing for parties that want to spice things up etc. Being responsible with undressing is easy do you feel comfortable with undressing in this company? If yes I could basically just say NUDE ROUND and everyone just undresses and play the next round. No real responsibility about this falls on me as a designer besides just giving players a heads up that undressing will be a part of the experience. Drinking is another thing as its cumulative highly individual on tolerance. This is a challenge that intrigued me and thats why I made this post.Since Im laying down the foundation for the game at the moment I just want mechanics that do well with each other involving drinking morally puts some responsibility on me as a developer. I want to be able to say if someone calls me out on it in the future that drinking is in the end really the drinkers responsibility but I did what I could to make the drinking mechanics responsibleDrinking as much as undressing and any other social activity will be a core element of this game. And the mechanics need to work with that. The other mechanics wont rely on drinking but drinking will rely on the other mechanics so even on this early stage I need some form of idea of what may work with drinking what will not and more input on how to distribute drinks.Playing it without any of the party modifiers might result in basically a Mario Partylike game or similar. A couch game but where the mechanics are built to work with drinkingundressingother party stuff.The base idea is that the game should be adaptive in what mechanics gets presented based on which mode was selected. Drinking is just a modifier I felt I needed help with from external sources due to me feeling like I should make a serious effort in designing that responsibly and picking mechanics that inherently dont encourage excessive drinking.,gamedesign,dck8vla,1,t5_2qimq

10543034,0,t1_dd2v9xm,Just so youre aware the Pokmon games battle system actually HAS evolved quite a bit over the years changing the way stats are affected by certain skills and what type combinations of Pokmon are able to specialize in certain types of offensive or defensive roles.I would encourage you to play the original redblueyellow and compare it with something like rubysapphireemerald can all be found online with emulators for free. Can download VirtualBoyAdvance to play the ROMs.Pay particular attention to the way stats changed from having hpattackdefensespeedspecial to splitting the special into Sp. Attack and Sp. Defense skills developed physical vs. special attack types in addition to their actual type association. In the original all moves of a certain type FireWaterElectric etc. would use the Special stat. Now which stats are used to calculate a skills strength are dependent on the attack type which is derived from the CONCEPT of the skill. For example Grass Gnot a grass type attack is conceptually about lashing out with a grass gnot and PHYSICALLY hitting the opponent so it ends up relying on the attackers Attack stat and the defenders Defense stat. This in contrast to the vast majority of grass attacks that are usually special moves like Mega Drain or Solarbeam. Whats more Pokmon that may have high Attack stats wont necessarily learn many good physical moves so you have to keep this kind of stuff in mind and choose your skills wisely. A Pokmons rate of growth for certain stats will change based on its demeanor wasnt in the original games for example a Pokmon could be Bashful which might make it have a different distribution of stats for the same Pokmon at the same level with a different demeanor. Also every time you beat a Pokmon it will contribute special EV points that impacts the overall rate that a particular stat will increase. This is a subtle way for grinding to be more efficient and that rewards those who are spending the additional time and effort to train. Beating  low level Pidgey Pokmon might take me longer than beating one samelevel Pidgeotto but by golly I really want more EV points put into whatever stat Pidgies subtly influence so that when I next level up that stat will increase by  instead of .So yeah theres a lot of depth theyve added over time and that doesnt even get into the science behind team customization and crap. I am by no means an expert at it all though. I hear talk. Personally Im too lazy and just say forget it Ill take the Pidgeotto battle.,gamedesign,dd365dh,1,t5_2qimq

10567079,0,t3_5raeoj,I think the easiest way is to have a referee.  Someone outside the game who will look at the cards submitted and determine who was killed without giving away the killer.  Obviously not ideal.The innocents get a set of cards dealt to them.  The cards played would either prevent their assassination or allow it to happen.  The innocents have limited prevent cards so they might save them until later.  The players can be numbered X or given identities like Clue.  The killers cards have instruction to kill or attack X character on them.  During the kill phase the players submit cards face down onto a special box that denotes who provided which card and the referee looks through the cards in secret and determines if there was a kill.What you can do is make the cards have additional uses outside the kill phase and have the assassination instructions included on every card so there are no cards that are different.This way card drawing stealing and discarding can be incorporated into the board game design and the killer wont have to have a card for every character at all times.  The killer may have to hope that he can draw the one card he needs to get the last player. ,gamedesign,dd5wc01,3,t5_2qimq

There are a lot of platforms out there and especially if were digging back to older titles therell be a sizable amount of people that dont have access to the platform. Ex if someone has a PC smartphone and  current consoles theres still over a dozen major other consoles whose games could exclude the person.At the same time I definitely think itd be bad to try and say do  for each major platform each month. Until we can gauge the level of activity that risks splitting the community too much and killing activity in each thread.To help maximize activity each month Id recommend starting the system by going off popular vote.

11168131,0,t1_devx61u,First off lets back up and underline the fact that Im not saying diversity is bad. Im saying that diversity for diversitys sake is bad. Diversity can be achieved correctly but most attempts these days are hamfisted and poor attempts at doing so... including Overwatch. The best diversity in games happens when you dont notice it at all. We are after all playing games here. And games are foremost intended to be fun not preachy or cringeinducing when it comes to social justice.gt Your assumption that Overwatch has a diverse cast purely because of a token checklist speaks more about your personal views than the developers aims.The black dude is the hiphop breakdancer. The Japanese dudes are a ninja and samurai. The biker is the fat white dude. The medic is the german berfrau. The french woman is a femme fatalle. The cowboy is a white American. The Korean girl is a gamer waifu. Come on dude. You must be acting facetious about this if not naive. Representing a multitude of races and genders using stereotypes is problematic. Overwatch has the distinct honor of having many lazy stereotypes represent their characters. This is what makes their attempt at diversity more of a joke than a good example. You absolutely can have diverse casts. Many games have them. Mass effect. Assassins Creed. GTA. etc. But they dont wear their identity on their sleeve using cartoonish stereotypes. Sure make all the characters in your game women. But... doing so means that no one will believe the authenticity of your WWI FPS. No one will believe the authenticity of your modern day combat FPS. No one will believe your game about Roman legionaries. Again diversity for diversitys sake is problematic with regard to game design.,gamedesign,dexw9h6,1,t5_2qimq

If you mention your source its easy enough to find this thread with some Googling. Due to the very nature of these being public responses they are biased as well.I suggest you do it right. Get a Google Form and send it to people. Get a hundred or so responses. Anecdotal evidence from a few people will get you nothing of value.And you need to ask better questions. Seriously. One question is not enough and the one you pose is too vague and has too many interpretations. It is also biased in your phrasing. Use the terms online and offline not real life.Back in my college days I had many friends on campus. I also had many friends in World of Warcraft. I spent ten hours a week raiding with my online friends joking around and working together and helping each other out. I had very few friends on campus that Id spend so much time with. Were my online friends any less real then my inperson ones? Furthermore do those friendships count under your idea of achievements and progress?The question is also inherently flawed in its roots. I care about my achievements in World of Warcraft much moreso than my achievements in Shovel Knight because those achievements are visible to others. I care about my rare mounts in that game more than I care about any of the ingame achievements because theyre more visible and useful.Im very proud that I got my Masters Degree much moreso than any ingame achievement Ive ever had. On the other hand I am very proud that I defeated the Lich King on heroic and got a really cool mount something that took months of work and preparation and more than a little skill. I value that achievement much moreso than say the fact that I scooped up my cats litter last night.Some real life achievements will be more important than others and same with ingame achievements. You simply cannot say that all video game achievements are more or less valuable than real life ones because there is a massive overlap between the two categories. I can think of real life achievements I value much less than video game ones and vice versa. I would also like to add one extra bit of advice. This question does not look at addiction. Video game addiction has everything to do with Skinner Boxes and nothing to do with achievement. Its about reward schedules and how important those are to people. Take a look at how people value ingame rewards versus real life rewards and what theyre willing to invest for either.Good luck with the research though and let me know if you have any questions on how to get poll data scientifically.,gamedesign,dflr1eg,22,t5_2qimq

Basically the idea is that if your opponent has a Pokemon thats been able to buff itself to the point that either a snowball or sweep is imminent or theyve buffed their defenses enough to become untouchable you emulate the effects of the attack Haze which eliminates stat changes. This is done in a number of ways most commonly a dedicated move that forces the opponent to switch to another Pokemon resetting their buffs  debuffs in the process. Its also often bolstered by entry hazards  something akin to field effects that damage or otherwise impair Pokemon when they first switch in such as inflicting percentilesbased damage poisoning them or slowing them down.ampnbspSince your fifth faction was dealing with pseudovampires it makes sense that they would have abilities related to impairing powers and abilities you could have them set up jammers on the map that disable buffs in a given radius or have traps  mines  damaging items evocative of woodenstake imagery etc. Maybe theyre pretty difficult to beat unbuffed so if you try facing them without any supplementary bonuses its probably going to get you killed and their abilities compensate for that.,gamedesign,dg9pt8l,1,t5_2qimq
11622042,0,t3_65scui,gt since I heard you can learn most of it with a little bit of willpower and googleshould probably read gt since you can learn some of it in a longer amount of time and after more frustration As you look to make this important decision there are a few things you need to identify.  . What is your goal?  . How many options do you want to keep open as you work towards that goal?If your goal is exclusively to make and texture environmental d models ex rocks and billboardssprites ex grass trees then you can learn a lot of what you need to in half a years time on the internet.  Unless you have access to a student email though youll either be using free software blender paint.net etc or cracked versions of industry standard software.  With this route youll be pretty limited in career options and will have a harder time producing a portfolio to land that first gig.  Youll also be less prepared for game development than someone who went through schooling for it.   If your goal is to keep all video game art paths open and make yourself significantly more hirable from d modeling to animation to d design you will be struggling to learn everything from the internet in a reasonable period of time.  Being in a situation where you are essentially forced to better yourself for hours each week with classmates for competitionsupport and a professor ideally from the game devart field for feedback and guidance is extremely valuable.  Severalhundreddollarspercredithour valuable.  Many of my current game art professors have traditional art degrees and did not focus on gaming applications in college.  Nowadays I think thats still possible as a route but would require some more technical training afterwards.  So in terms of our options we now have a the long solo route where were learning it all from the internet and b the shorter route where we get a traditional art education then go to community collegegrad school to learn how to apply these principles to games.  The c option is to go straight into a game art program.  To answer your posts question the advantage here is youll probably have someone who not only can talk specifically about game artdesign principles and ds max maya zbrush etc but who also likely had some traditional art education.  You will learn to create usable assets in industrystandard software.  You will learn some basic design and programming principles to make yourself a wellrounded insightful employee.  You will come to understand the grind that is game development.  It will however be up to you to really tap into the professors brain and learn the principles of art like color theory framing palettes etc. Assuming you applied yourself equally in all possible routes c would be the fastest from start gt employment.  Im not entirely sure which college is only requiring a paper at the end but any good game development program will require you to actually make a game.  I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT THIS STEP IS.  Making a game is possibly the single most important thing to do before you apply to any companies.  From establishing a team workflow to ensuring your unit setup is correct from ds max into Unity or Unreal you will learn so many things that professors simply didnt have time to mention or werent prompted to discuss.  If you really want to keep the long term options open and make yourself as desirable an employee as possible aim for technical art positions.  Theyll require both artistic skills and programming skills but the things you can do and the necessity to companies is pretty unparallelled right now.  Modelers animators etc are fairly common and you will be competing with a large number of people.  Technical artists are significantly less common because the job is more difficult but their skills are those that future game development artists will be required to know.  ,gamedesign,dgddb5g,1,t5_2qimq
11641069,0,t1_dgci7hu,I actually meant this somewhat differently that the core concepts used as organizing principles for the game systems as opposed to rendering etc in some of the game engines map well onto the concepts in game grammar. In the case of when we did Metaplace this was intentional  we designed the engine in part around game grammar. But in the case of stuff like Unity I dont know. A lot of it also just looks like OOP.,gamedesign,dgfj1if,1,t5_2qimq
11645246,0,t3_65zhr0,I think mechanical action combat is the best but lets not confuse action with button spam. For a good comparison to other games I would draw a correlation to Souls games or even monster hunter games. Where positioning and knowing when not to attack are more important than a memorized sequence of attacks.This was sort of my hope for Tera originally but the game fell into the trap of grinding out high intensity combat for negligible gain and ended on the spam and pot side of things.That and Im rather sick of HP sponge mobs and I think we are due for a new system thats a bit more dynamic and engaging like a balance mechanic focused around destabilizing your opponent before you can do any damage. Does For Honor do this? Ive only watched a few videos but I couldnt tellI believe Camelot Unchained has something in store for the combat system to avoid spam and giving attacks weight but I havent looked into it too much since there is a large PvP focus.Also personally I find soloing a bore in MMORPGs so I find the solocentric combat systems to be oddly placed in a game where so much money was spent on creating a persistent world full of other players.,gamedesign,dgg03ig,3,t5_2qimq

11651782,0,t3_6688l1,I dont think theres a good answer to this question as is since we dont know why you are trying to avoid exp. Exp may be an ideal solution for whatever you are trying to achieve and I dont think it wise to brainstorm alternatives without first establishing what the actual goal is here.Although if youre just trying to establish a progression system I will note that my favorite kinds do two things. Allow the player to choose what to upgrade. Use those upgrades as an incentive to complete a task in the gameA pretty decent example of something like this is the recent Ghost Recon Wildlands while there is still character EXP in that game much of the progression system is tied to tasks you can complete in the game world. And theyre not really quests or anything just items you can pick up or NPCs to interrogate or little side missions like stopping a convoy or stealing a helicopter. The only real issue I had with this was that you could just google what the best weaponattachment is and where its located go get that from the start of the game and stick with it forever since youll never find something better. Seems like a pretty easy issue to fix though. The system was so fundamental here that the progression system basically became the game. There are skill points to find medals that award extra upgrades to specific skills weapons attachments upgrades to the rebel ops support resources gasfoodetc is also used as a secondary exp bar of sorts and story missions and all of that info is also hidden on your map until you track down intel on it too and even that offers a choice since you can choose  of  things to get intel on barring the storymissionintel.,gamedesign,dggqsbr,2,t5_2qimq
11699672,0,t3_66xf28,I think having two rounds of calculation by the engine sounds overly complex. What about just a single round of execution by the engine per turn using the baseline persistent stats from your characters and upgrades and adding the two chosen cards on top. You could consider potentially having each area execute in a fixed order during the execution phase like first everyone does their maneuver step then their power up then attack etc. During each step you only execute that step to the extent that your baseline stats plus bonus cards apply so if none of those baseline or chosen cards relate to maneuvering then you just skip that step that round. Id say do whatever it takes to reduce the amount of calculations and replanning within a turn,gamedesign,dgm6d3s,1,t5_2qimq
11742559,0,t1_dgqw801,I think that would be fair. I do like the horror theme in cases of resident evil soma etc. I dont really find them scary but they are eerie and that is something I relish. not like resident evil  or alien isolation though. those arent eerie they are tense and edgy. not sure why I like eerie. I love all that stuff like castlevania silent hill beetlejuice labyrinth alien prometheus etc. I guess I can see a kind of beauty in it. I suppose its the same reason most other girls like vampire novels. I never got into them. but I do like the twilight films. thanks for the question I enjoyed thinking about that. ,gamedesign,dgr1ruc,1,t5_2qimq
11747982,0,t1_dgrlm1d,And you expect me to believe YOU are the authority for game design? Humor me then.Sigh will you PLEASE get off your vitriolic crybaby mode and at least try to engage in a civil discussion? And you are wondering why you are being labeled as a troll when you act like one. We havent even started talking about Genjis game design and you are showing that you are not eager to listen.I am starting to doubt if the well thought out argument i want to provide would be useful for someone like you.Ill give you a chance then. Since you came all the way here after your whining presumably failed in the other subreddit. DO ENLIGHTEN us with what you want to do with Genji. Pitch us your proposed rework.

11765774,0,t1_dgtfb21,Theres no real to degrees that relate to level design which is what youre describing. You should definitely think about your degree as a supplement and fallback option  what gets you a job will be the work you do outside the classroom.In reality it doesnt matter what degree you have unless you take Computer Science or a Digital Mediastyle degree where you learn a lot of technical art tools which give you a leg up. A lot of entrylevel jobs in level design ask for mission scripters or people to do more technical tasks under the direction of other designers. You can also just supplement any degree with electives assuming you are American that cover topics like architecture art history psychologyUX and D modelling. Many level designers I know have humanities degrees but game design degrees are increasingly common. If interested in that path definitely try to find a program that focuses on level design  look at currentrecently graduated student portfolios to see what their work actually consists of.,gamedesign,dgtoiiv,2,t5_2qimq
