2801515,0,t3_2s673x,Hi guysSo ive been running my blog for around a year and I think its now time to start monetising my blog. I have one or two advertisements on there are favours for other peoples hard work but my issue is I really like my theme and there arent a lot of spots to be adding advertisement spots.If anyone could point me in some obvious spots where  I could add some advertising without spoiling the clean layout of my blog it would be much appreciated. PS. Im looking to add some advertising space in my blogs footer.Thanks,Blogfeedback,cnmisoc,2,t5_35qza
