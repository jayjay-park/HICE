1164012,0,t3_277y7y,On the flat surfaces of that spire were signs with the Waikoloa Logo on it. Im guessing so it would be easy for folks to know where to turn down Waikoloa Road and buy property since there isnt a street sign to tell them. The sign logos were taken down in the late s if memory serves me right. So if anything it was mostly just a fancy sign board tower.  I have heard stories about it being a sundial but the area around it doesnt really lend itself to being used as such since it isnt flat.,BigIsland,ci0kjyt,1,t5_2rwf5

Also if you could stop something from colliding with  people and maybe only hitting  people wouldnt you do that? The question isnt whos house gets hit versus whos doesnt the question is how can we minimize the damage as much as possible. ,BigIsland,ckc7a2l,-1,t5_2rwf5

3316792,0,t1_cp62dx7,was going to suggest the kona coast hikes but you seem to have summed that up. I think I may have hiked pretty much every stretch from kawaihae to honokohau by this point. Hiking north from Kiholo to Keawaiki is the hardest part imo,BigIsland,cp6cbvc,1,t5_2rwf5

5091659,0,t1_cuzqc16,gt Yes architecture makes a difference. Aframe homes dont do well in Hawaii as the heat builds up like crazy near the top and its not like we need an Aframe for snow to slide down the sides.LOL yeah... it always cracks me up to see an Aframe in Hawaii for reasons you say. However a small solar panel to drive exhaust fans at the top combined with air intakes low on the sides help a lot. And yeah no wind  high humidity is a problem that wont be helped much by natural ventilation. I remember the last September I spent in Hawaii and it was the same story. The temps were in the low s and it was sweaty as hell. One thing I like about the climate in Idaho is that you just dont sweat its so dry. I could never ride a bicycle wearing long pants in Hawaii but I can here. Funny thing is when Im riding I stay dry. Then I go inside an airconditioned building and it just pours off. ,BigIsland,cuzqj68,1,t5_2rwf5
5175083,0,t3_3lruoc,I dont know what Braxtons setup was but I have a friend thats a veteran freediverspearfisherman who said Dont use a beltwaist kui stringer always keep your string of dead bleeding fish away from your body. Sharks want to eat fish and you may get in their way. Dont go in the water at sundown as its sharks dinner time Dont go out in murky water like Braxton did. Sharks dont want to eat people but if they cant see what it is that can be a problem. Tiger Sharks are cautious and circle prey before moving in again visibility is your friend  yards off Upolu Point is really deep and dangerous If theres blood in the water and more than one shark then all bets are off its a feeding frenzy,BigIsland,cv9sd5y,3,t5_2rwf5

If by some chance its not dengue then its most certainly brought my personal awareness to how inefficient the officials running this truly are. It is incredibly frustrating to me and others in the area. I do think I will begin contacting additional county offices and representatives state agenciesreps to express my concerns on how this outbreak could be handled better. ,BigIsland,cwv4mft,1,t5_2rwf5

6308209,0,t3_41zjar,Hand crafted wood is a pretty popular tourist purchase and due to the popularity a number of artisans advertise online. You should be able to find some doing a search. Or look up the communityfarmers markets. Hand crafted wood items are usually available there. I understand you dont want something massproduced that makes sense! However whatever you are likely to find is still produced with tourists in mind. As twoscooprice mentioned Polynesian religion isnt really practiced anymore and so an authentic tiki statuette is not something youre likely to find anywhere. ,BigIsland,cz6o7xw,5,t5_2rwf5

7557505,0,t1_d30y2s2,Thanks for the insights! I appreciate the fact that a lot of teachers have been intimidated or yelled at etc. Im just hoping that as an elementary teacher my wife wont be exposed to as much of that. We moved to Oahu after highschool with just a few suitcases too lol. We plan on renting for six months while scouting for a chunk of land somewhere in a lava zone  or higher. We are aware of the dogs fiasco. We have three so its going to be pricey. If you get them the proper care at a veterinarian who can follow HI policies they only have to be quarantined for three days I think. I guess I just feel like there are two big issues people are talking about. One is the cost of living which we are familiar with and we are willing to live a very modest lifestyle which we have been. We lived on my paltry income of k year while my wife was in college. Since then weve lived on her income of k and saved everything I make so it wont be a shocker that we cant both buy k cars and live in a baller apartment. The second issue is the buerocracy and stress of teaching and a lot of people like you had no experience. She has taught for two years and next year will be her third and she teaches in a teach to the test type of school. I doubt itll be too much of a problem moving.What were the school facilities like? How long did it take the kids to warm up to you? Did you move out of the lava flow or off island?,BigIsland,d3192sa,1,t5_2rwf5
