11116401,0,t3_5xt653,I don think you need a live or post discussion thread. Just a thread with the date of the episode would probably do the trick. That way everyone can jump in no matter where they are at in the show or after the show and ask questions or make comments.There really arent any spoilers in the show. Its the same traffic stops duis domestics border crossings and bad play by play each week.I like to start the episode about an hour into it on my PVR so I can zoom through commercials and rewind stuff.It doesnt matter when you put the thread up. Any of the hockey or football ones I follow put them up hours before game time so there can be some pregame jabber.I tell my wife me and three other guys on reddit are really big fans of this show. I hate to miss it.,livepd,des19j1,2,t5_3hime
