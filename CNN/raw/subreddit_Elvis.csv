1246250,0,t1_ci9hnxc,Your DP doesnt already have equipment lined up? Im not debating whether History Channel or Discovery documentaries cost quite a bit of money but the album is already known to exist and the last most Elvis fans knew it was in the possession of Jerry Osborne who clearly has audio clips on his website. I dont see anywhere in your IndieGoGo campaign that states that Jerry is involved in this project or even aware of it but you throw out his name a few times... the pitch video shows nothing of who you filmmakers are no faces to put names to just text explaining what I can clearly read below. How can anyone trust you with their money?The mostcrowdfunded movies that net anything in the  or figure range have a huge following and even those struggle to meet fundraising goals. Im sorry your figure is ridiculously ambitious for crowdfunding. I suggest you go hunting for executive producers. Elvis is as big of an icon as he always was but the average Joe just doesnt want to spend a lot of money on him documentaries are never moneymakers and especially when the focus of it is an album that very few hardcore Elvis fans care about and a movie that even fewer nonElvis fans have even heard of. Its not like youre looking for a neverbeforeheard song or neverbeforeseen footage its a welldocumented release of a promotional album related to the filming of essentially commercial flop.Plus calling the people who might want to most contribute to your film you lot is just rude.,Elvis,ci9thcm,1,t5_2rj5m
