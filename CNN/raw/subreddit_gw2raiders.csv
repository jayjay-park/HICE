9676039,0,t3_5dmyr4,I think the barrierforentry for raids is mostly artificial. What I mean is that people seem to believe that raids are very hard and only accessible to the most hardcore players when in reality a group only needs a little organization to clear the content.I started playing GW about  months ago and now have  characters fully geared for raids and LIs. If its possible for me to start the game with a level  character one day and be full clearing raids with PUGs every week a few months later this illustrates to me that the barrierforentry isnt very high.,gw2raiders,da5rwou,6,t5_3goob
