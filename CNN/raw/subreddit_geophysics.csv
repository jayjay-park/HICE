1401417,0,t1_cirsv67,There were a few Americans going to Western while I was there and one of my thesis supervisors was an American. As a general rule tuition is cheaper for Canadian students since our universities are taxpayer subsidized. International students typically pay double the tuition price as the locals. However pretty much anyone accepted into a grad program will get paid by the university to be a teaching assistant research assistant or etc. The pay scales are negotiated by union so international students actually get paid more to make up the difference in tuition costs. In the end youll have about Kyear in income available for living expenses.Its kind of ironic when the university is paying you so you can pay them tuition. But it makes the bean counters happy.As far as academic performance goes most Canadian universities are virtually on par with each other. They probably exceed that average american university on performance but certainly average behind the top tier US schools. If you cant get into the Colorado School of Mines or similar and are thinking of settling for a middleoftheroad school youd probably be better served in Canada.Additionally I know quite a few students who did an M.Sc. in Canada and went on to a Ph.D. in the US. A friend of mine went from Western to Princeton like it was no big deal... Unlike fields like law or business which are really tied to the country of origin geophysics is pretty universal. So youre not hamstrung into working or studying in a given country later.A good friend of mine did his undergrad in Brazil in Math and Physics like you. He did his Ph.D. at Western where he worked on earthquake seismology. Almost immediately got a job processing airborne geophysics data. Now he travels the world.Anyway let me know if you want to know any more.,geophysics,ciry4x2,1,t5_2qzgp

2347951,0,t3_2m7ydb,Dont know much about the UCSD program but see if you can major in geophysics if your school lets you. Check your Earth SciencesGeology department. If you dont have a geophysics program find a school that does and look at their curriculum. Figure out which courses are a better match math or physics. ,geophysics,cm1x287,2,t5_2qzgp
2975758,0,t1_co2cwu5,Thanks for the good advice... Im actually at the end of my PhD in geophysics and having previously worked for a supermajor oil company.  Laying people off is one thing but has it become impossible to get an entrylevel position in the industry with sub  oil?  I am considering staying in academia doing a cushy postdoc in Florida until this blows over.  May I ask the state of the industry where you are at?,geophysics,co6cycp,1,t5_2qzgp
6743883,0,t3_47bxpg,Recent grad in physics with a BS. I did my physics technical concentration in geophysics and got a geology minor. Currently working for a small engineering environmental geophysical firm on the west coast US for about a year. Days on average are between  hours long min lt max . Im in the field about  of the time doing onsite data acquisition and interpretation. About  of that is locating underground utilities for different types of drilling utility markout for construction and surveys for underground storage tanks. That part generally speaking blows. The other  is doing various seismic surveys and resistivity surveys mostly for construction and the installation of solar respectively along with other more specialized surveys like locating unexploded ordnance that pop up less frequently. That side is more grueling but also a lot more gratifying than locating utilities. Also because its a small company all of my training has been on the job which is basically code for youre going to suck at everything and deal with a bunch of PMs who dont have a coherent or organized training methodology until you dont suck then its basically the same work every day until you are good enough to get projects yourself. The job definitely has its ups and downs work life balance is pretty off the rails for instance but I make a decent amount of money enough to support myself in a major city and get to go on pretty interesting surveys and learn cool things from time to time. Also as far as learning to do a variety of surveysuse a variety of instruments goes this area of geophysics is the most diverse from day to day IMO. Im also just grateful to have gotten a job in geophysics with a  bs at all. My other friends that tried are either . oampg desk jockeys  . On MT field crews for months on end  or unemployednot in geophysics . The rest are in grad school are employed but with advanced degrees or left geophysics to do other stuff. Hope that helped! I know my perspective is somewhat limited given how green I am to the industry so apologies if I inadvertently offended anyone. ,geophysics,d0gvhw7,2,t5_2qzgp
8480275,0,t1_d61ei7t,Its never too late. I would definitely discuss with an advisor on your options and determine if its possible to transfer to the engineering school. You should have all of your core classes out of the way by not which should not make it much of an issue as long as your gpa is good enough. Which it probably is considering you got accepted to the geophysics program. In the end this is a big decision that you need to make on your own weight out your options and determine which fits you best. ,geophysics,d61kt2f,1,t5_2qzgp
9553110,0,t3_5bp2vt,Nice info here. Keep it coming  I wont pretend I know all the uses for logging here as already described they can be useful for almost anyone and the better one understands the logging tools the more applications they can be used for.Instead Ill just give examples to add on. Environmental Work. Commonly used are Natural Gamma and Induction ConductivityResistivity logs to locate  aquifers and contaminant plume depth. . Often sandgravel aquifers  low gamma count amp more resistive measurements Certain contaminants may be found with increased salts andor increased total dissolved solids which can decrease resistivity so a contaminated aquifer may have low gamma but low resistivity.. There can be many additional logs usedplotted. An example might be a flow meter to detect flow ratesdirection in a borehole or optical image logs that can show where fractures and bedding planes exist and what their orientation is.. Lots of software out there anything from Excel to WellCAD and beyond.Also for environmental work it is popular to plot Natural Gamma with Induction Conductivity instead of Resistivity because they often mimic each other which makes spotting deviationscontaminant plumes that much easier.,geophysics,d9qm9ib,3,t5_2qzgp
10182543,0,t3_5lpidh,I know a guy with a Canadian bachelor in maths background who is now doing a masters in seismology also in Canada similar issues with lack of geo background idk what hes planning for accreditation...but in terms of understanding the math especially in applications such as inversion theory he has a more solid understanding than the average geogeo eng folk. ,geophysics,dby8xbj,1,t5_2qzgp
10197390,0,t1_dbzx1y3,So assuming a true DC not a switched square wave in the loop you should have no magnetic field as the derivative is zero... so one assumes they are actually transmitting some sort of signal.Are they actually using a square wave and measuring the normal time gates that they would in TDEM? Only using an oriented coil instead of a single coplaner coil? or a three component coil and calculating taking the normal component?I mean we have an audio frequency magnetics survey we run essentially an AMT survey but we dont measure the Efield. We could simply pair that receiver with a TDEM transmitter and achieve the same effect it records full waveform so timing isnt an issue. ,geophysics,dbzxiiw,1,t5_2qzgp
