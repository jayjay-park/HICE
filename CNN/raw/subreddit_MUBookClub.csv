But Khonshu takes the form of various people. No Avengers hallucinations. I stopped at  but saw he teams up with SpiderMan in issue  that may be the closest thing to Avengers relation in this run.,MUBookClub,d5fvgqz,2,t5_3f0bu
11031293,0,t3_5w4bso,I really loved this. I thought the art was stunning. I especially loved the contrast in the first few issues with the black and white real world and full color magic world. I loved all the side characters. The quick little vignettes were cool.I agree the last bit in the cellar wasnt told very clearly. A lot of the stuff happened off camera or wasnt framed very well so it was hard to keep track of who was doing what. The art in the side issue was really varied did they get a bunch of different artists?,MUBookClub,deidecn,3,t5_3f0bu
