Ive been able to learn a lot about these crypto currencies the past few days and Im impressed by their potential impact. Im all about the idea of the decentralization of currency and the worldwide potential impact cryptocurrency offers. However there are several facets that turn me off.gtDigital currencies are the future. Offered in  Bit Coin is a young and growing technology. The benefits of Bit Coin have the power to disrupt the way currency is currently made and used. Fed up after the  financial crisis the idea of a decentralized currency came to fruition. Bit Coin offered tremendous freedom from third party financial institutions that drive up costs and cause problems. gtThere is no third party seizure meaning government cant freeze your account. Bit Coin is used anonymously with no taxes or transaction costs. While many people are concerned about the limitless power of governments over an individuals life Bit Coin and other cryptocurrencies offer an awesome solution of freedom. The question here is why isnt everyone already using this technology?gtWhile my understanding of cryptocurrencies is limited I believe I have valid concerns. The earning power of Bit Coin is not a concern. I think that as digital currencies become more popular the price will continue to appreciate.  My main concern about Bit Coin is HOW you get it.gtThese Bit Coin Farms use ridiculous amount of electricity and I could never have a similar mining operation. The way Bit Coin is mined in my opinion has a negative economic and environmental impact. While Lite Coin offers an alternative mining process that alleviates these concerns it is still the silver to the Bit Coins gold. However I think both are still great investment vehicles and everyone should buy some now. gtIf anyone has any further reading for me I would greatly appreciate it. Im extremely interested and am trying to consume everything! The financial impacts and how cryptocurrency is used as an investment vehicle interests me most. Do you currently hold cryptocurrency?

I would suggest everyone to read Anna Coulling book A Complete Guide To Volume Price Analysis.gtTLDRMost important truths about all marketsltolgtgtEveryone is trying to make money on the market. End of discussion.gtPeople are making money in both directions. A big number of bitcoin exchanges allows you to trade with leverage. You can sell bitcoin you dont have and when the price falls buy them back and collect the difference. Most people are not aware of this. They think the only way is to buy low and sell high.gtMarkets are manipulated by big players. This is also true for heavy regulated markets but especially bitcoin!ltolgtgtOne of the strategies for market manipulation If you have enormous amounts of money what most early adopters do. You can keep buying a big supply over a long period of time. This will not affect the price right away because you will have always people selling. But then you can make a big push in a short amount of time raising the price to a new bar and keep it stable there selling again everything over a long period. Take the market lower again and repeat!gtOf course news always comes good as wind in the back to move the price. Especially bad news because the price moves faster down than up true for all markets.gtSo dont try to make too much sense behind price movements. Its moving because somebody is trying to make money and not because there is some badgood news and thousands of people realised its changing the world suddenly.gtIf you would like to learn more about this topic just grab any trading book.

In a payment system the global mechanism to prevent double spending can be a centralised system of online authorisation authorisation using endtoend authentication tamper resistant objects or more realistically some combination of these. Moving the  primary locus of trust even slightly can have profound effects and very small design changes can greatly improve the systems resilience and robustness.From   ,BitcoinAll,cxtxmdk,1,t5_39m7n

The platform that was  rbitcoinrbitcoin  has been irretrievably destroyed. Bitcoin however has not been destroyed and I think its good for bitcoin to get people off that ruined platform sooner rather than later.gtLets say we have two competing discussion forums.

More importantly whats the most productive location to grow the community in the long run? Maybe the forum that censors discussions is right this time that censorship resistance is the most important property of bitcoin. But shouldnt that discussion be allowed? In my opinion pro large block people need to be educated on the decentralizing effects of small blocks rather than driven off to brew conspiracy theories and fork the network.gtAnd maybe you think its ok now and in a Machiavellian sense you like that the procensorship subreddit is on the right side of the block size debate and maybe youve actually convinced yourself that theres not a huge number of people who actually disagree with you and that its some sort of censorship or false brigade of its own. But maybe you are wrong and maybe the strong leaders you like here now wont always be on your side of things. I say it is more productive to move to an uncensored subreddit as quickly as possible. This wont be the last disagreement within the community. And mark my words serious damage has been done. A for will occur and it is a direct result of the terrible decisions being made by moderators every day on  rbitcoinrbitcoin . Ultimately I think you show more self respect by posting in  rbtcrbtc  I agree with small blocks but I can never support a discussion forum that is highly pro censorship and almost seems to deliberately be seeking to divide the community.,BitcoinAll,cy9prcq,1,t5_39m7n

Id like to start mining bitcoins. I understand that it can be expensive to start off but Id like to know my options. Firstly can you guys direct me to somewhere where I can learn how to mine using my graphics card? I understand that this is inefficient and will not make any money but I would like to do this to learn about how it works before I invest money. I have a GTX  and an iK if that matters.gtAlso I want to know about hardware meant for mining. What are the positives and negatives of buying my own hardware as opposed to paying for someone else to do it I dont know what its called but the thing where I pay them to use their hardware? Also how do miners work? Do I plug them into my computer or do they work on their own? What miner should I get if I decide to get one?gtI apologize for my ignorance but this seems like a good thing to do and Im not too sure how to start. Thank you!,BitcoinAll,czv8z7f,1,t5_39m7n

6583397,0,t3_45ul5s,   Author  tobixen    Content     gthoir I know it but I just wanted to share this comment I just entered on a blog.  Some people at the other side of this debate are still describing classic as an altcoin some people even thinks that removing the  MB limit would be an altcoin even if Core and  of the miners was to support it.  There is so much wrong with this reasoning ... but in the comment below Im just pointing out that classic fits very well into the original vision of Bitcoin.  Please dont flame me for the statement that Adam Back is acting in good faith while I wouldnt rule out completely that hes acting in bad faith I believe it serves no purpose basing the argument on conspiracy theories.gtI feel there are some fundamential misunderstandings here.  This debate has two sides personified through Adam Back vs Gavin Andresen.  Despite all the conspiracy theories I strongly believe that both Adam and Gavin are acting in good faith and want only the best for Bitcoin.  They both want Bitcoin to stay true to the original vision of Bitcoin  and I want you to put away the thought of Classic being an altcoin or Classic being a hostile takeover attempt.gtFirst of all let me try to deal with your implicit claim that any abandonment of the MB limit contributes to ditching Bitcoin and creating an Altcoin.  I dislike arguments like look at what Satoshi wrote  its an appeal to a godly authority an authority that is unable or unwilling to clarify what he really meant.  Anyway its hard to argument for or against the argument classic is not Bitcoin but an altcoin or controversially core is not Bitcoin but an altcoin without looking into how Satoshi defined Bitcoin and what he actually wrote about the proposal to increase the limit.gtFirst of all I would like to point to the white paper.  It says nothing about a  MB limit but its strongly hinting that the chain with the most accumulated PoW is the Bitcoin.  Meaning that if more than  of the miners will support Classic the miners still sticking to a  MB limit after those  days will efficiently be mining an altcoin.gtI would also like to point you to the very start of the blocksize debate Garzik proposed an immediate switch to MB block size limit in October   ref     the terms hard fork and soft fork was not introduced back then but Theymos immediately identified it as a hard fork and Satoshi chimed in.  Satoshi kicked the can his exact wording We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it.  In    he goes further proposing to hardcode the new limit being applied at some future block height allowing the network sufficient time to update.   I suppose the number  was chosen quite arbritrary but block  passed in March .gtSo Satoshi said ... lets upgrade the limit to MB?  when we get closer to needing it i.e. ? by setting a hard flag block height and giving people some grace time months? .  Classic is nothing but an attempt to fulfill this.  gtTLDR Please stop bitching about Classic being an altcoin.  Classic is Bitcoin.,BitcoinAll,d009ztg,1,t5_39m7n

6758266,0,t3_48bsok,   Author  moonjob    Content     gtThis seems so silly.  Its sad that we are letting Bitcoin stagnate.  If the blocksize was increased I bet we would have a lot more users more investment VC interest improved infrastructure more innovative services higher price and other mindblowing things that you cannot even imagine.  Instead its all being blocked.  Blockstream does damage control and says they are the ones making all the code and everyone else is leaving.  Yeah that is what happens in a captured industry. Quality devs cannot even contribute to Core because their code will likely be blocked and vetoed.  This is why Mike Hearn started XT because they blocked his lighthouse code.  This is why quality devs like Mike are quitting Bitcoin.gtNotice all of the energy companies quit too leaving the monopoly to GE.  All of the small banks and credit unions are closing down so the toobigtofail banks can get more monopoly bailouts. The same thing is happening in this space and BlockStream is trying to get complete control over the protocol and Bitcoins future disgracing Satoshis vision.gtPeople are attempting to capture Bitcoin in the same way as other industries have been captured.  But I still hold hope.  Because Bitcoin is supposed to be resistant to these attacks.  We should have expected these usurpers to come.  Now is the test if the people can rise up and throw off the tyranny of BlockStream Core.  If we can do it we will prove to the world that Bitcoin is in fact different and resistant to such capture.  The price will rise extraordinarily if such an accomplishment is made and if the community can successfully rebel against Core. I hope everyone will learn their lesson soon and realize the immediate need for a block size increase. gtBitcoin is not so much about technology and code.  Its about a human network.  At the end of the day we the people run this network.  Once the people regain control of the network then I will feel much more confident to recommend it to others. I really hope the people will rise up and bring justice to this situation sooner than later.gtI think this is going to be a huge embarrassment to BlockStream Bitcoin Core and the devs like Adam Back Greg Maxwell Peter Todd Luke jr.  People like Samson Mow eragmus and btcdrak are never going to be given credibility in this industry ever again.  It will be sweet justice.  The steadfast people who get it like Brian Armstrong Gavin Andresen Jeff Garzik and Satoshi Nakamoto are going to be proven right in the end.  They are the people that the world will look back upon with respect while the others will be disgraced forever.,BitcoinAll,d0id0iw,1,t5_39m7n

These solutions can be understood as technology and especially in that it takes many individuals to build them and so there is a certain time involved and implied. gtInstitutions are these solutions often thought of as buildings but are really just customs or complex sets of rules and they exist not because of some history of secret societies that rule over the common man but rather to act as sort of metavehicles that render complex problems into simple games that can be approached and solved from the meta perspective.gtMoney too arises naturally! as a technological solution to our complex social problem we ALL share this problem right? and so there is a special psychological problem that arises because of the nature of the problem and solution money attends to.gtMoney exists to solve a problem that the individual isnt supposed to or cant fully understand and yet because of the nature of the solution each of us knows and understands the value of money or in other words what money is for.gtSo a duality arises where on the one hand we have a increased and often irrationallyemotionally motivated want for money and on the other hand we dont really understand what money truly is or what it is for.gtThe problem then is exacerbated if the money used by the people is subject to the whims of political will whether it be of some real or fictitious elite rulers that control the quality andor supply of a currency used by the citizens or whether it is the citizens themselves that might exert their own political influence on the nature of the money used to serve the society.gtUltimately and this is my conjecture but it is also my plea and in regard to the introduction to this paper the individual seeking to serve their selfish wants but also possibly to alleviate world suffering what we truly should want is to levate an unbreakable standard between the largest institutions nationscentral bankslarge currencies in order to solve the largest and most significant metaproblem possible on our planet.gtThat problem is the Triffin Dilemma.gtThe bitcoin community has been fighting over trying to keep bitcoin a coffee money for the people trying to keep bitcoin out of the hands of the big players governments and banks.  This crusade is petty short sighted and valueless to the individual and the society not to mention scientifically unfounded.gtIdeal Money which is the levation of such a standard I allude to that is for none other than the highest meta players of our global financial system is that which will bring order to our global economy and what that means to the individual is the attainment of each of our individual goals.gtIdeal Money means the attainment of each of the individuals selfish wants and each of us can help each other and our selves achieve such ends by the levation of it which happens through dialogue on the subject of How do we bring Ideal Money about?...which we must remember from the very beginning of the dialogue is a QUESTION not a conclusion to be argued about.,BitcoinAll,d48gdag,1,t5_39m7n

However the recent price explosion was bound to push the topic of Bitcoin into the wider realm sooner rather than later and we saw the first inklings of this earlier this week with coverage from  Bloomberg  the  Wall Street Journal  and  CNBC . This trend is continuing with coverage continuing to pick up todaygtTechCrunch  Bitcoin is being Bitcoin and spiking  this week and  this year gtBarrons  Winning Portfolio In   Gold Treasuries and Bitcoin gtCity A.M.  Latest surge pushes bitcoin price above  barrier gtReuters  Virtual safe haven? Bitcoin surges to highest in more than two years gtRefreshingly yet predictably the coverage now has nary a mention of Bitcoins untimely death its governance issues or its use for nefarious purposes. Instead reporters are now praising it as a safe haven from broader market uncertainty and the bestperforming currency of  while also detailing the upcoming halving event and progress on scaling and codebase issues. Though a few still parrot the tired meme of blockchain over bitcoin thankfully that is now becoming less prevalent.gtIt will be interesting to see what happens to the markets over the next few weeks as halving mania reaches a fever pitch and the news media gets further saturated with Bitcoin coverage. While I dont think well see many front page stories unless and until Bitcoin breaks the ATH AllTime High the existing and upcoming coverage almost certainly will bring additional awareness and interest from those on the fringes of and completely outside of the Bitcoin space.gtWhile a tsunami of new demand is unlikely well likely see multiple waves of new money come into the space as those entirely new to Bitcoin as well as the I thought it was dead! crowd begin to throw a few bucks into Coinbase Circle GBTC  the ETN and other established and userfriendly onramps. However this effect will be staggered and delayed by the friction of buying in for the first time both mental what is it?...why do I want it?...how do I buy it? and financial please wait X days for AML  KYC onboarding and your ACH  SEPA  wire transfer to go through. Luckily these days the former factor is the biggest hurdle to overcome onramps have grown and matured over the last few years and buying Bitcoin is now easier than ever as those that remember the days of sending Western Union and MoneyGram to Mt.

9346422,0,t3_58isq2,Here is the post for archival purposes  Author  MatRich  Content   gtCryptocurriencies like Bitcoin are the newest development in money as we know it. Its complex programmable qualities may have the power to change more than just how we deal with money on a personal level or even the economy as a whole. gtWith a full integration of a digital currency traded by the entire world a completely new way of seeing world politics could be set in place. It is entirely possible that the world could see a new model not Capitalism not communism but a sort of Crypto Scientific Democratic Economy. So yah its not a catch name but we have time to find better before were done putting this system in place.gtImagine if one day the world all agreed to a set of rules and converted their currency to a standard digital currency capable of being transferred from one Country to an other in an instant. All transactions tracked and approved by algorithms honouring the rules agreed upon all the codes open source open to scrutiny. These rules are set in order to encourage and incentivise human excellence peace and well being of the earth and mankind. Quite the task! It sounds beautiful and optimistic. Nave wishful thinking you might think? Anyone logical would see it this way but I invite you to hold off on that thought until you have read about these rules and the structures in place which would be as follows.gtThink of this structure as a United Nations .. One with actual power and neutrality where every country unites to govern the world.gtEach Country puts all of their money in the World Bank which is completely decentralised owned by no one. Each transaction is tracked and registered on millions of computers who cross verify all the transactions for validity A Blockchain.  gtAn average price on human life established How much does it cost to feed a person in an average country. Each country has different costs due to their different realities infrastructure etc. The price is to be renegotiated very soon.gtAt the moment of implementation each country must propose a budget for the resources needed required in order for their country to flourish. I will not go into the way that the initial standing of each country is to be decided since that is to be determined by the current system accounting for many factors like national debt GDP resources history and much more. This is by far the hardest part of the process and I am no expert in world politics economics or human nature! Although I agree this step may seem insurmountable at the moment I would invite you not to dismiss the theory just yet. If the system proposed could work this is the big wall we must overcome to achieve our potential for peace!gtAlgorithms are set in place to calculate and allot currency to each country according to what every country has evaluated. In this algorithm there are guards in place to catch any fraudulent behaviour. For example if a countrys evaluation is far off from the norm or in opposition to the norm it is valued much less in the final tally. If this behaviour happens too much and patterns of maliciousness manipulation are detected this will affect their allowance negatively. Stop it North Korea the USA and lesser Korea do not deserve to starve!  Play fair or you will not get desert for your citizens!gtOnce all the proportions are calculated with the process described above and an extra amount kept aside as a global emergency fund all of the worlds currency is now available for each country to dip into as they please! These amounts are locked in place for the whole year and no more than the amount allowed can be withdrawn. Transfers between countries are extremely illegal and due to the transparent nature of the Blockchain any attempt at doing so would be heavily sanctioned by a heavy penalty on allowance. gtEvery week or month depending on what is decided the United Nations . holds meetings to discuss progress and propose actions. Good behaviour is incentivised at these meetings by giving scores which will affect next years allowances. The same algorithms as the initial process and more govern these scores. For example If a Canada has a huge discovery in solar energy has implemented the technology thus lowering pollution and saving costs. Countries are invited to vote on the impact of this development. If China shows with their vote that they are not impressed but the whole world is amazed Chinas allowance just took a hit. Furthermore if after downvoting the technology China actually implements it the other countries can now vote to lower Chinas allowance once again for not playing fair. Canada is given a part of the allowance that China has lost both times as extra incentive for innovation the rest is divided amongst the group. gtAllowances are recalculated at the annual meeting according to the years history. This is also the time for each country to propose a budget once again according to what they need and what they want to accomplish. The budgets are calculated with the same process as the first time only this time the years score is added to the equation. Countries are given their allowances and the process repeats again and again. gtOur current world system has penalties for wrong moves but it doesnt have the right incentives. The world is in constant tension due to fear of attack of other countries. Ever dwindling resources mean that within this climate of fear the best solution for countries is to stack up wealth and prepare to survive a war. Weather it be by arming themselves choosing sides or avoiding too much attention the worlds behaviour is driven by fear. Profit is the main positive incentive we have at the moment and even it is controlled by fear. We want strong economies to not starve to death to not be vulnerable to our enemys. We do not advance technologies that are not profitable to shareholders shortterm profit. With the my proposed system there are incentives and penalties in place that hold the right values and in such would affect the behaviours we would want to see. Made possible by new advancement in currency and computing I believe we have the power to implement an environment that fosters good behaviour and produces innovation. By incentivising collaboration and innovation with technologies already available to us today we have the chance to live in a world with drastically reduced fear. The only thing we have yet to come up with perhaps is the political will. ,BitcoinAll,d90q5im,1,t5_39m7n

Roger BU Haiyang Po Blocke and others are indeed expressing dissent. You havent called them out. They have been dissenting for a while now. And they are getting stronger because dissent reinforced with facts and visions of a better world appeals to other free men who have the courage to thinkfeely learn from mistakes and adjust their positions accordingly.gtNow onto the destruction of your emotive drivel.  gtRoger Ver and his big block agenda has managed to create a lot of noise and uncertainty in the bitcoin space the last couple of months. But what does this movement really consist of? Who is really supporting it who owns the voices and opinions that are being blasted out from  rbtcrbtc  bitcoin.com and Rogers twitter?ltblockquotegtgtSince you are asking what the movement consists ofit consists of me and any other free man with the sense to choose which side of a contentious issue he wants to stand on. Who owns my voice? Me goddamnit. Dont forget China the  attendees of the Hard Fork Cafe the BU developers and the scores of free people expressing disdain for Core on Twitter and  rbitcorbitco ...wait there are none here because they have been purged you sycophantic wretch.gtAugust th this year. A new twitter account is made ViaBTC. This is the official twitter account of the mining pool ViaBTC. They announced that their hashrate somehow surged from  to  in  hrs. Quite a feat. They almost immediately start to retweet Roger Vers big block propaganda like these  ltblockquotegtgtWell did or did not the hashrate surge from  to  overnight? If it didnt then call him out. If it did then whats your point? Also I would like to clarify that the propaganda in question consists of  ViaBTC saying We support big blocks and  Mr. Ver quoting a business truism Dont kill or cripple version  in favor of an asyetunreleased version . gtI cannot tell if your trolling is meant to be ironic you are a simpleton or your guilty conscious betrays you since the above two tweets are . A free man expressing his opinion and . A common sense business maxim applied to our beloved bitcoin.gtOctober th ViaBTC retweets Roger Ver about the Fantastic turnout for his meetup of Bitcoin scaling and free speech supporters.ltblockquotegtgtYeah were you there? It was fantastic. There were  attendees total and  present at any given time. You should get out more. Its amazing what different opinions can do for the mind of a free man. gt days later October th. ViaBTC announces they are signaling Bitcoin Unlimited with all their hash power.ltblockquotegtgtAfter a huge gathering of miners bitcoin enthusiasts and BU folks ViaBtc started to signal...Gee whiz! Its almost like they found common ground and made plans to effect the change they want to see in the world. The horror! Free men making deals!gtSo the movement now have Roger Ver his communication channels  rbtcrbtc  and bitcoin.com plus about  hash power. Voices are Roger ver and Haipo Yang CEO of ViaBTC.ltblockquotegtgtDont forget China the  attendees of the Hard Fork Cafe the BU developers and the scores of free people expressing disdain for Core on Twitter and  rbitcorbitco ...wait there are none here because they have been purged you sycophantic wretch.gtEnter John Blocke who conveniently created both a twitter account reddit account and a Medium blog account in the following days and promptly went into overdrive producing content. He immediately becomes one of the most active and upvoted voices of the movement expertly packaging the censorship propaganda and unhinged technical arguements into blog posts. His post    is currently stickied on  rbtcrbtc .The whole picture around this push for BU just reeks of dishonesty and hidden agendas.ltblockquotegtgtThe only thing that reeks is your neckbeard cheese. JohnBlocke created social media accounts WITHIN HOURS OF EACH OTHER to spread his views...astounding! Mentioning the figure Blocke only weakens your already facile theory that BU is nothing other than Roger and ViaBtC. Here we have another free citizen taking to the internet to voice his or her opinion. Blockes works are farreaching indepth and highly informative. You seems to praise the authors acumen and writing ability. As with most of your kind it seems your venom is admiration in disguise and derives from an inferiority complex rife with jealousy and an eagerness to be in the presence of strength only to experience humiliation. gtYour emotive muckracking grows weaker and weaker. You started out with a catchy title punned from Noam Chomsky and Edward Hermans  Manufacturing Consent . You should read it or  watch  it. The work introduced the The Propaganda Model which ironically describes the machinations of Core e.g. censorship bias in reporting narrativestructuring being beholden to investors etc much more so than a free movement like Unlimiteds. gtIt is the polar opposite of an organic movement driven by honest opinions and arguments. If you remove the crosstweeting between Ver and ViaBTC and a couple of anonymous voices that have mysteriously popped up the last months there is really nothing much left of this whole movement.ltblockquotegtgtWhat is more organic that organizing events spreading your ideas gathering likeminded free men and women and signaling this to the masses? Also dont forget China the  attendees of the Hard Fork Cafe the BU developers and the scores of free people expressing disdain for Core on Twitter and  rbitcorbitco ...wait there are none here because they have been purged you sycophantic wretch. gtMore effort needs to go into exposing the dirty games of Roger Ver. It seems obvious to me that he has bought ViaBTCs BU support and is funding a concentrated effort to create a sense of dissent in the community.ltblockquotegtgtFinally your circular drivel has come to an end without an upshot. You began by suggesting there was some conspiracy I thought you were going to prove that Mr. Ver was in fact ViaBtc and JohnBlocke China and every Twitter dissenter and  rBtcrBtc  user at once. Alas you did nothing but come into the room and defecate.  Peeyew! Maybe that reek you smell is more than just the neckbeard cheese afterall. gtLastly may I remind you that dissent is only possible in a free societyltstronggt. As a denizen of the coopted  rbitcoinrbitcoin  I understand that the light of reason hurts your eyes. But I urge you and your kind to be strong castoff your slave chains and consider alternatives. If after rational consideration you disagree then voice those concerns as such. Vicious albeit comical diatribes such as this only serve your mastersnot Bitcoin. ,BitcoinAll,da7dk3k,1,t5_39m7n

But contrary to what most people may expect this is some positive news for a change. A new document has been released by the government which goes to show Bitcoin is in fact legal in the country. Although this change had been rumored for quite some time the document makes it all official.gtThis particular document is living proof cryptocurrencies are considered legal in Russia. Or to be more precise Bitcoin and consorts are looked at as foreign currency. A few months ago news broke about the government leaning toward this peaceful resolution albeit nothing had come from it every since.gtAll trading operations about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are foreign currency transactions. More importantly these transfers will not be subject to financial reporting. Considering how the IRS is investigating Bitcoin transactions in the US it looks like Russia is turning the other way.gtAn Official Document Legalizing Bitcoin in RussiagtThe news comes as a big victory for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and advocates in Russia. The country has had an uneasy relationship with Bitcoin over the past few years. At one time it even looked plausible the government would incarcerate entrepreneurs conducting cryptocurrency transactions. Thankfully that idea never came to fruition.gtAs a result of this official document there is no legal prohibition related to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in Russia. Additionally buying or selling Bitcoin is perfectly legal albeit considered a foreign currency transaction. It is important to note using cryptocurrencies may be a cause for money laundering investigations though. This doesnt mean all Bitcoin users will be scrutinized by default however. It merely points out local exchanges will need to perform KYC and AML checks of all users.gtIt is due time some clarification regarding the Bitcoin situation in Russia is provided. No ban on Bitcoin and other currencies is a positive development. Any draft law regarding banning Bitcoin usage has been put on the back burner for the time being. However new regulations may be written in the coming months.gtBitcoin is deemed foreign currency in Russia since August of . All cryptocurrency activities suspected of money laundering will be reported to the Russian tax authorities who can launch an official investigation. Now that everything has been put into official writing the future is looking promising for cryptocurrency in Russia.gtHeader image courtesy of ShutterstockgtFromNewsbtc  ,BitcoinAll,dannwlv,1,t5_39m7n

But even if we use the own ratioo that means that  out of  people worldwide will ever be able to acquire an entire single Bitcoin.gtgtAnd think about how skewed worldwide current BTC ownership is towards China and then the U.S.   While the ratios of spread across the population may be better in these countries there are . billion people in the China and the U.S. meaning perfect socialism would allow for  out of every  residents to own but ONE Bitcoin  assuming there were NONE in any other country.  Factoring in the wealth disparity and realizing that plenty of other countries have Bitcoin investors maybe its  in  in China and the U.S.  still plenty scarce. gtgtBut that means BTC would be even more scarce in every other county since we have to still average  in  worldwide.  India Pakistan Russia and other countries with hundreds of millions of residents are all increasing in awareness and activity. Thats got to affect the market. Maybe not  a day...but maybe in a few years by day.gtgtThis in data holds up no matter what price BTC trades at its purely a calculation of supply vs residents  and the Earths population will increase at a FASTER rate than Bitcoin production  by a big factor  there are  new BTC mined each day....and  babies born each day according to UNICEF.   When we drop to day mining in  short months that ratio will tilt further towards scarcity.gtgtAll this hints at why every price prediction is likely WAY conservative. IF Bitcoin continues to expand in exposure to attract new buyers to trigger more FOMO to become more desirable to more people... AND THEN YOU FACTOR IN THAT SCARCITY... then  will be a remember when? number just as  or  is for the earliest adopters. Eventually there will just be bidding wars establish market price.  Some one will have to be induced into selling part of a Bitcoin to free any up and there are many more buyers to come than there are holders or hodlers now. gtgtIf there were a growing awareness that only  out of every  people worldwide could get their hands on a ladybug thered be no reaction financially environmentally maybe. But if you replace the ladybug with something being discussed on Bloomberg and CNBC and written about in WSJ and Barrons there will be a scramble.  We are seeing that scramble from Cyprus to Venezuela to Greece to China repeatedly there as the yuan staggers to India.  Capital controls  bank runs  hoarding  abandoning fiat  and governments taking currency out of circulation to stop inflation really?  these are becoming MORE prevalent not less  and that forecasts greater adoption of Bitcoin by more and more people anywhere there are banks and WiFi routers. gtgtIf youre correctly thinking well Bitcoin is scalable down to one satoshi so why is scarcity of ONE Bitcoin important consider this The relative scarcity is the same no matter how many different decimal places you use  lets say  in  people will ever have . Bitcoins or  in  will ever have . coins....when we get to the point where a fraction of a BTC becomes an aspirational ceiling of ownership the price will go off the rails just like the people who bought  at a time in  became Bitcoin billionaires  when price rose and fell and rose again which adds to the health of BTC to survive that crash much like a relationship is stronger if it survives a tough fight so in late  and most of   the rest of us were thrilled to buy . or   or  or  BTC a month.   feels like the good of days... and that was merely last August  months ago.   Now the same money buys . or . or  or  BTC.   A single Bitcoin already costs more than the average Americans weekly salary  assuming full time employment  which is hardly a given.   gtgt and  were so exciting.  I know some veterans saw higher prices briefly in  and I know we will have a dip and level and chop and future spikes.   But were not talking about  to  over the next  years.  New adoption reduced supply increased government pressure  laid on top of the simple math of BTC supply vs population  suggests the moon landing someday is several factors of  higher than the dream of  in . gt,BitcoinAll,dbja04l,1,t5_39m7n
10065428,0,t3_5jwpfx,The author is confused and writes such nonsense as PayPal is the most popular online wallet in Kenya by far  The most popular online wallet in Kenya by far is MPesa. I doubt that most Kenyans even know PayPal.To his credit he does mention MPesa later but the article contains more confusion. It sounds more like a Skrill ad than like good journalism. The truth is that Kenya has a lively LocalBitcoins market with at least  reliable dealers who will happily fill up your MPesa account with Kenya Shillings for bitcoins so Skrill may be welcome but is not urgently needed.By the way selling bitcoins in Kenya is done at a very good exchange rate because there is a tendency towards a slight bitcoin shortage there.

It converts it to AUD and then I literally just use it as an EFTPOS card like I would my regular Visa Debit card from my bank.gtIts absolutely fine it works etc. What I want to know from you experts is why should I use this Bitcoin EFTPOS card over my regular bank card? I initially assumed that I gain anonymity since Bitcoin is all about privacy amp protecting your identity untraceable wont get scammed amp have my bank details lifted etc.gtHowever now I think about it could my card be skimmed just like my regular bank card? So is there even a point in having this Bitcoin EFTPOS card? Or should I just call it quits keep my Bitcoin wallet but ditch this card in favour of my regular Visa Debit from my bank?,BitcoinAll,ddcs65p,1,t5_39m7n

10808494,0,t3_5ukzgg,Here is the post for archival purposes  Author  adamus  Content   gtSegwit is an optin softfork to miners they can signal and protect users without supporting. It probably is the case that there are people who do not understand this subtle point so I wanted to flag it. Nonsegwit blocks remain valid after activation of segwit though a miner should protect their node using a segwit aware border node or upgrade their node but tweak it not to yet create segwit blocks until they get comfortable with it. And unlike previous softforks segwit is more miner optin forgivving and wont penalise via block invalidity people who do not switch their block version after activation and there is protection from other miners even if a minority of miners dont upgrade nor border node protect their infrastructure and continue mining without defences their blocks remain valid they just are exposed to someone wasting k to make an invalid segwit block which they might temporarily build on until the majority orphans or rejects it as other miners and ecosystems economic full nodes would be validating.  In addition segwit transactions themselves are optin and provide unilateral scaling to people who adopt there is a long list of services and wallets etc that are ready    and adoption also creates capacity for everyone by logically but not physically moving the witness signatures out of the MB block. Physically segwit blocks are just larger blocks    it is only old nodes that have an alternate serialisation sent to themThere is a list of segwit benefits    and costsrisks    for a fuller discussion just wanted to highlight that segwit is x optin. First  the ecosystem has decide if it wants it as a pragmatic tested incremental step to scaling seems to be the case by organic node count ecosystem support and readiness     whereupon miners then should signal readiness which is different from support to allow those who want to optin to do so and then  post activation it is optin for miners whether they generate segwit blocks or wait a while to decide and  it is up to users and services whether they upgrade and benefit directly from the scale which benefits others via increased free space.Finally there is some dangling confusion about discounts or economic changes. Whether you call it a discount or an economic change it is an unequivocal good that the perverse incentives to create UTXO bloat are reduced. Today it is literally cheaper for a wallet to split one coin into change vs spend change from two coins which reduces UTXO impact. UTXO is a scaling factor it needs fast access cache memory and accesses to it scales nonlinearly latency to it has been getting worse as use grows. Artificially bloating it helps no one. That the bloat is not worse is in part due to mildly altruistic or nonshortterm costoptimal change selection in wallets. The weight construction in segwit is technically necessary anyway to get scale without introducing a d optimisation problem and reduces the incentive to bloat UTXO hurting scalability. So for people who look at that economically the way to do so is that it is a beneficial reduction in a negative economic externality.,BitcoinAll,ddutj3c,1,t5_39m7n

Because I need to quickly pay some bills with btc I signed in to my poloniex account I sent another  ether it took  confirmations for the deposits to be processed which was about  minutes. I sold the ether for btc and in less than  minute I was able to withdraw the btc to my wallet. As I type ShapeShift hasnt sent my btc nor complete the transaction. gtIve used ShapeShift several times and their service was close to instant but I guess they aint getting any better. I was just wondering if I did a huge transaction... thats how Ill be left hanging. I have emailed their customer care service. I hope theyll refund back my  ether as I no more need the btc for now. ,BitcoinAll,detrobj,1,t5_39m7n

Bitcoin Unlimited Unlimited makes the process easier by providing a configurable option for the accepted block acceptance depth via a GUI menu. Bitcoin Unlimited Unlimited thus provides a userconfigurable setting allowing you to accept a block larger than your maximum accepted blocksize if it reaches a certain number of blocks deep in the chain.gtBy moving the block acceptance depth from the protocol layer to the transport layer Bitcoin Unlimited Unlimited removes the only point of central control in the Bitcoin economy  the block acceptance depth  and returns it to the nodes and the miners. An emergent consensus will thus arise based on freemarket economics as the nodesminers converge on consensus focal points creating in the process a living breathing entity that responds to changing realworld conditions in a free and decentralised manner.gtThis approach is supported by the evidence accumulated over the past six years. The miners and node operators have until now been free to choose a block acceptance depth of  which as demand grew has always been fixed to meet the needs of the market. We expect miners to continue in this tested and proven freemarket way by for instance coordinating to reject any blocks larger than MB unless they reach whatever block acceptance depth they have chosen. As demand increases the blocks acceptance depth can easily be decreased to   and so on thus removing central control over the process of finding the equilibrium blocks acceptance depth by allowing the free market to arrive at the correct choice in a decentralised fashion.gtIn this way every user will have his own blockchain.,BitcoinAll,df9a542,1,t5_39m7n

The Google search isBitrad.io BRO BTCThe fact that theyve taken their forum offline is unsettling. At least you can read what used to be there using the Google cached view.And yes if you successfully bought some BRO BitRad.io credits the fact that they are called BRO means they are not BTC and is therefore an altcoin.

11590430,0,t3_65fcp7,Here is the post for archival purposes  Author  jratcliff  Content   gtI felt a need to post this.gtI am deeply offended that individuals who became extremely wealthy because they got into bitcoin early are now trying to attack it with controversial hard forks inexperienced development teams radical changes to the network protocol and consensus rules and propaganda.gtLets understand this very clearly.  Two individuals are largely responsible for the disaster that is bitcoin unlimited.  They are Roger Ver and Jihan Wu.  Just these two guys.gtSo much for decentralization.gtRoger Ver by all accounts is a very wealthy man.  We dont need to pin down an exact number.  All we need to know is that he got into bitcoin early at an incredibly low price point and bitcoin has made him a very wealthy man.  I dont resent that he is wealthy.  I resent that his wealth has made him so jaded he thinking attacking our network is his privilege. gtNow lets stop for a second and talk about wealth because it is important.  Most people strive for wealth because financial  independence gives them a certain amount of freedom in their lives and removes anxiety and stress. They no longer have to worry about how they are going to pay their bills or what would happen if they lose their job.  In fact if they have enough wealth they dont need a job at all any more.gtWhat kind of wealth does it take to have that kind of independence and freedom?gtOn the low end maybe a couple of million dollars.  At the high end ten or twenty million.  If you have ten or twenty million dollars the investment returns on that alone would allow you to lead a lifestyle of the fabulously rich and famous for the rest of your life. Not only would you be able to live an extremely extravagant lifestyle so would your descendants and all of their descendants for generations to come.gtAt this point you become officially the idle rich.  You have so much money that you have nothing better to do than pursue your own personal dreams and goals.gtBy all accounts Roger Ver is already at least that rich.gtHe is so wealthy that he never has to work for another day in his life.  If he lost  of his bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies he would probably still be wealthier than most any of us could dream of.gtSo who are we?gtWe are the people who did not buy bitcoin at pennies apiece.  We didnt buy them for a dollars apiece.  We bought our bitcoin for hundreds of dollars each if not at recent prices of thousands of dollars apiece.gtMany of us have made substantial personal investments in bitcoin.  We have put our familys money at risk because we believe in the network as a long term store of value.  The price of bitcoin matters to us.  The security of the network matters to us.gtWe can only dream of retiring for the rest of our lives and bitcoin might never reach a point where that is even a possibility.gtSo for these people who are fabulously wealthy to be actively attacking our network the one protecting our money with a cavalier attitude of ltemgtwho cares if we get it wrong we can just reboot the systemltemgt is deeply offensive.gtOur network is protecting nearly  billion dollars of our value.  If Roger no longer believes in our network.  Then fine.  Let him move to ETH Dash or fork his own coin.  However he should not be attacking our network protecting our money!gtIm tired of bored millionaires with nothing better to do treating our network as a playtoy that they can fuck up with no concern whatsoever because no matter what happens they will still be rich.gtThese millionaires either need to get with the program which is a strong development team executing a conservative but well thought out roadmap or go move onto something else.  But please stop attacking our network!,BitcoinAll,dg9s7fx,1,t5_39m7n
