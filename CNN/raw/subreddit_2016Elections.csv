1462075,0,t1_cizj0tw,Oh believe me I know its broken. The bad thing is only a fraction of the populace who is eligible to vote does. Its sickening. Ive also lost all faith in my government to do the right thing. I know that the race is a show of lies. Obama is a terrible president. Bush was terrible. Obama blames all of his problems on Bush yet does nothing to change his policy. Okay the point Im trying to get at is the system is broken. Its supposed to be a government for the people. Everyone wants someone to trust. Lets not argue about the improbability of a third party win and lets at least try to get somewhere. Anything worth getting is gonna take work so lets get to work.,2016Elections,cizjp1w,2,t5_2sxe7

9802884,0,t1_dal8w2d,even choosing to ignore his comments about wanting to FUCK HIS OWN DAUGHTER your assumption that feminists should like trump because She is vaguely centerist when it comes to womens issues is what is really laughable here. anybody who finds those qualities even in the slightest way redeeming would still be voting for Clinton not grab her by the pussy women should be punished Trump. fucking lol,2016Elections,dalf03z,1,t5_2sxe7
