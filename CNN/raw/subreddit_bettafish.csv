Ive always fed my fish the  meals a day once when I get up and once when I go to sleep Rose is the only fish that I only feed once a day because thats what they did at the store. I always bought zoomed brand food for them but I was worried she wouldnt like it. Maybe Ill buy her pellets and incorporate them in with the bloodworms until she gets used to just pellets and as you mentioned give her the worms as teats.

390127,0,t3_1yiy5h,Honestly this kind of thing can be INCREDIBLY tough to beat. Mycobacterium or acute columnaris are a possibility  but both have the same very poor survival rates. You can do everything right and still have either kill your fish. Both are a very fast moving and incredibly aggressive ailment that can take a fish from  healthy looking to dead in as little as  hours. It sucks.There is a particularly nasty strain of mycobacteriosis being found in a number of betta splenden populations blue bettas are for some reason particularly vulnerable that has a very low rate of recovery and no real reliable cure. tldr Dont be so quick to blame your LFS.

Most important parts are to have a heater so the water is at  degrees F and to do frequent water changes with a good water conditioner. Also if you need advice it helps to tell us all about your setup. We cant diagnose something without any information regarding your bettas home.

721044,0,t1_cgm7xv8,Thanks for the source.  Reading it and how it pointed out that halfmoons with excessive finnage are more susceptible to giving themselves haircuts overnight seems like it could be the case.  Males are completely new territory for me admittedly.  My females would pick on one of their sorority but she would regrow her fins quickly.  So Orion losing as much fin as he did overnight and by himself was a little eepworthy.I think Ill add a cave and take out a few plants to see if that helps with any boredom issues.,bettafish,cgm8i82,2,t5_2udkc
730558,0,t1_cgnamji,Yeah then I would try to make a buffer before you buy something new.

774183,0,t1_cgr4rio,You can use the carbon filter cartridges that come with hang on the back filters it is just essential that you also have some sort of biomaterial. The biomaterial is a piece of filter cartridge sponge that you always leave in your filter baring a quick rinse with tank water to remove some waste. This ensures that if you change your filter you do not lose all of your beneficial bacteria. True sponge filters are literally a sponge on the end of a tube. An airstone creates bubbles which rise up the tube and pull water through the sponge. This then circulates the water through the sponge that is filled with good bacteria who then eat fish waste. Personally I like my Hang on back filters. I have dirted planted tanks so they help to filter out particulates more than I think a sponge filter would. ,bettafish,cgsa1yp,2,t5_2udkc

839815,0,t3_23p1g9,It sounds like youre talking about whats been labeled last time I checked as graphite disease which is a variety of mycobacterium the bacteria that causes tb. The symptoms are large latches of charcoal miscolouration on fins which appear very quickly over the course of a couple of days steadily moving to the body. Lethargy is induced as the swim bladder is compromised. Death is very quick  usually within a day. In some cases the fish survives for about two days after the first symptoms. The graphite colour often accompanied by an oilylooking rim around it is a result of internal organs failing and shutting down and rapid necrosis setting in.Heres the thread on it with lots of pictures so you can compare.Can you take some pictures? Is there black around the edges of the fins? Can you see any obvious scruffyness around the edges or fraying? Are you sure its not his natural colouration?,bettafish,cgzqmvt,2,t5_2udkc

1061806,0,t1_choyxue,Since the tanks right now are really small you could pretty much just dip a plastic cup in and pour it into a bucket.  Keep going until it looks like the tank is about  down then empty the bucket into a sink.  Thats essentially what I do with my planted .G jar at work.  Add the water conditioner to the empty bucket fill it back up with tap water and either pour it onto a flat surface like a lidplastic plate or against the side of the tank if its a rounded one.  This helps prevent too much current from being generated by the pour which would annoy your fish and uproot plantsspread dirt everywhere if you have them.  If you dont have any live plants have you considered them?  Some of them are absolutely terrific at helping to maintain good water quality  fastgrowing plants will take up ammonia like nobodys business!  and can supplement a filter. They can also provide your bettas with places to hide or rest which they like too.  Itd be a real squeeze in a little tank trying to trim plants in that kind of space would make me wish for one tiny hand but a G planted heatered and filtered tank would be a really nice cozy home for a betta.,bettafish,chozcy5,1,t5_2udkc

1099352,0,t3_26pdfe,I would actually turn the filter back on  finrot is usually a result of poor water quality and without the filter on youre killing any established beneficial bacteria in it that would prevent the water parameters from going south. If you think the filter current is too high you can make a baffle with a plastic water bottle. With that said  Id like to see some more pics but I think whats going on here isnt true finrot but rather fin biting or tears. What kind of filter are you running? Does he have any tankmates?

1708357,0,t1_cjuhud7,Even if the water is nasty its better to do many partial water changes vs one big  change. So for example if you changed about  every day over  or so days it would be less of a shock to the betta. Unless there is some sort of disease outbreak or emergency like spilling a whole bottle of chemicals in the tank you should avoid a  change. And while the essentials of fish keeping are the same appropriate water parameters correctly stocked tank for the type of fish good filtration system etc goldfish are very different from bettas. Ive had a few and they are obnoxiously messy little buggers and require water that is fairly cold compared to a betta.

1885056,0,t1_ckg5p8h,Hey! Congrats on your tank! It has such potential now with pictures I realise the slime is brown algae and gunk. All very easily fixed. Your fish looks good it doesnt appear to be nipped or rot. Maybe a bit of melt which again is caused by chronically bad water. No need to medicate though which is great news! His beard is a light color how old did you say he was? That can happen to mature bettas. The floating particles is just loose dirt. Running the filter should collect that again. I second the NO on a freshwater mussel. You dont really need to add any other critter to the tank. A nerite snail will not reproduce in freshwater though if you get a female she will probably lay eggs everywhere they will never hatch and you can scrape them off in case youre set on getting something else for the tank. ,bettafish,ckgcb70,2,t5_2udkc

A completely cycle means there is enough nitrates to break down ammonia and nitrates fast enough so they dont build up to hurt the fish.Here is some info on fish in cycling.Here is a test kit. You will need to do daily water changes at least once possibly more than once a day.

2277483,0,t3_2lbeu5,Ive had bettas with african dwarf frogs without trouble a newt would probably be OK as well..  Like your pet shop guy said it depends on your particular betta.   Your newt is amphibious though so youll need to provide it with a place it can crawl out of the water... and they tend to like colder water than bettas so one of them might be unhappy.In a  gallon tank you can likely get away with several options he has plenty of room so shouldnt be as territorial.   You could add a small school of neon tetras or white clouds cory cats ottocinculus Khuli loaches although they are hiders so probably wont help with the emptiness snails  or divide the tank and stick another betta on the other side.      Just avoid anything with long colorful fins that he might think is another betta.  SOME bettas will let you get away with shrimp some will eat them.. but if yours isnt inclined to murder them... cherry shrimp are really fun.   Edit   If you do decide to get snails I suggest Nerites since they cant breed in freshwater theres no risk of them overrunning your tank and they also come in some really neat patternscolors.,bettafish,clt7rlr,2,t5_2udkc

Just make sure he has a lot of things to rest on near the surface. Id also consider lowering the water level so he can get up to the surface easier.Usually its recommended to quarantine new fish first in case they have any infectious diseases that could spread to your current fish. A QT tank would also be good in this situation because it is a middle point between where he used to live tiny cup and his permanent home big gal. I use a .gal for QT and had my betta in there for a couple months before I moved him into my big tank. I think it really helped the transition. If I had just plopped him in the big tank it would have been a struggle for him as he hadnt built up much muscle from living in a cup.,bettafish,cm445d5,2,t5_2udkc

Although it would be ideal to cycle it before you add the betta you could add him at the start and keep a close eye on the water parameters get a good test kit not the teststrips. Live plants are always fun bettas like floating plants and they are usually pretty easy to maintain. The type of live plants you can get depends on your substrate and lighting java fern and amazon swords are nice and dont require much care. Also add some hiding places but make sure there are no sharp edges that can damage his fins. I usually feed mine a mix of frozen brine shrimp and bloodworms and any fruitfly or other small insect I can find.  As for tank mates cories and snails do very well with bettas. shrimp can get eaten in smaller tanks or depending on your bettas personality. There is a stickied post at the top of the sub that explains everything much better. Hope this helps ,bettafish,cmddrzm,2,t5_2udkc
2468689,0,t3_2nsqdp,Archimedes is my eldest hes four. Hes a veiltail I picked up my first year of college Im now two terms away from graduating. I expect him to live for quite a while hes ridiculously healthy and still very active. My other boy Zy is almost a year I think. Also a veiltail hes been fighting a bad case of fin rot on and off since I got him. I ordered him some supposed kick ass meds a few days ago thats supposed to actually kill it so well see how it goes cause its the only thing I havent tried at this point. His entire tail is pretty much gone and hes almost at the body rot stage but hes still kicking and going strong. Real active good eater aggressive that fish is just not done with life yet haha. Ive had three others living from twothree years to a few months. One was sick and succumbed to it one Im  sure got into a fight with a bristlenose pleco I was gifted and lost they were fine for almost fivesix months living together but he was perfectly healthy when I left for a vacation and when I came back his remains were found in the plecos log. I no longer have plecos. and I still have no clue what killed the third one. He was Archimedes brother and lived in a divided g with Archimedes.

Hes gorgeous and that construction paper for a pop of color would probably bring out his blues really well! The only thing to worry about is that a lot of the bacteria that help with cycling the tank are inside of your gravel and filter.  If you take away the gravel it may mess up your cycle for a little while so just keep up with the water changes and watch your parameters closely.  Ive never run a gravelless tank so I have no idea how it would effect it.Another idea would just to be to get a lot of rooting plants!

2636888,0,t3_2q3ura,Congrats!  Ive been kind of looking at these...  gallons is pretty small in my opinion but I bet you could keep a betta and a snail or two in there with a big ol disclaimer that you would need to modify it.  I dont think that the aquaponic aspect of the roots growing in the water is going to clean the water at least not in such a way as to support the life of the betta.  However  with a little extra work than the box is advertising I bet you could do some pretty cool stuff with it.  If you can figure out a way to retrofit it with a very small sponge filter and heater you could keep a betta happy in there.  I do believe you would still need to small weekly water changes however.  It would always be nice to throw some aquatic plants in the bottom of it as well.... At any rate if you end up doing anything with it I hope you post an update!,bettafish,cn2rvvd,3,t5_2udkc

You have to stick with it until it gets better new translucent bits growing again. It might also look like it gets worse because the bits that are already rotting will fall off. I found whole shreds of fin the first few days.Also provide shelter or something to do. I chucked in elodea waterpest in his  liter quarantine tank. A little salt in a regular tank wont do a whole lot. What I read about it its equivalent to taking half an aspirin when youre having a migraine. So with salt you either use it as medication or you dont. Just a bit of it is useless. Obviously make sure you measure it off very precisely so you dont overdose.So with your . quarantine tank Id use . grams of salt or to make it easy only fill it up with  liters and put  grams in. Float the quarantine tank in your usual tank so it stays heated. Do daily  waterchanges with readded salt. It might take . weeks.About medication...

I just added one of those leaf hammocks to make sure he has a place to chill by the surface. However I honestly cant recommend putting more fish than just a betta in a tank thats under  gallons.  However you can certainly get some cool snails or even some shrimp depending on your bettas personality.  You can keep plants in tanks with sand or gravel!  Youll want to look for plants that can feed from the water column and with low light requirements theyre easier to keep.  A list of some plants that fit those requirements include  marimo moss balls anubias java fern anacharis and water wisteria or water sprite.  You may also have good luck with some aponogetons which you can find sold as betta bulbs at petco or petsmart. ,bettafish,cpzv6sg,1,t5_2udkc

On top of that it can lead to a tail biting habit which can sometimes prove difficult to get rid of even if you get rid of the reflections.Best ways to remedy areChange lighting angle so he cant see his reflectionthis will require some experimentation and patience.Add long plants to whichever tank wall he can see his reflection in.Provide more hiding spaces.Float some Indian almond leaves or add some floating plants to reduce strong light in the tank.,bettafish,cs86y01,6,t5_2udkc

4678538,0,t1_ctji13z,Sadly this is the truth. I think the biggest problem with pet owning is that you get people who want to have a pet but do not want to shell out any money for the upkeep and care of the pet. These people should not own pets and typically have no idea how to even care for the animal. People forget that pets are animals and not just something to be put on display. I partially put the blame on the misinformation that is fed to consumers by companies who care about nothing but money. I own  bettas and several mice and I honestly have spent more money in vet bills in terms of period of time etc for my mice than I have ever for my cat or dog. This is most likely due to the pet stores where I got my mice not really giving a shit about the future health of the animal as long as they made some money. All of my  mice have had serious health issues and Im sure that a lot of small pet owners out there dont take their super sickly bunnies mice and hamsters to the vet. Also in regards to the person talking about bunnies as toddler toys I totally agree. Like get your kid a stuffed animal or a plant or something not an actual animal that requires more upkeep amp care than your  year old could ever possibly provide. I think all we can really do is demand higher standards in terms of care amp breeding for pet stores. That and help people understand proper pet care and the amount of time amp energy that is required for a pet. Blerg long ramble. ,bettafish,ctka0ej,2,t5_2udkc

4742964,0,t1_ctsdyey,See how on the ends of his tail it looks more raggedyshredded than in the before pic? That usually means there iswas fin rot or maybe torn fins.  Do you have sharp plastic plants or other decorations in your tank? If so he could have ripped them in that. If not it could be fin rot which usually comes from lessthanoptimal water conditions. What are your ammonianitritenitrate levels? And what is your water change routine? Current temp of tank? Details about the tank can help diagnose issues. If it is fin rot clean clean water is usually the best route. So that means if your tank is uncycled frequent changes. Maybe adding in a bit of AQ salt. ,bettafish,ctse8q5,2,t5_2udkc

My fish that died was a dragon halfmoon  and he was beautiful  looked like something out of a painting so we named him van Gogh. I live on the Gulf Coast of Central Florida and when we moved about a year ago just a few miles north of our previous location the move and the slight temperature change really did a number on him.  I never needed a heater until I moved one county north  but even after I purchased one for his tank  like your fish he never seemed to quite recover from the overall trauma.  Its really sad  theyre such amazing fish.LOVE your setup!  I currently have two corner tanks  each holds one Betta and is . or  gallons.  How do you like your aquarium?  Was it difficult to set up and what were the costs involved?  Do you think the fish have enough room in each of the compartments  or do you find that the tank gets dirty fairly quickly?Thanks again for all the info.

4953038,0,t1_cuiu7xf, gallon are rubbish for anything other than snails or shrimpif you are an expert  gallons should be the absolute minimum. The problem with small tanks is that they are more unstable harder to manage and dont give the fish much of the needed room to swim. Depending on your experience I would either get him a  gallon tank just for himself or a bigger tank if you want other fishes only clam ones!. Also a heater is absolutely necessary for bettas. If the temp drops below C they can easily get sick. To get a new tank faster ready ask someone who has a already stable running tank for some filter material to infuse it with bacteria.,bettafish,cuivcmb,6,t5_2udkc
4956758,0,t1_cuj1x3o,gal is fine. A lot of people here are very passionate about bettas hereyou will find that a lot in pet specific subreddits and I think their emotions can cloud their empathy for a person new to the hobby. Bettas have an especially misinformed reputation since there are literally decades of misinformation to correct. They are just tough as nails and can survive the most shit conditions for a while longer than many other fish and in a sense its led to their downfall. As far as you are concerned for caring for this little guy a gal filtered heated tank is wonderful. You can keep him in a bowl with spring water for now while you are putting your tank together just be sure to change it every  days. I kept mine in a critter keeper for a few weeks while I slowly saved up and ordered parts and plants for my betta tank. Keep him in a warm place in the house if you can but no direct sunlight!

However by the time that I left work the temperature had dropped to about  according to my thermometer. I worry that the heater is not keeping up with the temperature fluctuations. But Ill find out for sure tomorrow.

5209137,0,t1_cvdsjps,Oh I still do water changes!! Very regularly but I have tetras in the tank and my betta stresses too much to pull him for feeding so I soak his food and put it in a corner then put the flakes in. So a decent amount of food makes it to the bottom. I can handle filling a pitcher for water changes but putting a bucket on the ground for siphoning through the stones until there a few inches of water left is hard on me. I have noticed when I siphon there are pieces of shrimp in the stones so the bettatetra dont gorge themselves to a dangerous level. With the shrimp lasting  to  weeks in the tank its a lot better siphoning when they disappear than every week for me. I havent seen how my new betta does with shrimps but hes a more modest eater than Marvell and likes to hang around the the middletop of the tank so he might leave them be.Like I said just an  experiment. If my breeding stock cant keep up with the disappearances then Ill shell out the cash for some amanos.I really just wanted to know DURING this experiment how to best help the shrimp thrive and no one has answered that question.,bettafish,cvdw6lm,2,t5_2udkc

6483014,0,t3_44exzm,it really depends on what kind of glofish you want. The zebra danios Danio rerio  need atleast g and a large group. These fish prefer colder water and can be huge assholes so I wouldnt keep them with a betta.The tiger barbs Puntius tetrazona needs atleast g and also a large group they are usually pretty aggressive and much faster than most bettas. The tetras Gymnocorymbus ternetzi will need g. These can be kept with bettas as long as they are in a decent group and the tank has enough hiding places. Bettas themselves need atleast g with a filter and a heater they can be kept with other fish as long as these fish arent aggressive nippy or overly colorful. ,bettafish,czpw4al,4,t5_2udkc

Since I put him in too early like the day I got the tank obviously no cycling occurred and the poor fish is basically swimming around in the middle of it.Im not sure whether to just start changing water in the little tank and now let the big tank go through a cycle or move him to the bigger tank with less ammonia obviously because I just started it or what.,bettafish,czz8a0b,1,t5_2udkc
6632943,0,t1_d054hbu,Please take the other posters suggestions and read the care sheet. You are likely harming your betta by keeping him in that bowl.

Youll need to fishin cycle but right now hes just sitting in uncycled and unheated water right? So the new tank is obviously a better option. Ideally youll want a test kit to help you out with water change frequency but taking  every couple of days should be a really good place to start. edit Nevermind I saw that you have a test kit now too!

8469478,0,t3_4vp4no,My parameters are  tank is  gallons and filtered cycled heated etc. I recently discovered that Glen must have some dragonscale in him because his scales are beginning to grow over his eyes and Ive noticed some vision problems developing  he will occasionally miss when he tries to grab a pellet from the surface of the water and he never did before. I thought that he might be biting his tail because of the stress of losing his vision but when I put him in the cup to take pictures I noticed that theres actually a color change around the damaged area of the fin which I thought only happened with fin rot. the rest of his fins dont look particularly pretty in this picture either but that color is normal for him. Hes a very pale blue when the light hits him just right but hes so pale that most of the time he just looks seethrough.He has also been kind of lethargic for the past week or so. He mostly hangs out on top of his heater on his betta leaf bed or somewhere on the gravel. Hes still capable of swimming all around the tank but he doesnt do it very often. ,bettafish,d6082xa,1,t5_2udkc

8562248,0,t3_4x1ho8,Well with a cycled tank youre looking at a water change every week or every other week  to manage the nitrates. I personally do a  water change every two to three weeks. My parameters always have  ammonia   nitrites and nitrates a bit on the high side. I dont have to scrub anything anymore its just using a simple gravel vacuum to take out half of the water and replace it with clean dechlorinated water. Youre honestly not doing nearly enough water changes. Before I cycled my tank I had to do a  water change every other day AT LEAST just to manage the ammonia. And water changes that frequently really did begin to take a toll on my fish. He HATED the cup. I also had to inspect his environment daily to remove poop or extra food to help reduce the ammonia buildup. Now in his cycled tank I dont have to worry about it. It seems like youre not testing the water and if you did youd see that your changes arent frequent enough. It doesnt take much effort to do a fish in cycle especially now that your betta is living in an uncycled tank. Simply start the cycle by having a filter and instead of doing a  water change every week start doing  every week. Im sure many people will suggest using products to help jump start the cycle but I honestly didnt use anything. I just was sure to monitor the parameters doing changes when necessary. ,bettafish,d6bux26,8,t5_2udkc
8595576,0,t3_4xjq94,You shouldnt really throw them away because they contain the necessary bacteria to hold a cycle. I normally just swish them in old tank water to clean them.

Fin damage can be due to ammonia amp even though . is not ideal its unlikely that it would cause ammonia burns but get it sorted.Could he potentially be tearing them on decor?The clear patches suggest considerable healing.

Im gonna hazard a guess that your betta has ammonia poisioning which often displays as reddening of the gills which you noticed when he was flaring his beard.  This can kill him so its important you learn about how to prevent it.   As for being scared of the filter you can try a filter baffle google diy filter baffle and make sure he has a hiding spot coffee mugs work great.  ,bettafish,dan5iv1,1,t5_2udkc

It wasnt a fungus and he ended up kind of sloughing off a bunch of scales picture and then his scales came back and he ended up looking marbled so I thought it was that too! Through all of that he acted perfectly fine and healthy and I couldnt find a reason for it anywhere including asking local fish stores so I kinda let it go. Anyways he was fine for about a year and then a couple months ago the white started coming again and eventually went up and covered his eyes too. So he was mostly blind and then about a month after that he was just laying at the bottom of his tank and not eating so after several failed treatments I euthanized him.

10102496,0,t3_5kgz78,The healthiest bettas Ive had have all been veil tails. The most unhealthy ones Ive had have all been crown tails. Just kind of a weird trend Ive noticed. The fanciest ones Ive had have also been the most likely ones to eventually get some awful tumor. It seems that betta tumors are often made up of the scale cells that make the pretty metallic colours the fish vet Dr Loh has a video on youtube where he analyzes one. I had a crown tail with an absolutely beautiful very opaque iridescent blue patch on his side. Lo and behold later in his life a huge tumor sprouted from it. Another shimmery platinum white crown tail I had died of multiple tumors  ,bettafish,dbod916,3,t5_2udkc

10237925,0,t1_dc4h7su,Here it is in all its glory. The only real work I had to do was yank off the label on the bottle and use googone on the sticky crap I wasnt sure if the adhesive under it was good for fish tanks and it is a little hard to get the bottom cut off I was kind of unsafe about it and sawed it off partially with a steak knife lol. The bio max filter sponge and air pump could add up in price but you can opt for a cheap sponge from say a dollar store or something. The real point of the sponge is to catch debris. Some people use only a big sponge and no filter media but I prefer to have some of those weird tubey things in there just to make sure the filter grows lots of ammonia eating bacteria. I could probably even stand to have more of them in there but I only have the one little dude in the tank so. You may be able to find a  gallon air pump at a thrift store or it may be cheaper at somewhere like walmart than the pet store. Ill link everything I used exactly but Im sure you can find a cheaper sponge than I have and maybe something like a soda bottle would have an easier to remove label.Bottle of course Sponge cut to fit bottle Bio Media Airstone this is optional but I like using one Airline the smallest length ought to do Airpump Its suggested that you have the airstoneopening of the air tube sit under the bio media because the bacteria also like some air bubbles. Oh yeah and in case you are unfamiliar with the aquarium cycle and all that jazz never never let any part of this filter touch tap water after you initially rinse it all off to set it up. You really dont have to clean it like ever. If the sponge gets lots of debris in it you can give it some good squeezes in a bucket of old tank water say during a water change. It should only take about a week or two for the filter to cycle with good bacteria but during that time youll want to do a  water change every couple of days. Buying that fancy bacteria in a bottle may help things move along but Ive never needed to use it myself. Yellowish or even orangey gunk appearing on the air line is a good sign as far as Ive heard! This should be good bacteria so youll want to leave it alone as much as you can even though its rather gross looking.,bettafish,dc4ixy3,2,t5_2udkc

10937638,0,t1_de846n9,These days the term Mustard Gas or MG is used incorrectly as it happens to describe any bicolored fish that possesses a green blue or steel blue body and yellow or orange fins. This particular color combination has in fact been in existence about as long as the Non Red gene itself since it is fairly easy to breed an iridescent betta to a Non Red betta and get iridescentyellow bicolors by the nd generation.The Original Mustard GasThe term Mustard Gas was originally coined by breederhobbyist Jude Als to describe his particular line of multicolored bettas. The original Mustard Gas bettas were greenbodied fish with variegated bands of blue or green yellow and black. In  Als added a band of white as well developing certain specimens of Mustard Gas into a fourbanded butterfly the colors of which were never clearly separated but rather run together creating an effect that looked like gas to its creator.In the late s Als sold some of his Mustard Gas fish to other breeders some of whom outcrossed the line but retained the strain name. Therefore the modern Mustard Gas fish is today so far removed from Als original vision as to be a completely different colorpattern combination. One of the most intriguing aspect of the Mustard Gas strain name was the controversy it caused among breeders and hobbyists all over the world who were able to acquire fish from Als strain and once having spawned them were at a loss for what to call them. Als was very protective of his Mustard Gas name and felt that once the pure line was outcrossed in any way the resulting fish could no longer be called Mustard Gas. He rallied hard to get others to stop using his strain name even to the point of securing a trademark for the name in . The primary focus of his campaign was Marianne Lewis to whom he had given  pure Mustard Gas fish a male. Lewis bred that male to several female fish in her fishroom from different lines and many fish came of a result of those matings that looked to her eyes identical to the Mustard Gas fish she obtained from Als. She bred and sold these Mustard Gas fish until Als asked her to quit at which point she changed the name to Salamander. This added to the confusion since people started equating Mustard Gas outcrosses with Salamander and any red bicolor fish they bred that came from a yellow bicolor outcross was named Salamander. It should be noted however that Lewis Salamanders are actually yellow bicolors that resemble the Mustard Gas and since the creator of the term Lewis does not even use the strain name anymore all those Salamanders you see out there are probably as fake as the MGs.more stuffs here ,bettafish,de852sv,3,t5_2udkc

11154496,0,t3_5z7h8g,Not something I have experience with but Id boil some water and store it in containers inside of a cooler with a blanket so that you can do some water changes if the tank temperature starts dropping too much. Just make sure to mix the water with cooler water from your tank before the change if its hotter than what you keep your tanks at when you go to use it. If you have neighbours or friends who still have power you can go to their place to get hot water.Doing that along with keeping the tank wrapped up in a blanket will hopefully keep everyone in the tank safe.If you have a fireplace in your house move the tank to the room with the fireplace and block off all of the doorswindows with blankets keep your family in there too  We had a big power outage one year during an ice storm and all slept in the livingroom nice and warm. If you dont have a fireplace though blocking your windows with blankets will help keep the cold out for a bit.Good luck.,bettafish,dewcmhk,2,t5_2udkc

11427966,0,t3_634mop,Hey I am in no way a Betta expert but just from my own experience with a . gallon tank this heater worked perfectly for me However I should add two things. I have only had this heater for the duration of winter my room gets pretty cold at night so my experience is only how it works in a cold room. I have no clue if your room is hot and if this will overheat the tank or not. I would suggest getting a cheap thermometer . This heater doesnt regulate temperate it has two settings on and off depending if it is plugged in or not. So keep an eye on your thermometer. Also very important thing to know is if you are ever going to have it out of the water UNPLUG IT. It will get very hot and then burn itself out and it wont work again. Youll have to get a new one.I linked to petsmart just beause thats the most popular store I can think of.

11476604,0,t3_63t4w2,I have  female betta in a  gallon tank. A couple weeks ago they got into a fight and tore each others fins up. I immediately separated them and have been cleaning the tanks x a week with a little extra StressCoat to help with healing.They have been showing great fin regrowth but one has me worried. She has been losing her color every night. When I check on them in the morning I notice shes a very pale color and loses nearly all of her magenta. About  minutes after I switch on the light her color returns. This has happened the past  days in a row. Her behavior is normal otherwise.Ive never seen a betta lose color and regain it this quickly. And just by turning on the light. Most resources online are for betta losing color slowly or for longer durations so Im not sure where to turn. The tank is  gallons. I do  water change x a week since their fight x a week before that. Theres a Tetra Whisper filter and it has a heater keeping it  degrees F. ,bettafish,dfwvabv,2,t5_2udkc

11717040,0,t3_6769om,Identifying ick on a white fish is difficult. Fin rot is easier  does your betta have a reddish or dark coloring on the tips of his fins? Regardless whether its ick or fin rot treating with aquarium salt is a good place to start. You can add  tsp of aquarium salt per gallon at  hour intervals up to  times max  tspgal although Id leave it at  unless your fishs condition seems to be getting worse. Remember to dissolve the salt in some water before adding it to the aquarium. Keeping the temperature up is another good way to help your fish fight disease so youre already doing well there. In the future you can start adding half a teaspoon of salt per gallon every time you change the water as a disease preventative.RGTP is right.
