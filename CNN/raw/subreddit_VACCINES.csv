204532,0,t1_cf0cx4d,If you are working on site then what precautions do you take to prevent yourself from getting sick? I have noticed many family practitioners do not wear protective masks and such when seeing patients maybe because they see a wide range of ailments. However you are guaranteed exposure to infection. ,VACCINES,cf1qnf5,3,t5_2r9k3
733066,0,t1_cgncitu,gtAlso how many of those baboons would have caught sick in the wild?I really hate to ask this but... well... did you read the baboon study?  Your question really doesnt make much sense in the context of the study.  Could you maybe elaborate on what you mean?And yes Im glad you see my point.  Diseases cant survive if they kill their host.  They coevolved with us to continue infecting us and the serious complications death paralysis etc. that they leave in the minority of patients is to the disease an acceptable collateral.But we dont have to accept that.,VACCINES,cgnlqle,3,t5_2r9k3

3140372,0,t3_2w490f,LOL Been there.  Enjoy beating your head against a wall.  Where the hell did this whole aborted fetus thing start?  Its a new one to me and I used to argue with these people CONSTANTLY.  I gave up though.  You cant change peoples minds with facts.  It just makes them defensive and more sure of themselves.I actually know a nurse who is against vaccines and I spent months trying to educate her.  In the end it made non difference.  I had to just let it go and move on.  Maybe when a kid dies because of her she will wake the fuck up.  Luckily we are in a pretty sparsely populated state and nothings come here so far.,VACCINES,conhvpu,4,t5_2r9k3

4462456,0,t1_cst2dre,OMG. I am so tired of explaining things to you sheeple who trust of all entities politicians and corporations ??!! Just amazing.There is NO immense amount of data supporting no link between these toxins because the studies themselves draw conclusions from faulty data. For example did ANY of the studies you listed radiolabel Thimerosal Aluminum Formaldehyde Sorbitol etc. molecules THEN inject concentrations of those neurotoxic additives equal to those in the recommended regimen of vaccination over the course of the first  years of life AND in a statistically significant population of babies numbering in the hundreds AND THEN track the movement of those molecules and perform autopsies of those babies to see if brain cells and other cells were destroyed? NO? Then there are NO studies proving those substances are safe.HOWEVER! Guess what? There are studies showing the effects of your so called safe mercury Thimerosal on individual human cells and THAT is real science. Unlike those fucking sellout scientists doing subjective clinical observations on populations being exposed to totally different environments and life events.Effects of Thimerosal on NGF Signal Transduction and Cell Death in Neuroblastoma Cells Parran et al Following h exposure to increasing concentrations of thimerosal the EC for cell death in the presence and absence of NGF was  nM and . nM respectively..nM Thimerosal is . ethylmercury by weight with molecular weight . gramsmole . MolesLiter Thimerosal x . grams Thimerosal per Mole x  liter   milliliters x  grams  . parts per billion mercury. Remember this is flat out brain cell death. Lower concentrations are able to disable cells from functioning normally. And thats just ONE shot! And ONE of the TOXINS!Scientists are just human. They have to feed their families and can be bought like anyone else.Waste your energy fighting to help government take away more freedoms instead of fighting to give people an additivefree alternative if they happen to believe the additives are unsafe.,VACCINES,cst66ps,0,t5_2r9k3

5139424,0,t3_3ld7bw,They immunized individual mice x with adjuvants and toxins. This means that a tiny animal is going to have an inflammatory response every five days for essentially its life span. Each immunization takes roughly  weeks to go back to normal in lymph nodes. They essentially forced a sustained inflammatory state mimicking autoimmune disease in these animals. Inflammatory responses are going to include a lot of tissue destruction which releases endogenous native intracellular proteins out into tissues to be picked up by unsuspecting apcs which are already there because of the inflammation. This is almost certainly why they pick up so many  auto reactive cells. My argument is further supported by their own evidence of tissue damage. To me this is by far the most logical explanation and it is probably why a study with such a potentially important claim is not cited or discussed years after publication.All that said there is absolutely evidence that shows strong correlations between immunizations and auto reactive cells but its a lot less sensational than people think. Healthy people have many low level non specific auto reactive cells already and they dont cause disease. ,VACCINES,cv5hr8i,1,t5_2r9k3
5399244,1,t1_cw1sw6n,Japan dropped the HPV vaccine due to concerns. Also reputable sources tend to protect investments I dont know if you noticed that.

I just clearly know more than you and youre not admitting to being wrong no matter what because you cant grasp the fact that vaccines are good for you are actually vital and nontoxic AND the fact that youre looking to put down people based on their looks and not for their work. smh,VACCINES,d2nl2j8,1,t5_2r9k3

9246392,0,t1_d8o0xuv,Its gradual but with a sharp upward curve as the days pass. What you need is enough time for your body to mount an immune response to the material in the vaccine. For a young person in good health Id guess seven or eight days to be pretty solid.,VACCINES,d8o1qbh,2,t5_2r9k3
10569009,0,t1_dd1wg4n,I think it can also depend on why youre afraid. I personally am afraid of heights so I can totally understand the idea of an irrational phobia. It doesnt matter to me how much someone tells me Roller Coasters are safe or that the barrier at the edge of a lighthouse wont giveI still dont want anywhere near these things.If you are in the same boat that is to say you might be dealing with a phobia regardless of how it started you might want to replace a nonproductive fear with a productive fear. Sure its not likely that your child will die of meningitis. It is  after all. But they also arent likely to die in a car accident on any given day and yet we still wear seat belts. Other people are unpredictable and pathogens can be invisible and so we are safe regardless.Give your psyche something productive to fear with a brief slideshow of both acute symptoms of infectious diseases the ones manifesting during initial infection as well a some of the more chronic and longterm disabling effects. We can all appreciate statistics abstractly but sometimes you have to just play hotpotato with the lizard brain since it doesnt listen to reason to the same extent. Sometimes a number on paper quantifying risk isnt what is needed and you need a good ol fashioned kick in the amygdala.,VACCINES,dd63ywf,1,t5_2r9k3

11521461,0,t1_dg1v7ty,yes as the parents we get to decide what is best for our children not a doctor. Well take their advice on board. We have made a decision and the query here is finding the path of least resistance. Laws have changed in our childrens lives around this. Its not that we want to walk in and slip a doctor a  bill and ask them to look the other way while they sign but some doctors willingly and blindly tell you something and when it goes terribly wrong will point to science as why they told you it in the first place. Theyre not miracle workers and if theres a doctor out there who can guarantee that immunizing a child will NOT have any adverse reaction particularly a long term one then Id do it. But they dont exist. ,VACCINES,dg1yjqm,-1,t5_2r9k3
