1230754,0,t1_ci7leha,Yes. My question still stands though how often do you leave the city?I pay  a month. The same thing with koodo not including data costs . I put an extra  a month on to cover any extra costs that might occur due to me leaving town I leave about once a month. That extra  accumulates fast enough that every now and then I dont have to pay my bill because Ive got enough saved up.People get so hung up on the fact that wind makes them pay outside of town. The realty is its so inexpensive that it more than makes up for it unless youre leaving town on a regular basis.,windmobile,ci82siy,3,t5_2x13z

5309180,0,t1_cvqavk9,Read my post again.  The entire point is that Wind usese a punitive hold on deposits without explaining that in the terms of service.  And judging by the facebook comments on the Wind page the store level wind employees seem to be getting much of the same negative feedback.Edit  Also the practice of having customer sign away their right to view the service agreement is in my opinion a violation of the CRTC rules.  Think about it.  A customer goes to sign up for a plan they go through the whole process of a credit check picking a phone picking a plan then when they go to sign they they are asked to go online and read the terms of service.  How many customers actually do that?  Its a bait and switch an you know it.

You should get a notification if you are connected to an away network. I dont have experience disabling WIND away... I think the FAQ on the site might discuss this.
