3043,0,t3_1u5rln,I agree that kh had a better original soundtrack but I think thats because it has more music. Also I prefer passionsanctuary over hikarisimple and clean esp. after the battle so that might influence me more. I just feel the first one was more whimsical than the second.

I have said it twice now but maybe the third time is the charm. The thing that would prevent Star Wars and Kingdom Hearts from working together is the tone.

345778,0,t3_1y0l3r,So Ive actually had this though for a while So were in Kingdom Hearts  and were collecting all the  lights to fight. Well we all know there are too many keyblade weilders so some are going to have to sit out. So I feel that once Ventus is brought back Sora might lose his ability to weild. And since this has become his life and he was one of the greatest keyblade weilders he will succumb to darkness for a bit. He fell once why not agaiin? So now not only do our heroes have to worry about Xehanort but we have to worry about puppet Sora. And now close to the end of the game Riku finally makes the final sacrifice to save his friends.    Do I think this will happen probably not but it would be fantastic. I hate shows and games where we know the hero will never die because its a main character.,KingdomHearts,cfglxe8,1,t5_2s3jo

843618,0,t3_23s1o8,A Jungle Book world is almost guaranteed Nomura has been wanting to do that since KH. This would take the place of Tarzan and Mulan before it.Also I think there are certain archetypes that need to be satisfied so if we take a certain world out of the equation we need to add another one in. Wonderland and Cinderella made us little people in big worlds so I think we can expect A Bugs Life Toy Story or most likely The Great Mouse Detective to take their place.There needs to be an underwater world and they are clearly out of ideas to keep The Little Mermaid going so I think Atlantis or Finding Nemo will take its place. I doubt well return to Beasts Castle since we got a conclusive postcredits wrap up on that front. I think we can expect something new to take the place of that world which I think leaves room for a wild card something Nomura is keen on. It could honestly be any Pixar movie or perhaps a recent disney film Tangled and Frozen are surely front runners. Also I strongly doubt we will return to Halloween Town. This is sad but I dont think theres any material left to explore there. To replace this we will probably go somewhere else familiar likely a stitch world since he is a Nomura favorite. However thats all speculation. My main point here is there seems to be room in KH for  completely unprecedented Disney worlds of Nomuras choosing.I think Pirates will likely return since there is a lot of plot for them to work with. This takes Neverlands place. I think Agrabah is certain to come back it and the Coliseum are both considered a staple of the series. Pooh is also very likely. Nomura is very fond of The Lion King and since theres a whole sequel to cover we can expect to return to the Pride Lands as well. The Kingdom Hearts games tend to limit themselves to a max of  original worlds per game. Since Hollow Bastion and the Keyblade Graveyard are all but guaranteed to be two I think we can expect Twilight Town and one entirely new original world. Every game introduces a new world I know there is so much old material already but to not create this games own End of the World would be somewhat lazy. I think the Keyblade Graveyard will be the penultimate world.I doubt they will bring up The World that Never Was Castle Oblivion or Traverse town because as much as I would love to go back to them I think theyre going to attempt to be economical about what they include. That said there are a lot of lingering plot threads that I can already see them ignoring and it doesnt thrill me. e.g. Maleficent Taking over The World That Never Was yet not appearing at all in that world in D. Thats about as comprehensive as I can get. As near as I can tell its all about process of elimination. There were  worlds in KH and  in KH. We can probably expect  in KH. . Radiant Garden.

938569,0,t1_chayiu4,No it isnt. I was able to face the second form fights without much difficulty only dying once or twice. You should never be too over leveled for a boss fight or it wont be fun. The fight was easy but it was long and tedious and half of it was waiting for him too attack.

1220121,0,t1_ci6kyqs,Agreed about Billy Zane his voice was so genuinely terrifying. From what I remember he ended up losing a lot of gigs because he was part of a movie that had some slightly antiAmerican message and a bunch of the actors from that movie were blacklisted from jobs Disney just followed suit and recast Ansem. Im not too sure on the details cause Im not American but you could probably look it up I remember thinking it was an overreaction when I first heard about him being replaced I dont think the movie in question was that bad especially since it was a movie and not some kind of conspiracy documentary. ,KingdomHearts,ci6vraa,6,t5_2s3jo

His specials could be a keyblade throw some long range spells and maybe KHstyle fire for his neutral aerial.

Marluxia was the hardest for me and I just beat him yesterday. with the death holes at the edge directly in front of him cuz the holes dont usually reach there and he does  off three moves. He comes at you as a scythe that rolls through the ground. You can easily block this and then  you just start hitting him. He does that tornado spin attack he normally does and I just reflect it. He jumps beside you then begins to combo you so you can block normally if you have good timing or just use reflect but stay out of the air at all costOR you can disregard that and get glide level  so you can just fly around or get aerial doge so you can just aerial dodge back to safety if you are in the air.He does a move after where he appear on your back and blasts come from the ground so glide is highly recommended for that.,KingdomHearts,cnwz6fy,1,t5_2s3jo

2935509,0,t3_2trs74,I love the game but it is a shame because it is probably the most controversial game of the series. Gameplay wise its great. The new additions were excellent. The drop system isnt that bad if you use DropMeNots. I only dropped like  times. I enjoyed the new worlds especially the Fantasia and Three Musketeers worlds because they shed some light on Mickey and Co. plus Fantasia is one of my favorite movies. And although there werent any FF characters the guys from TWEWY worked out pretty well especially the angelic character. Story wise I loved it. It felt way more revealing than the other portable games with the exception of BBS. This is where the game gets controversial though because some people are upset at what has become of the Keyblade and Xehanorts use of time travel. I personally love it. The Keyblade might not be as unique anymore but its still great to learn more about it and to see how other characters handle them. With regards to the timetravel usually Im not the biggest fan of it but I think it was used really well in DDD. The rules were fascinating to me albeit a little unclear and I like how it turned events that  appeared miniscule at first like Ansem SOD being on Destiny Islands when it fell to the Heartless into something way more significant. It also showed us just how insanely powerful Xehanort really is. All in all its one of the best games in the series. I would rank it the th best game in the series behind the main games and BBS. ,KingdomHearts,co1s30p,3,t5_2s3jo

So if you want to complete the journal expect repetition.  If you want to get the platinum on PS just start on critical mode. Its only hard for the first couple of worlds and it feels almost the same the further you get.  Magnega makes short work of mobs.  Dont waste time farming medals in the arena for crystals. It doesnt take that long to complete the story and youll get all the crystals you need as you go.  The first time you get an astounding crystal meld Experience Walker.

3047731,0,t1_codvjeo,Roxas definitely had a heart he couldnt wield a keyblade at all without one. Whats up for debate is whether it was his own or Ventuss. No one really knows and we wont know until Nomura confirms or denies it. I really hope he had his own though because he just acted too differently than how Ventus acts.Plus if you play through . youll notice that Roxas shares Vens hair but not his face. Vens face pulls in before his chin which is rounded while Soras and Roxass face come straight to a pointed chin. Vens nose and mouth are shaped slightly different too and of course Roxas has brown eyebrows while Ventus has blonde. Admittedly the difference between them is not very noticeable in the original games but Square made changes to Vens face in . to emphazise that he and Roxas are different people not that you were saying they were the same person just that I think that its interesting.,KingdomHearts,codwa78,2,t5_2s3jo

The reason i say watch them is because in . and . remix you only get the cutscenes from  days and Recoded which are DS games. The order you should play the series in at least how i believeKH gtKHCOM or KH RECOM gtKHAfter this you fair game to play any of the least  games just as long as you finish with DDD since thats the latest game in the story. I would personally say to play  days and Recoded before Birth By Sleep since BBSs story is even before the first game and it might be nicer to actually remember the full story when playing days and Recoded... Oh god that might have been super confusing xD Sorry  If there is anything you would like me to explain tell me!Ps If you dont knowKH .

3553355,0,t1_cpx9j3g,Yeah they both have different aspects of Xehanort and Terras personalities. Nomuras always been coy but hes said that those differences are important for how they acted.The time travel Xehanort uses means that even if you tell someone something when you bring them through time they wont remember it when they go back. There will be a hint of it left so you can kind of push them in a certain direction subconsciously. Since Xehanort couldnt change the past he already knew both plans were destined to fail so even if he warned them they wouldnt be able to do anything. He just took the lessons and moved on. That said its been left somewhat purposefully unclear just how much SoD and Xemnas remembered. It is worth noting that Xigbar suspects Xemnas isnt quite towing the line with Xehanorts wishes since he remembers them better than anyone. This is one of the reasons a lot of people think the KH of hearts was really about getting a power source to get Aqua and Ventus back. As for the heart transferal the truth is its never been explained fully. The unwilling thing is only my guess. Even an artificial KH is a hugely powerful thing so it may have just been the best option maybe since Xemnas doesnt have Xehanorts full power.In other words theres no super confirmed concrete answer P I imagine we may learn more about the new Organization  in KH to an extent that will help us understand this stuff more!,KingdomHearts,cpxb11h,2,t5_2s3jo

Id remove the whole set each teammate to a specific action toggle and just balance them well enough to provide a challenge in the game but not make it that they are invincible.

Aladdin The Lion King Cinderella Tangled just grabbing a handful here those were all musicals and yet none of them had levels that consisted of shoddy rhythm or lack thereof games. I seriously doubt this would be the case of hypothetical Frozen world Im sure Nomura has to have seen the reception of Atlantica back in KH II.gt  Frozen is popular and popular things are bad!Oh shut up kid. You must have been born after the s where the hype and marketing of Disney movies was absolutely huge. I can still remember how much freakin stuff there was for The Lion King when it first came out and Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin were absolute juggernauts had marketing campaigns that steamrolled anything trying to compete with them.

4516324,0,t3_3cxr3k,Well having not played the games this is as good a theory as any for the nature of Kingdom Hearts. Once you play them youll know why this probably cant be the case but you still wont feel like you know anything about Kingdom Hearts the entity. First a nobody is the empty vessel left behind when a being loses its heart. Since Kingdom Hearts has never as far as we know had its own vessel and is rather an amalgamation of all the hearts WITHOUT vessels its unlikely that Xehanort is this supposed vessel. Second you need to know that there are two types of Heartless. Pureblood Heartless beings of pure darkness that respawn infinitely. And Emblem Heartless hearts that have fallen to darkness contained within a Heartless as a vessel. These heartless release that Heart to Kingdom Hearts when it is killed by the Keyblade. Both of these however need a heart to be stolen from a vessel to be born. Without getting too spoilery I suppose its more reasonable to think that Sora is Kingdom Hearts Heartless than it is to think Xehanort is its nobody. But still this cannot be the case. ,KingdomHearts,cszxdon,2,t5_2s3jo
4531858,0,t3_3d4mfo,I always felt the reaction commands in KH were way too gratuitous in terms of ease of use. You never felt like you earned it just oh the designer really wants me to see this fancy sequence.I think itd be great if the reaction commands made a comeback but were less frequent and became seamless action sequences. E.g Reaction command for Pegasus where instead of just mashing triangle for free invincible hits you actually guide pegasus and are given  different attacks. In the Sora  Xemnas face off initiate and make the character automatically rush forward but direct the player to hold a button and release to draw the keyblade at the right time  too early or too late and you take massive damage instead.Pretty much a more interactive minigame that takes more than toddler button mashing would be satisfying.,KingdomHearts,ct1viyy,5,t5_2s3jo

You can sum up the relevant info in this game in like a single paragraph without even explaining how it came to be and itd make sense in fact you just did.In fact most of those things can easily be assumed through the other games. We have the Tron world in KH and even Riku Replica in CoM to make us believe other stuff can have hearts. Namin was aware of the mess Soras heart is because of when she scrambled with it in CoM we didnt need an entire filler game to show us that. We always knew Roxas was hurt we didnt need a very boring world to show us that either. The only thing I really see as relevant that we couldnt have figured out from other games or a simple cutscene is the Journal power thing.In the end as much as I dont hate the game I think it can easily be considered filler and be skipped without any problem.,KingdomHearts,ct5qwnx,1,t5_2s3jo

They all did a good job of making the various worlds more than just a simple pit stop along the road KH II had a bad habit of doing this and tying them into the overall story and having the characters learn things from their experiences.KH I also has the best damn ending of the games and had it been the only one it would have been a great way to send it off with a mix of closure and mystery.Days was the most tragic of the entire series and is almost a deconstruction of the Mary Sue trope. Xion knows shes special but because of this she goes through hell at just about every step and she gets absolutely nothing for it in the end.BbS was a breath of fresh air with a new cast who have their own motivations and stories before becoming connected to Sora and the other modern characters.

Notwithstanding Ive played some of it as time goes on but thats like asking someone who doesnt care about Assassins Creed to keep up with the story of Assassins Creed and then splitting it between different systems that they arent guaranteed to have. I can tell you right now I have no idea what happens in that series at all and that was all available on the same systems. Its the same for some people with  KH.

4827053,0,t3_3gy32l,I feel like the only way to top KH is to do that system but even better.With the worlds in KH being huge freeroaming areas instead of a dozen rooms Id like to see us go back to a world   or  times for different reasons. Like something in the storyline of the game or something with the main antagonist like OXIII visits to worlds in KH progressing with the worlds story itself or just coming back with better abilities and being able to access more areas than before.Two things Id really love to see would be considerable changes to an area when visiting again and overleveled monsters that you just have to avoid until a later visit.The first would be something like Olympus arena being destroyed in KH but actually have it built again when you come back because they had time to repair or something like Xehanort launching an allout attack on all the worlds and the destruction caused areas to change or different areas to be accessibleinaccessible from then on. Maybe you could even spend time rebuilding the worlds to get to the lategame items.As for overleveled monsters I just loved it in Final Fantasy XIII. Once you got to the freeroaming area of Pulse instead of saying Oh this area is level  Im fine you actually had to go based on sight like That monster looks huge and scary. Ill pass. or you had to fight things only to find you werent ready and run for your life. If they did this in KHs huge expansive spaces it would be a more organic way to keep you in the playspace until youre ready for those side areas.,KingdomHearts,cu2zn5z,2,t5_2s3jo

Youre placed in a team of  individuals based on your Union it prioritizes placing party members together first  you can create a party of up to  people within your Union  then picks others to match with based on something maybe Lux gathering or activity. Each day that team is pitted against a team in the same general vicinity of strength from a different Union  mines against Ursus today I think but yesterday it was Unicornis.At the start of every week the Unions are ranked by number of team victories. There are some small bonuses you gather  more lux if your Union is th you get a mission that gives a bunch of extra Ethers if theyre stnd but its not a big deal. Apart from that it changes the Union a certain NPC is in its always your rival Union  Vulpeuss is Leopardos I dont know the rest and yeah the Foreteller who shows up in your cutscenes because theres only been one where it was a set one and not just yours.,KingdomHearts,cumijvk,1,t5_2s3jo

5085704,0,t1_cuywmt7,If we take what the reports say about how the soul factors into death and what Master Xehanort says in his reports about his old age creeping up on him and him getting closer and closer to taking a dirt nap Im thinking if he were to supplant his soul into Terras along with his heart and make his soul the dominant one hed probably run into the same old agesoul problem whereas if he just puts the heart in he gets the benefit of a younger fit body and a soul thats not old. But thats just me taking a wild guess. The Lingering Will thing is something that Ive seen argued about. There seems to be be confusion on whether or not its Terras soul plus his willemotions just his will and emotions or a third theory that Ive seen going around is that since there seems to be a level of Keyblade sentience and some of them may be doing the wills of their original master. Terras Keyblade would be the one influencing the armor and therefore is the Lingering Will of its master. Either way the whole mind thing is also talked about by Terranort right after the Lingering Will animatesgtYour body submits your heart succumbs so why does your mind resist?Now on two of those it doesnt seem like you would necessarily need the transfer of the soul and the heart to animate the armor. So those cases if would just need Terras willmind to carry on and Terranort would keep the soul and body of Terra and technically his heart though Xehanort would be the dominant in this situation. You see Terra and Xehanort talking about the property dispute that theyre having in Blank Points During this he mentions Terras heart and body but the sold aspect is never really brought upgtDarkness rules your heartit gives me control. Muscle and sinew that once obeyed you now rebels against you. How you can remain here at all confounds the mind.gtHmph. Dont even entertain any notions of escaping me boy. In the end your heart will be engulfed by mine forever.Im gonna go try to find if theres is anything explicitly said about the Lingering Will in an interview or anywhere else as what he is exactly could have been said somewhere and I might have missed it and Ill come back and edit this post. And Im glad that you were able to get my analogy. EDIT Alright doing some digging the Lingering WillSentiment is also talked about in the  Kingdom Hearts MysteriesgtQ What is the true form of Lingering Sentiment? gtA After Terra lost his body his thoughts gathered into his armor.gtAt the end of Terras scenario Master Xehanort had commandeered his body so his thoughts took control of his armor. Afterward the armor stayed in the keyblade graveyard until KHII FM where Lingering Sentiment went against Sora. Because he saw that it was not his chosen one Riku using a keyblade but Sora he grew suspicious and thought he had something to do with Master Xehanort and attacked him.So using this information I personally think that Lingering WillSentiment is just Terras thoughtswill and not his soul but you can make your own interpretation because his soul was never explicitly NOT said to have moved too.

Basically I feel D was a big rushed mess and it shows! Whoops.Nah the whole purpose of the test is Yen Sid desperately trying to get Sora and Riku the heartdiving ability. He admits this is too much and theyre not really ready and that if either of them do itll be kind of a miracle to Mickey. Eraqus failed Terra because hes afraid of the darkness  remember he wanted to straight up name both him and Aqua Masters. Its not until Xehanorts lettter that he decides on the traditional outdated exam.The power levels thing is just kind of unnecessary here  the games are pretty explicit that your hearts strength matters way more than how hard you can hitwhat flashy shit you can do with your Keyblade.

5536757,0,t3_3qxjgx,All of the games develop the main plotline of what Nomura is calling the Xehanort saga. While some games contain more important story than others they all feed back into the overarching plot of the games and its expected that the lore of KHIII not necessarily the plot will be heavily infused with references to past games.The good news is that all Kingdom Hearts games will be available across two consoles the PS and PS.The PS has two collections Kingdom Hearts I. HD ReMIX and Kingdom Hearts II. HD ReMIX which contain two games and one summary movie each the games which are summarized are somewhat good but require other systems to play.  The PS will be getting the collection Kingdom Hearts HD . Final Chapter Prologue which contains the last two games not covered by the PS collections and the last piece of new game content KH . BbS A Fragmentary Passage before KH III comes out which will itself be available on the PS and Xbox One.With that said if you were to ask for a shortened list of games I think most people would point to the first three KH KHCoM KHII as well as the most revelatory of the remaining games KHBbS and KHDDD as the necessary games for getting most of the preKHIII plot.  You miss a couple of things with this short list notably the existence of Xion and all actual details of the Keyblade War but youll be mostly prepared to play KHIII with these  games.,KingdomHearts,cwjdb93,6,t5_2s3jo

The closest I came to that claim is when I said that Sora willingly gave his heart to darkness which is correct. He gave into darkness willingly and gave up his heart in the process. But if you need proof that purebloods come from people losing their hearts to darkness...gtThey are born from those whove lost their hearts...note this one was before an artificial way to create heartless was found so he is talking about purebloodsgtBy recreating the conditions that spawn the Heartless naturally...We know that emblem heartless are created by being forced to give into the darkness since he reproduced the conditions and created the emblems and we see that when a heartless steals the heart of a person an emblem heartless is created. It can be safely assumed then that this happening naturally is the process by which naturally AKA pureblood heartless are created.thengtBorn out of darkness in peoples hearts...FinallygtThe Heartless come from peoples hearts as does the darkness.,KingdomHearts,czrujqz,1,t5_2s3jo

Stayed for the later suffering and plot.Sure the original had its dark moments ha but things really started to kick off in CoM and II. I mean CoM has you slowly having your memories manipulated some rather cold blooded murder and a rising resistance group who wanted to turn you into a mindless puppet. II kicks that up a notch with Roxas and his existential crisis Axel and his suicide and the sense of despair when you find out you were actually doing more harm than good by slaying heartless. And then DaysBBS happened. Self explanatory. All in all I can say when I started the series a long time ago I did not expect all the feels and tears to come along with.  would and have been playing again. ,KingdomHearts,d0kzdo5,12,t5_2s3jo

7404351,0,t1_d2jrroi,Right.  I did have the As long as you have one of the fullturn boost medals caveat up front but I didnt really expound on it.  Currently Vivi Magic Aerith Speed and DiZ Power exist as jewelonly boosting units.  As long as you have any one of these you can dump it in the first slot of any keyblade and itll give the rest of your team a bonus.  I actually used Vivi for the longest time on Lady Luck as I was convinced that him being a star with a dot! was better than my star oncolor Aerith.  The wide majority of players here have spent at least some amount of jewels on the game already and might possibly have one of these units already. But that wasnt the point that I was trying to make.  Aerith did work thats certain.  But there were a ton of avenues that I could have improved on and didnt need to.   I didnt reset the stage once in that playthrough even though a typical way of clearing these stages is to furiously reload it until your partners Paralysis  Sleep skill goes off and clears up a free turn for you. I ran no Defense Boost units Paralyze units or Sleep units.  These are key for being able to clear these stages earlier on as they basically give you a free turn whenever they are triggered.  Defense Boost isnt as powerful as Paralyze  Sleep but its also much easier to obtain. I borrowed what turned out to be a really inefficient ineffective partner medal.  A star level  Rikku is pretty decent but I had far better available.  I picked her because she had Poison but the Poison skill didnt trigger once.  In addition I never used her gauge ability.  So while it was a good medal it was underutilized and I could have done far better borrowing units that I could have actually used the skills of. I used no massivelydamaging highgauge medal skills.  The farmable Sora A that I placed on my .x slot is a solid unit but as a gauge its multiplier is only . or something of that sort.  I could have gotten far more mileage with a similarlyguilted Rikku on that slot instead.  Sora As damage is something like   .  .  . guilt  .  Per hit thats  damage over  hits.  Rikku in that same slot could have done   .  .  . guilt  .  Per hit thats  damage over  hits.  My big attacker was Stitch which admittedly is really really strong in this game.  Mine could definitely use some optimization but it was swinging at  before any Attack Boost procs or before calculating Aerith.  If I was doing it right it would be at .  Its fantastic but its singletarget damage and it required that I be really spendy with my gauge hence all of the cheap medals.,KingdomHearts,d2jtqzu,1,t5_2s3jo

Since he needs to be in those last two slots always while preferably in the last slot it can be tricky at times to work around him. Also since Stitch can be guilted his damage output will at least match if not exceed many paid medals for a while until we get the ability to have buff medals later on that will let us guilt paid medals.BC Riku should therefore be your priority between the two medals listed since he is one of only three good Single target power damage dealers right now.,KingdomHearts,d2qqcbk,1,t5_2s3jo

Destiny Islands is a world from the Realm of Light not the Realm Between. Therefore it cannot exist in multiple realms at once. Destiny Islands drifted into sleep when it fell into darkness. Thats why Sora and Riku went back in time to when that happened.

I think its loading times might be a tiny bit slower but it has extra content to make up for that. Also they fixed Vens weird chin. ReCoded  either is fine.

Stronghearted Keyblade wielders can also deny keyblades wielded by weak of heart wielders as seen by Riku denying Soras keyblade in KH.

8506453,0,t3_4w8ajr,WHy do you want to merge an aerith to it? Aeriths STRENGHT boost is different from an ATTACK Boost.  Strenght boost is a special attack while Attack boost is a skill. Unless you mean to say your Aerith has an Attack boost skill along with her natural Strenght boost special attack and you want to transfer it to Cloud.If you really mean your Aerith has Attack Boost yes you just insert her in the first slot in the level up page and some skill transfer info should appear.Medal guilting is when you fuse enough identical medals together to make it stronger to a maxing of  additional medals. Once you fuse the th you get a special attack bonus in percentage the range differs from medal to medal depending on rarity.  Skills such as Attack Boost Paralysis and others are mainly earned through scrooge medals from the coliseum reminder that ATTACK boost is not STRENGHT boost. The higher the level of a skill the higher the chance of it procing but you also gotta take into account the fact that the enemy can have resistance to it so a skill procing doesnt mean it will work.,KingdomHearts,d64v168,1,t5_2s3jo

Dont get me wrong Disneys involvement amp the fact that the game is a partnership between Disneyloving Japan amp Japantolerant Disney...implies a really expensive dub from the beginning...amp a lot of the nonDisney characters dubs are spot on.....but a lot of KH fans forget that if this were anime being released dubonly there would be riots.  amp Bob Buchholz has..never really been a great director. Jack Fletcher Final Fantasy Mononoke Spirited Away or Mary McGlynn of Naruto Bebop Wolfs Rain wouldve been much better. Also Lance Bass is a really strange casting for Sephiroth.Bottom line is the dub is mostly great amp I personally happen to adore dubs in general but a lot of people who like animestyle media would turn up their noses at Japanese media with English voices.amp honestly I would like a way to play the games subbed as well as a huge dubbingVO fan.uFrietagSurvivorIf you are someone that prefers the original language exclusively or simply would like a way to hear that...it unfortunately doesnt exist for Kingdom Hearts or Metal Gear Solid which actually has several awesome voices amp characterizations lost in the dub. There is a way to play Kingdom Hearts  with a Japanese voice patch amp there are undubs for several of the games but sadly I havent found a way for Kingdom Hearts .Though the dub sounds great amp not too cheesy well in the context of an animeesque game amp if the release werent dubonly I would be singing the hell out of its praises.,KingdomHearts,d6vi4z3,1,t5_2s3jo

8757558,0,t1_d5x48g4,As of now its not considered kompu gacha if it were then it wouldnt exist right? Especially since SE is a well established company. Such a company could try to pull a fast one but for now lets assume theyre doing things by the book.However like TheOppressed mentioned you still need to complete the set in order to get a medal at its strongest potential. Even then you could be reguilting countless times to get max guilt. Your definition is technical being that we need  separate pieces in order to unlock another piece. Though lets dig a bit deeper so we can have a better understanding shall we? Good? Ok.For example if KLouie and Mowgaloo were in the Deals THEN that would be kompu gacha since MP is not obtainable unless you have both pieces.Unlocking guilt is not recognized as kompu gacha because its technically not unlocking a new medal. However it cant be denied that it is dangerously close to kompu gacha because it encourages the player to keep on spending money in order to unlock it. A new law would have to be made in addition to the current kompu gacha law to cover this aspect of it.game displays multiple items for players to randomly draw for a price similar to the Gashapon or gacha and a player who has obtained all of a designated set of items or completed the set can combine them to form a rarer itemExplains difference between kompu gacha and regular gacha So as I understand it KHUX is still a gacha game but not a kompu gacha game.,KingdomHearts,d70cqpy,1,t5_2s3jo

8777515,0,t3_50995x,People seem to be debating whether or not it would be a savvy business decision to cut production of a XB version of the game so I decided to throw together some facts using the release of FFXIII as a starting pointFFXIII total copies sold worldwide     PS .M     .M Global console market share at time of XIIIs release   PS .M     .M Now lets consider the current state of the console market   PS M    XB M If KH were to follow the same pattern as FFXIII the sales would look something like this   PS    XB Off the bat that seems like XB still has a big enough chunk of the market to warrant production but there are still many factors in play the fact that there is no precedent for a Microsoft KH game being a relevant one.  Anyway Im not sure how much development is needed to port a game but my guess is that it would have to be pretty expensive to warrant the stoppage of production on XB.

For your medals use one of PinocchioBambiJudy and Nick preferably Bambi and the four biggest medals you can squeeze on that keyblade while hitting the slotspecific mulitpliers  the higher the guilt tier the better.  If it means using weird stuff like a maxed Abu go for it.  The more DB  medals you have the better but dont do things like give Larxene DB.Once you start the battle use PinocchioBambiJudy and Nick every turn and Minnie after the first turn.  Tap the rest.

8932703,0,t1_d7hllee,I share the same sentiment but admittedly Im a bit biased because I managed to guilt Sweetheart Beast at .Since I havent guilted any Jewel medals and likely will not for some time hes definitely considered a stronger medal for me  current Jewel or fully guilted farmable medals or not.For me he can replace both fully guilted Goofy ver. A thats a nobrainer and fully guilted Paine since hes over  guilt at a lower cost and his added Cure Special is a nice bonus.The way I see it is that  he could outclass decent farmables  he could replace a costlier AoE medal and all the while doing so  he also has the power to Cure.Curing doesnt seem like much when you have other stronger Cura and Curaga medals but in the context of AoE attack  cost and potentially being even stronger than Paine its a bigger deal to me.Its not JUST Curing and its not JUST Attacking.Its the combination of the two carried out in a single strike AoE Special which Beast does effortlessly.Yes there are definitely stronger Cure medals and of course there are definitely stronger Attack medals and all available through Jewels.But if Beast is going to outclass someone like Paine or come really close to it and for sure outclass Goofy ver. A and offer a Cure while costing less why not just swap him in and in the case where maintaining enough HP is an issue take advantage of that additional healing power while at it?I totally get that hes not for everyone but for me hell likely have a place for a while.,KingdomHearts,d7lkuok,1,t5_2s3jo

9045882,0,t1_d7ya70h,Sadly I only have a single Cerberus no orbs at all I pulled him just recently. Right now for AoE Ive been using my Kh Riku since I have him guilted. QoH IS guilted but like you said she doesnt hit THAT hard and costs a lot of SP.What is so special with Xigbar and Shadow? Im a noob I suppose cause to me those two seem pretty w.e Granted they can be useful for missions with all three enemy types.... but besides that they never do bonus damage right simply flat damage? So I assume they are only really desired for certain missions? I have a question on the buffer medals. For Power I have Kh Kairi and DiZ Speed I have Kh Kairi and Kh Aerith Magic I have Kh Aerith and Vivi. From the suggestions most prefer using two buffers in a row which I do have two for each type.The question is should I focus on medals like Vivi who arent locked into a specific medal buff. Like KH Aerith only applies to magic based medals. Should I even bother with her then? And just sub in Kh Aerith or DiZ in her place? Granted I lose the slot bonus for not using the correct medal but you dont use buffers for their damage anyways. And wouldnt be wasting the k strdef medals one very single buffer.Also should I use Kh Kairi? I think overall she would be better than someone like ViVi? If I start out with DiZ and follow up with her that would raise the strength by  tiers. However Kh Kairi only works for  attacks. So that means my last medal wouldnt get her buff only DiZs. So do you think its worth giving two medals the tier boost and last medal a tier boost vs all three medals getting a tier boost? Technically math wise the DiZKairi combo seems better than DiZViVi combo granted last medal would hit rather weak but the other two medals would make up for it.Final question is there a limit to how many str boosts you can get? Like would throwing Attack Boost II on the first buffer be wasteful? Currently out of ABs only have ABs so Id have to start with those but if I get any would it be a waste to use them with buffers?,KingdomHearts,d7z658y,1,t5_2s3jo

If he had to channel it every time I seriously doubt that his keyblade would have just appeared in his hand while he was unconscious as a keyblade. They are two separate weapons and the way he regards them proves it. He sees Soul Eater as a symbol of darknesss hold on his heart while he sees Way to the Dawn as a symbol of his path away from the darkness.As for the other keyblade wielders they didnt just start with a keyblade. Earning the ability to wield doesnt give you a keyblade. They were all in the exact same situation as Riku is when they got theirs. Hence why Lea wasnt able to swoop in keyblade in hand. He didnt actually have one yet because he apparently didnt have the makings yet.Also did you see a different Ansem fight? Because while yes Riku reconciled that he could never purge the Darkness from his heart he most certainly decided that he didnt have to have anything to do with the power of the darkness. Hed also said at the beginning of the game that he was trying to get rid of Darknesss hold on his heart. He obviously doesnt want to be using the powers of darkness as he knows just how much you can lose yourself by doing so. Also Light and Darkness is a move that Sora can use as well.

The story is pretty complex because it spans over so many games now but once you play them all its not too hard to follow. I would definitely get the HD Remixes for the PS they have a lot more content than the original games too. Just keep in mind that  days and ReCoded are just movie versions on the remixes so you will still need a Nintendo DS to play those. The most recent game that was made Dream Drop Distance is coming out soon on a PS HD Remix so I would wait for that rather than playing it on a DS. Its a great series and Im sure youll both love it.

Sora Aqua Riku Mickey and Lingering Will travel to Castle Oblivion to rescue Ven leaving Kairi Lea. When Ven is resurrected the camera pans to reveal Roxas was brought out as well. We now have our  Guardians as depicted in X. We get to play a bit as every guardian if we so choose and then we move on to the final fight a  phase final boss with each phase being a different incarnation of Xehanort. Riku faces off against Ansem. Ventus faces off against Vanitas. Terra fights Terranort. Aqua fights Apprentice Xehanort. Etc. After our Guardians have settled their own scores we move on to more secondary Seekers like Xigbar where there are two Guardians to a Seeker. Once weve taken out the  vessels were down to just Master Xehanort. We now finally play as Sora once more with a party far outweighing anything previously seen in the series. Eight party members all  Guardians facing off against the ultra powerful Master Xehanort as the Keyblade Graveyard is crumbling into Kingdom Hearts all around them.,KingdomHearts,d9mgh94,4,t5_2s3jo

9844227,0,t3_5g9785,Can we stop making silly comparisons?Its been said time and time again that the problem is that many of us already have buffs before. The bonus buffs of these new medals arent as good because of that. The buffs also only last for the next  attacks and thats something you need to keep in mind.These new medals will be useful in proud quests. But besides that they dont fit in many of our builds.Edit Oh lets not forget HT Sora was farmable. You literally need to get  guilt with Moana to be on par.,KingdomHearts,daqq526,5,t5_2s3jo

Fit them in your build and youll see they do great as AoE damage dealers. You are assuming many people guilted things in the black friday deal a statistical unlikelyhood given the large pool of medals or scored top  in HSC again an assumption.Many people will find great usage for these. Very lucky CP and whales wont. Think outside the box. People keep extolling the magnificent damage of Marluxia B when these medals can hit in the same ballpark with an added bonus damage for the next medals.

9883655,0,t1_davtvux,In orderMagic Pooglets still got a place on TW if your goal is to conserve gauge. I think you can pull something like PoogletiKairi depending on the situation paralysis medal use your least favorite farmable Moana Final Form Sora and Hag.  As long as you dont spam FF Sora you should be fine. Can you guilt Jack?Power Youve got two amazing premiums in the form of iKairi and iSora. Meowjestys still one of the strongest event medals we have. Id probably run something like iSora Piglet Meowjesty Wakka and Playing CardsPete.  iSora Piglet and Meowjesty take eight gauges total so the last two medals cant be too costly like Queen of Hearts.  I made a note of why Piglet is here over iKairi in the Speed section.Speed Your Speed medals arent as amazing as the other colors but its still workable! Give HT Soras guilt one final try!  Hopefully itll bump up higher.  Hell be your main damage medal for now. Id ditch the extra King Louie if youre short on inventory space. Though itll eat your gauge like crazy try something like Piglet KH Kairi Yuffie HT Sora and Flowbermeow.  Why Piglet?  Because KH Kairis  and whlie PoogletiKairi are technically better choices theyre also .  If you have  cost unlocked and a ton of Cids then use PoogletiKairi over Piglet.  If you absolutely want a reverse medal in the last slot kick Yuffie for Marluxia B.Other keyblades For Olympia use Flowbermeow over Yuffie unless you absolutely need a singletarget medal. Divine Rose will be tricky but workable.  Try something like Pooglet HT Sora use him as a pseudodebuff FF Sora Jack and Marluxia B.  Larxene should be released a bit later this month.  Hopefully shell have a good effect so you can use her over HT Sora Divine Rose gives buffs to reverse Speed. Your Moogle of Glory is going to rock if you manage to grind out all the quests!Overall your medals arent bad at all.  You have the important utility medals so you can swap your damaging medals around and see what works!  Stuff youll want to look out for are Smee shove him in the third slot of TW and watch the magic a good singletarget Magic upright medal TR Donald comes to mind Marluxia A solid reverse Speed medal IMO and a  KH Kairi or iRiku if youre insanely lucky.

The beach is the unknown world the ocean is part of the Realm of Darkness where the Door to Light appears this is reconfirmed in the KH summary of DDD.Personally I also think that Dark World is simply another translation of Yami no Sekai and will be changed for the English version even though its the same for now in both trailers.,KingdomHearts,dazc8f1,11,t5_2s3jo

9948125,0,t1_db0cz50,You dont seem to understand that Square Enix doesnt really have the time or manpower to make a big Kingdom Hearts game every  or  years thats why they rely on smaller releases so much to set up the plot for the big titles. However the problem is that you cant just focus on setups or else you have a boring game where nothing really happens AKA ReCoded they also have to write a satisfying plotwithintheplot so that the game can still stand on its own and concluding certain plot points from earlier in the series is a good way to do that case in point Aqua. I would not mind if she was saved by the end of . precisely because if done right it could really give me something to look forward to while playing the otherwise total mystery that is III. Think about it Birth by Sleep was basically one big foregone conclusion yet that arc of the story was wellreceived because people wanted to find out about what happened in order for the rest of the series to have happened. Having Aqua be mysteriously saved right at the end and implying that this scene will show up from Soras perspective at some point in III will generate hype massive amounts of hype. Also Aqua being saved in by no means the only big thing people are looking forward to in III so even if they do save Aqua in . that doesnt conclude everything Sora and Co. still have to battle the New Org we still dont know how Back Cover will tie into III or what the events of the final battle will be or its outcome.

However you also need to keep in mind that regardless of what your opinion of the guy may be Nomurawho is in charge of this stuff and the people working on this game do care for the KH series on a personal level and know it better than anyone. Disney writers being brought in possibly hardly knowing anything about the games prior being told a brief overview of the series and then told to write the story of the thcounting x. game is not gonna fix the problem and at that point it wont be Kingdom Hearts anymore and definitely wouldnt be portraying the characters correctly. Now Disney telling them on how to fix their character writing that might be good.I also completely agree with your statement Nothing irks me more than a character doing something....out of character and out of nowhere! Character motivation is so important I just have fear that they might miss that if they dont comb over the Scenario thoroughly after the mess of writing and character portrayal that was the recent games DDD and ReCoded especially. But keep in mind those were side games of which from what I recall it has been noted Nomura wasnt as active in the development of. EDIT I would also like to point out that even though the dialog of . hasnt seemed to improve upon this issue Back Cover has looked great in this department in fact Nomura had said in the recent interview that he really wanted to portray the individual personalities of the Foretellers which has definitely come across in the recent trailers in my opinion.I remain to have some amount of optimism.,KingdomHearts,dblvuoq,1,t5_2s3jo

No. We arent getting brooms at some point. We will more than likely never get them and if they did decide to it would be when the game is in heavy decline. The United States is the biggest mobile gaming market on the planet by a massive lead. Japan has things like brooms and free gifts to keep their players interested.

Then they have the audacity to make the new hsc only have them as score boosters. Especially on a challenge that people who didnt get ikairi were waiting for.

I believe this change only affect Whale Top ? so majority of people wont carenotice about this perhaps biggest victim will be people in around Top  ranking where without the change they may be in Top  Top . I believe is still too low to have the impact of the change considering the strength of the people close to that rank I heard people closer to Top . also feels the impact of stuck in Giga Shadow round tho while the others can easily pass by skipping it and perhaps an organized complain from lots of whale will be more heard like in JampS saga where it is an easy to spot blunder but also most victims are top ranking Whale and Dolphin and some hardcore CP and FP unlike in the boycott saga where all whale still pulling and FPCP voice is not heard.

Youre Sora commentThe original group was supposed to become the vessel but as you can see only some did. The rest were incompatible.Sora didnt have yellow eyes because he wasnt even a part of the new group yet. Xehanort was about to make him his th vessel but Lea blocked the blast from Xehanorts key blade preventing him from becoming part of the new group and having the yellow eyes.The original group had a full year... If you remember from Birth by Sleep Isa originally had teal colored eyes but once he became apart of Organization  he had yellow eyes. They all had a piece of Xehanort when Xehanort turned them all into nobodies as seen in Kingdom Hearts D intro where Terranort slashed Braig to release his heart clearly when he did that to the rest of group  some of them didnt get Xehanortified. ,KingdomHearts,ddd6qmv,0,t5_2s3jo

10673641,0,t1_ddguddn,Dream Drop Distance spoilersSora went from being really special to actually having no importance at all. Hes not special hes not even supposed to wield a keyblade. The narrative is both trying to reinforce that Sora is really special and important and that its his job to give everyone a happy ever after after their unhappy endings but the plot also hits you with the fact that Sora is pathetic and shouldnt even wield the keyblade without Ven. Like in Kingdom Hearts  when Riku gets the keyblade off Sora its a huge shock and big gamechanger. In fact the plot pretty much said that there was only one keyblade of light and that the keyblade had some sentience as it would choose its owner. Now Rikus got his own keyblade as do Kairi and Lea.

You can use Lea for some SP damage or you can use a preferibly speed medal with APP to tap and gain back some SPFor the friend medal something that will boost your damage for  turns is best. The WoFF medals are great and always super effective or you can use HD Sora Maleficent iMickey Jack amp Sally... whatever you can find in your list. If you dont find anything of the sort use the strongest power medal you can find.It will take some turns but its a safe strategy. If you have at least one medal with APP and one with DBII itll be alright. The most important thing is that you upgrade your keyblade. What level is your Olympia? That is a great keyblade to upgrade first so if its not at  already and you cant beat it today next week do the first few Adamantite quests every day you should have no problems with the first  at least and use all the ores on Olympia.,KingdomHearts,ddo0qji,2,t5_2s3jo

10820762,0,t1_ddvu9ja,I feel like a broken record sometimes when I say Id feel much more confident pulling if only we knew the pull rates for premiums.  Something like Fire Emblem Heroes where it shows you the chance of getting a banner  star hero  focus or any  star hero  lets you decide whether a pull is worth the risk or not.For example right now the data shows that  in  medals pulled were HD Ursula for a . chance for any given medal to be HD Ursula.  If we assume that each medal is independently chosen and that each has a . probability of being HD Ursula we get a . . or a . chance that any given pull will have at least one HD Ursula where the  comes from the fact that each pull has  medals.  That means on average youll pull an HD Ursula every .   pulls.  This explains why some people are getting really lucky and some people are pulling a lot and not getting this medal.We can apply the same logic for all medals  in  medals were premiums so if we assume each medal has a . or . probability of being a premium then the probability of getting at least one premium in a pull is . . or a . chance of pulling any premium in a pull.  Of the  pulls in the table right now  had premiums so . or . of all pulls had at least one premium which matches the math pretty well.So if I pull at least I know what kinds of risks Im taking now.

11160316,0,t3_5zbzf7,I think it is best to wait until the anniversary to see how MampB will be handed out in the future. If the rate is really low putting MampB on Tier five medals that are not orbed might be a bit tricky for FP players. In the course of collecting more brooms even the tier  might have become a little outdated because better medals have shown up. Besides if you can gain much strength by guilting a very good Tier  medal right away this could result in you performing better in events that rewards MampB medals performancewise. This way you could spend one MampB to gain one later. Not a very bad choice.Again we do not know how MampB medals are going to be offered to us in the future so stating that we should not use it on T medals could be a bit of an oversimplification. It is best to hold on the MampB medal for now unless there is a Tier  medal in your inventory directly waiting to be guilted.,KingdomHearts,dex0d3n,18,t5_2s3jo

I didnt go from division to addition I both divided and added. thats the crazy part because both the addition and the division give you the  for a circle and half a circle. sure im sure you can relate KH to several other stories because most stories are based on astrology and the movement of the celestial bodies of heaven. right down to the bible. most good stories use the stars as a template. for instance star wars the main characters luke skywalker. luke mean LIGHT and his last name skywalker refers to the movement of the sun across the sky. the sun is the sky walker. jesus is the LIGHT OF THE WORLD Lucifer means morning star. what is the morning star?

FWIW I had enough jewels to pull  times during WoFF deals. I was going to go all  pulls but was hoping to guilt one after . its not the case and I had to pull  times to guilt one then I stopped rather than wasting more jewels. my point with this I guess is that we cant go on guarantees all the time cuz this is a luckbased game after all. sometimes you just gotta go for it if you think your odds are good not guaranteed and just try to have fun with the game.sadly you cant really compete for top spots in this game unless you spend money its the same in JPN. but I can understand that. beggars cant be choosers after all. that being said its not at all impossible to go for the second tier rewards by being a freecheap player. with good strategy good players can beat those who have better medals but dont understand the meta of the game.,KingdomHearts,dfmfl52,1,t5_2s3jo

11467308,0,t3_63onke,Since you are dead set on playing you legitimately need to know nothing since nothing happens of any value as of yet. The story of KHUXXUX has little bearing on the series as a wholecurrently there are some things that are just thrown in there but since they have yet to be really explained in any real detail to mean anything of value. You might want play BBS to see what happens but that is in hope that maybe it will make something if it happens worthwhile. BBS is a great game though so I would recommend it anyway. It raises more questions and actually in over a few years of story has failed to really answer any questions asked over the series. This saddens me there really is no reason to play the game for plot reasons due to the immense and literally worthless fluff that makes up this game. I would honestly say just watch the cutscenes on YouTube since its more convenient and honestly will help you get a further understanding of anything that goes on plot wise in this game. ,KingdomHearts,dfvt9zo,0,t5_2s3jo

11789250,0,t3_6875ke,You spoke out my mind. There is one other thing id like to add to your traits topic double trait is broken in NA but JP was ready for it. In NA any buffer with double cast will be EXTREMELY overpower because there is no other way to reach that power with one medal without the same medal with double cast. For example there is no way youll reach  GAU with one slot without iKairi with doublecast. That is gonna continue for months now because all the next medals were created for a game WITHOUT double cast. Nothing can defeat the new medals with double cast and people will not get them because there is no mercy.But in japan traits were added just as they started giving out the new batch of medals ones with buffsdebuffs above  and blended effects. Sure an iKairi with double cast will be great but iKairi. can do that too and with bonuses. So a double cast for japan can mean the same thing if not less than a new medal. Even a double cast in a new medal can mean very little since they give such high buffs. Lingering Will for example gives Speed  a double cast on him would limit it to  you might considering getting  atk instead. Hell its even way too strong even without traits getting a trait on it is just a bonus not a destructive gamechanger.In the end JP gives a lot of room for options old medals with double trait new medals without traits guilted with brooms which you can a lot of them get for free it all balances out. Obviously not perfectly but its a lot more fair than how NA is working right now.,KingdomHearts,dgwcnhg,37,t5_2s3jo
