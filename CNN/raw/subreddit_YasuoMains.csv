4490579,0,t3_3cla33,Wall of text I realize its worth the read. Look at my runes and masteries I got them off a challenger yasuo guide and have played many games with them and find them the best for my play style. As for build do whatever is necessary to win the game so change your build dependent on the game. Also just find the build that suits you like the current best yasuo in Korea gets triforce first item becuause he gets blown upstruggles to survive in the mid game. Tldr just find what suits youEdit I posted this in a yasuo build thread on reddit a few weeks ago it may seem off of what I just told you about finding your own build but Im just doing the math and what works best with me.Plat yasuo player here. For starting items I generally get Dorans Blade   health pot. If against ziggs xerath or any highly dependent skillshot mage go boots and  pots. After that rush your zeal never go Avarice blade first. Get the zeal because it increases your q cd crit q animation and aa speed. While avarice blade gives passive income and  crit and after the zeal Statikk Shiv should only be  g so you should be able to get it by under  minutes if you have relatively good cs or at least by  minutes if you are getting bullied. If I started boots then I rush the ie if I went dorans I generally get boots then I rush the ie. Ie provides  crit chance while increasing crit dmg up to  which then negates the  crit damage from your passive. When getting ie generally try and go for the BF gt Pickaxe gt Cloak. Cloak wont really help you that much since you wont have any ad to make crits out of in example if you have  AD on yasuo which is what I generally have once I get stattik around level ish so the crit is AD x . which is .. so effectively you would be critting that same amount if you got cloak even though you will have more crits the higher damage crits are better than more crits imo so if you have lets say  AD  AD  bf then that crit is .. Lets say you then finish ie then you have  crit damage multiplier so then that  AD level  AD  ie this isnt accurate levels Im just trying to have constant values for the best representation then  AD  .  . dmg. Then I generally got merc treads or ninja tabi depending how ad or ap heavy their team is if its an even balance just go for merc treads since of the tenacity that it gives. Then I generally go bortk or BT depending on how bursty they are vs how many gap closers they have. Bortk is good for shredding tanks and catching up to people whilst BT is good for having long teamfights bursting down people and sustain since you have the shield from BT. After that depending how fed I am vs how fed their team is I will go my second lifesteal item either bortk or BT depending on which one I just got or I will go for a banshees or randuins. Second lifesteal item is amazing because you will be able to shred people and sustain Banshees and randuins are for if they have a fed vayne or leblanc if not just go  lifesteal items. For the final item if I didnt get randuins or banshees I will pick one of those up or a GA this is very situational and I really cant describe on which terms you would get one its more of just playstyle and how the enemy is trying to kill you. In addition never get LW as an item unless they happen to have  tanks from youre ultimate which is a s cd at level  you get  additional armor penetration for s after using ultimate which is half the cd of your ultimate so it is very silly to get LW unless you happen to be fighting people alot wo ultimate which is a bad decision already. Then if you are getting to late late game then sell boots for zephyr since you get AD AS tenacity and a few other goods stats.,YasuoMains,cswp5nv,2,t5_34mug

4947406,0,t1_cui5m5r,I almost always go Shiv to Triforce mainly because u dont have to wait for Infinity edge to get your power spike and you can generally reach power spikes when u buy the individual cores of Triforce PhagegtZealgtFull purchase while Infinity edge heavily relies on buying the full Item to reach its max power. So I mainly do it so I dont have a awkward game stage between Shiv and a really expensive item and the build path for Tri Force is much more viable in my opinion.My hardest match up in Top Yasuo is easily Riven its considered a skill match up that heavily favors Riven and you can only play to your level  power spike.In Mid I would probably say the hardest matchup is easily Annie. She outranges out damages and is just really annoying to go up against.,YasuoMains,cui5sog,1,t5_34mug
4954655,0,t1_cuivxc0,I always take TP top. Im also feeling that if I want to run Triforce Id run AS reds and LS quints because I wont be buying a vamp scepter earlier like I usually do since LS is my third item normally. Id also need to change my playstyle a bit which would take some getting used to.I think Ill stick to taking him top more often than mid since Im more confident in my ability to handle all the less than favorable matchups like Riven Ive not had much problem with Riven than I can against the mid matchups I just cannot handle Azir or Annie ever.Thanks for the info.

5633935,0,t1_cwvfpj2,Its not really for the waveclear though. Its for the extra burst damage for trading. Thats why Shiv rush is so powerful on live and the new Shiv changes nothing about that. Suddenly hitting your opponent for a huge chunk of extra damage on a Shiv crit is an absolute game changer and is worth infinitely more than anything PD gives you. And now that Shiv scales to  base damage its superiority to PD only grows larger.

5981276,0,t1_cxyifpb,I love this matchup and I find it quite easy to deal with. You can literally dodge every ability in her kit apart from the autoattack portion of her W. Poke her out with short trades Thunderlords is very good for this take advantage of the fact she has no crowd control and very limited mobility. If she tries to E windwall. If she tries to Q dash out or even through her. Keep the position of the tentacles in mind when she uses her W dash out to dodge those. If she ults get out immediately. Under no circumstances should you fight her in her ultimate zone unless its literally  or  versus .I think solo killing her is quite easy the real problem is when your clueless teammates dive her ultzone in fights and allow her to pick up easy doublestriples.,YasuoMains,cy3odi5,1,t5_34mug

6216525,0,t1_cyw5nqc,gt Statik shiv is still the best item to rush firstDepends.  If you have AD in your runes yeah get Shiv ASAP.  If you run  AS like I tend to do getting AD through PhageHexdrinkerBF Sword first and then getting Shiv tends to result in a much larger and more effective powerspike because Shivs proc damage early was nerfed significantly making it so its not as useful without some AD to back up the extra crits it gives.And thats assuming you get Shiv.  Rushing Trinity Force or PD is also perfectly viable.gt Statik shiv is better than PD on yasuo.This is very much preference matchup and playstylebased.  For outright burst yes Shiv is better but for dueling or fighting bruiserstanks Phantom Dancer is king no contest.  Thats why its more popular on top Yasuo who tends to get into prolonged fightsbe against bruisers.gt CDRlevel glyphsNever get CDR on Yasuo.  Your Qs cooldown is reduced by AS and CDR is effectively useless for E.  Unless youre a Yasuo support whose only purpose is to spam Wind Wall please dont do this CDR is terrible on Yasuo.  And no Phantom Dancer is far from the worst option to cap your AS.  In fact Id argue getting Berserkers Greaves is the worst optionMerc Treads Swiftness Boots or Tabi will serve you far better because DPS is nothing if you die instantly.,YasuoMains,cyw936j,-1,t5_34mug
6228731,0,t3_40vtip,One thing I think that gets missed in a lot of discussions about Yasuo is that if you want to play aggressive you need to play aggressive.It isnt like playing a mage poking and poking and then suddenly turning aggressive when they get low. If you want to play aggressive you need to be going for it from level  abusing your passive and E and their cooldowns. And you need to keep at it pretty much any time you see anything resembling an opening.Playing against enemy cooldowns is probably more important for Yasuo than just about any other champion.If you arent going to play hyperaggressive you need to focus on farming. Yasuo has ridiculously good farming so thats not necessarily a bad thing. If farming be carefuly with your third Q hitting a lot of minions and pushing your lane and note that it can be a little bit hard to freeze once you get shiv  though it can let you push hard enough to start roaming and hopefully get kills or help with objectives.But theres very little middle ground. Either youre making people leave lane and killing them or youre farming. If youre trying to farm while doing a little harrass here and there unless your matchup is really uneven in skill youre likely to be taking too much damage to stay in lane while not putting enough kill pressure to force them out and youll just end up underfarmed or dead.When I was first starting it helped a lot to focus my laning on farming  dodging poke learning the max Q range learning to harass with your third Q its slow so this is not super easy learning to use E for lasthitting without getting punished for bad positioning etc.Once I got more confident on Yasuo and finally got around to learning enemy champ cooldowns more methodically then I started to play much more aggressively.In general dont be stingy with your W either. Its on a long cooldown so dont throw it out the moment it goes off cooldown but dont be so worried about wasting it that you dont use it at all. Using it to block an AA to stop them from popping your shield is for instance not necessarily a waste of it.Teamfighting is sort of similar. Either you play hyperaggressive and ult  of their team for the engage or you need to wait to come in later.If you can get  of them ideally carries in a tornado or you have a teammate who can knock up  of them then you ult in. One mistake a lot of newer Yasuo players make though is not considering how ridiculously longranged the ult is  the strongest part of your ult isnt the damage its the CC. If your team isnt there to capitalize on the CC because you ulted from so far away or while you were ahead of the team all youll accomplish is dying and turning the fight into a v. And if you initiate the fight with your ult and the enemy team isnt in shambles by the time its over you want to get out as soon as possible. Youre the most visible member of your team youre in the middle of all of them youre a squishy carry you just attacked all of them and every single one of them is going to immediately focus you. So throw down a windwall which will also help protect your team from their ADC E through it and leave the fight for a second or two. Wait for them all to switch targets and blow cooldowns then come back in and carry.If youre not engaging with your ult enter the fight later after everyone has chosen targets and blown CC. Youre a carry but youre melee. So you cant play like an ADC and keep safe with good positioning while doing damage. Youre melee but youre squishy. So you cant play like a tank and run in. Youre the cavalry  you wait until the fighting has started then you charge in and end the fight.Ulting one person in a teamfight is not so great. Ulting no people in a teamfight is worse. Ult squishies not tanks  your ult is a great way to keep them from repositioning away from your front line. Waiting until the end of a teamfight to ult someone is also not great. Do not underestimate how strong the  armor pen from your ult is  if you ult the last person in a teamfight youre largely wasting it. Remember that your ult has a ridiculously low cooldown dont be stingy with it  dont hesitate to use it in a v or v because youre worried a v might be coming soon.In general if you can you want to enter a fight with your Q already stacked and ready to knock up for your ult. Try to keep your Q at  stacks as often as possible. If you walk through the river Q the scuttler twice as you walk by you can also E the scuttler to get through the river slightly faster. If your team is sieging a tower lategame and you cant stack on enemy minions go whack a nearby jungle camp twice to have your Q ready. Dont spend your third Q frivolously  hold onto it until just before it goes away protip it goes away very slightly after the little aura around you which can catch people off guard. Dont waste it either  if its about to run out and you dont see anyone throw it into a nearby bush and listen for a hit.,YasuoMains,cyxn0ut,6,t5_34mug

6547830,0,t1_czvt8ie,I perfectly agree to your thoughts on Fiora... her W is a great example for a lightfighter ability. Elise E too is IMO. For a lightfighter Fiora has so much upfront strength. It used to be really obvious before the rework where she got a ton of AS from her E but now that AS only applies to  AAs. Therefore though she got a targeted slow cant crit tho and a guaranteed Crit afterwards. Still a ball of stats but as you said shes somewhere in between the two classes I couldnt confidently put her into either.gt sometimes it just happens and I was hoping for tips to handle them... They are giving me hard timesSame for me... I never tried building Yasuo really tanky I always went Shiv IE or TF as first item and never built a tanky item earlier than rd item other than TabisMercurys.  But again I almost never face heavyfighters in lane because I only play him mid.There are some melee champions who you can poke with Q when they CS... Zed in the early levels is one of them although hes not a fighter. I dont think you can apply this to Irelia though or rather I dont know.  I generally dont know how to handle enemies who you cant stop from jumping on you and who then outtrade you.One idea would be keystone masteriesIn extended trades Fervor of Battle overshadows Thunderlords. To be precise after  melee autoattacks on the champ assuming you didnt hit an ability on them Fervor has dealt more damage than  Thunderlord proc. Note that for this statement I assumed  BonusAD per level for Thunderlords which is above what you generally get in a game unless youre hellafed. gtLink to graphsltMaye Grasp of the Undying is also good never tried it. Maybe Thunderlords burst is enough against some champs to go even in trades where you normally wouldnt  I dont know though as I just dont have experience with those matchups.,YasuoMains,czwlkvo,2,t5_34mug

6614222,0,t3_46a183, Max E before Q in most matchups Learn to poke with innout EQ combos without necessarily going allin.     Your ultimate is on a low cooldown and can be used simply to chunk your opponent.     When multiple enemies are knocked up you will ult the one closest to your cursor.     If youre close enough weave in an autoattack between your knockup and your ultimate. Free damage.     Learn what abilities you can windwall. Dont just throw it when you panic. Think.     Go in a custom and try out walldashing. It opens up so many opportunities itll be like a whole new champion. Cancel your Q animation by throwing out your windwall. This applies to the normal Q and the tornado as well.     Cancel your Q animation by flashing. Q first then flash. The Q will follow to your new position. This also applies to both the normal and tornado Q.     Try out the EQflash combo. The flash will transfer your EQ to your new destination. Good for surprise knockups that are virtually undodgeable.     Try out the Airblade combo. Basically you need to land a tornado then EQ another target before ulting onto the knockup.

I dont know if you were a jack of all trades before or a one trick pony but effectively laning and trading with Yasuo comes with experience. k is not a whole lot and youve still got a long way to go to really get confident in every matchup. Just keep playing Yasuo and play around with builds and masteries in different lanes. Also you can search this sub for Lane opponents as some matchups are pretty often discussed.

But he just waited it out and farmed and he ultimately won the lane by ramming it in and I just couldnt really kill him.It is also tough to carry a game if youre team performs badly unless you get Tri and Mallet quite early at which point you might as well have PDShiv and IE and delete everyone. Ive enjoyed building these items later actually. Its an expensive build but really strong if the game drags on that long. ,YasuoMains,d4ack9q,1,t5_34mug

RUSH Executioners and Vamp scepter then go into Zeal then to Bork then finish out your Zeal itemBoth are good vs Mundo depending on circumstances I know the damage reduction from PD is nice and all but Mundo doesnt have alot of damage to reduce if hes stacking armor and hp Shyvs magic damage can equal it out plus mundo sucks at wave clear under towerI do this and mundos a really easy match up because of it...Levels  DODGE DUCK DIP DIVE AND DODGE cleavers and poke him anytime you can push him under tower and back off to not get ganked OR freeze the wave and try for some sneaky kills farm up atleast your executioners andor vamp sceptre maybe a pink too about  gold not much more than a normal zeal Level  Have the wave under a tower yours or his NOT in the middle... You can farm under tower really easily and if you dodge his poke hell just lose hp  and you can zone him with your tower poke him whenever possible to help win the tradeexecutioners will help mitigate his sustain vamp sceptre will help you sustain anything he can do to you...Level ? Next back is Zeal its just to help your dps and wave clear with that dps... then you go into Bork for the hp damage and active to help chase him  if he ever ults when running away from you... Borkbilgewater active from a safe distance applies grevious wounds to mitigate the healing even if you cant actually catch him to apply it was autos or Q... hes now basically ignorable. he cannot out sustain you much if at all and his damage is far lower too... his hp stacking means nothing to bork and his armor means nothing to your E and  arm pen from ult plus the  crits from Zeal... After you finish your PD or Shiv youllhave  crits and do more magic damage so he cant just stack armor youll have more poke damaage too if shiv or damage reduction and move speed to chase him with PD.Inshort Mundo is a  dimentional champion with no way to outplay you if youre smart and buildplay correctly he loses by default his entire kit is countered easily  he wins wars of sustain... If you rush vamp sceptreexecutioners youll have alot of sustain and hell lose alot of his evening out the playing field giving you the edge with your passive shield... Bork and your ults armor pen counters whatever he builds really... and your DPS is just too high with some crit...If a mundo wanted to build against you hed rush Visage Ninja Tabi and Randuins but none really are everyone just goes for sunfire and such. Visage would help his sustain and the MR would mitigate your E and Tabi would really hinder your damage as would Randuins but they dont do this cause if they do they wont have much power against the rest of your team and they just probably dont expect this cheese rush to counter them.,YasuoMains,d5wksst,1,t5_34mug

Last patch riot buffed Brand lmaogtNow then Ive said where I pull my thoughts from. How about you tell me how you know what champ is strong and why youre right while Riot and champion.gg are wrong?IMO Kindred is just a cancer champ design. Kind of like Kalista. There shouldnt be an adc jungler champ with an AOE trynd ult who excels at early game. And Kindred fucking has a  win rate in general right now. How is that weak? lmaogtKindred is and has always been feast or famineAgain this is why riot doesnt balance around garbage players.Feast or famine champs are almost never played in the LCS. These champs are Riven Reng Master Yi etc. Saying Kindred was always feast or famine is stupid. Theres a reason she was a top tier pick a couple of months ago. Because she was stupid strong and in no way feast or famine.Oh and your win rate argument wasnt that great either. You know some other champs that have low win rates right now? Leblanc and Gnar. Gnar is literally top tier pick right now in pro play and is one of the most cancerous champs in the game. LB is still played in pro play too. The only win rate that matters is the win rate of the mains of the champs.Wanna know what a weak champ right now is? Lee Sin.

9548002,0,t1_d9ppu9h,Good shit. To answer your earlier questions you can still split push you just have to know when to do that and when to group. If you know the enemy isnt going to pay attention to you and you can v anyone they send your way and that your team has the wave clear and the intelligence to just defend then definitely go for the splitpush. But if your team is behind and youre ahead and you know they cant defend by themselves or they are struggling with objectives then its definitely time to group. Champions I play when I dont get yasuo I play Brand and Twisted Fate most of the time mid and I havent been playing much top lately but I would play champions like Darius or Fiora. When youre behind i personally feel its a lot tougher as yasuo and I definitely make this mistake often when Im behind but you have to keep yourself from constantly trying to make plays because it will generally end to feeding as you dont have the items to make those plays. Try your best to farm up and if you are  sure you can make a play then go for it but settle for nothing less. I generally when Im behind will nonstop splitpush to farm up and attract some attention for my team to make a play off of it. But when you do this or splitpush at all you HAVE to make sure you keep up good ward coverage because getting caught out is the worst thing you can do when trying to catch up in a game. ,YasuoMains,d9pzl1r,1,t5_34mug

No one is a god when they learn to play yasuo so dont let them get into your head. Just play have fun and learn a little each game.. Focus on specific skills. You wont get anywhere if you are trying to master everything at once. Pick a particular thing and make that your focus.. Practice. Now I dont mean till you think you have a hold of him. I mean play him and practice him till everything comes to you reflexively. Once this happens you will be able to ascend to being a Godsuo as you wont be preoccupied with mechanics and can be focused on the game as a whole.. I know I said it earlier but you really need to not tilt. Hell only reason I was able to deal with the hate is because my family sucks and the haters were nothing compared to them. Basically take breaks and be sure you are having fun. No point in playing someone you hate,YasuoMains,db3xi1o,1,t5_34mug

9965721,0,t3_5i9o08,I tell this to all my friends just play like a bitch aim your skillshots only mid dash and pop the shield before trading. He can windwall mid dash but most yasuos dont so its pretty effective. If the yasuo brainlessly shoves ask for the jgler to walk mid to try and get freeze near your tower by forcing him to back off. Dont stand near walls makes it easy for yasuo to to land a q and walk back whenever he es especially if he has a q charged. Dont stay under half health.,YasuoMains,db6k5fp,1,t5_34mug

10044072,0,t3_5jhje9,Imo one of many things that makes Yasuo a strong laner is his wave clearing and his ability of lasthitting which is not corresponding in contrast to other champions.  His Q is AOE long range AA has short CD no cost.  His E has a very short CD also no cost and is an ideal tool to last hit and it even can deal increased damage on champs as well on minions.  His rd Q is the truly nightmare. It is his th ability that literally has s cooldown and is available to cast in s. If he wants to clear wave fast just throws it or EQ if he wants to pressure lane opponent just holds it the lane is his. s are absurdly long for every s wave. With all of those tools he still can trade put pressure and doesnt have to worry about his lane will be pushed. Like other times when Riot nerfed champss wave clearing perhaps Riot would do this to Yasuo again?,YasuoMains,dbgro63,1,t5_34mug

Fervor is working for you already but I recommend going Warlords glass cannon Yasuo is already so strong that Fervor is not that noticeable when you already  shot squishies. In some of your losses I assume you lost lane if against AP and youre not confident you can snowball right away build a hexdrinker after getting a zeal and then continue normally. Against a zed or similar AD I like rushing Tabis for the speed and resist if you cant get ahead.

10375417,0,t3_5okvqw,It depends on the matchup and indeed on how far up they play. Often the enemy midlaner will walk up to hit some minions and this is a pretty good time to go in as Yasuo. In most matchups you should just Eminion gt If in range auto enemy gt E enemy gt Optional auto gt get out because you will take a lot of minion damage.You have to keep in mind what spell the enemy starts for example vs TF if he doesnt show a card he can either have started Q in which case you could go in for an early trade or save his W for your early trade. In this case I wait until he either locks in a card and uses it on the minions or throws his q. You dont want to be gold carded in his minion wave at level  while trying to force an early trade.Bottom line know the matchup and play accordingly. It all comes with experience.Side note if you pop Yasuos shield before he can go in for a trade he cant trade effectively anymore level . This is a great way to ensure he wont go aggresive. If he already started E most matchups can start zoning him and deny him access to the wave.,YasuoMains,dck4731,5,t5_34mug

At this point in time I am not interested in proving you why I am right and why you are wrong.I will admit that its hard to talk about matchups based on experience because at my elo high platlow diamond people dont play their champs correctly so its easy for me to say this is easy this is easy cause I havent experienced the true pure matchups.But in short if riven takes q level  yasuo wins if fiora is bad with her Ws yasuo wins if renekton doesnt go full damage and trades without  fury eveyr time yasuo wins if pantheon all ins yasuo at level  and  without ignite yasuo wins if yasuo lets wukong get a an eq tld proc trade without allining him yasuo loses to win the wukong matchup you have to all in the wuokong when you are both at  hp only way to beat him. Jayce tho no matter HOW you play it he always comes on top yasuo likes punishing trades when they start etreating when their cds are off but jayce pushes him away he has way too much frontdamage at level  and  and never loses any trades or allins early game.Literally impossible regardless of how good or bad they are. ofc ive won jayce lanes when theyre bad but not by brainlessly trading.youre free to disagree cause different people play differently so it makes sense that some people have a better time vs this or that than others but overall all matchups are easily winnable by playing them right including pantheon.,YasuoMains,ddukzx4,6,t5_34mug

10968820,0,t1_debcg94,Shiv is basically only an option if your team needs wave clear you need the burst you will get more attack speed besides shiv in your build andor you dont need to duel people. Its only better very situationally. The reason pd is basically a must buy is that his q cool down scales with attack speed and not cdr so the extra attack speed lets him max out q faster with attack speed reds and quints its around level . Also about team play basically if your team has a good knock up or two team fighting is easier but if there are none its going to be difficult to get into a fight so it might be better to split push. But that applies to pretty much every split pusher so you have to see if your team needs you to fight or to draw pressure.,YasuoMains,debctyw,1,t5_34mug

Only changes to Yasuo have been reactionary to meta shifts.The shifts have caused Yasuo to start going PDgtBootsgtIEgtBTgtFMgtGA Basically hes gone back to being a triple damage carry rather than a Bruiser that only used  damage items. Primarily because of Tanks as a whole being rarer in the game the extra damage can just be used to kill all the squishies around you. ,YasuoMains,denjuii,1,t5_34mug

I know bonus ad can be really good on yasuo as his base ade isnt very good in my opinion. Actually i do rush Vamp scepter after the boots on Tryndamere. But i feel weak without PD IE on yasuo.And at the end i think i have found a problem. The runes i ve been using for a long time  as scaling hp were weak in the early game you know in low elo if u win early u basically won the game. So i switched to ADASARMR runes and im fine. I can cheese at  again and keep snowballing.,YasuoMains,dfd97wi,1,t5_34mug

11355669,0,t1_dfiet8b,Thanks for your thoughts. I agree that the same could be said for survivability and dont doubt that high elo players would say that like you mention. Like Ive said elsewhere my point is not that Greaves are the only or best option but rather a viable alternative. The points your raise are true but that only points out something that Im not trying to argue against tabitreads are great and viable options. But I wouldnt agree that they are necessarily always better thats the point Im trying to make. Berserkers increase DPS and you mentioned higher average damage being about the same in terms of surviving longer but that only applies if youre staying in the middle of a fight for long periods of time. Yasuos kit encourages an inandout playstyle you know that Im not trying to insult you. But consider that higher dps paired with lifesteal will dish out more damage and still keep you alive as you dive in at opportune moments and juke in and out with your E.As for your last point I dont think statistics are ridiculous. If youve studied statistics then youll know that sample size is a huge factor in determining the validity of statistics. Somewhere near  of all ranked Yasuo games in NA and Korea the Yasuo builds Greaves. Thats a very significant sample size. So a higher winrate should be paid attention to. Whereas the GA build has a total of  games in ranked only in NAPlat up a very tiny sample size. Therefore the statistic is hardly as valid. But in being consistent wouldnt you say that survivability increases Yasuos efficiency? Wasnt that your argument for tabitreads being superior? The  players whove built GA third apparently have relative success with it.Thanks again for your thoughts and keep in mind my point is to argue for the viability of Greaves not that they are the best option in each and every case.,YasuoMains,dfj5788,0,t5_34mug

11589039,0,t1_dg9d13x,gtHow do I untilt is my question?Tips for untilting while in game? Just sit back try to not care about winning or losing and focus on what you love about playing Yasuo.Most importantly for every time you find yourself complaining about a teammate no matter how justified come up with a way you can deal with it as a player.Losing teamfights because a player REFUSES to group? Well hes an idiot but then you have to realize that just means you dont teamfight when the enemy is grouped as .Is your useless Jungler never ganking for you while youre getting camped? See how much cs you can get without feeding and hope for a nice teamfight later.Finally to stop losing LP to tilt just say to yourself Im tilted and dont queue up again. Before queueing up I always ask myself if Im emotionally ready to have fun even if the game goes horribly. If not just do normals.,YasuoMains,dg9mifg,1,t5_34mug
11597522,0,t3_65ije8,Im not going to tell you to stop playing the game the way you are but Ill offer advice. At least expand your pool past yasuo because in higher ranks comps do matter and will greatly increase your win rate if youre able to pull off a tank. Personal favorites of mine are Shen need good map awareness though and Mundo need to know how to lane phase AKA wave manipulation to ensure you get cs and pressure I love yasuo but there are times where I swallow my pride and pick for the team and it pays off oh so well. ,YasuoMains,dgal5wt,2,t5_34mug
