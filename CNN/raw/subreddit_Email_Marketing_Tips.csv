7907770,0,t3_4nlatd,Well myself I run a small subscriptionbased newsletter company so I make my living producing publications like this.As part of the content I produce and distribute I assemble a free weekly HTML newsletter and I probably spend about three hours a week on it anywhere from an hour or two doing the research and then an hour or so writing up the newsletter printing off a test copy and proofreading it then sending a test to myself and then sending it out.As far as how much content there is typically three or four feature stories of an average  paragraphs in length. These have usually already been produced in larger form for the fulllength paid version of the newsletter so Im able to cannibalize them. Then I include a week in review side story and a week ahead item each about  paragraphs in length. These are original productions exclusive to the free version but they follow the same format and formula every week.One suggestion I would offer is to consider sending out a smaller newsletter more frequently say once a week. Have you thought about or tried that or is there some institutional reason that requires a biweekly schedule?,Email_Marketing_Tips,d44wpj6,2,t5_30iyo
