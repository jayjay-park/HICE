2583523,0,t1_cmubyis,My father was a jazz man from the s. Shortly after his death I had wanted to share this awesome video because he was a big fan of John Coltrane. Upon watching the video I immediately went to share it with him only to have it occur to me that he was gone and just had a massive broken heart at not being able to share something that he would have loved.Thank you for your consoling message. How did you find my post?,Statements,cmvsyck,1,t5_2rhvc
