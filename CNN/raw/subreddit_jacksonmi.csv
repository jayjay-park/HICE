470428,0,t1_cftqgy5,Sadly I dont think we have a single good Indian restaurant or in fact any at all. Though Id welcome a correction to this from any other local.As for Mexican I cant think of anything that isnt just a bar in disguise. Same mexican family owns The Crazy Cowboy and Hugos Bar and Grill and both are ok. We also have the almost franchise of Los Tres Amigos which is decent for a sit down meal. Outside of that Im not honestly sure.,jacksonmi,cftqmi5,2,t5_2soqz
