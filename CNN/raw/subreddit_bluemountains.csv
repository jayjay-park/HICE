2130057,0,t3_2jcd1t,There are plenty of flies and various other creatures in the upper mountains. I spent over  years living up that way. You get mostly the big annoyingly loud blow flies. Hate them. If you use sprays they tend to eject large quantities of maggots as they die on  your kitchen benches and window sills. Ick! Mosquitoes are also abundant. If you have a garden that is prolifically planted with dark damp areas you can just about guarantee mozzy bites. I spent most of my time up there in Katoomba and my legs were constantly covered in bites. They itch and  they suck! My father never got around to finishing putting in the fly screens when I was a kid and most places I lived also had no screens.  No idea why people up that way seem so averse to them. Moved away nearly three years ago and love my fully screened abode that I now inhabit without the flying nasties!,bluemountains,claksbd,2,t5_2scrw
