750493,0,t3_22r17j,The game looks stunning. There was a small clip I saw that had a destroyed hornet hull spinning around with the light of the dying planets molten core glinting off the charred metal. Once the bugs are squashed this module will fucking pwn.,eddsquadron,cgpl5x0,3,t5_2vlju

Id prefer that people under estimate us and then we hit them like a freight train. Isnt being underestimated a double edged sword as well? People and Orgs underestimating our defensive capabilities are more likely to attack. And more attacks inevitably lead to more losses in terms of both RS pilots and assets we were supposed to protect.gtgtThe greatest individual pilots will always be over taken by team of good pilots with suburb teamwork. Teamwork kills not the exploits of one individual.There will apparently be squad based combat. Combat in a controlled environment against other teams of people that actually play and train together like us and not random people that are thrown together in the AC matchmaker.,eddsquadron,chyai3q,1,t5_2vlju
1191497,0,t3_27py80,Hows it running with the whole CH set? I was thinking of getting that Hotas ever since I pledged on SC. Figured since Im not that good with the mkb on space combat shooting NPCs on a M in X isnt exactly challenging thought might as well start learning with a joystick for authenticity. ,eddsquadron,ci3nuif,1,t5_2vlju

2308184,0,t1_clwinhu,Adding guns really helped.  I bought it before they revised the specs to provide protection for our fuel runs at UFS.  I melted the M for this because even though it used to have the same weapon loadout as the constellation or very similar to it the Redeemer was a smaller target and could carry up to  marines for a chance to take back any convoy ships that have been boarded.  Now it has become more of a deterrent than it was.EDIT This comparison illustrates the size difference between the connie and redeemer gt ,eddsquadron,clx0anr,1,t5_2vlju
