150610,0,t1_ceu8qgj,Ive spent a little time working on LMs.  The very general idea of how a gas turbine works is pretty close to a turbo.  In a turbo exhaust gases turn a turbine that drives a shaft and the shaft drives a compressor.  Now take that compressed air and route it directly to a combustion chamber add in a continuous supply of fuel and that compressed air becomes very how and highly pressurized.  Finally use that exhaust to power something AND drive the turbine.  Thats it.  Everything else is either there to keep the engine from burning up or to make it more efficient.In a turbo the compressor requires the air flow to change directions gas turbines use an axial centrifugal compressor made up of a bunch of stages of rotating and stationary blades.  These are called the rotors and stators.  At the back of the engine you typically have a couple stages of blades this is the gas generator that removes power from the exhaust gas and uses it to drive the compressor.  Between the compressor and the gas generator is the combustion chamber.  Some GTs have one CC wraped all the way around other have smaller cylindrical CC positioned around the center shaft.  Either way air enters fuel is added and the combination heats up and tries to expand thus forcing it out the other end.  The flame shaping he was talking about directs the hot air around and through the combustion chamber in an effort to protects the casings and literally shape the flame.  The little arms that he pointed to at the end and the VSV feedback are there to control variable stator vanes.  These rotate the stator blades making the compressor more efficient over a wider rpm range.  Bleed air is used for cooling.  It takes away from efficiency but stops the engine from destroying itself from heat.  There are systems that preheat the intake air prior to combustion these increase efficiency buy a huge amount.  The LM is the same basic engine as the LM but with the addition of a preheater.  It makes an additional  more power.,Justrolledintotheshop,cevl34t,1,t5_2tteh

325151,0,t1_cfeebvg,This is very true. Especially since most people do not know how to properly drill. Now that isnt meant as an insult to anyone not at all.But most people dont. They take their  drive drill and go full throttle with a dull bit and grind a hole through something. Low speed lots of lube anything is better than nothing and steady even pressure.If youre making small flakes and dust  youre doing it wrong. Even drilling a  bolt you should have an inch or two of metal string swarf. Sharp bits low speed lube even wd or water in a pinch. A friend asked me to sharpen his drill bits and most of them had BLUING an inch from the end where they got so hot...If you think youre drilling slow enough  youre not. Slow down more. Even a  bit shouldnt be run over rpm. Bigger bits  slower speed.Left hand drills do work wonders if used properly. Sadly when a bolt is broken below flush or flush the end is usually jagged. Most people wouldnt file or grind it flat center punch it after careful measurement spot drill then drill. Theyd just start drilling  eating half of the bolt and half of the parent material.More times than not if there is a tiny bit sticking up past the surface Ill zap it for a second or two at A spray it with pb and use needle nose pliers to remove it.,Justrolledintotheshop,cfeh0o0,7,t5_2tteh

Normally they have a spring and cap on them so that the spring can hold the valve shut while the cam forces it open to allow the introductionexit of airexhaust  I dont know on this engine particularly but all valves work the same  the spring assembly disappeared and allowed the valve to float and ruin the engine. Valves work with precise timing to open only when they need to if they are open too long it is called float. Valve float can lead to numerous engine problems including a catastrophic failure. TLDR.

354695,0,t1_cfhgwqu,the thing is many shops only make money by inspecting cars during oil changes and tire changes and finding things that need fixing. If my shop did  dollar oil changes all day wed go broke and many many cars would leave in a state of disrepair. Loselose. The business model is lose money on the oil change but inspect and make money on the repair. This can of course involve lying or being honest about what needs to be fixed. I find that anything over KM can use SOME sort of repair. Not necessarily imminent safety but either affecting mileagehandlingdriveability or reducing the life of some system. More often I find myself leaving stuff off the  point inspection sheet because if we actually told the customer everything thats in need of repair by the standards of the manual or textboosk theyd just plain not believe us.

For someone who has dedicated their life to fixing cars this sucks to have to do. I get that most people cant afford to have all that crap fixed at once. But if theyd just changed stuff at the mileageage the manual says or had listened to the advice of the technician the first time it was suggested they wouldnt have this pileup of issues.  of the time you only get a car that you could honestly sell them everything under the sun when an owner neglects regular maintenance. Really having  things noticeably wrong with a car doesnt even take THAT much neglect. Ignore all fluid except for oil? by K youll need brake trans power steering and if equipped rear diff fluid. And coolant. Refuse filter changes a couple times? Well now youll have cabin and air filters filthy on the sheet. Not change your struts at km as recommended? well now youve probably got leaky struts showing. Then add in some random issue because stuff goes wrong and youve got  things. So the customer assumes theyre being lied to because how can  things need repairs. The answer of course is that most of them have gone wrong long ago at different times its just they or their mechanic ignored it. And it feels incredibly futile to send a car out having done an oil change when every other fluid is low or dirty. Yay your oil change was done on time. See ya when the water pump goes. And then a few months later when the power steering pump gets noisy...,Justrolledintotheshop,cfhj4h2,9,t5_2tteh

I was unharmed and I even got to reuse the engine. I cant speak for all s cars but these s RWD Hyundais are known to be heavy and overengineered as well as slow and prone to rust and from owning them for a decade and a half and surely crashing into many things with them I have gathered that they are one strong car. Especially since at the time of the accident the Pony was more than  years old. The good thing about owning such old cars is that no one will steal them ever. Im so confident that I leave the keys in my Pony almost always in part due to its crazy start up procedure  pump gas twice pull choke crank adjust choke so its not overrevving  Plus youd hear it a mile away  because of the highly tuned engine. Also having a car made before  in Ontario allows you to bypass emissions. But forget rolling around with badly damaged body panels. I got harrassed when I took off the fender on my  Swift when it was being painted and drove two kilometers to my then gfs house by a traffic cop said all those exposed sharp bits might cut a pedestrian...

It wouldnt matter how much money you threw into a pushrod engine it could never match the performance of the highest performance OHC engines.gtI didnt say they could and quite a few already do. Ill let you look up all the numbers since youre the one saying its not possible. But keep making an argument and then moving the goalposts.There are no OHV engines that can hit  VE period.gtThe results speak for themselves.Youre just talking about a big engine trouncing smaller engines. The Porsche engine is only  liters! Imagine what would happen if Ferrari were to run something like the LaFerrari which makes nearly  hp in stock form. Anyway youre focusing on ONE race class and calling it the endall to this argument. Consider the Panoz cars in the LMP class they had big thumping engines and couldnt even keep up with the Acura ARX which ran in the LMP class! Theres also Indy where Mercedes tried to run a pushrod V and despite having greater displacement and more boost it couldnt compete. The only major race classes that still use pushrod engines other than the GT class in ALMS do so because they are forced to by the rules.  gtExcept that they arent. There are great OHV cylinder heads out there that can get phenomenal numbers. They really arent as bad as youre trying to make them out to be.According to you. gtChanging either a chain or a belt is a fucking pain in the ass maybe?Thats not a problem and it doesnt have anything to do with technical advantage.These are the heads that someone acheived  VE with Im trying to find the article. Notice the flow numbers and keep in mind that these are  liter engines not even half the displacement of an LS gt If I can flow cfm through a drinking straw what does it matter? A. Its inferior to DOHC heads made for much smaller engines.B. The harder the engine has to work to aspirate its combustion load the less power it will make and the less efficient it will be.

740451,0,t1_cgofbov,gt True and if I had the choice to buy a  Regal or a  V Accord Id go for the Accord even though it has slightly less fuel economy. Honda gt BuickFor the purposes of this discussion lets not forget that the  Accord gets the same highway mileage and  mpg better in the city.gtDisplacement affects torque but so does piston stroke. As I said there are several different factors at play which determine torque. But piston stroke is probably the biggest.You cant just say stroke is the biggest and not back it up with anything. Displacement is the biggest VE is next. Ive never seen any evidence that stroke alone has any effect on torque output.gtGM has to use larger displacements to make up for the lower rpm limit and general hpliter disadvantage that OHVs have compared to DOHCs.Are you even reading my replies? I know this.gtDOHCs can rev higher more reliably...They can also do it more efficiently.gt But again yes...displacement affects torque.Its the main determining factor. You need to read up on BMEP.gtI cant find any weight info for any comparable Ferrari Vs. Itd be nice to have the F or  engine weights on hand.Youre probably the most forgetful person Ive ever had a conversation with. If a Ferrari V from  can weigh less than the LS and make more power wouldnt it stand to reason that the modern smaller displacement Ferrari Vs could very easily weigh less?Either way high rev engines are capable of much greater power to weight ratios than low rev engines. High rev engines can also have vastly superior power densities. Just take a look at a  hp Indy V or a superbike engine or an LMP V or an F engine they are all extremely small for the amount of power they produce.gtWhile tons of other people have taken LSxs beyond  miles with only routine maintenance. to  is common for me to see with high rev engines that are in still very good operating condition.gtHonda is obviously very different from Ferrari.Not really. In terms of outright engine performance theyre pretty close. Hondas engines are a little more heavily built but the point is that high rev engines can be very durable. Ive already gone over why that is you seem to not be reading my replies or not paying attention to what Im saying. I may sound like my understanding is simplistic but Im just trying to keep things simple because you wont bother to learn about things like BMEP VE BSFC etc.gtZ with the Z package posts faster times on Laguna Seca with the same driver and same weather conditions.Well the LFA is quite a bit faster on the Ring and Road amp Track beat the ZR with the  at spring Mountain Motorsports Ranch with the same driver and under the same conditions.,Justrolledintotheshop,cgofzmg,1,t5_2tteh

So the complaints that are arising is from an educated  experienced group who forgot what their customers actually have not experienced. edit to the last point you make Yes I agree that it would disrespectful to not inform a someone if you knew it would be a problem but to most people it would never cross their minds that there is a problem to inform on.

1137921,0,t1_chxhoba,Not on the ones I have seen. Here is how my yo Mitsubishi Super Select WD works.The front hubs are not free wheeling they are always locked. In the front diff is a pair of hubs that unlock via a signal from the transfer case. When they are unlocked the CV shafts still spin from the wheels but the diff centre doesnt as it is disconnected automagically. When you are in WD you are in WD.  RWD. I can do whatever to the front as it is disconnected.One position forward on the WD selecter is AWD . This locks the front hubs in the diff and uses a viscous coupling to spit the power frontrear. This allows you to drive on bitumen in WD. This is the one you dont use unless the front wheels are connected to the transfer case as it kills the viscous coupling in the transfer case. This is where the vehicle would creep down a hill if I left it in P with no drive front drive shaft.Next stop is WD hi and lo this locks the centre diff as a normal WD would.As an added bonus I can go WD ltgt AWD driving straight on the road up to kmh its a bit crunchy anything over kmh so I dont do it above that. I can also go AWDltgtWD up to kmh. A lot of WDs this age cant do this apparently.Now I have changed the wheel hubs to put unlockable ones on so the CVs arent spinning as its quieter and uses a small amount less fuel on long trips. The catch it I have to make sure they are locked when I want to use AWD otherwise... I cook the centre diff.,Justrolledintotheshop,chxmkn6,3,t5_2tteh

1341536,0,t1_cikfje3,gt To be fair the front wheels are doing the stopping whether theWhich is why relying on them as the sole means of applying power is overworking them. Theyre already handling  percent of stopping the car supporting  of its weight and controlling which direction the bloody things pointed. Asking them to provide drive on top of all of that is simply asking far too much of them.gt Also FWD does actually have a pretty good advantage in pretty much any situationHrm. Lets see. Cost Yeah its cheaper to make. Which is a large part of why most everything is FWD. Fuel economy Yeah its slightly more fuel efficient. Like MPG more efficient. But thats enough for the marketing crew to work with. Packaging NOPE! All of the NOPE. FWD engine bays are universally cramped. Changing a clutch requires pulling the cars face off for example and on vee type engines changing one bank of plugs is often impossible due to the firewall. Youve also got the matter of worming the exhaust out somehow which either means wedging it between the motor gearbox and firewall or running it down the front and underneath the engine. Neither option is ideal. Power handling Elnoparino. You can get more power out of a RWD transmission than you can out of a FWD one. The weak link isnt even the gearbox its the half shafts. Because everything else is wedged into the nose as well FWD halfshafts have to be small and since they have to put power to the wheels that also steer the car they have to use CV joints. CV joints are inherently fragile. A good sturdy double Ujoint or a cardon joint can handle boatloads more power but theyre big and bulky so you only ever find them on RWD applications and the front axle of WD trucks...the latter less frequently they also cost more than CV joints so halftons are increasingly often fitted with CVs in the front. GG. Power delivery Again a big fat nope. By default you get torquesteer usually to the left in forward gears and to the right in reverse. You do not get torquesteer in a RWD car by default so long as the axles supports arent bentworn and both tires are of even size and maintain traction you will go in a straight line at any throttle level. It can be engineered out yes but this also increases the cost to design and produce the car which means the cars more expensive. Hence why most cars on the road torquesteer like pigs when you ask the engine to unleash its full wrath. It costs money to engineer that out of them which means they dont get that engineering.  Weight balance Erm no. Ideal weight balance with a front engine car is a rear transaxle driving the rear wheels. Some FWD cars are so laughably front heavy that a single random joe can pick their ass end right up...its part of why having bad shocks is such a problem with a lot of cars yet older ones give precisely no fucks. ITs also a large part of why the front tires and front breaks were stupidly fast while the rears barely wear at all. Minivans and subcompact hatchbacks are some of the worst offenders here. All the heavy oily bits are sitting on the front axle after all. Ease of Servicing Nyet! A sideways mounted engine is a sardined engine. Its why a lot of people loathe timing belts why so many timing belts go unchanged. Its an absolute bitch to work on most cars simply because theyre trying to cram way too much machinery into increasingly small engine bays. Handling Nope. Nope nope nope. Sure some FWD cars handle great. The original Mini for example. But theyre rare. The configurations weight balance and overworking of the front wheels predisposes it to MASSIVE understeer the likes of which Cadillacs of the s would be embarrassed about. There has to be a TON of engineering put into a car to make it handle right while also being FWD which again costs a lot of money. Most cars are made as cheaply as possible this includes design so the carmakers dont bother trying to work any of that understeer out. Worst of all they justify it by saying its somehow safer to plow into an obstacle headon than having a nippy responsive car able to avoid the obstacle entirely. Theyre also prone to liftoff oversteer which Ive noticed in watching dashcam vids on Youtube ends up with a lot of people in the ditch. Controlling oversteer Okay they have a point here. They are easier to get out of an oversteer situation weld your foot to the floor and point the front wheels where you want the car to go and nine times out of ten it will pull itself back in line. Doing that in a RWD car will just see you do donuts. But theyre not even the best at that AWD cars do this as well without most of the cons. Longevity Theyre not any better at living a long time than they are at promoting a nice responsive  weight balance. A lot of it comes from them being engineered on a penny budget though if properly engineered maintained and not abused they can still last  years or so. Engine options Ahhhh no. FWD is a large part of why we dont see inline sixes anymore. You just cannot package an I in a FWD car which is a crying shame because the I is an ideal largerdisplacement engine. They run smooth as silk can be fuel efficient last forever are generally pretty easy to work on cheap to make cheap to engineer and take well to boost. Theyre wonderful engines and we cant use them anymore because they dont fit in a FWD application very well. Also contributed to the demise of Vs had we stuck with RWD we could be seeing  and  liter Vs as a regular thing. Smaller more fuel efficient yet they retain all the wonderful sound and performance benefits of their bigger cousins. Modification You a car enthusiast that likes tinkering with their hotrod in their driveway or home garage? Yeah dont bother with front drives theyre a bitch to work on and youll spend an entire week doing something that only takes  hours on a RWD car.Bwwuuuhhhh...Im sure theres more ways I can find FWD falls on its face or at best only matches the alternatives but I dont have that much time on my hands. Surely though you can see why its used ITs cheap to design cheap to make great for cheap disposable economy cars and family sedans. Which is  of the car market worldwide. Hence everythings front wheel drive. Im quite content with RWD and AWD as Subaru does it. The crankshaft should be parallel to the roadway not perpendicular.,Justrolledintotheshop,cikje00,7,t5_2tteh

Most were repairable wrecks or badly repaired with front end damage.  It takes very little impact to totally screw up the alignment of the headlight housings break off plastic headlight tabs screw up radiator supports etc. and most of it is hidden damage esp if someone did a cheap cosmetic repair.  I had one like this where the airbags had deployed the windshield replaced with a really scratched up salvaged one and the airbags not replaced with the dash and steering wheel cover patched up.  Still have one of the first ones I bought a funtodrive  with a stick now long in the tooth probably too rusty to pass inspection sitting in my yard.  Still runs great.  It had been hit in the front I found one the same color in a local junk yard that had been rearended.When we lived in Germany and needed to replace a car I found a really sweet latemodel diesel Yaris at a used car dealer.  Took it for a testdrive ran great then I took it in to the Post for a courtesy inspection they told me the headlights were way out of alignment and wouldnt pass.  When I took the car back to the dealer and showed him the inspection report he admitted the car had been hit and repaired.  When I looked more closely at the headlight housings under the hood I could see there was no way you could correctly line up the headlights without taking the whole front end apart and straightening it to specs.  The car looked perfect on the outside they had matched the paint up and panel alignment quite nicely.Anyway kudos to the OP for doing the job right!

Youre now only allowed to retorque the bolts a fixed number of times before theyre required to be replaced for fear that one will come loose.

Shops cant have one licensed tech but pumping out a bunch of inspections done by someone else but under his name. I wouldnt want to ruin my reputation. Obviously there are people that will scam but what Im saying is if something that isnt required by the government to be inspected would most definitely fail I feel as a tech its your duty to shut it down.

If they used a Mobile  or equivalent they would be fine. The only spec that GM put on the engines for a required oil is a Dexos spec which isnt terribly hard for the oil manufacturer to obtain. Even a BMW will die a short death if you run conventional every k. Ive had Strait  bmws comming back at k with  or  quarts left because its their second or rd oil change using a off brand filter and conventional oil. BMW owners have been using high end oil for years though so they are use to it and you dont see that error happen as much. GM owners got this thrust upon them in  and not a single person cared to explain it to the person buying the car so they all think its BS of the person doing the oil change trying to get more money out of them.

Pepboys put w oil in the last service they put w and when we followed up after  days customer said the problem was gone. Hell Chrysler even has a code P for incorrect oil weight the computer can actually determine the problem in some cases. The new fiat doesnt even have direct contact with the intake valve the camshaft lobe operates a oil control chamber to vary lift you think a change in oil isnt going to affect that? Most VVT vehicles set codes with  degs of variance.  We typically get  or  a year I can copy case studies from our monthly seminars that have a number of these problems.  Questioning the difference between ww vs w means you dont even realize that the tolerances for what constitutes a particular weight oil is so broad you can literally have a w be thicker at a given temperature than a w in an extreme case.Take a look at European oil standards. Look through that list all those oils which are in different viscosities  to meet the requirements.  For some brands its w others may label it a w.  And this doesnt even take into account the additive packages.TLDR  Ive seen and fixed a number of cars with a simple oil change so believe it.

It sounds like we are both performance biased car guys.However I would hope you agree that not all modifications to a car have to have a performance benefit.  Lights emblems lips tint carbon fiber bits etc are all aesthetic additions are unique to the owners taste and style.  They are part of what makes that car and owner combination unique.Im not saying stretched tires are appropriate safe or should continue to be legal.

3393107,0,t1_cpf0we2,I dont know how hard their credit checks are to pass or if they even do one but it seems pretty easy to get one. You need a clean title in hand with matching ID. There have been instances where someones sister used their ID because they were similar enough. Also a couple people who would get the loan then immediately drive a few blocks to  another loan place and get another just because the first loan hadnt been processed yet.The family member question actually reminded me of a really shitty story. So I had a title loan assignment for a Red Dodge Dakota but the truck never showed at the house and nobody would answer the door when I came knocking. Id also leave notes for the guy to try to get him to call me. I hated doing this shit but I had to. One on night run I happened to be there at the same time as the guy who delivered their newspaper. He told me he had never seen the truck before. Other address start popping up for the guy way across town. Thats a different zone so another driver gets the assignment. No sign of the truck. I cant remember how we got the info but it turns out that the guy and his wife had split hence the new addresses for him despite the same family living in the house the whole time. I put this assignment on the back burner.Fast forward to Christmas Eve. All of our clients put out holiday moratoriums telling us not to do repos during the holidays and such. All of our clients that is except the title loan companies.So all I can work on are my title loan assignments and I decide to cruise back by this house one last time. I just want somebody to answer the door and tell me to fuck off so I can just get the account closed. I make the corner and lo and behold theres the fucking red Dodge Dakota sitting right in front. I snatch that motherfucker up and get the hell outta Dodge heh.  I bring the truck back to the lot and begin my personal property inventory. Everything is removed from the vehicle and inventoried the owner has  days to claim and pay  for their property. Im kinda surprised by the stuff Im finding in it then I finally realize exactly what happenedIt was his sons truck. Well it was in his name but it was his sons truck. The truck was never there because the kid was away for his first semester of college. The guy is a piece of shit and sometime around his wife leaving him he took out a title loan on the truck. I imagine him assuming that the truck would remain out of state and he wouldnt live with his wife anymore and he could just avoid the problem altogether.So its Christmas Eve this poor kid probably just watched his truck get repod from his living room window and now he has no truck and no way back to school after the break.

3773371,0,t3_33akw1,Mine was really simple but scared the shit out of me. Im not a mechanic but come from a family of mechanics so ive been working on my own cars for the past  years. Anyway I bought a used  Toyota Tacoma with only K on the odo. I bought a bull bar and Hella lights for it and when it came time to install a friend and I had to run the wires into the cab. This is where the fuck up occurred. Folks online said use a coat hanger and run the wires through a grommet in the firewall in the drivers side footwell. This grommet also contained a bunch of other wires. So my friend is under the hood trying to push the coat hanger through and its not going. Finally he gives it a bit more of a push. Bam. Were through. Fish the wire up into the dash wire up the switch and we think were good. Go to start the truck to test the lights and it wont start. No crank nothing. The lights dont come on and the stereo unit touch screen unit is totally dead. Fuck. So im scrambling around trying to think of what happened. We disconnected the lights checked the fuse box everything looked fine. So im freaking out thinking I broke a truck thats still under warranty when finally I look underneath the dash and there is a large box in the drivers footwell with three different harnesses going into it. One of those harnesses the biggest one was unplugged. It has the arm style clip on it that folds over and apparently the coat hanger had managed to hit the tiny little piece of plastic and released it from the box. Plugged it back in and she fired right up. Crisis averted and my heart was able to slow down a few beats..,Justrolledintotheshop,cqme4cq,1,t5_2tteh

But again for warranty even if they looked like theyve been sitting at the bottom of the Atlantic for a couple decades we are required to machine.  At the Chrysler dealer I worked for parts were so cheap we never turned rotors.  They also only warrantied pulsation for  mos k miles vs GMs mok.

Theyre beautiful designed driving machines as I said before and I think that theyre an experience to drive. But aside from taking one around a track for a day or two I personally do not have the interest in owning one and thats ok cause theres an ass for every seat.As for the fire thing that happened to about x s in  and was a common running joke back then. I dont believe its happened since but Im not in the mood to do research at this time. The disintegration was that the sand basically well sandblasted the car and removed some paint and some of the fiberglass close to the outside of the wheel wells. Perhaps it was a defective or a prototype car or wrong mixes were used but considering where I live has quite a bit of sand it doesnt inspire confidence in me. As for the awg thing. well you tell me how bad that is. It certainly sounds like an electrical oversight across that model year perhaps that generation but I dont know how they do their designs because they wouldnt JUST select your car and say fuck this guy in particular. But I do know that Lamborghini starting out making farm implements hasnt had such problems albeit they have their own issues. So I have formed an opinion that theyre not worth it to own. Drive? yeah give it to me for a day. But to own?

4604986,0,t1_ctaqbpi,gt Yes it is. Its used to give physical properties mathematical properties.Thats not what you said earliergt Drag coefficient is simply the mathematical expression of dragThe mathematical expression of drag is the formula you used earlier which contains the coefficient of drag to calculate drag. If the drag coefficient is the mathematical expression of drag how could the mathematical expression of drag also contain the coefficient of drag? It cant both contain and be the same thing. Thats a logical impossibility.gt This might be true if the impact was instantaneousInstantaneous with respect to what? Youre being completely unclear. Are you saying the impact doesnt happen all at once? Or that the impact happens as soon as the projectile begins accelerating? Youre not making any sense.gt happening in an otherwise empty environmentWhat? No. Of course not. The point is the only thing that matters to the outcome of an impact is the projectile and its properties at time of impact and whatever it hits. Whatever happened to the projectile before the impact ie it was accelerated by a gun a slingshot a tornado Beckhams foot etc is  irrelevant. If it impacted with the same properties the impact will be the same. Nobody gives a shit whether the acceleration was due to wind or gunpowder because it cannot matter.gt we end up with other flying objects great variations in wind velocity variations in the orientation of the projectile and target and a thousand other things that make it more complexI already gave you a list of all the relevant properties but you insisted on adding wind force because you have a thing for tornadoes.gt All of these make drag extremely importantFalse. The velocity of the projectile doesnt make drag important. At all. If the wind accelerated the projectile to  mph then the impact happened at  mph. If the wind accelerated the projectile to  mph then the impact happened at  mph. Nobody gives two shits if the drag force was big or small because the impact still occurred at that speed regardless. Its completely utterly irrelevant.gt are all going on even on the timescale of an impact once winds are this violentWhile technically true its utterly irrelevant. If it takes  seconds for the wind to accelerate an object up to  mph that same wind with greatly reduced drag force since the relative motion is now so much lessand as we all know drag scales quadratically with relative motion will apply so little force during the milliseconds over which an impact occurs that it would be far less than a rounding error to exclude it. In fact trying to include those drag forces would be an exercise in failing to use significant figures properly.gt You only think its irrelevant because you cant grasp the bigger pictureLmao youre the one trying to focus on how hard the wind continues pushing on a projectile after its already hit an object. Thats a comically minute and irrelevant detail and youre just grasping at straws to try and come up with some semblance of hope for your argument.gt This isnt your high school physics book this is reality  which is clearly something youre not very familiar with.Youre not familiar with eitherat least I know my physics! And the fact remains whatever forces were accelerating a projectile before impact are completely irrelevant and it doesnt take a high school physics course to figure out why.gt It really just demonstrates you are just an arrogant piece of shit who cant stand the thought of being wrongLol irony.gt youve been consistently missing pieces and then pretending you saw them all along!Youve been literally disagreeing with your own statements throughout this entire conversationnot just changing small parts of your argument to try and patch the gaping holes but literally doing a  when you realize how wrong you are.

The systems that indicate which tire needs to be serviced with a TPMS service tool where most start with identifying the LF followed by the RF RR and finally the LR. The tool is then connected to the DLC and the serial data from each sensor is flashed to the TPMS system to match each tire location. The confusion stem from when lazy techs dont properly match a wheel to its addressed location on the vehicle or do a proper system reset when rotating tires.But this stems from poorly run shops that refuse to charge a customer for resetting the system and paying the tech to do the job properly.,Justrolledintotheshop,cte6pqj,1,t5_2tteh

You really havent ever been poor have you? Just because I can afford to pay about month for a car cheaper if you get older used model doesnt mean I can afford the maintenance for it. Being poor you usually dont get to pick and choose which car you get so you may be stuck with a vehicle that has high parts prices. In any case the only light that could endanger anyone else on the road is the brake light and honestly if you cant feel that your brakes arent really working right you shouldnt be driving it.

Im sure it didnt look as good as when she dropped it off but what choice do you have.  Suck it up and let a company you pay fuck you for  or fight back?  Remember she now has ANOTHER car that she bought in the meantime that the extended warranty company ended up at least partially liable for.  Probably because a K cash car was cheaper than renting a car for  years lol.Edit was looking at rentals last night and did the math.  Cheapest I found was day which would be almost  for  years.If I were her I would turn around and sell the car that sat and the extra she bought and get something nicer with the combined funds.  Then drive it to the extended warranty company headquarters and do burnouts in the parking lot whilst flipping them the bird.,Justrolledintotheshop,ctizu3g,44,t5_2tteh

It is independent of frequency and when you start placing speakers offaxis and aiming them at each other perpendicularly nonetheless it happens. Thats not even mentioning all the weird reflections youll get and the effects all that intermingling has on the way you perceive the sound once it reaches your ears. Sound is a very directional thing. Its the reason people spend lots of money to treat rooms for critically listening to music.Phasing is part of the reason that the vast majority of modern music comes out of a mastering studio with everything beneath  Hz summed to mono except of course in very specific situations.Not only that but youre more likely to perceive these issues in your sound system when listening in close proximity to the sound sources...like maybe in a small truck cabin.

5080113,0,t1_cuyb074,Well if youre shifting without the clutch you essentially do the job of the synchros when you rev match. The downside is that if you cant rev match perfectly your synchros end up doing the reduced job of the clutch. If youre rev matching with the clutch the synchros still have a job to do since the input shaft is disconnected from the engine. Ive never driven a big rig or anything unsynchronized but I always rev match since it reduces wear on the clutch.,Justrolledintotheshop,cuycgri,2,t5_2tteh

Sent the head out to be machined and came back  thousandths lt. which was within spec and I put it back together. Running for at least a month now with no problems.During postmortem I think I found the cause looks like the super charger had been rebuiltreplaced as it still had all of the paint markings on it and was very clean plus the screws were black anodized which I think is an option when rebuilding. Anyway my best guess was the gears in the back which drive the water pump failed and it overheated. Judging by the amount of missing bolts and how poorlynot torqued everything was I think someone rebuilt the super and put it back together only to find out the head was warped. Then they dumped it to auto auction and I ended up with it from a dealer who did their best to hide the issue which I eventually found a few weeks later.P.S. Love the videos you gave me the insight I needed to replace the head even though you dont really have a video on head gasketshead repair I was able to piece it together from your engine rebuild videos.Now Im off to do a clutch replacement on my wifes  R.

You can use staples to hold it in place while you sculpt the boiling rubber. If that doesnt work try drilling eyelets into each edge of the damaged areas and connecting them together with zip ties  just like putting laces through a shoe.

Im looking for long life and reliability that allows for a wide coverage area. A lot of the driving is lousy with deer and other things that get on the road. Having a vehicle with focused narrow light throw is a liability.Weve kept the vehicle around due to it having large headlamps that cast a wide beam that lights up the shoulders. When we replace it Im going to have to make sure there are low driving lights that can be set to augment a focused beam if the vehicle comes with those projectorstyle headlamps. Id love to put a light bar on the vehicle but that would be a real asshole way to treat the other drivers she infrequently meets let alone that it is highly illegal.,Justrolledintotheshop,cvmjf88,1,t5_2tteh

We use to place these black boxes on peoples cars and our greatest fear was the driver taking their vehicle to a mechanic shop and being discovered. However legally we could ever only use these in cases in which one spouse suspected the other of cheating. If they werent married we couldnt offer this as a service. We charged a  deposit in case it was discovered or lost and several hundred for each day it was on. We were able to report where they had been how long they had been there where they were heading and how fast they were going. We never once placed one of these on a vehicle only to learn they werent cheating. If we learned they were somewhere they shouldnt be or lied about where they were we would rush over and film what they were doing. As long as it was a public space when the divorce went to court we turned over all videos and location records to the judge.

5640515,0,t1_cww7chx,most rail car axles are not fixed to the truck in any way and are just held there by gravity and a small steel clip which is why when you see a train overturned the axles are often missing from the truck because the force of the derailment snapped those bars. the truck is the portion at the end with the axles.

5658297,0,t1_cwy4gvz,I have an  CTS and Ive replaced every single bulb in my headlights for aesthetics not because they burnt out. I never had any problems going in through the wheel well fender liners but thats only because I work at a dealership and have access to lifts and a full toolbox. I cant imagine what someone would have to go through trying to change any of those bulbs by themselves especially without prior knowledge. Even for me installing my HIDs required removal of the entire air box assembly on the driver side and removal of the fuse box on the passenger side and even with my genetic predisposition for long skinny dexterous fingers it still took me almost an hour per light. In order to change the reverse and tag lights you have to remove the padding on the trunk lid again very difficult to do without damaging the clips unless you have the right tool then remove the entire panel that holds the rd brake light reverse lights license plate and tag lights in order to gain access to the bulbs.

Its the local municipality skimping on road repairs and diverting your attention to something else  comparing studs to Hitler. Im from Northern europe and if you are driving outside cities and off the main highways without studded tires you are in a massive disadvantage. Even if you have a state with barely any snow but a lot of rain in near  C situations  you will get black ice.You shouldnt have any issue with staying on the road if its just wet there is a slight disadvantage to studs on snow in stopping distance but if you have ice under a sheet of snow studs win again. And the snow packs down hard on any driven road and forms an extremely slippery white ice where you have trouble standing up on.We have approx  months of snow a month and a few politicians who incidentally never get out of city centers trying to blame studs on holes linear depression lines and massive cracks  when its clear the roads are built by  year old standards and just cant cope with the heavy traffic we are experiencing nowadays. ,Justrolledintotheshop,cxdthn5,1,t5_2tteh

Cant remember the make off the top of my head the guy hadnt changed the oil gas spark plugs batteries or even the tires and brought it to us and wanted us to fix it and just get it running. The guy was notorious around he area about always having an issue with price and running you for every last penny. He was super obnoxious as we know now. When we told him the price he yelled at us about trying to price gouge him. The parts manager girl bless her heart came back and told us how mad he was and I walked up front set his carburetor on the counter with the bowl off and took the top of the container it was in off. We put it in an old Tupperware container because it smelled so bad it was stinking up the entire shop.The bowl was FILLED with gunk like you have coating the edges of the bowl and jets. Like you could dip your flathead in it and scoop some out. The guy made that dry heaving sound and thought he might throw up it smelled so bad and I just said Thats just one part of your bike. Dont make me bring your asbestos air filter up here too if you want to complain about prices. Then my manager just told him to either pay what he owes or to come back with a trailer because there would be zero negotiating on the price. We fixed the bike and made some decent cash off the thing but good lord was that a nightmare job. Never pulled so many dead mice and dead lizards out of an air box before.

That wasnt the case  years ago.

6414658,1,t1_czipz29,Toyota quality started falling about  years ago but it was still better than many other brands until the last  years. Some Toyota products remained relatively unaffected by the falling quality but others were quick to start having issues. The entire Lexus brand for example started having issues much sooner than other Toyota branded cars. Maybe its because the switchover where Lexus was just a blinged out rebadged Toyota instead of their own unique car designs was a turning point where prior owners noticed the lower quality standards. Whatever the reasoning it has been obvious for awhile. In the most recent few years some domestic carsSUVs have been highest in quality ratings and many KiaHyundai products have hit top marks as well.Its not just Toyota falling though.

6688823,0,t3_4771ir,I used to help run a workshop for students.  The school owned the tools and we had to have both inch and metric tools because the stuff we worked on had both.  After the students chewed up some nuts and bolts by using wrenches that almost fit I grabbed all the metric wrenches and sockets out of the tool chest.  I hit them all with some brake clean and a rag and then spraypainted them  a wide stripe down the middle of the wrenches and both sides of the sockets when they were clipped to a socket rail.  I ended up with bright SAE tools and painted metric tools.  That made it easier for the students to tell them apart and reduced the number of beatup fasteners.  I had to occasionally repaint the really popular tools like  mm but that was a small price to pay.edit inch and metric not inch and SAE derp,Justrolledintotheshop,d0b6ldm,7,t5_2tteh

Once thats done try to isolate the rattle itself. Hold the hinge and if you still hear rattle then its probably rattling at the closure. Often times the door pin is too small for the clasp and that will cause rattling. You can try to find a pin with a slightly larger diameter or even wrap it thinly with masking tape.

7502627,0,t1_d2v033p,Well for one thing theyre very tight tolerance. Boat motors have unlimited cooling so they can run at a very low temperature. Lower temperature engines need higher tolerance parts. Its not specifically salt water but there is a lot of stuff exposed to the elements. Most of the hardware is stainless steel for this reason. Its little things like this that raise the production cost. Cars can be made cheaply because they make millions of them and an unreliable car can be written off as a lemon. Not really the case with boat motors. The failure rate is incredibly low. Theyre also a luxury item. Ive been around boats for my entire life and when you see several examples it becomes pretty easy to see why a reliable boat motor can cost k. Its not just an engine attached to a prop. Its an entire stand alone unit with its own closed systems. ,Justrolledintotheshop,d2v0cky,2,t5_2tteh

If youre just trying to replace the old receiver that is usually less than a couple hours work if you buy the adapters and mount kits for your vehicle ahead of time definitely worth looking into as a DIY thing. You can do most of the wiring work before you even get into the vehicle when you buy a plug adapter. Just as a for instance I replaced the receiver in my Yukon and it took me all of  minutes to wire the harness adapter to the receiver pigtail and another ten to install the mounting brackets. All told I had about  minutes invested in the project and I knew when I walked away that the connections would outlast the device.If you are going further than a receiver I would definitely suggest going to an actual audio shop. Usually they dont have a problem installing the parts you supply and theyll let you know if there are going to be any issues with compatibility between parts like if you buy an amp that cant push enough power to all your speakers.,Justrolledintotheshop,d3tdgjf,3,t5_2tteh

He declines and says it cant be any of that it must be electrical. He just replaced the starter and hes out of his realm. He wants me to test the starter relay. He seems very sure of himself and very insistent so I oblige and quote him X dollars to pull and test the relayIm quoting at our labor rate at this point so like x more than the basic check hes okay with that. We get to it in about an hour and hes left at this point. We jump start it and and pull it in and test the starter relay. Its just fine of course. So I call him and let him know the bad news that the starter relay is just fine. But that we were able to jump start his car and bring it in and offer to do our basic check again. Hes flabbergasted and agrees. The guy went through the trouble of replacing the starter towing it to a shop. Insisting we test this one obscure part. All for a battery.

In the early s everyone bitched about how much clutter was under the hoods and blamed it on pollution controls. The fact is that it was our escalating demand for accessory items and their related systems...and this prePCV car illustrates it well.   Its amazing how many items nowadays are electrically operated and remotely located that once were engine driven. Lincolns once had hydraulic wipers. Others had hydraulic windows tops seats vacuum wipers etc. Its crazy to consider now and you have to wonder what changed with the electrics to make it possible now but not then. ,Justrolledintotheshop,d76xxx0,6,t5_2tteh

8969693,0,t1_d7q003q,To a point yes. But airbag geometry is surprisingly carefully designed. In a lot of places my area included a mechanic can put their job on the line for allowing a vehicle with damaged airbag covers to be driven back on the road. Theres also concern of moisture ingress which can turn the dry lubricant powder into goo since its corn starch. The concern on deployment even without moisture though is that the cover is designed to break in a specific way and if it doesnt the airbag can deploy too low too high or deflect the occupant to one side or another which if it is toward the outside youve possibly sent someone through a window. Tldr theres a lot of shit that can go bad if those covers are bad that you might not think about Edit In all fairness that cover isnt that bad compared to what Ive seen.

9288820,0,t1_d8tbnk9,gt Of course the fact that its an impact tool plays a role as well.That bit is crucial an impact will only turn a set amount before releasing tension again then turn a set amount again etcetera.Say you took a torque wrench and turned it a quarter of a turn producing X amount of torque at a nut. Now add an extension between the wrench and the socket and again do a quarter of a turn you will have applied part of the rotation to the twisting of the extension and part to tightening the nut assuming the twisting of the extension takes less torque than it takes to tighten the nut.However in this case the question is does torque get lost so instead of turning a fixed amount turn until the wrench clicks. Will there be a difference in how tight the nut is with or without the flex from the extension? Nope no difference. The flex in the extension just means you will have to turn a bit further to take out that slack whether it comes from play on the connection or the extension itself twisting doesnt matter when the wrench clicks by definition the amount of torque applied by you to the wrench is equal to the amount of torque being resisted by the nut.,Justrolledintotheshop,d8tfan2,3,t5_2tteh

My radio is compatible with both DDP and BAP and sets a code which you can ignore for being unable to communicate over BAP.

It just sounds like you took all of the differences in AWD vs FWDRWD and put them into the form of a complaint.   Having to buy all  tires is an annoyance but its not like youre throwing out the other  tires or even doing it every week. Nor do you have to do it all the time. You can shave all of the tires to the correct tread wear If possible  Not all AWD vehicles are hard to work on. Audi and BMW are the only Euro vehicles I hear bad shop stories from. Most AWD Japanese cars are super easy to work on even with the crammed space  Out of the  some cars my entire family owned Mom  Dads side too With a huge variety of Domestic Imports and Euros very few werent AWD and very few were annoying to own because they were AWD. On the plus side as well Audis Quattro and Subarus Symmetrical AWD systems are fantastic big buggers if you live anywhere that snows a lot. Snow tires and  AWD make for a very fun season.,Justrolledintotheshop,d9jo7yk,2,t5_2tteh

It was an  Scottsdale K with k on it and the body on it didnt look bad but the frame was BAD. Hole in left rail and crack at least half the height of the rail gas tank crossmember was rusted out on one end exhaust completely rusted out  missing tailpipe breaks in ypipe at cat connection and cracked beyond repair at both manifolds. Truck wasnt beyond repair but needed a lot of work. Would have loved to keep it and fix it up but I dont have the space.Also all the boltsnuts on my  came loose just fine with a breaker bar it was the tapered surfaces that gave me trouble.

People drive around here in Virginia with expired inspection stickers for months and cops dont notice or dont care. The fine for an expired inspection sticker is  after court costs. Driving after a failed inspection sticker expires is only . Since the cost of fixing anything major that is broken is going be significantly more money than either of those its much cheaper to just roll the dice and pay the fine if you happened to get pulled over with an expired sticker than to actually get the damn thing fixed. Equipment violations dont get you points on your license either. ,Justrolledintotheshop,d9qbze6,7,t5_2tteh

9561382,0,t1_d9r2r40,Most these cars dont use metal or anything of that nature. They want the car to weigh less so it goes faster. In the last fast in the furious there are tons of unrealistic stuff like driving a car through  building. But the part where vin diesel picks up the front end of a exotic car so Paul walker can get under it could be plausible. Granted its still unrealistic but these newer sports cars are so light that the wind pushing the front of the car down is what is keeping it from flying up in the air. So with no engine in the front and very light weight material one could argue someone could lift the front end up. ,Justrolledintotheshop,d9rmxca,1,t5_2tteh

With grease being pumped through the tubing will swell with time and thus never fit in a new fitting and in many cases it will not release so you have to cut the tubing and often you find the tubing has swollen so that a new fitting will not fit it any more. You press in the end using either the special tool they make for this or some pliers for those that are not going to release with just finger pressure. Then pull gently on the tubing and wriggle it so it comes out of the grip spring inside and breaks free from the seal in the end.,Justrolledintotheshop,dav0rj8,1,t5_2tteh

Engine needs a new rod piston bearings and rings on one cylinder and the transmission needs the converter rebuilt and the clutches replaced from having water stand inside it.

Especially if some burning hydrocarbons remain after incomplete scavenging which appears to be the case given the pattern on the piston crown.  Besides although diesels have a higher compression ratio gasser engine compression ratios are still plenty to ignite the diesel prior to full compression even without hot spots.  Its just that a diesel with a ratio that low would ignite inconsistently at injection making injection timing difficultimpossible to calibrate properly and itd be a bear to cold start.,Justrolledintotheshop,de3a9a1,2,t5_2tteh

Kids getting their first car often got a beat to death Civic and being too broke to buy a decent car figured theyd just improve what they had. Thus a culture of modifying shitty economy cars was born.If there is a single truism in automotive performance it is this there is no replacement for displacement. The reality is that anything that can be done to a small displacement engine can also be done to a larger displacement engine and the larger engine will always produce more power. Tunning and forced induction are not exclusive to the lawn mower engines found under hoods bearing a Honda logo.There were some truly shitty cars with a V but most of those bad driving experiences were in stock vehicles so comparing them to a modified car is ludicrous. The slowest crown vic can produce some truly impressive numbers with a little work. Yes the same could be said for a Civic but the potential of a . liter engine exceeds that of a . liter engine. Therefore the . liter engine is inferior as a performance engine.Drive what you like if an anemic little toy motor makes you happy than by all means drive that just dont delude yourself into thinking that there is some form of magic causing a small engine to have the same potential as a big one.

So a bad landing on brand new tyres put on before that flight could mean you take them all off get a new set of wheel assemblies  came already mounted filled to the right pressure and with a label on them out from the tyre shop put on put the old ones on the trailer and Chris would replace the rubber and retest them.Change limit was  plies exposed on these particular ones the old tyres were kind of popular with local farmers for farm trailers as they would fit a regular steel rim and last years towed behind a trailer with any load on them. Of course not rated for road use but on the farm fine. Takes a long time for a farmer to wear through the remaining dozen plies and they were almost puncture proof as well.,Justrolledintotheshop,deu54pu,5,t5_2tteh

11169834,0,t1_dexzit7,Im not trying to give you shit.  You got the job done and thats all that matters really but you definitely did more than you had too if your intention was only to replace the bearinghub.  These cars are notorious for bad wheel hubbearing assemblies so if you end up doing it again a little more research might save you some time.  Riveted ball joints kind of suck so I feel bad for you.The only hardware that needs to be removed are the  lug nuts  caliper bolts  caliper bracket bolts large axle nut the  bolts for the hub assembly and one electrical connector if yours has ABS brakes.The common problems a DIY guy will run into are an axle rustedcorroded to the wheel hub.  Sometimes a rubber mallet will do the trick other times you can use a wheel hub remover that you can rent free of charge from AutoZone.  This tool will bolt in place where your lug nuts go and has a center drive to push the wheel bearinghub and axle apart.     I myself dont use it usually but Ive probably done hundreds of these just on GMs.The next common issue is finding the right socket and extension combination that gives you access to the  wheel hub bolts with the axle in place.  It is a little tight and crowded but can be done with basic  drive hand tools.  Ill normally use a short socket and an extension  long preferably with a basic wobble end for a little extra angle forgiveness.  Full swivel sockets might work but are usually kind of bulky for this area and those bolts are fairly tight.  Be prepared to have a bleeding knuckle.  Edit another trick to access these three bolts is to have both front tires in the air so you can turn the steering wheel from side to side giving you a little more room.The last thing I see people struggle with is feeding the ABS wiring harness thru the hole in the steering knuckle with the axle in place.  The axle will compress if you push towards the middle of the vehicle giving you just enough room to feed the harness thru.Just to make you feel bad.  Warranty time is . hrs and non warranty time is .hrs for the hubbearing.  The ball joint is . and ..  Good luck in the future sir.     ,Justrolledintotheshop,dey37mm,4,t5_2tteh

Its only a big job in regular cars because they are designed so you have to remove a lot of extra stuff to get access to remove the engine because people dont often replace them.What would be awesome would be for them to get it down fast enough to swap engines during the race.

Until I got a damage claim filed against me for the snapped off stud.Now if I cant break it free with just my arm strength with a  way I tell customers it needs a tow. Dont need another damage claim filed against me that will cause a reduction in my pay.

I told her that I dont want to break or damage anything and that I could happily tow it to a shop who can handle it. She then got pissy with me telling me I wasnt helping her or doing my job correctly. She then told me Why are you loosening the bolt with the wheel on the ground jack it up and then loosen it! I wanted to tell her that she clearly has no clue how to change a tire but I have to hold my tongue.

The car started feeling sluggish on the highway and as it was slowed the driver realized smoke was coming from the front end. The discs on this car are one inch thick SOLID nonvented. Before anything could be done the entire front end caught on fire! I was told the car was a total loss.  ,Justrolledintotheshop,dfyf5xj,13,t5_2tteh

11749080,0,t1_dgrrvsx,Tire ratings. They limit the speed to avoid having to put on more expensive tires. Also driveshaft redlines. My Dakota was limited to MPH basically a T rating tire.  is also common which works out to an R rated. However some Dakotas had an aluminum driveshaft those were limited to MPH and aftermarket tuners would NOT raise the speed limiter on those because they would run above the driveshaft redline and start becoming a flail under the truck. A MPH limiter would run about right for an S class tire limited car. On Dodges there is a key trick to get around the limiter where you turn the key to the start position and hold it there. It sounds insane but the starter does no engage unless the clutch is in on a manual or the transmission is in park or neutral on an automatic. So dont shift. But during this mode the ECU ignores the speed sensor your speedometer drops to zero but you keep accelerating. In the case of a stock . Dakota someone in Germany showed that  is where drag catches up.,Justrolledintotheshop,dgrsd28,30,t5_2tteh
