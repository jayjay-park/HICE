263150,0,t1_cf7umuk,The problem with that logic is that starting prices are much higher this year.  Just as an estimate based on what I can remember from the start of last season price for an AVERAGE regular starter is up almost m per DEF almost .m per MID and almost m per FWD or GK.  And that doesnt take into account some pretty large price jumps m or more for star players like RodWall Collin Magee and a number of others.  So you really dont have m extra to spend.I think its a little early to say whether this is a good or bad change but it certainly makes the initial roster selection more challenging.  If you want a m player it basically commits you to taking at least  players with the m minimum salary.  This is because average salary if divided totally evenly among your  is .m but although top price for GK is m most of the regular starters are running higher than that.  Just from an eyeball guess looks like  approximately .m per DEF . to m per MID . to m per FWD for runofthemill level starters it goes up pretty quick if you want more quality than that.,FantasyMLS,cf819aa,2,t5_2watp
272545,0,t1_cf8y3zs,When the season starts you will only be allowed  free transfers per week.  You do not want to be wasting those on a keeper at the beginning.  The beginning will be all about making money.  Player has a good week?  Buy him immediately so his price rises while hes on your payroll.  I highly doubt keeper prices fluctuate quickly.How much money do you have left in your bank?  If you dont have anything and youre stuck with . to spend you dont have a ton of other options.  You already have Borja so you cant choose him. ,FantasyMLS,cf90dhb,1,t5_2watp

Much less on a guy who may or may not be starting.Now they also resigned him after Hyndman steppeddown and before Pareja accepted the job. So the resigning of Loyd was a front office and Fernando Clavijo Tech. Dir. move. It is entirely plausible that Pareja does indeed give Acosta more playing time than we all anticipated here and there but hes  years old. Simple as that in my mind.Loyd has been a very good RB for us for a few years now. He fights hes apparently the most fit player on the team each year and hes something of a fan and marketing favorite.The FCD lineup is going to be in flux similar to COL the last few years as Pareja has many pieces yet not too many outwardly proven consistent players.,FantasyMLS,cfpecub,3,t5_2watp

627488,0,t1_cgbkjv7,It appears like last year we again tend to disagree on a strategy remember our discussion hits vs no hits?. That is ok though it shows that there are multiple ways to tackle this game successfully. You speak with such certainty but you use a strawman example. You will not have Mil while I have Mil. You may have MilMil more at the end of the year but that is it. Getting points will naturally lead to a rise in team value. Someone who only has Mil in September will not have many points and likely be a dead team.This example is akin to me saying when Im  points ahead of you your extra million still wont give you a chance. The fact is i will never be points ahead of you.I really care very little about  i dont make my transfer choices based on it i only base the timing of the transfers i am about to make in a certain week on it.My team value is only . and at the risk of sounding confident i know that i will finish the season ahead of most posting in this thread.Moral of the story?

7218849,0,t3_4ealot,FCD supporter here tried to warn people last week about how Pareja handles injuries.  He wants to make sure his players are  fit and will limit his minutes at first.  That being said my analysis was that he was going to rest Diaz week  amp play Diaz for the DGW .Id be surprised in Diaz plays  min. in the first game on the road but may play   home vs SKC.   My advice is to go with Castillo this week and get Diaz for week  if hes fit since I think he is the better player to own long term.

9004720,0,t1_d7tt1zz,Not sure what anyone else is doing with their WC but my team currently has  DGW  players amp will have  after using my  FTs for GW . My SGW player is BWP. I see no need to play my WC when I already have  DGW players so Im playing mine in GW .The main challenges going forward will be in selecting players from teams that are still fighting for one of the remaining  playoff slots amp teams in danger of losing their playoff slot. Players on teams still fighting for one of the top  slots in each division.The reason for choosing players from the teams that are in one of the situations above is for you to avoid selecting players that have secured a playoff slot or that have no chance to make the playoffs since they may rest a lot of their stars so that they are rested for the playoffs. Just remember that this is the MLS and even players on teams still trying to secure a playoff slot or hold on to one still may rotate some of their players.,FantasyMLS,d7u86wx,1,t5_2watp

10755973,0,t3_5tv3bg,The same theory can support the strategy of focusing on cheaper players so that you can have a starting XI AND a bench full of regular starters. The  scrubs wont increase in value so every one of them you have filling out your bench is a wasted opportunity to make money off that slot. Yes those players are less likely to gain value but you have more of them and players are generally more likely to gain than lose value. It should be noted that I do not subscribe to this theory at least not at the moment. Still a few days to change up my team though.,FantasyMLS,ddpebvu,1,t5_2watp
