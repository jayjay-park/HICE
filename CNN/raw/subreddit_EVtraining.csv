1389120,0,t1_ciqdpi0,Thanks! Also I took your advice and posted it. Hopefully itll get some more answers tomorrow.Heres the link if youre interested as wellThanks for answering! Im interested because Id just like to fight  horde battles and not care so much about the math. I remember in the previous gens having to look for the pokemon you need getting a notepad ready and marking off every single pokemon you knock out. It got so tedious to make sure that you only got  into a stat.Thanks again!,EVtraining,ciqep14,1,t5_2ur2z
