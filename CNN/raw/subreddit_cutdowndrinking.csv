1872468,0,t3_2eeyx4,Hey nice progress! I am trying to take a similar approach and would be interested to hear how you progressed to  days a week. Did anyone else help you in any way? Did you distract yourself somehow? How many weeks did you do each tier?  Did you manage to stick to it every week or did you take a step back at some point? Was there any change to the amount you drank on the days you did drink as you introduced more alcohol free days?,cutdowndrinking,cketqi7,1,t5_318u8

2903435,0,t3_2tbkbq,If you plan on cutting that back a good pointer would be when you wanna drink on the weekdays you mentioned only weekend drinking in a comment dont give yourself an excuse to drink on the weekdays for now. Maybe later when you have absolute control but not now. Good luck man. ,cutdowndrinking,cny4ke2,2,t5_318u8
5438949,0,t1_cw6cqc5, So far its mostly early morning meditation in my home before the kids get up. There is more to the program.The bad part is Ive had to come to the brink of divorce to seek counseling and have them suggest this MBSR to me. My situation is more complicated than simply drinking too much. Stress and alcohol have been contributing factors. will either be the year my spouse and I reconcile and are stronger than ever or part and go separate ways. The extra stressful aspect is that I dont think either of us know for certain what we want. The relevant part is this program has introduced a much healthier mechanism for me to address stress in my life.,cutdowndrinking,cw6vnu8,2,t5_318u8

10056927,0,t3_5jr8th,Ive had much more success with capping the number of drinks per day than going  dry. If youre ok with two beers a night cap it at two and be done. Drinking something bitter like tea or coffee afterwards and then brushing my teeth and using mouthwash helps me cut back the craving for more alcohol.Starting later in the evening helps too. If I have my first drink at  Im much more likely to only have one or two than if I start at PM.,cutdowndrinking,dbifxbx,4,t5_318u8
