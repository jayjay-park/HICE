337018,0,t3_1xxxil,I work really closely with a few of the professorsadministrators who have been working for the past couple of years to make this program a reality. you will graduate with a UF degree so it doesnt matter that you start at Santa Fe. You are for the most part only doing gen eds at Santa Fe with VERY limited core coarse work offered. You are given access to several UF Engineering resources so there really isnt much of a difference. Bottom line if you think UF Engineering is worth it then this program is worth it. On a side note if you are doing Computer Engineering I would do it with a hardware focus rather than a software focus. You learn a lot more in the ECE courses than you do in the CISE courses.,ufl,cffpaf9,5,t5_2rjcb

689471,0,t3_2227zf,I am currently a graduating Mechanical Engineer taking an innovation class as an elective and it is a lot of fun.  I am sure FSU or UCF will have great programs as well but Gainesville is quickly turning into a Silicon Valley of the south.  Buildings are going up around town for innovation centers and great programscompanies have started here you can check Shadow Health Student Maid Grooveshark Spinchill HackerHouse along with a LARGE amount of other companies.I think Gainesville is a great place for an innovation hot spot because of how highly ranked our science degrees are.  If you have an idea and you want to put it into action chances are one of your friends will know somebody who is great at whatever task you need.  Also the professor that I have now is an innovation intersection that will gladly point you in any direction or introduce you to somebody to help make your idea come to life.  Every month there are innovation meetings at  downtown too that a lot of company leaders and upandcoming studentspeople go to so they can increase their network.  The wealth of information here is a bit overwhelming.  The worst thing you could to would be to not give it a try.  ,ufl,cgin7pb,2,t5_2rjcb

Once you get into your major coursework though be ready to work very hard. This is especially true for computer science. While it is possible to take some easy classes you will also take some very difficult classes that you will need to pass to graduate. ,ufl,ch195pf,1,t5_2rjcb

1252872,0,t3_28futb,Woodlands and canopy are very good quality apartments and youd be spending a little extra there to live a little further away from campus in my opinion. I currently live at university commons which is a  minute bus ride to the middle of campus. I am an engineering senior this upcoming semester and Ive lived both right across from campus the courtyards and also a small  distance away University commons. At u commons I pay  a  month but when I lived at the courtyards I paid  a month because of the proximity to campus. I have a friend currently at canopy and his apartment is really nice along with the amenities. However he does say he feels like its too far probably like a  minute bus ride  and so he skips class a lot because the distance makes him lazy. If you can avoid that  then Id say you would be fine. As far parking Ive heard its a real bitch to park on campus because of the limited spots. Ive never parked on  campus  myself because of this. Most people have mopeds which seems to be the best choice to get to class and back. Sorry about the Grammer errors as I am currently studying abroad and the autocorrect is killing me haha.

9137792,0,t3_55g930,It depends on what youre studying  what majors andor minors. Now my major is in the liberal arts but my minor is in the natural sciences. My best friend is in engineering. Where my friend does a lot of math and coding I am frequently writing papers and watching lectures. Liberal arts utilize different skills compared to engineering and different people have different skills and interests. I would say that engineering and other sciences are more difficult but again it depends on your skills. It also depends on how many classes and what classes youre taking specifically so its difficult to just generalize about time studying. Frankly I honestly dont keep track of how often Im studying or working in terms of time but I do put in a few hours of workstudy a day. If youre still reading this awesome. I hope it makes sense since Im trying to nurse a head cold and Im drugged up a little bit. In terms of a social life I dont really go out too often and I havent really met too many people but thats my own fault any of you want to hang or play xbone? I still have some down time per week unless its a crazy week. I also work  hours a week and volunteer a bit on the weekends. Hopefully this made sense. All and all youll have some time to have fun. Be sure to make that time if you can for mental health reasons. You need to relax and have a break here and there.

9623559,0,t3_5cr8fy,Lots of people have made good points but I wanted to address your mobility struggle.First buses do run on the weekends you may have just been exagerating but its a different schedule. Use the app to know when the bus will be passing by and you can definitely go shopping on the weekend if thats what you wanted to do. You can also use Zipcar or Uber or ask around your dorm for a shopping buddy. If your fridge is too small you can get another of course only if you can afford it but if it saves you money on meals then it could be worth it. There are also meals you can keep at room temperature and we can definitely find you some resources for those around here if youre concerned about the cost and convenience. Beans rice pasta and cans for example keep for the entire semester so you can cook them whenever.The second suggestion is to get a bike or borrowshare one You can definitely ride a few miles with a bike and you can put it on a bus. Its late enough in the year to be comfortable to ride outside now. A huge percent of students has a bike.Finally walking is totally an option that people tend to overlook! You could probably walk a few miles per hour so even if a party is three miles away you could walk or run there and back. I like listening to podcasts or music while I walk and its pretty relaxing. If Im going to do cardio anyway I might as well jog to a party instead of on a treadmill.Finally if youre still not happy after reading the advice here you can talk to a professional at the UF Counseling and Wellness Center or peruse their online selfhelp resources several of which could apply to your situation. Youre definitely not alone.By the way I never cared much for football games or sports either. Hanging out with friends was cool but sports was just background to me and I was never really interested. When I went to games by myself I would use it to practice photography.,ufl,d9zaw0p,7,t5_2rjcb

Any good organizations in the business school would be great as well. Honestly though any club you know of that you think is cool Id love to hear about.

11570741,0,t3_655368,What is your major? If you are in the arts or a film student a MAC would be desirable. As other posters mentioned if you are in the business school where you need Windows and Excel to manage data in finance statistics econ or other math classes get a HP over Lenovo.

My volunteer work was average and I didnt really do many clubs due to family circumstances which I stressed in my application. I was offered first year online through a PaCE program then I could transition to campus which I did  and now theres no difference. Id say do your best and apply but dont be surprised if youre offered some sort of alternative to the traditional oncampus FallSpring semesters!

11772314,0,t3_67z8iv,First off its totally normal to have an awful year and so many students struggle with depression it sucks but it happens a lot. I want to make sure you know its not too late to get help. Im very disappointed that the wellness center turned you away I do know that they have trouble keeping up with demand but nobody should be turned away because theyre depression is too bad. Do you have health insurance? Often times health insurance will cover therapy if it is necessary which your case seems to show that it would be. I would suggest seeing a psychologist for regular therapy and a psychiatrist for discussing pharmaceutical treatment options as well. You need to be able to manage your depression better before you get back to school so you can do well and keep moving forward. The fraternity scene isnt for everyone though. If youre still wanting to meet people next semester you could always try showing up to classes at SW Rec finding an art class or attending a religious service. All of those things are social but less pressure than a fraternity or clubs. If you want to talkhave any questions feel free to PM me. ,ufl,dgufa3h,10,t5_2rjcb
