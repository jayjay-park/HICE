Then you can see number of edits  There is a massive spike in edits in june  when he announced his president run.And also number of page views but this doesnt go that far back. Maybe Ill have a go at cleaning up the charts for several of the candidates.,DataVizRequests,d0ruqnq,1,t5_33xnd
6964116,0,t1_d15oljt,Yearh I guessed it had to do with gear shiftsRPM it makes perfect sense.I assume that the fuel usage is exponentially related to RPM or speed and i think the multible lines confirms that in a way but i cant see it in the RPM or Speed graphs.Thank you very much for your help am looking into R right now.. ,DataVizRequests,d15pv4v,1,t5_33xnd
