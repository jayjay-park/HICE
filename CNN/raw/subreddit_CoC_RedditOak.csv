860995,0,t1_ch22vev,It was pretty apparent from the start these were very casual players.  We are too but definitely more organized.  There are some Reddit clans that are very competition driven but I would like to think we could give them a run for their money.  Congrats to QXpointone too.  Good luck in future wars!,CoC_RedditOak,ch25f93,1,t5_2zkrh
