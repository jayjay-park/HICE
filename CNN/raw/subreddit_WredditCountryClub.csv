All that being said if I had to give a definition a mark is a more casual type fan they cheer for the faces amp boo the heels amp they generally dont watch other wrestling promotionsA smark to me is someone who likes to analyze amp discuss the bigger amp broader aspects of wrestling. They cheer or boo whoever despite that characters alignment. Smarks also probably watch more wrestling than just WWE TNA NJPW ROH LU etc. There can be bad fans on both spectrums its just that smarks are the more vocal of the two,WredditCountryClub,d463px6,4,t5_3c7jw

I think Finn has absolutely been pushed too fast but I also anticipated that since he was anointed during his time in NXT. EnzoCass I mean... theyre over AF so if youre booking WWE youd be foolish not to capitalize on that. I feel really stupid for once thinking they wouldnt make it on the main roster. All in all... I think things are going well the WWE needed some new blood and theyve done a great job integrating that new talent. There are bound to be more NXT callups to come I dont know if Roode has a NXTonly contract like Joe but I dont see him being in NXT long Nakamura it has to be a matter of time for him but Ive been saying that for a while now it seems Im a mark lol.

Becky is the clear top dog or lass amp will hopefully win the title amp make it great! Nikki Im lukewarm about. Id rather it be Bayley so the HW are evened out plus wed get Baymella! It also doesnt help Ive never liked either of the BellasNaomi as this rave gimmick is great amp I think shes massively underrated thank god they toned down the lights too lol. Alexa plays a great bitch heel DAE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS!?!? amp can really show off whats shes capable of. Eva Marie I cant wait for to come back! I love the nuclear heat she gets just from being there! As for Natalya well lets just say Im not a fan lolAll amp all for what they have its been pretty good! I think its better than Raws amp they have the more stacked roster! Its a shame they wont use any other women on Raw except for Sasha Dana Charlotte soon to be Bayley as well.

8980068,0,t3_52ug6e,One thing that I liked about Monday Nitro is that they at one point changed announce teams between hours. Perhaps they could start the first hour with cruiserweights and switch to regular Raw at the beginning of the second hour. Have Corey Graves and someone else commentate the first hour and then being out Cole and Saxton to join Graves for hours  and . One thing with WCW that worked for a period of time is having wrestling start the show. You had to watch one because the matches were usually good but also you didnt know what was going to come next. Raw is very formulaic as it generally it starts with an in ring promo and ends with whatever that in ring promo started. So much so that I often dont watch the main event because it is usually some sort of throwaway tag match that I couldnt care less about the outcome of. There are also no cliffhangers so theres not as much incentive to tune in the next week. On a side note one time they had a match I think with the Giant vs Hogan or something. It ended after Nitro went off the air but you could catch it by watching Robin Hood or some shit afterwards. If I have to watch the Chrisleys to see the finish of a main event Ill probably complain about it online. ,WredditCountryClub,d7r9mol,1,t5_3c7jw
8980829,0,t1_d7r9r8m,I took a little longer with your post because I wanted to properly digest it point by point but here goesMaybe it was a consequence of me lurking around the rsc hivemind for so long but I didnt really notice the dry sporty presentation at first until I realized my investment in the storylines mostly came from me filling in the blanks with my own headcanons fantasy booking. You can see the potential for good stories with guys like Finn Cesaro and Neville but the current writing gives you so little to work with youre forced to fall back on Theyre athletic! ad infinitum. I worry this may be because for years WWE evolved their product by reacting to their competition the problem is that today wrestling in general has declined in mainstream popularity and thus their biggest competition by default is UFC. So now the WWE is convinced it needs to emulate UFCs serious presentation to win back audiences going against the spirit of what made wrestling so good to begin with.gt But as far as building stars go as much as I like people like Ambrose Reigns Rollins etc. I just dont get that epic feeling watching them that I do a Michaels Austin Undertaker etc matchpromo. They feel more like  Jeff Hardy where theyre fringe main eventupper midcarders while people like Cena Orton and Lesnar still feel more important. This might be the scariest part for me and the reason I worry older viewers may have toohigh expectations and Attitude Era nostalgia goggles nowadays. I feel its important to give the newer guys breathing room to develop first give them a chance to find their footing as main event guys. Even if they do though theres no guarantee any of them will develop the same epic feel as the veteran superstars. Given how much the WWEs business model has changed since then is it really such a death sentence if we never see another HBKAustinTakeretc. in the modern day? Ten years ago I never wouldve imagined Edge would become the companys top heel but he surprised me. And I believe that if Creative could just get its act together and improve how it builds up characters anyone like Dean or Finn or Sami could achieve a similar career transformation. They may not become epictier superstars but so long as I and millions of other viewers can get invested in them thats victory enough.Edit I should probably note that I became a fan sometime after Wrestlemania  and thus dont have the same investmenthero worship in Lesnar or the Attitude Era as a lot of other fans do.,WredditCountryClub,d7rcx1x,7,t5_3c7jw

9847259,0,t3_5gceqh,gt The most popular example is Reigns as people enjoyed his work when he was in the Shield but then when he won the Rumble in  fans seem to have turned on him booing him etcI have to slightly disagree with this from my own point of view anyway. When The Shield were still together I would talk about Reigns and how he would be the future of the WWE the real breakout star from The Shield because of his looklineage etc. I think the problem was how the WWE forced him in to a top position. The Shield split and hes thrust in to the number  slot. If he put in another good show at the Rumble but didnt win then went on to win the IC or US title and have a good run with that and organically climbed up the ladder then I think most wouldnt have a problem with his push. Instead the WWE just expected people to accept him as a top guy at a time when Daniel Bryan was walking on water. ,WredditCountryClub,dar4coz,4,t5_3c7jw

10232582,0,t3_5mipoo,Personally I recommend just watching a few different matches on the WK card and seeing if there are any guys you get behind.Its a different style of wrestling to be sure but Ive found that one can usually find a wrestler or two they enjoy in any promotion if you look a lil bit.Edit to elaborate a little more. One of my favourite NJPW guys is Togi Makabe mostly because his character is essentially a massive fanboy of Bruiser Brody who just happens to be a massive badass in the ring. As a big fan of Brody this appeals to me plus Makabes stiff hoss style is pretty appealing to me. If youre into flippy shit brawling technical wrassling or tag teams theres a good chance you can find someone who fits your niche with a bit of a twist compared to what you might be used to in WWE in NJPW which I find is a pretty nice change of pace after watching mostly WWE stuff.,WredditCountryClub,dc3x5kx,1,t5_3c7jw

Whenever one of these audiences imagine somethings being done solely for the sake of the other audience they feel they are being taken for granted. Furthermore when one of these audiences feels that somethings been created for them and them alone ignoring the other audience they feel resentment of a different kind.What wrestling audiences want is a show that satisfies everyone while seeming to be organic and spontaneous.

I wish Dean would have won tonight but Im not losing faith that he didnt. I know he has the talent to be a main eventer even without the win. Consistent booking is far more important than winning the Rumble out of nowhere.

11029435,0,t1_dehnj9d,I just watched it too. It was my first full length Ricochet match Ive seen some LU highlights and my first time seeing Ospreay at all. It was really very good and one of the best matches Ive seen in a while but it was almost too good. The spots were so fluid at points that they might as well have been wearing tutus with the Nutcracker Suite playing in the background. I love me some flippy shit but my favorite parts were probably Ospreays kicks. They had some crisp impact to them and gave the match some of the grit it needed. The ending sequence with that spinning leg lariat or whatever its called was really good and that springboard cutter that finished it was just lovely.,WredditCountryClub,dei5tj0,2,t5_3c7jw
