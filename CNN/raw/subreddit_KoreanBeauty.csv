954429,0,t1_chcrccv,Im kinda hesitant to buy cosmetic knockoffs. Idk why since Ive seen beautymakeup gurus use them and they seem to be alright Im talking about stuff like Odbos copy of the Naked palette and a new one thats a copy of Too Faceds Return of Sexy and Sivannas OCC Lip Tar copy in the exact same packaging. I know not all makeup knockoffs are created equally and some actually are pretty decent like the palettes I mentioned but idk shrug. I was just choosing between the Etude House Minnie red lipstick and CE lipstick in Double Shot earlier. I think Im going for the Minnie lipstick lol. My boyfriend introduced me to a local KoreanJapaneseWestern beauty shopping site funny right because he was looking for skincare for himself and his mom and well there goes the spending ban...Hong Kong has a bunch of Stylenanda stores too! ,KoreanBeauty,chcrz4n,1,t5_31f0i
1238409,0,t1_ci8l8x6,i am still impressed with his lip stick application! But the eyeliner oh man it was so funny when he drew on my eyeball!yeah me too I am glad he joins me in on these weird cosmetic experiments!,KoreanBeauty,ci8xr4m,3,t5_31f0i
1522300,0,t1_cj6lih1,I use this reasoning when I explain to my husband why I need to buy things from Korea. It is seriously much cheaper and the quality is better. I tried to find American equivalents but they can sometimes be triple the price. I also used COSdna and went through all of my US made products. One of them actually contained a form of formaldahyde. Ordering from Korea is not the most convenient since it takes so long but it costs less and I dont mind waiting if it means my skin is manageable. I admit I also love getting packages. ,KoreanBeauty,cj73itf,1,t5_31f0i
2071137,0,t1_cl32mni,Matte? Oh no  Is it the BCDation All Master? I think thats the new one that comes in only one color. Oh well. I was choosing between that and some Innisfree Smart Foundations planning to use a little Perfect Cover with Super Moisture. Im not completely sold on cushion formulas yet for some reason.,KoreanBeauty,cl3357n,1,t5_31f0i
2255644,0,t3_2l1913,Are you completely revamping your entire collection? Or is this just backups andor things you need want to try? I also bought a bunch of Mizon Snail and am absolutely loving it!

5759649,0,t3_3r49st,I think any kind of exfoliator that increases skin cell turnover can help. So maybe some AHA or BHA?,KoreanBeauty,cxb1ee6,1,t5_31f0i
6027874,0,t3_3y1fri, have swatches for makeup items and have them ACTUALLY look like the products instead of some photoshopped item and preferably with different skin tones have english ingredients and detailed descriptions  have some kind of system in place such as jolses review for credit system to encourage user reviews have a guarantee of processing taking less than a week have customer service people who actually speak English and will actually respond AND actually knows about the products ie knows how long the container is knows the differences between different versions of similar product in the store  pay by weight or include the cost in the item itself dont have a flat rate shipping this one is a personal preference feel free to ignore  please charge in won. PLEASE. Charging any other currency means that theyll have to charge for the conversion fee from won to whatever that currency is then charge to the conversion fee to the customers currency. Im Canadian and if Im charged usd Im stuck paying something like  extra for all the conversion fees.  make sure the search function works and preferably make keywords work. For instance let the phrases red lipstick or brightening emulsion bring up specific products. ,KoreanBeauty,cy9rwms,6,t5_31f0i
7668063,0,t3_4kbv2x,If you want to lighten excess pigment look for the following actives not necessarily all in the same product but the more of them you have in your routine in the correct concentrations the better a chance youll stand Niacinamide ideally at  and combined with Nacetylglucosamine but I havent really seen that combo in many products high niacinamide is fine Lascorbic acid vitamin C  at a pH below  like OST C or C AHA like glycolic acid or lactic acid  pH below  Retinol or other retinoids if going OTC then brands like Make Up Artists Choice MUAC or Paulas Choice have good retinol options with disclosed percents drugstore stuff like ROC and Neutrogena tend not to have much and dont disclose their concentrations Arbutin tranexamic acid kojic acid and licorice root extract are all helpful but I wouldnt use them as frontline whitening agents as they arent as powerful Strong strong sunscreen for any areas that ever get exposed to the sun,KoreanBeauty,d3dtcm6,8,t5_31f0i
7939283,0,t3_4eeiur,Please patch test the Mizon Ampoule! I had a great routine going but stupidly decided to change it up and this product really damaged my face I would walk into work with an incredibly swollen and puffy face. ,KoreanBeauty,d48g7s1,1,t5_31f0i

9103657,0,t3_53ycel,My skin is also combination. It is also sensitive. I would say what keeps or helps keep my skin more matte is the nots  remedy balancing toner as well as the ahabha clarifying treatment toner by cosrx a quite good whitening essence Im using these days myconos and pure block spf by apieu. There is also a very hydrating cream that doesnt make my face shine its Previse  and of course my blue powder pack by eclips that bet has a shade that is not the typical clear one I just love it and it takes care if this issue very very well. Benton snail bee essence plus the steam cream are great too they make my skin look less shinny especially the steam cream which in the beginning looks so shinny but a couple of minutes and... voila! Its really matte in the end. Hope this helps,KoreanBeauty,d8643co,1,t5_31f0i
10044178,0,t1_db31rsz,I havent heard much about this brand. Try a local store in case its not for her skin type. You can buy her a basic whitening set or a moisturizing night sleeping pack. Face shop is pretty general and good. Like my friends and I receive face shop sets from each other and we dont complain because it just works generally across.If at all buy her some sheet masks like a pack of  or so and shell enjoy it.,KoreanBeauty,dbgs632,1,t5_31f0i
11085851,0,t3_5xldsb,I started on reading out kblogs and going to Asian beauty section here on reddit. I think its better to do your research first before splurging yourself on products which what i did at first and ended up buying stuff that werent good for my skin. I would recommend reading blogs from fiftyshadesofsnail and Snow White and Asian pear. I also bought the book from solo glam by charlotte regarding bout Korean skin care. Its really a good book for beginners and quite entertaining. Good luck on your search! ,KoreanBeauty,deokkwd,3,t5_31f0i
11218723,0,t1_df38mca,The masks I do twice a week. I do the routine morning and night. I only use the sunscreen in the morning and mostly only use the zero purity for before bed. I dont double cleanse when I wake up.,KoreanBeauty,df3mmor,2,t5_31f0i
