4652237,0,t1_ctdv5q2,Yeah I think Id go for this solution as well. Id be stressed to hell if I had to do melee fighting or raids all of my practical realworld skills are actually in farming foraging and very basic medicine so Id focus on taking care of the group in exchange for them keeping me alive.  If I didnt have a group Id go as remote as possible avoiding others at all cost. Fullon hermit mode.  ,INFJplay,ctgz4ar,2,t5_374rg
