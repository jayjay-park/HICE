168298,0,t3_1w0o2w,BAF is wonky. Most do but some dont.  Im not even sure where this whole no baf thing started probably by people who dont understand how baf works because some mobs dont baf by nature and others dont unless you are in a group.Quests are generally working but a decent bit are in Frenchat least on Hib.  Some abilities and damage feel like they need to be tweaked but are for the most part seems fine.  Many caster mobs dont cast or they do cast and hit you them once and they will immediately just try to melee you till one of you dies. This is especially true of caster keep guards whom you can just hit once and if they are on a wall they will just stand in place with their staff out. But this is a common problem with private servers so its not a big deal to me personally. It may get fixed down the road.  Mobs dont have pathing and ignore collision again a common private server problem.   Hib dragon seems to be mostly working fine hes kind of buggy but mostly does everything he should.I wouldnt know much about Uthgard drops to compare them to Origins so I cant comment on that but seems to be mostly ok.Lag and loading is a big problem right now especially in rvr. Lag is absolutely horrendous in rvr but new hardware the devs ordered that should arrive in a few days should fix that.All in all the server is going through growing pains that all servers go through. Theyre pretty damn annoying but its nothing I havent seen in other servers.  I dont really know much about Uthgard to compare the two as I didnt play it very much due to frankly the devs and GMs being shit.I have played on a fuckton of private servers for various games over the years and have only donated to about four of them and all of them I didnt donate until I played on it for several weeks. In Origins case I donated after three days.,daoc,cexlp0t,3,t5_2r616
269092,0,t1_cf8kldk,I agree  I think because DAoC pretty much revolutionized MMO PvP with the RvR system at least in my mind it was the most fun I had  but for most players that is end game. You grind to  then you gear for RvR but when you gear for RvR you can also end game PvE raid if you have to or want to.Versus WoW for example which I currently play if I end game geared for PvP and then tried to end game raid people would lose their shit that Im PvP geared. I think that it is the basis of the mechanics of the game or maybe my personal preference.,daoc,cf8ngvz,3,t5_2r616
398718,0,t1_cfknfag,Genesis is fantastic. Unstable at times. Not without serious issues. But its free DAoC with a big population relatively speaking. Anyone interested in need of a guild on Genesis check out Clan Oaksworn.oaksworn.guildlaunch.com,daoc,cfm3col,1,t5_2r616

6163269,0,t3_3zy5ll,You might like lethantis free shard. Pre toa  daoc with new frontier ras. Multi boxing is banned. Its Mordred like with just the frontiers and pvp at lvl . You can have a buff bot in pve but if you are attacked pvp wise you have to eat the loss youll get banned otherwise.
