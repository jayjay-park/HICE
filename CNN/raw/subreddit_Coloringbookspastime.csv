6775725,0,t3_473yfa,I colour with Prismacolors.  I put a sheet of wax palette paper behind the page Im working on.  I just make the choice which page I want to colour more.   Sometimes that leads to tough choices in a nice book.  So that scan trick is pretty clever.,Coloringbookspastime,d0kb8lx,1,t5_38poi
