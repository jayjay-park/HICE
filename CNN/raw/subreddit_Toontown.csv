1337026,0,t1_cijw2tb,I have a few tips if you want to play TTI. I recommend that you use a VM or Virtual Machine which essentially prevents any form of malware to actually access your real install of your operating system.

1514739,0,t3_2bk8bj,First of all I have to admit I may be a bit biased as Im someone without a beta key but I think its a fair trade off between being able to play and having to restart.

Also I think itll be much more fun with toons all playing together at the start. And game so far is just supposed to be a test.,Toontown,cj65dt0,25,t5_2sgii

1525099,0,t1_cj7ew9p,It kept saying my computer needed to update and it would do it automatically without my say so. Then it would restart and go to a black screen with the mouse and no log on screen. I would turn it off and try to start it up again and it asked me if I wanted to start the computer normally or in safe mode. I would try normally and get the black screen with the mouse again so I would turn it off and on again and then try safe mode to revert my computer to an older version. Once I did that my computer would start up and say I was connected to the internet but nothing that used the internet would work. Then after a few days the update would appear and reset my computer again. Going into the computer settings to turn off auto updating wouldnt work either because the update settings window was all messed up and had weird text and the buttons werent pressable. This process happened a bunch of times and I tried many things to stop it including windows support helping me but finally nothing worked and I had to lose everything.,Toontown,cj7g57z,1,t5_2sgii

2562823,0,t3_2p3j18,Here is my opinion in order of most useful to least.  Of course everyone has different playing styles and preferences so this is not a definitive guide.Throw is the only clear winner IMO for the bonus damage.  You can single handed take out a lured lvl  an unlured lvl  and an unlured lvl  with a cream pie.Lure is my nd choice simply because often when you lure it can have devastating consequences when it misses.  Organic lure turns it into a medium accuracy which can be super helpful.Organic trap and drop I would say are about equal in terms of usefulness.  The TNT and piano can still only  shot a lvl  just like nonorganic.  You do however have easier access to railroad and toontanic as they are often the hardest lvl  gag to earn back.  Additionally you can destroy a lvl  cog with an organic piano with just  sound and an organic railroad will destroy a lvl  by itself.Sound can be very useful if combined with other toons carrying organic sound.  I would rank much higher except for the simple fact that most toons do not have it organic thus making it useless in most situations.  For a detailed explanation of its uses see Necromonis and Arctils comments.Squirt is not very useful as organic cloud is no more powerful than a normal cake.  A cloud can destroy a lvl  unlured and a lvl  lured.  I find it less attractive than throw since non organic cake can destroy the same levels and typically cogs are lured so the increased accuracy is not worth the reduced damage.Toonup I see very little advantage to it.  Juggling is normally way more than plenty and high dive is kinda a joke.  I think I may have used it once legitimately and not as a joke.Me personally my main toon went with organic lure and my second organic throw.  Primarily because my nd is lureless so I rely on my mains lure when I am duoing.edited to factor in other peoples additional information and thoughts,Toontown,cmt3kdd,6,t5_2sgii

If thats the case simply do everything you want to do. If you make a new toon after that hopefully you enjoy yourself. If thats the end of your TTR experience youve at least done everything you really wanted to do.I for one incredibly enjoy the grinding. Ive maxed one toon in all three suits a second toon in sell alone and Im working on maxing a third toon in sell solely through solo factories. While I may be an isolated case if you remove the grinding you remove my ability to enjoy a very large portion of the game. For those who do not want a maxed toon there is the option to not become one. If this change was implemented however there would be no choice but for me and many others to play a simplified and shortened game.,Toontown,cnm67dc,1,t5_2sgii

Besides were talking about a situation where the extra rounds actually matter.Though I do agree that this guide as a whole is too generalized. What if I only want sound exp and have enough health to sound through the th floor? What if Im not training in a duo? Why would I bring anything but the most trap I can hold if Im training trap? Why is there no drop section? Its the exact same as any other gag. Why would I save toonup? Obviously its unimportant if you care more about other types gag exp but if youre almost entirely a supporting toon and dont have max toonup why wouldnt you toonup liberally?,Toontown,coc1x10,1,t5_2sgii

3096213,0,t3_2vlu13,Option  Go when youre lowThis is a good way to get really frustrated and please do not blame or get mad at high toons for not taking you. Its important to stock your gags right. Do not stock drop at all do not stock lure unless its at least level  stock extra toon up and throw stock less sound and squirt. Try to have level  throw because having  whole creams can mean life or death in a bad split. You will be sitting there for awhile to get invited to a group. Do not beg or mention you had high toons in TTO it will put people off from inviting you.Option  Go when youre higherAround  laff it starts to get easier. Having maxed sound and throw basically guarantee you getting in without much trouble. Having level  lure maxed droptrap or level  toon up helps too. You can survive a lure miss and bad split much easier. ,Toontown,coix6zd,2,t5_2sgii

You get the tasks for your Cashbot suit when youre working in Donalds Dreamland and Lawbot and Bossbot after youve finished Dreamland.When you get your disguise you can go into the lobby in Sellbot HQ its the tower in the main area with the pit with the four sets of doors.  There youll be wearing your cog disguise a cog suit with your silly toon head where the cogs head should be.  If you want to fight the Sellbot VP youll have to find a group preferably of eight people.  If you have lower than optimal laff and gags you will probably have a hard time getting people to invite you to their groups.  You can either use the boarding group system like used for the factory or get on the elevator at the far side of the lobby.Before youre ready to fight youll need to get merits by defeating Sellbots.  Its only  when you first get your suit but it goes up every time you defeat a VP.  You start out as a Cold Caller level  but go up one level every time you defeat a VP.  Once youve defeated five VPs as a Cold Caller youll be promoted to Telemarketer and so on.,Toontown,conmwjj,1,t5_2sgii

3477247,0,t3_302iyh,I think its selfish to tell others what to do because their choice may mildly inconvenience you.  If people feel uncomfortable with upset or harassed by the things that people say to them in SC or if they dont like being dragged into small talk with random people or whatever other reason they may have to disable it then that should be their choice.  Its a video game that people play for fun so they should be able to play in the way thats most fun for them.I personally will likely make more use of the ignore button than disabling SC but if some people want it disabled then good for them.  Im glad TTR has taken the steps so there are options for everyone.By the way almost none of the behavior Ive seen or seen people complain about is in Vibrant Valley.

But what if you run out of your cute little sound and cant restock it? What if youre with a soundless toon? If people dont know basic lure strategies then they can easily go sad unless they leave like a coward or use rewards. You would be surprised about how little some toons know about basic strategies because THEY ONLY USE SOUND.

It might be the same for golf coursesI havent done enough yet to be sure.I always hated Nutty River and I think preventing it from happening again is the best thing for the game so I support this.

4386667,0,t1_csj5tyi,Theres no dedication towards any group of fans however. Theres no reward system for coming and no punishment for people who couldnt come. An accessory for your Toon when you visit OMG!Con is no more special than say a cape for your Minecraft avatar when you visit MineCon.I dont know why people throw a bit of a fuss about exclusive items as if equality and fairness have to be exercised amongst it. The very definition of exclusive is restricted or limited to the person group or area concerned. It doesnt mention anything about trying to give everyone something of similar nature.It will probably help those who are to sore to not think of it as rewarding players for coming because that brings out a bad mindset. Think of it as a souvenir. Should Minecraft not give players a souvenir in the form of a cape to players who attended MineCon? Should Disney not offer souvenirs in many forms whether it be TShirts plushes etc. at their amusement parks because some people simply cant afford to go and therefore wouldnt be fair? Of course not as its simply a cool way to remember their experience and if someone else sees the souvenir it shouldnt fill someone with jealousy but just an oh cool!. Point is exclusive items are not a new thing in the gaming world and the amount of feedback against them is honestly shocking to me especially considering Ive really only seen this kind of displeasure of exclusive items when it comes to Toontown... not any other game or company. We hear you when you say youd like a different setup for items or better items altogether but the exclusive nature of these items is something that is not going to change. If they are changed they wont be called exclusive.,Toontown,csk440s,1,t5_2sgii

4456699,0,t3_3c4yap, We no longer offer support over IRC for three reasons Its an unfair advantage to those who emailed support. Live support is well live. It often takes priority and when a lot of people use it it often can take up the time that could be used on other people who have sent in an email and have been waiting days. As IRC support is live that often demands quick responses and timely outcomes when sometimes thats not an option. When we receive an email we usually like to take time to investigate the issue so nothing is rushed and we have a chance to weigh in with others if need be. Queries made over IRC are hard to track. If you talk to another person later and say Yeah I talked to another person about this blah blah... well have no idea what youre talking about or how much of the issue was already resolved what the other person knows etc. With emails we can leave messages for other moderaters and its easy for anybody to see what was said and assist the other staff member if needed.Although I cant offer support right here you can PM me your support ticket number and Ill see what I can do.

5344835,0,t1_cvuv0m8,Ive come to that conclusion as well so it could be. Its so  petty. Like an ex girlboy friend going through there exs profile and commenting something really passive aggressive on each post.  The reason I complain is because its getting to a point were  percent of the posts I make are downvoted. Even the ones I make sure to not be hostile and be extremely polite are getting downvoted. It really irks me. But what else do you expect given as shown most of the people only play one game so they lack knowledge of how other successful games are run. I play alot of games and Im accepting of the fact that I may play to many Id never consider them my life. The only reason I play them is probably because when I was five or  somebody decided to get me a Gameboy or something and I got hooked. Its just a hobby honestly although now I am learning how to code because of it. Im very grateful for being able to play games. Toontown has a special place in my heart and childhood. But Im not nostalgia blind either. I admit this game has had its better days and this community has hit the fan. I mean honestly were talking about the same community that has gotten the police called on joey for murdering his whole family real mature guys otaku swatted twice how does it happen twice?! Gotten multiple people doxed and probably part of there lives they wanted secret revealed and I cant even begin to mention the amount of people who are so dumb it makes me wonder how they properly operate a computer. I know I probably wont be on this sub forever and Ill move on from this game one day I actually dont play it that often atm but right now I think people really need to realize that this game isnt perfect and this community is quite the opposite of perfect. This post will probably get downvoted by some fanboy for being against the whole ttr message of what are you talking about toontown is as great as ever except for all other servers I just want the game back not a soap opera on why I shouldnt play x server and only play y server. ,Toontown,cvuv2b0,4,t5_2sgii

5451345,0,t1_cw8dk1n,gt I would like to see anything on the scale of toonfest or bbhqYou are right there has not been an event thats equal to toonfest yet. However I can say that bbhq remodeling is on the same level as the redone cfo fight. Its debatable on which is better then the other. Its not like Im saying something small like the color wheel is up to participate on bbhq remodeling. Yes bbhq may have taken more d models and resign of the area however the none of the game play for bbhq was altered. I mean I understand why given ttr has a team mostly made up of d modelers. I can also understand why infinite a team made up of mostly developers would add something to the game play part of the game. Im sure there will at one point be toonfest esq event actually Im fairly certain since they talked about a while back there will be an invasion type event for the coming of open beta however its clear that infinite favors small tweaks and ways to make the game more friendly and modern over limited time events. gt time span between disney and similar releases.Its true that ttr did remodel bbhq faster the disney  made bbhq it should be noted that remodeling the hub of bbhq and creating the whole thing from scratch are very diffrent. They also had to deal with using lesser technology. I mean if I make a rom hack of super mario world when its released adding in a whole new world itd seem pretty impressive right? But if I did the same thing  years later not so much anymore.

5935660,0,t3_3wo9in,Thats a really tough decision!To be honest both of those graphics cards arent very good. The Intel one is integrated but since Toontown was made to run on Windows  it should be able to handle it. That said the R is built more for graphics.A th Gen i is a super good CPU though Skylake is starting to show itself off. Not to say the A is worse but the i is more modern.So basically if you want everything to load faster and have a much better experience go with the Intel. If you need the most you can get out of gaming go for the AMD. Personally Id go with the Intel though since the CPU is awesome and  can probably handle multiple TTRs fine.,Toontown,cxxp26p,3,t5_2sgii

6419175,0,t3_43m3lp,I think this is a glitch that is similar to the one you encountered but on toontown online In case you didnt watch the previous video to go along with the one linked a toon either died or disconnected as the other toons including epic frizzy joined the battle and then destroyed the cogs. I think the game got confused in this instance because it thought that no toon should be there anymore after they died so the cog should have been their either until the other toons joined and the cog was counted as being there and not there at the same time. A scripting error but I wouldnt be surprised if this glitch is in rewritten as well as there are similar bugs in TTR to the ones in TTO. Did someone disconnect or die in that building that would have caused this glitch. If so this scripting error might be the cause of this mistake. However either way you have to disconnect so tough luck and I wish you the best with your other buildings.,Toontown,czja279,1,t5_2sgii

6547911,0,t3_457hkd,Work on the game has been very slow to nothing since the beginning of this year. We were tired out from all the work and attention that had to go into the game while it was live and we want to rest right now. I have been thinking a lot about where the game is going to go and Im not too sure. The problem with the game is that nothing was really planned out as I only started making the game to learn how to make a multiplayer game and just added random stuff as I continued to learn. Adding in a plot and making quests were just attempts at making the game make sense but it didnt seem to work out. Also the minigames are strange and Im not sure if theyre that fun. It seems best to start over with a fresh new ideagame and actually plan the game out.,Toontown,czwlvqn,1,t5_2sgii

7270147,1,t1_d24j5v6,I wish I could gold you for this.I  back everything you said about Toontown Rewritten. They did a pretty great thing by making the game playable to the public again. However during the process they had a good amount of the work handed to them which is why Im not comfortable with them claiming they made the game. On the game side of things the AI code and obviously the client code for most of the game was readily available in old TTO clients dating back to . Sure the files needed some tweaking to work with Astron and newer public builds of PandaD but its not like it was backbreaking work like having to write every single AI from scratch Heres looking at you TLOPO. I would like to applaud the Toontown Rewritten team for making Astron however. They definitely deserve praise for that.In regards to the advancements on Cog Invasion Online Im thrilled that you guys are taking the time and putting in the effort to improve the game.

10011434,0,t3_5j16j9,Being trolled is not fun for the people being trolled.  It wastes a lot of your time and is really frustrating.  I actually was trolled by Coach Zs Evil Twin once but even if I hadnt been I wouldnt think it was funny.  When he did his Running from the Law series offices were hard to get through due to glitchescrashing so I was already exhausted of doing and redoing offices without having someone troll and waste an hour of my time in one of them.If youre a fan of his maybe you know his techniques but hes subtle enough at trolling that its not obvious to the average player.  When I was in the D Office with him he didnt even start trolling until the third or fourth floor and then he was tripping the puzzles on purpose and blaming it on other people making weird gag choices and saying oops etc.  Near the end he tried to green me so I left but if Id stayed hed have succeeded in greening me.  For some reason his fans say he isnt a greener?  He is. Until then I wasnt  sure who even was the troll the other two in the office with me werent the best players and were making some weird choices too.I didnt know who he was until he posted the video and suddenly I had random people whispering to me that they had seen me on coach zz evil twin.  After that I figured out his tactics and exactly what he had been doing so Id know what to expect if I saw him again. The bottom line for me is that he is just a cowardly bully who doesnt have the guts to even bully people facetoface so he bullies them in a childrens game.,Toontown,dbcioh1,12,t5_2sgii

10070956,0,t1_dbk8w5i,Hey Otaku!I actually had already finished shipping the box before I got this but Id be happy to write out a note and mail it to you!This will actually help a lot with the move! The shipping for my desktop alone ended up being around  and Im sure gas for the trip home is going to be a killer. Los Angeles to Connecticut... I actually checked this subreddit as a last minute thought. When I was here a few years ago there wasnt a whole lot of traffic so I was expecting even less now. I definitely wasnt expecting such revived interest in Toontown! This has been a great surprise. I want to see if I can get a bunch of the people from the old Toontown team to hop in and say hello if thats something you think people would be interested in. I still keep in touch with most of the Toon Troopers and Resistance Rangers. I found a Toontown lanyard as well so I threw that in for free. I also didnt have a lot of packing material to stuff the box with so I stuffed it with limited edition League of Legends Tshirts. Not sure if you or anyone you know is into LoL or Riot Games but if so these  are from the  World Championships and not available anymore. Im really happy I was able to find someone who these items will mean something to. I originally moved out to California with enough money for three months rent and no job lined up. I got the job at Disney Interactive right at the end of the third month and its the entire reason I was able to stay and to meet so many amazing people and ultimately what got me into the video game industry which Im in to this day. I owe a lot to Disney and to Toontown and while I hate having to part with these items they couldnt be going to a better owner!Thanks again!,Toontown,dbk9nvh,3,t5_2sgii

McQuack and Sir Max are both considered storyline toons cause they were used a lot on the blog posts since alpha so it was decided to keep them that way. Sir Max is also maxed. They are mainly logging into them because players are very excited to see them so its a good way to communicate with the players. But when you talk to sir max you will most likely meet sir maxs personality and not much of joeys personality.Yes it was joeys toon on TTO but on TTR because it was kinda converted into a storyline toon so he now has new and anonymous personal toons.,Toontown,dbqt0dq,2,t5_2sgii
