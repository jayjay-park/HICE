Ive gotten as much as about  hours without having to get into any battery saving tricks aside from screen set at about half NFC off everything else on and as much disabled without root as possible. So point is memory doesnt seem to have any battery impact I wouldnt ever expect it to have much at all anyway.The memory management becomes obvious if you have maybe  apps open if any kind and are flipping between them. Things like losing your place in a scrolled list Web pages reloading etc. I think its a problem thats a little overblown because I suspect most users wont notice in most situations... but its definitely there and its definitely annoying when it happens Google Note  memory management and you can find videos of people demonstrating it thatll help decide if itll be an issue for you. ,galaxynote5,cv2w9pc,1,t5_2ygpt

6300357,0,t1_cz5rtuz,Thats the thing Im pretty good to my phones. It went into an otterbox on day one and stays there I keep it clean dont drop or throw it the only real thing Id say thats happened is it got frozen once but I dont know whyhow that would affect only the wifi since I did buy a new battery for it less than  months ago no change in battery life. Its weird Ive read there can be glitches in the OS in terms of wifi but no idea how to fix it. At this point I dont even really care anymore. How good is the battery on your phone?

6356376,0,t3_42fcu8, Mine hasnt frozen yet. Better it feels easier to write with. Worlds ahead. Works like the iphones much more accurate and no more stupid swiping. Its actually glass with aluminum sides. Definitely buy a case the glass is fragile and the aluminum sides will get scuffed from drops. Id recommend Casemate or Ringke fusion if you want a clear one to show off the gold. It feels great to hold Samsung kept the screen the same size as the note s but made it just a bit taller amp slimmer which makes it a bit more pocketable as well. Camera quality is phenomenal. Screenoff memos are really convenient. The wireless charging rocks amp battery life is amazing. Its overall a really great phone.  I sometimes miss the IR blaster amp SD card but the advantages far outweigh the few things its missing.,galaxynote5,czc5etu,1,t5_2ygpt

I bought an ATampT Note  instead of an internationalunlocked Note  because the latter doesnt have Samsung Pay which was a major deciding factor in getting the phone. Unless the Note  intl supports it Id be stuck with the ATampT one again.  Even if I went with an internationalunlocked version Samsung does what two updates for a flagship and then calls it quits? Im not keen on paying  for a phone for it to be abandoned in two years anymore. Yep I could buy a rootable model and update it after its abandoned but why in the world should that be my only recourse?I still like Android and Ill still keep using Android tablets but unless something major changes I dont think it fits for me on a phone anymore. ,galaxynote5,d2qyo6a,1,t5_2ygpt
