93406,0,t1_ceobmlf,First off thank you for the kind words. Especially when talking political theory with people its very much appreciated. It is true that a more Decentralized system probably wouldnt address the problem of Corporate Corruption especially in regard to Lobbying very directly to use a word After all you can still practically buy votes of the representatives in power as long as you have enough money and the legal will to do so. Its just much less of a risk if you dont have one man running the show Its harder to convince multiple groups of people with conflicting interests rather then  man with  belief that has a lot more power. However the existence of central power As proven by history has a number of downsides besides corruption including the opression of the populace and the nationalization of the economy Which again history has proven to be a flawed concept in practice. Again ill point to the Roman Empire Because they had central power it opened the door for widespread corruption and the implimentation of a dictatorship eventually causing the empire to fall by sheer corruption and power struggles. However had that central power never existed then Caesar wouldnt have had any central power to seize he may claim himself emperor but without a beurocratic system establishing such and said system granting him any power over the rest of the people then his claims would have been a moot argument. Bringing us back on topic a lot of these problems in essence boils down to the endorsement of campaigns and bills to help a corporate entity or any other organization with power impose their agenda such as with Lobbying. Often bills end up representing the will of whoever has the most money rather then the will of the people Thus a more Direct approach to solving this issue would be simply to ban the use of lobbying and instead only have the funding for campaigns come from direct contribution or donation like a Nonprofit. The reason I dont really fully endorse this strategy in my main article is that well the United States is a very corporate country. One of the only things thats keeping our rapidlydeflating economy afloat is a lot of large businesses and banks being headquartered in the US or using US Dollars Such as with the majority of the worlds oil being traded exclusivley in US dollars. Removing what they may percieve as the corporations right to Speak in government may anger a lot of people and convince them to begin more operations abroad rather then domestically. With the United States in its current financial condition this is not a very viable option. But again its an option.Yes it is true a lot of the American Public simply isnt interested in politics As is the case in a lot of other countries ive heard about and looked into. To many especially in the USA the government is so Distant from the people that many have simply lost interest in participating in something that for them rarely affects their daily lives in any major way. As you mentioned they have mouths to feed and TV subscriptions to pay for and this takes up a majority of their time and interest nowadays. Thats why a lot of my idea if it works out will be Direct Democracy convince people that yes the government does affect their lives and yes they should be concerned and interested in matters of state while at the same time restricting the government in size and the rule of law. An overexpanded buracracychoked system such as is in place at present is proven by history to be impossible to sustain. Yes its unrealistic but its hopeful. Sometimes thats all you need.The restriction of Government and the decentralization of power As to prevent Corruption are both key components of my idea. I believe it would address the first two As well as the third that you mentioned by making the government more active with the people Direct democracy while also limiting the power of government itself preventing Corruption while giving people a voice. As I said earlier corporate involvement in Government is a cause for a lot of the USAs corruption now Lobbying Basically Bribery which flies in the face of the core of the democratic system but the removal of such corruption is at the present largely infeasable. Its not a bad thing either With an economy and country like the United States the corporate say in the Government should play at least a minor role in determining the future of the United Statess foreign and trading policy As well as other such things. Trade and economic activity are very important to the United States and the Corporations are the people who largely make that happen nowadays. bThe problem is in the execution.b With a system like we have now yes it gives the Market a say but in such a way that it causes the prevention of what democracy itself is supposed to do represent the people. As you mentioned earlier in your post with Initiative  with Lobbying making that possible you have the corporations rejecting a bill for the ibetterment of the peoplei simply for sake of profit. In this case its gone too far. What we need is a new system that allows for a minor market say in Government while preventing corruption like this to happen that hurts the People. Perhaps the establishment of some sort of Council like Londons council of guilds Or whatever its called or some sort of advisory committee for this purpose. As its late and my brain isnt exactly working as it should I dont have any solid idea on how to fix this yet. But im sure there is one.I understand what you say about Baby steps With politics how it is and voter apathy running rampant having a small party get into power  iand wini and then change the basic political structure of the United States is infeasable Unless you stage a revolution which I iabsolutelyi dont vouch for as such revolutions are always bad for everyone especially the People. Your idea of an Amendment for the Voting rights is definetley a great start and will most likely lead to other changes for the betterment of the people Perhaps even the decentralization of power or the reduction of Corruption if were lucky. The only real way for this idea to be implemented at present is as you said baby steps. One idea will follow the next and the nation will decide for itself whats best for it when the time comes.Sorry for my own text wall I seem to be quite apt to do them without meaning to P. Thanks for sending feedback! Its always appreciated and I like seeing what people think. Yeah the Viability is a problem but anything is possible if you put your mind to it enough. Im sure that this idea will be At the very least more easily implemented and adopted in the future.,reformstorm,cep2bn2,1,t5_2uhlg
