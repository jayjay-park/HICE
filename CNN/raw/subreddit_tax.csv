695689,0,t3_224nh5,IRS employee here First please file your return on time.Send the largest payment you can afford on or before April . Even if its . that will be . paid on time.After the Service processes your return we will send you a notice asking for fullpayment of the remaining tax plus the initial charge of Failure to Pay penalty and interest. If you can fullpay by the notice due date you are done.If you feel you need a little more time to pay we can offer you an extension of time to pay of up to  days. With this arrangement there is no fee and no fixed monthly payment. We calculate the balance due out to  days and during that time you could make one payment or  payments as long as it was paid in full by the agreement date.The next option is a formal Installment Agreement IA. With this plan we establish a minimum monthly payment and a regular monthly due date. With an  balance due the monthly payment could be as low as ..There is a onetime fee to establish an IA of  and you may qualify for a reduced fee of ..Missed payments late payments and payments of less than your minimum can result in a defaulted IA. There is a  fee to reinstate an agreement after it defaults. Another reason for default is a new balance due.You may request a Direct Debit IA also. The fee for this payment plan id . or the . and the payments are debited from a checking account. Another option is a Payroll Deduction IA where your employer makes your monthly payments on your behalf deducted from your net wages. The fee is the  or .The IRS website will allow you to set up these plans once you receive a bill. The upper right section of the notice will have a Caller ID number. You use this number to establish a PIN and then you use the PIN to access the Online Payment Agreement system.If you prefer to speak with a person we are available M  F am  pm. Have your notice or return handy. We will ask you some verification questions and discuss your payment ability. We will ask if you have corrected your W with your employer and we will verify that your current with the last six tax returns. We will also ask you for a contact telephone number which you are not required to provide.After either type of agreement is set up you will receive a letter that confirms the terms within    weeks. If you request a regular or payroll IA you will receive monthly reminder notices with an updated balance a record of your last payment and a voucher to send along with a check or money order. DDIAs do not have reminder notices.Each year you make payments on an IA you will receive an Annual Statement which says THIS IS NOT A BILL. You would not believe how many calls we get in July asking about this bill which is not a bill.Electronic payment options are available on irs.gov. If you prefer electronic payments I recommend EFTPS Credit or debit card service providers generally charge a convenience fee for each transaction.The current interest rate is  per year and the rate can be adjusted quarterly. The Failure to Pay FTP penalty rate is  per month. If you establish a formal IA the FTP rate is reduced to  per month. The FTP is calculated on the unpaid tax and the interest is calculated on the unpaid tax and penalties. Payments you make are applied to the tax first not like a mortgage or car payment. Your payment reduces the tax every month which reduces the accrued penalties and interest for that month.If you choose not to pay your balance due you will receive three notices after the first about five weeks apart each with an updated balance due computation and a new due date. The fourth notice will be sent by certified mail to both you and your spouse. It is unlikely the Service would move forward with enforced collections such as bank or wage levies. If you have an overpayment refund on a future return it would be applied to the balance due first and the Service would send a notice explaining the offset. If your refund is more than what you owe at the time youre done.Thank you for reading.,tax,cgjcoei,11,t5_2quww

Could someone point me toward the necessary reading for these matters? Thanks!Hello Im a U.S. tax attorney and tax return preparer who specializes in U.S. expats.Income from a U.S. company is treated in exactly the same way as income from a Japanese companyit will still be treated as foreign earned income and thus will be excluded to the extent all of your foreign earned income is under  for .  One difference here though is it sounds like you are an employee of the Japanese company but may be treated as an independent contractor with respect to the U.S. company.  If that is the case you will need to pay selfemployment taxes of . on the income from the U.S. company.  So it would be better if you are an employee of the company but theoretically at least they pay you more if you are an independent contractor to cover the increased tax hit.As far as reading materials a number of the articles on my site touch on these issues.

But the assistance she gets does make a difference in whether you are allowed to claim her.Her benefits must be calculated as part of her total support. So if she has only Medicaid and nothing else provided there was no medical catastrophe youre probably okay. If there was a medical catastrophe you need to do the math. If she gets any other aid or any support from anyone else that all matters.  Heres an example for figuring it all outFair market value of her room with kitchen access .Food  you paid  she paid  from an old savings account.Clothing  gifts from friends and family.Transportation  gas her mom paid for.Medical expense  paid by Medicaid.This is oversimplified but in this example you may claim her because you paid  to her support and others paid  so you provided over half of her support. You must provide over half.Also she must have lived with you the entire calendar year. If she moved in on January  you may not claim her. You may not file as Head of Household even if you may legally claim her.

If theyre tools that are required for you to have in order to complete your work on the job and the employer does not reimburse you they may be deductible.     I also mentioned to her that I travel from my office to our remote site from time to time and she said to give me the total mileage. My employer do pay for mileage like  cents per mile. Can I claim it to my tax refund?If you are audited they will require you to have a log showing the mileage with the date starting and ending location along with business purpose.  If you are reimbursed less than the standard mileage rate you may claim the difference per mile.  see below for more on the mileage.    Also at work we wear casual like polo shirt and khaki can I claim that as well since I purchased those clothes myself.No.  Clothing that is adaptable to use outside of work cannot be claimed as a deduction.    In addition at my previous employer I used to travel a lot out of states and I paid for the flight hotel car myself. When I get back to the office I get reimbursed for the money I spend. Can I also file this for my tax refund?This sounds like you are on an accountable plan.  You incur the expense then the employer reimburses you dollar for dollar for what you spent.  Most likely they are paying you back with money that is not included in your taxes accountable plan.  If you were to receive lets say  for the trip without having to include an expense report or receipts and the  is included in your W wages you may claim a deduction for the amount spent on the business portion of the trip.     The only problem that I have would be I do not have the receipts anymore You wouldnt have the receipts if the employer took them under an accountable plan You cannot deduct expenses reimbursed under an accountable plan.    and about the mileage I did not file for reimbursement at my work because of the process it has to take.If expenses are reimbursable by your employer and you do not file for reimbursement you cannot take the deduction.  You get dollar for dollar as a reimbursement when you claim this on your taxes you get a far less  on the dollar if you exceed the  AGI limitation.This is just what the laws say do as you wish with the information. ,tax,cptoxjc,2,t5_2quww

On most game shows people do not have to wager any of their own money to win prizes.  Hence most game shows are not gambling and there is no federal  withholding.  But it is still your responsibility to report prizes on your  and  pay taxes on your prizes despite the lack of withholding.   But the most popular game shows are all filmed in California.  California does impose  withholding on nonresidents who win prizes in California.  So nonresidents of California who win noncash prizes do have to come up with the state withholding before the prize is released.  If they win both cash and noncash the withholding is taken out of the cash first.  Both residents and nonresidents will have to file a California state tax return at the end of the year.

4997904,0,t1_cuo00c0,This from the California Department of Industrial Relations goes through some of the criteria that determine whether or not someone really should be an employee.  A company saying you are does not make you one.  I will say that sometimes it is not worth the fight or that you should put up with it for now but can file a claim later.  But keep in mind that if they are requiring you to do work for what is less than minimum wage then you might want to fight this anyway or find another job first because you are getting royally screwed.  Professional reputation can also be a factor so finding another job might be best.I typically see independent contractors bill their time at a minimum of hr for moderateskill jobs to hr for higher skilled jobs.  You have to mark up your rate to cover the taxes and other costs of employing yourself overhead supplies health insurance.  If you need X amount to meet your costs and live on then you have to factor in the other costs in determining your wage.  this can help you factor in all the costs you will have and how much you want to make before taxes... then use a calculator like this to project your income and deductions for the year to see what your selfemployment and income tax will be and how much cash in your pocket will be left plug in your net income from you independent contractor on Business Income or loss Schedule C amp E subject to selfemployment taxes.Lets say you were an employee hired fulltime making hr had no health benefits no retirement plan contributions no paid time off then it would cost the employer about .hr to employ you.  If you factor in  weeks vacation an individual PPO health plan coverage and a safeharbor k match then their cost to employ you goes up to hr.  That doesnt take into account their costs rising for everyone if you have a workers comp claim or an unemployment claim or overhead for HR .  I also got this newsletter from a labor law attorney that might be helpful.gtThe Economic Realities Testgt Determination whether an employer can properly treat a worker as an Independent Contractor has long required application of the economic realities test. This test asks the following questions about a worker classified as an Independent Contractor Is the work performed by the individual an integral part of the employers business? Does the individuals managerial skill affect his or her opportunity for profit or loss?  How does the workers investment compare with that of the company?  Does the work performed require special skill and initiative?  Is the relationship between the worker and the company permanent or indefinite? What is the nature and degree of the employers control? gtWhat Does the DOL Guidance Add? The DOL guidance memorandum adopts the economic realities test. But the agency makes clear that the test must be applied in the context of the definition from the federal Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA of employ as suffer or to permit to work. An individual who is economically dependent on an employer is suffered or permitted to work by the employer and thus cannot be properly classified as an Independent Contractor emphasis added. In other words only a worker who is financially independent of the employer can properly be classified as an Independent Contractor. In one telling sentence the memorandum says that Only carpenters construction workers electricians and other workers who operate as independent businesses as opposed to being economically dependent on their employer are independent contractors. The guidance also clarifies that work away from the employers premises does not necessarily support Independent Contractor classification since that work can still be integral to the employers business.   They get pretty strict on this.  If you hire a cleaning person to come to you house every Thursday you are almost definitely employing them.  A gardener who comes hires his own people uses his own tools etc does usually qualify as an independent contractor.Having creative freedom may not be enough to make you an independent contractor alone. It really depends on what you do what the company does how much freedom you actually have as to how to work and when to work or even where to do the work.  Even then the economic dependence can come into play.,tax,cuofn2x,1,t5_2quww

5414329,0,t1_cw3d8vq,. A quick google on online taxes shows that there is no consensus yet on how and when such things should be taxed. I think they should be taxed based on where the buyer isthis goes with the idea that whats important is the state of the economy in a particular area. Also it keeps things simple which is very important in large systems.. So theres a Target and a Dollar Store in a low income neighborhood with a low tax rate. And a few blocks away theres a couple of similar stores with a moderate tax rate. People from moderate tax rate area comparison shopsometimes the Dollar Store wins.. Nonpoor people moving to poor areas is a very good thing. As I think I said above gentrification is a double edge sword. No one wants to live in a ghetto. Gawd has not degreed that property taxes go up as property values rise. What if they only went up on very pricey homes etc. in expensive neighborhoods? This creates an incentive for people to moveshop to a more moderately taxed district mixed income neighborhoods are good. Over time there would fewer extremely low or extremely high districts also good. amp . Its less complicated and more flexible which makes it a better tool for regulating the economy.

5678721,0,t3_3sv3fs,You definitely have to file and pay taxes to NY. You may also need to file taxes in VA.ampnbsp The VA angle will depend on something called Domicile.  Any state where you have Domicile gets to tax your income regardless of where it was made but they also have to provide you a tax credit to reduce that tax for any taxes youve also had to pay on that income to any other state.Domicile is the place that is your permanent home. Unfortunately that can be a little tricky to really determine. In your case we would need to know what your intentions are in regards to living in NY not my daughter. If you left VA to go work in NY but with the intention of going back to VA after the job is over then you are probably still considered domiciled in VA. But if you moved from VA to NY and you dont intend on ever moving back to VA then you have given up your VA domicile and established a NY domicile.Determining where you have Domicile usually requires evaluating a lot of different factors and then deciding where you have the most connection. You mention the lease ad the drivers license which are both part of that. Also... do you own any real property and if so where? What is your home like in NY vs VA? Where is your car registered? Do you have a wife and kids and if so where do they live andor go to school? Where does the doctor you normally go to work? When you put your address on an application what address is it? Do you have hunting or fishing licences and if so where? Are you listed in the phone book and if so where? And a lot of other similar questions all trying to determine if you have more connection to NY or to VA or any other place.A tricky little quirk though is once you are domiciled in one place you KEEP that domicile even if you later move and have more connection to another place if the intent of the move is only temporary and you plan to return to the first place later even if it is years later... like going away for college or a job. This is why you need to ask yourself Im I here in NY to stay or will I be going back to VA after this job is over. If your going back after the job is over it doesnt matter if you have more presence in NY right now.,tax,cx1029i,3,t5_2quww

Section   what is gross income   Section   what are business expenses     Theres a lot of general consistency in what are and arent tax deductible expenses for different individuals for example but it may not be obvious just reading IRS publications and form instructions since the organization of reporting requirements varies so greatly business expenses of employees on form  business expenses of sole proprietors on schedule C business expenses of corporations on form  etc..,tax,d0lnn7f,3,t5_2quww

10909797,0,t1_de4zsxp,Im going to disagree with some of the responses. Unless I missed it Im reading on the phone and you seem to have cited just about every publication the service issues it seems as though you are an unmarried occupant of a home you dont own. If that is the case regardless of how much money you gave your girlfriend the house is legally hers. You have no qualified debt and no qualified residence on which to base any deductions. As a result she can allocate the space in the home between business and personal use and apply that proration to her various forms. You are not legally afforded that option even if you paid the mortgage. Now there may be case law that allows this but I would not. Second youre analysis of the qualified debt vs. purchase price is not necessary. Generally that issue arises when a person has a mortgage that exceeds the purchase price of the home. That may be a second mortgage or home equity or whatever. Not an issue in your case. If you wish to take a deduction for your business you would need to make physical rent payments to your girlfriend and she would need to report that as income further complicating this issue. The government doesnt require you to take all the deductions possible those are up to you to decide if the hassle of accounting for and apply to a tax return are advantageous.,tax,de59o3x,1,t5_2quww

In nontaxsheltered investment accounts the individual assets in the account will have a stepup in basis if they would have generated a capital gainloss upon their disposition.gtHow do you determine basis? Is it the date of Dads death?Generally it is the fair market value of the asset on the date of death.gtI recall something about how an executor or a surviving spouse can elect to determine a basis up to six months after death.

This election can be made only if the estate is subject to estate tax and the alternate valuation reduces the size of the gross estate.  Note that this will reduce the basis on average of the assets in the estate.  The main reason to choose the alternate valuation is to reduce estate taxes.,tax,de9q33v,3,t5_2quww
10954808,0,t3_5webde,The traditional IRA allows you to effectively reduce your taxable income by  in any given year by putting it into a retirement brokerage account. You can then pay tax on the money put in and the growth at a later date through either converting it into a Roth IRA or making withdrawals from it in your retirement.The Roth IRA and Trad IRA are mathematically identical assuming tax rates dont change. The Roth locks in todays tax rate the Trad is tax deductible today taxable later. If the tax rate is the same then the outcome is the same.Personally I like the Trad for a number of reasons.Firstly the amount fluctuates and you can game taxes with that. When were near a market peak you can put  in a Trad IRA and get a  tax deduction. If the value of your investment subsequently drops to  entirely possible in an aggressively invested retirement account you can then convert it to a Roth IRA then and only pay tax on the . Or should the market go up significantly simply call your IRA provider before April  and ask them to recategorize your contribution. Theyll let you change it from Trad to Roth as if youd categorized it differently a  months previously. So if the value jumps to  and youre mad that you only got  of deduction then switch it to Roth give the deduction back and now you have  of post tax investments.Secondly the tax rate fluctuates and you can game taxes with that. Your choice isnt just pay taxes today or pay taxes in retirement. You can choose to lock in the tax rate at any point by doing a Trad to Roth conversion. So when you choose Trad youre not just betting that your taxes in retirement will be lower than they are today youre betting that your taxes at least one year in the future will be lower than they are today. Whereas Roth locking in todays tax rates is a bet that this year will be the highest tax rate youll ever experience. Trad seems more likely to me. If youre planning a family if youre expecting at some point your partner may stop working if youre expecting some kind of political swing in the next three decades involving lower income taxes or just planning to retire early Trad is your friend. Roth is a very conservative choice locking in todays tax rate seems remarkably pessimistic to me.Thirdly gaming with your AGI. Although you never lose money through income tax by increasing your income you can still be worse off due to tax credit cutoffs. If you put it all in a Trad IRA at the start of the year then during tax season the next year youll qualify for the most credits. Say youre  under the AGI requirement for the credit youre after. Well now you can call up your IRA provider and say hey please recategorize  of that Trad IRA contribution I made  months ago to Roth. They change it and it is exactly like you knew a year in advance the exact dollar amount youd be taxed on.Roth has an advantage too you can withdraw the principal at any time tax free without penalty but I dont think that is an especially useful advantage for most people. Personally I like Trad by default with situational conversions to Roth. But you know your tax situation better than reddit if your taxes right now are super low  or lower and theyre only going to go up then by all means lock in that  with a Roth. But in most cases Trad gives you flexibility to wait for a better spot to take the taxes.,tax,de9wsdu,1,t5_2quww

It can do selfemployment investments capital gains etc without forcing you to upgrade to more expensive editions.  Not that it doesnt suggest you might want to spend more money.

There is a lot of misinformation and just plain hucksterism on the internet about the alleged advantages.

Generally your tax home is your regular or main place of business or post of duty regardless of where you maintain your family home.

Youre right that if withholding doesnt supply enough taxes during the year there is a chance you get hit with an underpayment penalty so you do need to think about how your new contract gig is going to affect your overall taxes since no withholding is happening. First step I think is to download Form ES which is a booklet with a worksheet in it that helps you determine what your income tax is projected to be for the upcoming year. To fill it out youll need to make some assumptions about how much your income will be at the contract job what your deductible expenses are to find your business profit there. See Schedule C. Youll also need to estimate what your Social Security and Medicare taxes will be related to the contract income. See Schedule SE. You get to deduct  that Schedule SE tax number on  line . After you do some predictions along those lines youll have an idea of what your adjusted gross income will be for  considering all your income streams. Thats line  on the ES worksheet. Working through the worksheet it will tell you what you can expect your tax is. Then you determine what amount the IRS considers a minimum annual payment. Its the smaller of  of  total tax or  of  total tax. Thats the amount that needs to get sent in via withholding and estimated tax payments with the remainder sent in next April. From that required annual amount you would then subtract what you anticipate your W withholding will be at job  and job  which you have to guess based on your current pay stubs and allowances settings. Of course this is adjustable by filling out a new W. What remains gets divided by  and you send that amount in as payments in midApril midJune midSept and midJan.Then in April next year when you know your actual income and expenses your actual W withholding you find what your real tax is and you get credit on  line  for the estimated payments you made and figure out whether you still owe a little or are owed a refund if you overpaid.Because you have a W job you could also go through the ES worksheet to figure out what your tax liability will be and then you could ADJUST your W at job  and job  to force that much tax to be taken out via withholding. See Publication  for tables of how changing your allowances number increases how much is taken out and use line  to have extra taken out of paychecks. If you do that then you wouldnt need to do estimated tax payments. Either way you approach this youre going to want to estimate your income and your income tax. Side note The reason your job  is always undertaxed is you probably used wrong allowances number on the W for that job. When you have more than one W job you need to consider the incomes together to determine an allowances number then split that across your Ws. See W page  multiple jobs worksheet. You dont have to change that job  W you could instead just alter your job  W.,tax,dgrva1j,2,t5_2quww
