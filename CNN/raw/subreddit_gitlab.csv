Look at some samples you will get it its pretty easy once you get the hang of it.I am currently on my mobile so I wont be able to provide you code samples I will update my comment as soon as possible. For docker image what base package or image are you using?,gitlab,dcus6wo,3,t5_2zjmj

Every day has the same light blue colour even though one day I made  contributions and  on the next day. I was under the impression that the day with the highest number of contributions would have a darker colour.,gitlab,de3xz23,1,t5_2zjmj
