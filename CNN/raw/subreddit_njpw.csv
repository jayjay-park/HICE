6180847,0,t3_4061zc,Here is my thought process. First lets think longterm. Who are the guys that should be in the title pictures for each respective belt?Heavyweight Okada Naito Goto IbushiObviously Okada is going to be a player here probably all year or close to it. Now who else is going to be in this picture? Im going to say Naito is the ultimate goal. Now they cant do that now but ultimately OkadaNaito should be the end goal so keep them apart for now. Goto is the challenger short term but hes going to lose. Goto is the guy you can throw just about anywhere and it will be credible. Hes not gonna win but it will be credible and work. The other person that should be in the Heavyweight picture is Ibushi upon return. No more fuckin around with Ibushi. Fuckin push him.IC Title Kenny Omega Tanahashi Ibushi GotoNow the IC picture is obviously going to be Kenny Omega. So If Naito is the ultimate end goal for Okada who is the end goal for Omega? I would say Tanahashi. For me thats the big longterm program for the IC title. So who do you put in there in the mean time? I think Ibushi can play a part in the IC picture as well as the Heavyweight. Goto as well at some point. But what do they do for New Beginnings? Here is my idea for the IC title at New Beginnings. The story going in will be Nakamura being defeated by Omega and kayfabe get kicked out of NJPW. For me it makes sense that another member of CHAOS try to avenge him. So who is credible and available? Ishii Thats your match for New Beginning.NEVER Shibata Goto Elgin Honma IshiiNow the NEVER belt for me as potentially the most interesting year with Shibata as champ. Think of the awesome stuff they can do with it? I can totally see a ShibataGoto feud which would be interesting as they are a tag team. Honma can always be thrown in there for a program... maybe in order to FINALLY give him a singles title win. Ishii of course still works. And think of this What if Elgin signs with NJPW? I would throw his ass right into a NEVER program. I wouldnt put Ibushi in the NEVER picture as he needs to be the guy they push to the moon.TLDR  Omega vs. Ishii for the IC belt.,njpw,cys74wa,3,t5_2yc3t
6223359,0,t3_40of3b,he blew a chance at being push when he was found to have pirated bullet club merchandise though... I am not exactly sure who NJPW has on their radar.,njpw,cyx119g,2,t5_2yc3t
6668507,0,t3_46zgqf,There needs to be some clarity here.Ibushi has not given notice or left NJPWDDTpro he has cancelled the dual contract but has not resigned from either company. He has also started his own brandgroup to trainput on shows etc.NJPW will still book him as they did but its less likely to see him in meaningless six man tags now.,njpw,d092xlq,9,t5_2yc3t
6860898,0,t1_d0tuzko,I really do hope so. It would be the perfect answer to the spot theyre in now where Naito is very clearly next in line for a run at the top but Invasion Attack is too soon to pull the trigger on it.,njpw,d0tzq6u,1,t5_2yc3t
6869294,0,t1_d0uxv3j,Honestly if you can swing the sizing you should really opt for the official NJPW version of the shirt. IMO the shirt quality amp actual use of screenprints as opposed to their direct to garment style of printing that PWT uses is worth the extra amount. ,njpw,d0uy1rs,2,t5_2yc3t

Maybe the Elite but even they consist of two seperate entities Young Bucks and Kenny.

At best they can do maybe once or twice an underdog story that can get a little bit of interest but outside of that there aint much they can do with him.

11691305,0,t3_64i80u,Im back! the bank switched me over to the chip card so I made a new account over there NJPW had stopped charging me  months ago. Going through the Lions Gate show with no commentary. Liked Shota in that match with TAKA.,njpw,dgl878i,1,t5_2yc3t

11715153,0,t1_dgnwy6e,CMLL is the main excursion destination. You usually go there if you want to develop character it saved Nakamuras struggling career. You also pick up a few grappling and flying tricks. Even the Tempura Boyz who went by the name Fujin and Raijin were in CMLL.The RoH partnership is new but you go there to... I guess become more wellrounded? Its certainly working with Jay White who has become really good yet lacks star presence IMO. EVIL spent his excursion in RoH wearing brightly colored tights and not much else. It was weird. Hiromu spent a few months in RoH as the third man in The Addiction and continuing his Dragon Lee feud.Okadas an interesting case. He started his career as a luchador in Mexico trained by Ultimo Dragon then went to NJPW. From there he spent his  excursion in TNA who was NJPWs American partner at the time and very much flopped because bad booking and writing. However Sting became his main inspiration for creating a gimmick and thus the Rainmaker was born.As far as David Finlay I dont know whats going on. He started out as a young lion then when Matt Sydal got busted for pot he became Sydals replacement as Ricochet and Kojimas partner. Since then... not much. Some foreigners dont go on excursion Finlay might be one of those guys but hes very directionless which is sad to see but understandable with how bloated the roster is right now since Suzukigun came back.,njpw,dgnxww3,7,t5_2yc3t

11764840,0,t1_dgtabfl,Not yet but last yearSemi  Floor  limited to Fan Club  Arena A Tatami   Arena B Tatami   nd floor A   nd floor B Final Floor  limited to Fan Club  Arena A Tatami   Arena B Tatami   nd floor A   nd floor B I would NOT recommend the tatami for the final  they squeeze  people in instead of  for the semi. I usually do Arena A for the final and B for the semis. I did floor once and there are only  rows but unless you get row  or  its not worth it IMO.,njpw,dgtkov2,1,t5_2yc3t
