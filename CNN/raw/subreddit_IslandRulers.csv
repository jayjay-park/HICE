11269611,0,t1_df9auzm,I see! Im not sure about the population sizes of these smaller islands. If theyre uninhabited I suppose its no problem for you to simply claim them but if theyre inhabited youd either have to convince the population there to subject themselves to you voluntarily or make them do it by force. Is there any good reason why the people should submit voluntarily or does your island possess the military capacity to take them by force?,IslandRulers,df9e6md,2,t5_3jlbi
