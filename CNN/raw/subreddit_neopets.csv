25471,0,t3_1uerm8,You can look at mine here Its not nearly as good as the ones that get picked for spotlight but the inside is really coming a long great!I use the chalkboards turned around so you see the backs to divide rooms.If you are looking for cheap floor and wall colors I suggest going to the igloo garage sale. They normally have some very cheap there. Here is a list of all the furniture and decorations for neohomes .. Its arranged by price.I typically look at how the spotlight winners do things and look for inspiration for new ideas. Its very helpful.You can sort of move items out of your yard by hitting the up arrow when you highlight an object. This makes it look like its further out of your yard instead of floating. I did this for my treehouse. I suggest that you dont buy seasonal stuff in the season that its for. For example the Kiko String Lights that look like Christmas lights are very expensive right before Christmas but very cheap right after and during the SpringSummer.Make sure to save your house periodically when redecorating. Incase one of your items becomes stuck or lost. Some items are glitched in the new neohome so check Jellyneo item guide first before buying. These items will show up in your shed sometimes but not allow you to transfer them to your house.The outside of your house is going to be very expensive unless you do some kind of hauntedHalloweenpumpkin theme. Trees bushes and flowers are all very expensive. Ponds and water are also expensive.Good luck with your neohome!,neopets,cehbza2,5,t5_2r64t

703262,0,t1_cgk634c,Man I have to believe youre aware of how you come off to others. Not going to argue that point with you but your reaction was just one of the many I read that day that led to a general feeling of being bummed out.Im not saying that the intended audience is what seems normal for TNT but the method in which they delivered the changeevent. Of course the intended audience is different thats the entire point. Think of it this way someone who doesnt know about avatarsonly knows a little about them gets a cool one from the event. They go look up what other avatars there are and get excited about it. Maybe waiting for the event to give them another one starts taking too long and they start trying to work toward the ones they can still get the hard way. Not only does this engage them more as a player but it also keeps them around longer and gets them more invested in the site. Thats the point of design choices like that and I guarantee you it will happen for a lot of casual players.I also disagree that people dont go through other peoples ULs to see all the things theyve collected or done. I get random mails regularly from people Ive never talked to who liked something about my lookupgallerypets. And maybe now those people who wouldnt look at a stamp collection before will see the avatar and go look for it now. More visibility on a collection someone should be proud of is never a bad thing. So I believe my analogy still works just fine. Youre going to be able to see the effects of someones effort to be able to climb that mountain in their body actions and probably even their personality.gt  it makes the goal of collecting the stamps for that avatar less appealing to me.gt but if I can just win it from a quest why on earth would I waste years of my time and energy and spend M on it?Again its about if you can value the road leading to the accomplishment vs. just the reward. The former is going to make a game richer and allow it to offer you more as a player. Plus theres absolutely no guarantee that you would ever actually get the avatar you want from the random event.What youre describing about your player experience with running out of things to do is a legitimate concern and one I have to imagine TNT is aware of with their older seasoned players. I hope that they have plans in mind to engage people like you and offer you more things to do but obviously I dont know that. What I can see right now is that with change of ownership and all that theyre clearly looking toward how they can get more of their casual players more invested and start branching out into gaining new Neopians. Its going to suck if they forget about creating content for their older players but Im hoping that doesnt happen.,neopets,cgk7p3z,3,t5_2r64t

I hope this is good. I might add some more art Ive been doing later on or some more writing that I had thought of but didnt write because of finals. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed making it seriously thank you for giving me an excuse to make what turned out to be very enjoyable. The link to his lookup is in the content of the pet page and meant to be found as you read but  for the lazyEdit I added some more! I added a self introduction from Hayate and his baby picture.Edit  I added more to the story and the general ending  summary is at the end since the entire story is still in progress and will probably take months to finish.

Im still in college though so I have time before I actually reproduce myself. Ive been with my boyfriend for over three years so fingers crossed hes the one Ill have kids with the old fashioned way! The only thing is that were both pretty short hes not much taller than me and our poor future children will probably be doomed to be vertically challenged as well.Even though I dont plan on kids for at least a few years yet Im weird in that for some reason I absolutely love baby names it might be from all the Sims Ive played throughout my life.

Then transferred to another small campus though bigger than the previous. Then signed a lease in the area where I graduated. My mother has a habit of breaking leases and moving each chance she gets so I want some stability and to stay here even after my lease needs renewed in December. Its a nice little apartment and helps my boyfriend get to and from the university easier. My town was too small for any sort of public transit and Im too far away from the city to really have any way to try learning it. I would need a ride to the nearest bus stop and if I have a ride might as well just get them to go to the city. ,neopets,cifwqbr,1,t5_2r64t

So this school semester is probably going to be killer since...two jobs and taking  credit hours. Woo!The other day a flying tire tried to kill me when I was in my car  seriously a HUGE flying tire a whole one...not pieces came from nowhere and if I hadnt had swerved over to the right a little I wouldve had a facefull of tire and glass. But since I did swerve it just...took out my sidemirror and made lovely tire marks and scratches down the drivers side. Thats my luck ladies and gentleman a random flying tire tries to kill me. Ive always wanted to live in Japan or Ireland and more recently Korea. Japan would be my best option though considering my Bachelors is focusing on Japanese.

I frequent the RS amp chat board on the TC and theres ONE person weve all come to believe is somehow related to a TNT member because she comes and harasses everyone and is a downright bitch to everyone but nothing ever happens. However if you say ANYTHING she doesnt like you automatically get a warning andor silence. I was silenced once for posting to her Why do you have to be so rude? Does it make you happy how people view you? When she will literally come there insult EVERYBODY and be a huge cunt. But TNT does nothing to her. And then since then I get warnedsilenced constantly for the SMALLEST things... for example I posted a bunch of slorgs to bump a board and was actually officially warned for spamming. Like really? I see people do way worse but I feel like now I have a red flag on my account because of some bitch who has an in with TNT and now they just punish me whenever they feel like it.

Huge rule though dont break this. DO NOT MENTION REDDIT ON NEOPETS!! Sorry for the bold but were not a registered fansite or anything so its a big nono. There are some incredibly helpful guides that can be found in the wiki although its still being worked on. We also have weekly threads!  Theres the Weekly TradeSelling Thread thats made every Sunday by Automod. OffTopic Tuesday which is made by uwhitneyface and is basically just a place to talk about whatever even if its not related to Neopets! And theres also Pay It Forward Friday which is usually hosted by uOrganicDinosaur and it iswas a place to gift random people random things but is currently taking a hiatus while some rules are ironed out regarding giveaways.Overall we have quite a friendly community here!

1360414,0,t1_cimr28k,Colors and images are the easiest to change.  For colors all you have to do is change out the hex codes FFFFFF F etc with colors you want.  Images you can resize to the image in the premade and switch out the urls.Its all about trial and error to see what does what for the other stuff though.  Changing the number of this will increasedecrease the size of that header changing the font of this will change that etc.  You only change one thing at a time and take note of what it does and then change it back to what it was before before you move on to the next thing.  Once you have notes of what everything does you can change what you want about it.  Its like a big puzzle or something.  I dont know much about CSS just how to work around it.  CTRL  F will be your friend.I recommend having GetColor! on hand for identifying the hex codes of colors.  You just drag the little eyedropper on any color of anything on the screen and itll give you a hex code.  You can also use this to find out what colors are being used in the layout really easily and you can switch those with the codes for the colors that you do want.,neopets,cimtg5m,1,t5_2r64t

1637343,0,t3_2d30gj,Auction is not really the place to sell an item for more or most of its worth if it is a high value item. My experience with auctioning is usually to sell directly to one person on an agreed price or set the price of it very near its value with low bid increases.. If you are looking to sell for the highest possible price I suggest the trading post and patience. Trading a high value item for ETS easy to sell items can sometimes pay off nicely if you have the time to wait and sell those items too. People usually overpay with ETS for a desired item.,neopets,cjljvha,3,t5_2r64t

WELL SEE.Real Life So Lab already knows all about this since I was bitching to her last night but I hadnt had AC in my house since Saturday. I live in the hottest state in America and I had absolutely no AC. At night the INSIDE of my apartment would reach  degrees. THIS IS AT NIGHT. I hadnt slept all weekend and it was just ugggggh. The maintenance men in my complex are great theyve been really trying to help us but theres only so much they can do when they dont have the proper tools needed. The complex manager herself was gone so I had to deal with her worker. I cannot fucking stand that woman. Ever since we moved in at the end of July she has been nothing but rude for no reason. When I told her my AC wasnt working she rolled her eyes and basically called me a liar when she was talking to maintenance. I dont know what her problem with me is but I made a complaint this time. Neopets So I had absolutely no luck trying to get the bomb  I still kick myself for  not having the dubloons when I saw it in the cove to begin with. So Im big into plushies. Its my gallery its my main pet its plushie life. I have a steady plushie supplier who Ive given a ton of NP too and I love him. Hes great no problems. But I currently have this other girl who is bothering the absolute shit out of me. Shes trying to make me buy a Rainbow Kau Plushie which if anyone knows the price of...please tell me and the last price that I was able to find for it was k so when she told me to offer I offered that. Her response was basically that I was ridiculous and its worth waaaaay more! I get really annoyed when people do this if YOU know the price just tell me what you want dont make me guess an offer and play this game. Its annoying. Anyway I asked her how much she wanted and she said . mil and at this point Im like whatever its fine Ok then Ill take it. Que three days later she sent me another neomail going Oh I looked through my history and I had bought it for  million. I really need the neopoints what can you give me. Then because Ive been working and dealing with shit I didnt see anything dealing with Neo until last night and during that time she had sent me another going Hello??? Offer now.

I tend to just open them all in tabs and then go through so the relatively even division of dailies into segments makes doing them in chunks super easy.  I tend to get lost and confused on the JN page.  TDN is really good about sidebar notifications for major clickable avvies particularly pet and weather ones so I catch them when I go in for my dailies.  Their sidebar is also less cluttered than JNs so their Snowager notifications stand out more too.  Although lets be real for everything else I head to JN. ,neopets,ckxv49x,1,t5_2r64t

I thought I can just eat it out of a cup! But if I was heating all the water how would I be able to guess how much is enough for one packet? Well Ill just microwave the water and oatmeal together. I had my headphones in and did a little bit of cleaning around the kitchen while I waited. When I saw the timer go under  seconds I went around and checked the oatmeal.It was all over the microwave. Not only did I have to throw all the oatmeal out I had to clean the meal I did not get to eat out of the microwave.

2415369,0,t3_2n3tsp,I downvote misinformation IF it has positive karma because I dont want whoever they were replying to to get the wrong idea and I downvote people who are arguing for the sake of arguing.  I dont get a lot of downvotes here but since I usually reddit from my phone I can see the scores of other peoples comments and yeah it does seem like this has become a problem.I get irritated by posts asking for advice for new players theres a FAQ in the sidebar so unless they have a specific question I dont see the point of making a post about it and post that belong in the weekly pet adoption thread or NPNC trade thread because we have those weekly threads for a reason.  I dont downvote them though because in my opinion theyre not actively harming the quality of the sub.  Im actually pretty surprised by how much some of you seem to downvote!  I dont like most of the item pricing or RE posts either but they take like  seconds to look at and again I dont think theyre hurting anyone.I also upvote like its my job so I feel like Im showing my dislike of something by not upvoting it instead of downvoting it.Tldr I downvote posts I think shouldnt have been made andor are bad for the sub but I leave the ones I dont personally like alone.,neopets,cma8ykh,4,t5_2r64t

2500421,0,t3_2o8tkc,Wait what?    Uhm I told you guys that I wouldnt be very active these past few weeks due to work issues and that we recently hired new people and once they were trained Id be good and free.    Ive been on Skype fairly regularly and no one has ever said anything to me spoke to me or mentioned anything.    What the heck? Would have been nice to at least been told about this or talked to...    But either way welcome back Clim... oO    EDIT like a half hour later Im not angry per se. Just perplexed as to why I was told my being inactive wouldnt be an issue after informing you all of work responsibilities increasing for a bit and then all of a sudden Im removed from the mod team without a single attempt to contact me or a message from any of the mods.   Im all for whatever is best for the sub just kind of stings to be removed without any conversationdiscussionetc. after being told it was alright that my inactivity for a bit wouldnt be an issue and then to basically be banned from the subreddit skype chat on top of it.    Im just confused really and Ill wait for a response to the messages I sent DiceMelStrat,neopets,cmkxycb,94,t5_2r64t
2500857,0,t3_2o8tkc,sigh This again?First of all a big THANK YOU to strat for all youve done for us here on the sub I love having this community and you played a huge part in making it what it is today  Goodbye to fuzio though I am glad its not really goodbye since youll still be active on the sub.  And welcome back climeski its great to have you as a mod again!But seriously if fuzio was not told about being removed just like the last time the mod team was changed thats really upsetting to me as a user of the sub.  I can understand and forgive it happening once but the sort of bad communication with someone who seems to be trying to keep up even after saying theyll be around less without apparently being told this was a problem is ridiculous.  I probably dont have all the facts and shouldnt be so quick to jump to conclusions but that is another reason why I wanted to say something.  I understand a lot goes on behind the scenes that I as a user dont need to know about but I think its natural for those of us who frequent the sub to have some stock in our moderating team we care about you guys and we care about what happens so I dont understand why weve been kept in the dark about these changes.  I know fuzio is being really understanding about all of this and Im not trying to be angry about the removal specifically but I feel like both times this has happened the community has gotten all up in arms because we dont have all the information.  ESPECIALLY the part about being made a listener on the Skype chat unless fuzio meant the mod Skype chat which would make sense.Tldr It wish the mod team would give us the whole story when stuff like this happens.  I didnt speak up the first time but now that its happened twice Im a little worried.Also I dont know what gender most of the mods are so I had to write this whole thing without pronouns gt.lt,neopets,cml009x,27,t5_2r64t

2514335,0,t1_cmmqtac,I have the same fear of posting from my main account... but Im just going to do it. Hopefully the discussion will be more accepting going forward?I have to agree with you on a lot of this. I would definitely lose confidence in the moderation team if uindustria continued moderating this sub either as an official mod or behindthescenes. While I would happily welcome her back to the community and I hope she does rejoin when shes ready I dont think it would be appropriate for her to moderate.A lot of people are posting here and saying they have been in similar situations or suffered from similar problems as uindustria. I know that what she went through was sucky and I feel sympathy for her. However Id also like to speak from personal experience that being on the other end of this is sucky too. Ive had relationships that involved significant manipulation in ways similar to this and it took me a long time to recover from how horrible that made me feel. Fabricating the severity of a situation is not okay and the people you hurt by doing so are victims too. Even though I didnt join in much of the discussion throughout all of this I was paying serious attention the whole time. Id now just like to chime in and say that both cyber bullying and the manipulation of members of this sub are totally not okay with me.,neopets,cmmrfvi,23,t5_2r64t

2521870,0,t3_2ofn2p,Clearly I picked a great time to decide to sign up for reddit so I could participate here. pAt any rate I think when someone agrees to be a mod they need to have a thick skin and great people skills and some maturity. Youre not going to please all the people all the time and people will react badly no matter how nice you are about things.  And will react much worse if you dont have the people skills it takes to be a good impartial communicator Its a customer service position.  Even if you give someone rainbows and cupcakes they can still be a jerk. Its all part of the job and its not something to be taken personally. I think most people can agree that the mature response to possible bullying and harassment isnt to accuse people of making threats that didnt happen at all. Its not appropriate behavior for anyone and certainly not for a modleader. Clim was unfortunately forced to make this stuff public because someone else did first. The drama is not going to go away as this is about neopets and we arent all older adults here. This isnt meant to be insulting Im in my s and I can assure you that In my teens and early s I was still growing a lot as a person and Id easily get bent out of shape over stupid stuff. This isnt to say that there is a magic age where that stops happening this is just to say that teensearly s are a time of a lot of personal growth and maturity for most people.  That factor along with the reality that people are getting bent out of shape over NEOPETS needs to be in the back of everyones mind going forward. At the end of the day there is a world outside of this sub and neopets and sometimes an individual needs to take that step back and relax and regain perspective before getting caught up increating drama.I really like this group but it just feels that some stuff like down votes are taken a bit too seriously and it causes things to spiral out quickly. I really hope things calm down and that if a new mod is picked theyre vetted a lot better than previously. ,neopets,cmnqv9l,6,t5_2r64t

The creative team is hard at work but they have nothing to do with the server issues or the glitches those are all programming problems.My biggest issue is that they need to pay more attention to what we WANT to be fixed vs what is easiest for them to fix.  ,neopets,cnk25kg,8,t5_2r64t

It wasnt until that moment that I realised that we werent meant to talk about anything outside of the site. Maybe one of the problems is that we assume that others know exactly what we do which just sets us up for failure.

I am very confused as to why you created a public post speaking so hatefully of me rather than contact me privately. I did not remove your wishes to be spiteful I had received messages from users informing me they attempted to contact you and did not receive a reply. When a wisher ignores neomails we assume they no longer want to be listed and remove them. I never received any other neomails from you asking to list wishes or anything of the sort. Please keep in mind neo is incredibly glitchy right now and a lot of mails havent been going through. I am truly sorry for any distress this has caused you but I can assure it was not intentional. If you mail me on neo I would be glad to list wishes for you on our wishlist.,neopets,coulw03,1,t5_2r64t

3332339,0,t3_2yb6td,My gallery is useless Neopetswise since its a collection of items meant to represent the quest items collectable in Ocarina of Time. I mean look at this and tell me thats not perfect for a Shard of Agony. P This thing too. I refuse to believe it isnt a mini reference to Lon Lon Milk even if the name is somewhat genericish and not really solely LOZ. Id like to make a gallery that I can submit for winning a trophy one day but theres already so many galleries out there dedicated to almost everything that its hard to be original. Not to mention the cost of saving up and buying all that crap is... yeah Id rather put blow NP elsewhere. Edit Oops. In RL uh... I guess I collect coins? Sort of? I only did it while I was living in Canada because oh man their quarters. Youll get at least one speciallyprinted coin in every three handfuls of change you receive and I turned it into a minimission during the two years I was privileged to stay there to collect all the special edition coins I could. I ended up with maybe five pages at the end of it all without having to try. Its so amazing. I tend to buy little souvenir pins and badges whenever I visit a country too.

For the levels where your goal is to obtain the items not get certain amount of points once you get those items the level is technically completed. If you have a bunch of moves left and have obtained all the items you wont be able to make any more moves and the move counter will start counting down. As it counts down random ghouls get powered up and once the counter hits zero these powered up ghouls explode giving you more points and ending the level.,neopets,cp9xsn7,1,t5_2r64t

3404898,0,t1_cpgdrn5,gt Are there any guides that you think will specifically help someone with absolutely no clue?Frankly no. Everyone uses the BD for different ends  some people to get avatars some for the prizes and .... I have no idea what else the BD can do hahaha.I think what you need to do is establish what you want to use the BD for. If you want the BD avatars your pet should be good to go for all the BD avatars except Space Faerie whos a level  minimum. If you want to battle for the Obelisk avatarsboonsthemes your stats are more than adequate. Same goes for dailies. Trial and error and personal taste is key But for the record all the weapons I recommended are triedandtested ones for me and my personal favourites which I use daily  using them now as a matter of fact!,neopets,cpgdtks,1,t5_2r64t

The intro of the board explains that the idea is that the treasure might drift with the currents  so if one set of coordinates won a little while ago another set of coordinates in the vicinity is probably where youll find treasure too.,neopets,cpwaob3,2,t5_2r64t

3639702,0,t1_cq733xy,Heres the editorial where TNT says when you can use the AAA on a side tagging ugoofyspouse here toogtHi gives cookies. My side account is older than my main account. Old enough to enjoy all the loyal user perks that my main is not able yet to enjoy. I was wondering if its allowed to buy products from the Attic or the Hidden Tower with discount on my side account providing of course the points come from my main account. please remove my username Thanks. username removedgtWe discussed this at great length and finally came to the conclusion that as long as you do have at least one account old enough to enjoy user perks you may restock from the Attic and the Hidden Tower on discount day with the following rulesgtYou may only restock at these two shops using ONE account. Once youre banned for the day theres no hopping to other accounts or trying to avoid getting banned by using multiple accounts.        Funds must come from your main.              Please try to enjoy the perks in the spirit they were intended and try not spend your time looking for loopholes in the rules. The reason AAA is allowed is because its a loyal user perk so it lets users who have an older side than main access the AAA because technically that user has been around long enough but switched to a newer main. FC on the other hand is accessible to all accounts older accounts do have an advantage with the max bet amount but younger accounts can still play FC. EditAnd definitive answer for ueaterofdreams that FC is not allowed on sidesgtDear TNTMany of us have been wondering whether it is okay to place bets on side accounts for the Food Club. Would you mind illuminating us with your great knowledge? esbenkaldahl gtWere gonna say no to this one as the reason to play Food Club is to place bets and earn NP which you shouldnt be doing on your side accounts.Also a quick plug for JNs editorial database which let me find these editorials in like less than  minutes. ,neopets,cq75j5s,3,t5_2r64t

3708168,0,t1_cqey26w,So basically Etsy cant do anything about people infringing until the copyrighttrademarker holder sends in a notice asking for it to be pulled down. They have to submit a CampD for each item individually so it takes a lot of work and as you can see there are a ton there. Some people slip through the cracks for years. Sometimes depending on the IP holder they might even let some items pass if they think its good fan art and something that helps their brand but thats not something to rely on.I get a lot of requests for copyrightedtrademarked things I sell custom sunglasses and phone cases and in order to keep my shop legal I have to turn them down. Sometimes IP holders will make an example of people especially if theyre repeat offenders making a decent profit and will sue people. Its not something you can win. They have better lawyers and are in the legal right. They can not only take all your profits from the items sold but they can also end up getting a ton of back money and your equipment Disney is one of the companies known for it.Its not a bad place to sell. The fees are low and the community is really helpful. They are going through some more changes that I disagree with but well see how that turns out.edit to add if you want to keep your shop legal but still get the traffic youd get from fan art Id say make all the fan art gifts that you want and post them on DA then link to your etsy store with originals. Do not sell the fan art though! Ive seen wayyy too many horror stories to encourage it. But anyways Etsy isnt like Cons where technically despite being illegal to sell its more like an approved infringement. This is flat out if you get caught you will be taken down. ,neopets,cqeyfze,1,t5_2r64t

3823262,0,t3_347vkn,Yes I think we should be upset. No complacency for shit like this man.   If you ask me we shouldnt necessarily be upset at the amount of content being put out. Theyre supposedly busy fixing the site whatever. But if theyre going to decide to do something they shouldnt fucking halfass it.  The first handful of News updates were sprinkled with either embarrassing typosgrammatical errors or embarrassing misinformation neither of which they bothered to correct. If theyre going to put something live I dont think its unreasonable to expect them to at least reread it over or use a spellchecker.  They have been updating the Art Gallery at least one day late for some reason every day until yesterday  and yesterday when they actually updated it on time there were  sets of duplicates accepted one of them with the blatantly rulebreaking title CYBUNNY SEXY not to mention that traced drawings arent even supposed to be allowed. Also on the topic of misinformation rules of site features like the AG as well as the fact that they have eluded to items restocking in the wrong shops or paint brushes that dont exist I dont think its unreasonable to expect them to at least put in a little effort to learning the already established rules or the correct information of news theyre about to publish.  If they are going to release a new colour on a pet day they should have had that planned and release it on time instead of pushing it back. Similarly if they really are too busy to have things planned out or to push new content out then damn dont even bother doing it then! Write just one or two bullets in the News and own up to the fact that youre not releasing anything of quality. Give us updates on the status of things getting fixed. We dont need new items or colours every day. I dont know who they think theyre fooling with paragraphs and multiple bulletpoints in the News that are all just full of fluff and air. The News should be for actual News.rant,neopets,cqs31gj,51,t5_2r64t

Like really really ridiculously good looking. The problem was not many people would use such words to describe a Krawk. So Anj ran away Elsa style and built a glittery ice castle in the mountains. She quite liked the ice castle. Every surface was reflective so she spent a lot of time looking at herself. Alas she was lonely and despite all the glitter and glam she had provided herself she missed her friends. So Anj went back home and sulked for the rest of her life but at least she wasnt lonely.

3932241,0,t3_35hrda,The economy has had quite a whirlwind experience! A little less than a year ago they took the game KeyQuest down beforeduring the transition from Viacom to Jumpstart as well as the Habitarium. The Habitarium allowed people to grind out some mad NP while KeyQuest dropped codestones and paintbrushes and all those sorts of things. These two together dropped some prices codestonespbsetc. of things but also allowed people to buy things because they had such a substantial NP source coming in.Flash forward to now. Its hard to make NP gt its hard to sell things gt its hard to get NP. The app Jumpstart released called Ghoul Catchers can earn you k a day and you can play just the beginning levels over and over again to make it easier. Outside of that Food Club would be the only other suggestion I have to making NP but thats still even hard unless you have an old account. Once you get to your first million it really does become easier but it takes a while. I was unsure about Neopets when I rejoined in the Fall especially when dealing with all of the transitioning! My account is now  months and I am a very active player.

Just yesterday there was a whole commotion over Za which is a UC tier guide that some people take as law. Another UC owner wanted a movement rejected Za which happens every couple days and it very intense. And hilarious.Theres definitely a hierarchy and its based not only on UCs but Real Name Real Word BD and short named pets.For example the user behind Za  psychology  has  UCs. Shes a power user beyond what most people on the PC can imagine. Most people have like a BN mutant UC theyre trying to trade or a game of thrones RN misspell and they arent as well regarded.

3968380,0,t1_cr8mdgc,I love my animal pals! Could not be happy without them lt I live in a house downtown and we do have yards but I deffffffinitely dont have horse space lol. I started taking riding lessons as a kid and it took YEARS of being around them. I actually moved into a house with my friend and we took care of  ponies then  after some got sold by the owners temporarily. Super long complicated story full of drama and a few other people but we moved out after a couple months. My mom finally caved and bought me a horse for graduation but then he needed lots of training so I resold him and bought one of the ponies we took care of at the house because he was finally on sale she wouldnt sell him before I tried. This was my first horse although I shoulda just put him in the album I suppose. Soooo beautiful but he was a bit crazy. sorry that was longer than I intended PIt sounds so much better than it really is lolol its basically psych with more required sciences and such. But it just sounds sooo snazzy so I went with it.Definitely LOVE BC so much. I got the coordinates of Kelowna tattooed behind my ear when I went there! It was the first time I was in BC and I fell in love. Been there twice more Springdale area for camping and then stayed in ProcterNelson last summer. Still havent been to Vancity for Victoria but I still miss it every dayyy. Love the mountains and the weathers way nicer. It snowed here the other day it was awful. Still the warmest weve had all this year so far was like  degrees like twice. Its awful so much snow and rain and when it does get half warm its too humid to go outside. Usually its not even that hot its like cold and humid so you get clammy,neopets,cr8mnos,1,t5_2r64t

Obsessed I tell ya. I tell people that my favourite animal is the fox and I do love dem foxies but DOOOOOGSSSS MAAAAANNNN THEY ARE THE GREATEST EVAAAAAElephants are also my jam.Also I am a fucking geek. XD Especially for anime. I dare not link my anime list because it is somewhat disgustingly large. If you can name it I can almost guarantee that Ive either seen it plan to see it or know what it is and am deliberately not watching it.I believe in the power of Joss Whedon Yeonmi Park and a solid cup of tea every morning.I had an ex who gave me decaf tea on a morning once the first night I slept over the morning of their friends wedding none of whom Id ever met before because wed known each other like two weeks. I didnt understand why I was so grumpy and out of it Im normally very friendly and upbeat even in Le Dreaded Social Situations until they confessed their sin. I glared at them stormed off to get myself a real cup of tea from the beverage section and sulked.That last bit was a lie. I did do that in my own head. Outwardly it probably didnt have nearly that effect and was probably just me laughing awkwardly and going k Imma just go get some tea brb kkkkkTLDR Obsessed with dogs my work is intensive fucking geek dont give me decaf tea in the morning.

Cashiri seems really fascinating to me and I think it would be really cool if Neopets had a wearable that could change the tail into a different limb like the arm. I couldnt decide on what background to use so I used both.This design was meant to look a little more outworldly. This one incorporates more of the flowers.This design was made to look a little... scarier I guess? Give it a sinister feel.And what did I learn from this? Capes dont fit very well on Eyries.

4032930,0,t1_crfyc3r,The only real way to make sure youre selling your items is by making sure youre the lowest on shop wizard. This is really the only way to get people to go to your shop unless you advertise on the boards or are in a mall and to be honest those things just dont work all that well. Most people will ask someone to look up an item if theyre on a quest and thats really the only way someone cant SW something themselves. Basically traffic doesnt matter because most of the time people are just in your shop because they looked up a specific item and you were the cheapest. They might buy up some of the other items if theyre cheap as well but not always.Things recently have been hard to sell but as long as you have the cheapest price someone will eventually buy it.

4035546,0,t3_36q7my,I think in another year we are likely to see an updated site layout or if not many sections of the site updated. i.e. Neoboards    When they transitioned they upgraded to newer technology than what Neopets had been using which was really responsible for why they couldnt bring us some features we had been asking for OR implementing those features with such an outdated backend  infrastructure would have been more trouble than it was worth.    I honestly believe that once everything finally settles and the site gets back into a groove which I personally believe will happen in the next  months that it is going to open the doors for some interesting features in the future.

4075184,0,t3_379m95,Its not impossible to get as long as youre willing to spend real . For a newbie to NC trading theres a whole host of guides but if this is the only item you want then you dont need to get swept away by all the extraneous information.Most basic According to clara its worth  GBC. This means the item is worth  gift box capsules which is kind of like currency for NC traders. The NC mall currently has gift box capsules stocked for  NC per which means  GBC will cost you     NC. However in order to send NC items you have to have gift boxes which means you will need to open at least  maybe  GBC since each GBC is guaranteed to have at least  boxes. Thus you will probably end up needing to spend at least . Before you do any of this you probably want to find a willing trader wholl trade you the item for an agreedupon sum GBC or other NC items. My recommendation is ask around here and on the neoboards and see what people are willing to trade. Do you have any NC items you could trade?,neopets,crksppx,3,t5_2r64t

Whether its a comic movie TV show whatever groups that are not explicitly coded male or female are almost always represented as majority male with a few women dispersed in even though half of the population is female because male is default.

4369627,0,t3_3b2ayx,While its not impossible especially with the ewallet switch happening right now I wouldnt assume it was neopets unless this becomes a widespread issue. There are so many ways to steal credit card information and sometimes people steal the numbers and wait a long time to sell them off or use them. My credit card numbers got stolen in the great Target hack but it took almost  months for anyone to actually use them. My parents are constantly getting their credit card info stolen I assume by downloading shady software to their computer.

They had been doing a lot of Dragonas crappy on purpose for the lulz Photochop Caption Contests as well as diorama style images using plushies miniature figures and whatever else they didnt have to spend money on drawing. We had seen these before so this wasnt cause for alarm. But on May th they actually rereleased a Caption Contest image from years and years ago. Not a redraw they just took the same image and said Heres the next Caption Contest image. To quote someone in the comments section on Jellyneo ITSHAPPENING.GIF!!! Photochop and dioramas? That we understand. Thats being quirky and imaginative. But theres no explanation for reusing an image other than you simply dont have the resources. TNT said theyre low on resources. But how low on resources are they if everything is grinding to a halt around us?Its okay its okay soon these dark times will be past us and the transition will be complete. By the way hows that survey coming along? We heard that submissions were closed so did you read it all? What is it that we all asked for that you now must fulfill? BDers were particularly downtrodden and looking for a bone. Surely the survey had told TNT that fixing the Battledome was priority right? Ever since the new Dome in  things havent been as good as they could be for the hardy BDer. So TNT revealed what the survey said in the Editorial. And they said... gtWe dont have much to report on the Battledome at the moment.  We did organise a priority list for fixes so we could quickly take advantage of any programmers being freed up from other projects but weve yet to get a window of opportunity. We know its not what you want to hear We dont like broken content either! but thats all we have to report at the moment. In response to the survey we sent out weve reworked our current priority list to focus on the most requested content which included games and dailies mobile and small new events.Dreams dashed. Hard out there for a BDer. Did you know the New BD Beta Testers never got their special reward for testing the Dome? Some say they dont deserve one as being a Beta Tester was its own reward. Beta Testers cleaned up in the Beta off item profits. But even if they dont deserve it its a sign of how overlooked the Dome is. And this time theres nothing BDers can do about it because according to the survey theyre outvoted. The Dome just isnt important to the common Neopians wishlist. What IS important is new games new dailies Neopets Mobile and small new events. Wait a minute. Small new events??? What happened to PLOTS??? THATS what people want no more plevents!!! We were supposed to be sick of plevents!!! It was the mention of small new events as opposed to big new plots that made people really question the authenticity of that survey. If it wasnt skewed so that we couldnt say We want plots then there definitely had to be something wrong with the count because it is SURELY rare that youll find a Neopian that says I dont want a plot I prefer smaller events. Small events and dailies? Isnt that part of the reason we hated the Coincidence event? Because it was just a small event and a new daily when we preferred something larger like a plot? Is this survey screwing us out of the plots we were hoping wed FINALLY get after all these years??? Who did this to us? Who voted AGAINST plots??? No Dome no plots somethings fishy. But at least we were getting Neopets Mobile. And TNT had made a note of pointing out how JumpStart is pretty strong in the mobile market. If any overlord knows how to make a Neopets Mobile app its JumpStart. And on June th we got one of those new games Pakiko. Though it wasnt really new  per se it was a reskin of a Flash game from Petpet Park. So was the next new game we got on July th Coal War Tactics. But really what Flash game isnt derived from another game? Really all games when you break them down are made up of parts from other games. So these games werent received too poorly. So the survey was basically kinda sorta living up to its promise it just turned out the promise it was held to was weak sauce that no one REALLY cares about. But thats fine games and dailies and small events arent actually hurting the chances for plots and wars. Maybe the survey didnt say we wanted the Dome or plots but we would rally for it in time. It wasnt too late for the Dome or plots lets just wait until after the transition and then well hit the streets calling for plots again. Theyll see. Theyll ALL see.,neopets,cstjx85,1,t5_2r64t

4501693,0,t3_3cqcea,Hi guys Im just going to throw my  cents in here as Im an old lady and have some experience with business.  . Jumpstart doesnt want to hear about how the old team did it better. The reason they were all laid off is probably pretty simple  a huge reduction in revenue in the last ten years has left neopets vulnerable to a buyout and layoff. Thats what happens to businesses that are not creating profit. Though we as users dont like change  weve obviously stuck around because we love it  thousands upon thousands of people have left and arent coming back. Jumpstart bought this bloated jumbled mess because they think they can DO something with it  something PROFITABLE. Something that will bring in NEW users that will increase ad revenue and spend real money. And considering that were talking about a childrens educational company Im assuming it will be centered around that. If this was my company I would have hired  app designers and set them out to create the most fun and addicting neopets app the world has ever seen...that cant be fully enjoyed without . inapp purchases.  . As far as I can tell customer support has been outsourced to a company called Parature which in the last year was purchased by Microsoft. I dont know that Rico and whoever else answers tickets actually work for NeoJS. JS probably has a contract with them to provide ticket support and they only pay for a few full time people. This is just a guess by me but I doubt JS is hiring staff for that its likely outsourced.  . Artists and content developers are expensive. See .  . I agree with utalvarn that any letter should include real data from the userbase  surveys regarding NC purchasing length of use ideas for sourcing new users least favorite parts of the site most requested updates what an awesome app could include. What ideas do we have that could help them build not regress?  . They dont owe us anything  the original TNT built it and loved it but since multiple companies have run it its just a business to them now. We need to understand that the likely only reason neopets is still around is because it has the potential to be on the assets side of the balance sheet and more changes will have to come for it to stay around. They need more new users than users jumping ship.So thats what I think your letter should include  not what we think is wrong  they know that already how much bitching can one company have on its Facebook page  but how we as users can help them make the site better more profitable.  Thats what I would listen to if it was me.,neopets,csy3au9,20,t5_2r64t

Sure its good for their economy and helps cover costs for the website but I might pay more for NC items if I could guarantee Id get something I wanted instead of a chance for it.That being said if they wanted to JUST do NP they need to step up their game a little.

I cant do a screenshot since I am on mobile but make sure you pick the pirate from the drop down menu and then click the checkbox to the left of their name. You can see if you did it right because your odd bottom middle number should be the same as what the bettors list   etc. Bet the MAXIMUM on each row. You may lose some rounds but in the long run you will win win win!Make sure you click the COLLECT WINNINGS link and then Collect button.

I honestly didnt realize we had such a sensitive readership that felt personally attacked when I make extreme catchall statements. Especially the post you linked was so over the top and in direct response to someone elses specific comment. Its still funny that people angry about my dislike of cheaters and hackers went ahead with hacking my account. If they had reading comprehension skills they would have read my comments in my TP post stating that it was only aimed at cheaters and not at people who were frozen for reasons unfair.

Im just way more invested quite literally in Neo than she is D like she she asked me what my favorite games were and I kinda said I dont play the games but I didnt want to explain food club or RSing so it got weird. I feel the same way about telling people I play Neo as I do about telling people I watch anime regularly.

It took them  years and  tickets to get to me. I would list as much information that you can about your account. Even little random things that you can remember. I didnt need to provide proof of my NC purchases because I didnt have those I just told them all the items I knew I had and approx how many NC points I boughtredeemed. Did you redeem any item codes on that account? I used to buy the tcg cards and redeem those codes all the time  luckily I actually kept some of those codes too and gave them that. Did you buy any plushies or got the McDonalds toys? Buy KeyQuest tokens? Something like that could help too if you cant remember your email if you still have a code laying around haha. I added an extensive list of all the items I knew I had whether it be NC items pet clothing and things in my SBD. Not sure how much that will help but its good to add.

All the stories of people cleaning up ridiculously from Charity Corner paints a picture of billions upon trillions of Neopoints out there up for grabs all you need to do is have the thing people want to buy. And Charity Corner makes just about everything desirable so now people are all like If we could JUST have another Charity Corner! Then Ill be rich because I hoarded just for this day! Oh how I love Charity Corner! Because it promises riches beyond any plot thus far. But ya gotta understand the Neopoints are not infinite. Theres not necessarily enough for all of us to be multimillionaires even though Charity Corners success stories make it sound like it is. Its the lottery delusion.

Why not change the art? Why post anything id they were going to deny it? Its just going to get players talking about it more!I have to think this is PRupper managementsomeone in charge of stafftoplayer interactions doing. They were told what happened and told everyone If we admit we stole art wed be in bigger trouble than we already are. Just say its coincidence distance ourselves from the items creation and tell the artists if theyre going to use Google images at least make sure the source is from the site. At least I hope they did the last part otherwise we could set up a dangerous precedence of copied fanart.Whoever this person isthese people are JS needs to seriously fire them.

I read the description of the Gold one which just said something interesting will happen when your Neopet plays with it so I had my Lupe play with it... and was horrified to see it turn into a Gold Meerca. The kicker? I had read the description of the Red one and knew that changed your Neopet into a Meerca dont know why younger me didnt put two and two together. I then had my now Gold Meerca play with the Red one because I liked the color Red better. sigh In a few months I fixed it by buying a Red Lupe Morphing Potion.During the Faerie Ruins Plot my Fire Lupe got turned into a Baby by Boochi. The kicker? I had a Rainbow Fountain use... too bad the Faeries were all turned to stone so I couldnt use it!

5655873,0,t3_3skwef,CONGRATULATIONS!! As someone who went over a year without my main... I know that feeling when you finally get an email that its back. My favorite species is the Zafara. WHY ZAFARA? Cause theyre freaking beautious what ever happened to Zafara love? When I was a kid there were so many cool Zafara characters around the site and the way they were drawn blew me away. Enough so that even though my first pet was an acara I made a Zafara because I was so impressed by their drawing and character potential. THEYRE BIPEDAL. THEY HAVE FLOPPY CUTE EARS. THEYRE KANGAROO BUNNIES FOR PETES SAKE. I blame customization... theyre not the easiest to customize pretty but thats no reason to not have like  zafaras. Boris are better because even though I dote upon my zaf  probably more than my other pets  my bori Gastawn is the only one to win first overall in the BC and the only pet of mine to win a customization contest. Theres obviously something about boris that elevates them to new bori heights. Also this is the honest truth if I had to choose the best petcolor combo on the WHOLE SITE its a tossup between Woodland Unis and Water Boris. For the purposes of this contest water boris all the way! Seriously I think theyre beautiful. The color of the bori back humptheir tail just blows me away. My grandfather has the heart of a lion and a lifetime ban from the local zoo.,neopets,cwy5zqg,1,t5_2r64t

But then again since its a graphicbased layout it might actually look more filled and have less empty space on someone elses screen compared to mine? My screen is not that wide and it seems like the layout is set up for a widescreentype monitor.  Ehhh I dunno.

5887851,0,t3_3vwsd9,Mind if I vent? I cant really sleep due to what happened yesterday so maybe getting it out will be better.Yesterday was normal. My Mom was out running errands I was at home with Dad watching TV. Our two dogs were sleeping  and the chickens were out running in the backyard. Perfect day. Mom comes home and notices Betty one of our dogs hasnt eaten her breakfast half a can of food they get in the morning. Its not that unusual Bettys a late riser and for the past few days hasnt eaten her breakfast until the afternoon. She goes and pets her and notices Betty just doesnt look good. Her neck seems swollen so she asks me to hold a flashlight while she opens her mouth. She opens it and there at the back of her throat is this massive bleeding lump. Of course we were horrified and rushed her to the vet right away. Were sitting in the waiting room Betty on my Moms lap shaking and wanting to be held.We finally get called in and the Vet takes a look. He says it looks like a mass but Bettys in too much pain to keep her mouth open so they have to sedate her. They do my Mom comforting her all the while and sure enough it is a large mass in the back of he throat. He says theres nothing he can do and the best thing is to put her out of her misery. Mom cries we hug and agree to put her down. We pet her while the Vet puts the needle in her leg thinking about how she seemed just fine yesterday and we even took her for a walk two days ago.It just came out of nowhere. We havent even had her for a year! We adopted her in April so our other dog Barney wouldnt be so lonely. When we got her she was this little emaciated thing a former breeder for a puppy mill that was abandoned when she got too old to have more. Mom got her because she thought she was a beagle like Barney but I took one look at her and knew she was part Chihuahua.  It only became more obvious with time her constant need to be a lap dog her high pitched yip and of course the chronic case of small dog syndrome.Goodbye Betty. Your time with us was short but Im glad we could make the last part of your life a good one.Her adoption photo her first day with us on my lap and her stealing Barneys bed,neopets,cxrfj05,2,t5_2r64t

Ive been getting into the holiday spirit by relaxing not much time to do this during the school days hanging out with my friends and significant other more often buying them gifts for Christmas and by surprising people on Neopets with gifts. As a result this is making me so broke AHH! XD I think I need to find a small part time job during my break but its so worth it.The subreddit on Neopets has been getting me into the holiday spirit much more than what has been going on IRL which is pretty interesting. I cannot stress how amazing everyone is on this subreddit and I cant wait to give back to the community once I start earning a lot of NP. The holiday spirit is really contagious! . I dont have much to offer at the moment but regardless of results on this board Ill definitely host a giveaway to those who are interested in the future and will continue to give out random gifts to those who help out others or are in need of a surprise  Ill also offer any help that I can to those on this board and offer to zap peoples pets for those who do not have the lab ray available to them.. I will pick Thank you so much!,neopets,cxv5gni,1,t5_2r64t

Or how do I choose good opponents?Another question do people usually have one set of weapons they always use or should I be thinking about different weapons for different opponents?Right now Im using mainly the ridiculously heavy battle hammer and either scarab ring or shiny shoal shell shield.

Then you can check sunnyneos gallery size calculator to tell you how large your gallery needs to be and how much it costs.

6702191,0,t1_d0cave8,food adjustments appear to be typically weighted into the opening odds. So to me the opening odds are what matter the most.  I havent personally been keeping track but it feels like the last week of every month trophy run time always is riddled with ridiculous upsets either from way out of left field or sometimes from pirates that are historically strong but for some reason had really terrible opening odds like Franchisco who upset at  today for instance.   Of course thats just conjecture but yeah. Despite that I always rely on opening odds as being the most accurate way to predict which pirates have the best chance of winning .... Which makes sense...

7360656,0,t3_4g63gl,not quite the same situation but there was this name i wanted the name of my city which was a labrat for their owner. i mailed them and offered stuff and i dont really remember but they definitely agreed to trade her to me after a bit. the next day she turned chocolate so i sent them a mail again wondering if they were still willing to trade since they had gotten a nice color. they never answered me again and now theyre inactive. no idea what happened but im so sad. i just wanted that name.    and theres also this one uc tyrannian krawk i fell in love with and that was literally years ago. its been uft for the longest time. ive seen it change owners and still be uft. i couldnt get anything. now i have an uc plushie chomby and im so close to be worth an actual uc ty krawk... and that one krawk went into a permanent home. im heartbroken. i was thinking maybe if i get another wn uc ty krawk then maybe i could ask them for a nameswap but im not even sure theyll agree even with a sob story. im so sad.    that and i just want to mention Euthanasia. that one is a real case of no one else gets them either now. breaks my heart too. i loved her so much.    edit oh wow i just looked up the first pet i mentionned their owner is actually active now. but the pet has been moved to a side which hasnt been logged into in two months. i guess they really had decided to keep her. welp.,neopets,d2eutwm,1,t5_2r64t

Honestly I just remember how strict my mom used to be when I was little and one time I had a friend on Neopets with a username that was something like aishalover or whatever and my mom got so mad because it said lover and shes like DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?! she was foreign and we have just moved to the U.S. and started to learn English so I think she thought it meant something completely different than what it actually means. She was so upset at me that I was using a website that used such obscene words that she banned me from going on Neopets for a while lol. I just always think and look back on that memory and compare just how different and less strict my mom has become overtime and Im glad I have that memory to hold on to because now it just makes me laugh so so hard.

7600152,0,t3_4jewgf,neopets games were made in a time when the same simple games you see on mobile apps today was what regular gaming mostly was.  now that phones are relatively insanely powerful in comparison to early computers it makes sense to ask why neopets hasnt released any apps but what youre missing is that you cant magically copy and paste a game over to an app you have to literally redesign everything to fit on to the phone which essentially means remaking an entire game.  that being said it doesnt make sense to invest all that much into converting a bunch of their games into mobile games if theyre going to be such a minority appeal.  thats why making a candy crushesque game which would more likely be a a sure fire game is a much more logical game to make than remaking an older game for their tiny audience.this is just one of the many reasons it doesnt make sense for neopets to have their games as apps.  not to mention that neopets was already essentially dead by the time the smart phone gaming craze was full blown.,neopets,d363kr4,5,t5_2r64t

7788478,0,t1_d3r8032,I dont understand why people are downvoting valid pieces of journalism explaining cultural appropriation. While I have read one of these articles before and am aware of cultural appropriation in particular the Headdress debate and I dont think this falls under the same connotations as a Sexy Indian costume or wearing a headdress to look cool while you get high at a rave they did politely add to the discussion. Remember the downvote button is for when you dont think they are adding to the discussion not when you disagree. But as to your comment I respectfully disagree that this is indeed cultural appropriation as it is as the author said he would be okay with all articles of clothing that are ubiquitous between different tribes and does not claim to be representing either a specific real tribe or the native American people as a whole. As for the feathers Neopets has included many battle aspects into the game and an argument could be made that the outfit was indeed made to be a decorated warrior. All in all an innocent outfit on a childrens virtual pet game being blown out of proportion. If youre going to get angry about the way Native Americans are portrayed on Neopets maybe start with the way the Inuits are portrayed on the site with the Igloo Garage Sale? Just saying if youre going to make a fuss I would call that the more demeaning of the two.,neopets,d3rhcm5,9,t5_2r64t

8142726,0,t3_4qrax1,My very bad luck has to be the last three weeks. It started when I caught a virus that was going around. Pretty bad but standard sickness. Didnt think anything of it until it turned into a sinus infection which then led to an infection in the soft tissue of my face. I didnt even know that was a thing. I looked like a boxer who lost a big fight including a black eye. Two rounds of very strong antibiotics later I am mostly back to normal but have nerve damage in the left side of my face so my smile is a bit crooked. Thank goodness for universal health care. I spent a lot of time in doctors offices this past few weeks. That said I cant have a beer because I am just finishing up the last of the pills and it is Canada Day. Lemonade for me which I can now drink without dribbling. Yay!Gifting  Wishlists and ScratchcardsSeeking  Wishlist  or Evil Twin Goatees  UN lilpawzz,neopets,d4vdwxy,1,t5_2r64t

I have the neopoints to buy one technically but Im saving up for a stamp avatar like  million more to go... and am just hoping Ill get one from either random events restocking or like a giveaway like this lol. My favourite anime right now at the moment is Tanakakun is Always Listless its a fairly new one that came out on crunchyroll I love really slow slice of life comedy animes that just make you feel good and its definitely one of those. Its not my all time favourite though. Probably one of my favourites is anything Studio Ghibli I grew up on it. Spirited Away and Howls Moving Castle is awesome. If were talking about a series and not movies probably Samurai Champloo thats just a fantastic well rounded anime. I like your first version Draik better. I love those gold rings on her tail.

8808329,0,t1_d76m4i4,The only real issue I have with how Jumpstart is running neopets is with how awful they have made the customer service.  This frustrates me because Jumpstart has very fast customer service for some of their other games yet neopets users have to wait months to even get a ticket about premium or neocash looked at.   I wouldnt mind Jumpstart taking neopets in a new direction.  In fact when they took over I was actually really excited because they are a company that has the experience and resources to bring neopets to mobile platforms.  Thus far however Jumpstart doesnt seem to have done much of anything with neopets other than keep it mostly running.,neopets,d76n39s,0,t5_2r64t

9349388,0,t3_58ke3y,UN grosstwinI babysat for a little boy a few years back.  A year into babysitting for him the family got pregnant again and gave birth to a baby girl  months later.  Since I was already babysitting they asked me to babysit both of them but I was fairly young at the time and didnt really know what to do with a baby.  They asked me to come one day when they were home to learn about the baby so I could babysit and I reluctantly agreed.  But when I got there and looked at that baby I knew I was going to care about her for my whole life.  She is  now and is one of my favorite people in the whole world.  I dont babysit anymore real life took over but I still make time to go see her every once in a while.  The little boy too.,neopets,d913pla,1,t5_2r64t

I think youd be best buying a drackobunny and darigan PPPB  painting one I dont think its one of the special onesscratch thisIt doesnt seem to fit the pattern of the other drackobunnies so I wish you the best of luck! I can say usually a painted petpet sells for less than the petpet and pppb combines and that is more. If it does restock I think it will come down quite quickly in price as it isnt high rarity.Its page on neopets where you can search it and see if its in stock links to the basic petpet shop so its possible it restocks there.

9881612,0,t3_5gwhkv,I personally think they should finally go ahead with an App they have talked about it many times in the past and scraped it each time. I did not have a cellphone with internet when Lutari Island was accessible so I never got to experience that  which has always saddened me. I know they do have games in the app store that can help but I think an official app would get the younger generation more active.I wonder if they are nervous that if they create an app that people will no longer use the website? I guess ways to get around that would be making an app that is kind of like the Runescape one where you can only do certain things on the app but not play the entire game.It would be nice if they added app only games and app only dailies and how about another app only land? You can feed your pets and maybe have access to Neomail or the Neoboards but other than that youd have to go online.,neopets,davliv7,24,t5_2r64t

10070556,0,t3_5jxtd0,Id like to argue that Neopets isnt dying and their quarterly earnings have been steadily improving this last year. In the sense theyre losing less I think theyve been doing a lot right and I think a lot of people just dont understand what a Frankencoded monstrosity Neopets is. Paging uborovan for perspective I can barely type an accent mark. But thats the perspective Ive heard from most computery people.Anyways theyre adding items to shops that went neglected. They brought back the Daily Dare. I participated in the Stocking Stufftacular for the first time in the Christmas spirit of supporting the site and am actually really pleased with a lot of the items. That godawful evergreen gown notwithstanding. LmaoAnyways theyve been improving on the event prizes adding new stamps pages. Theyre making good on promises they made in that April Fools joke like the Valentine paint brush and wonder why more people arent excited about that. Especially with JSs intention to take the entire site over to HTML . The quality of their content has been improving in terms of art though I think they still need to really rethink how they draw Taelia. Can we just say it? They gave her this bizarrely disproportionate muffin top in that coat. Plus on top of all that they drew way back into the archives of Neopian history and gave us a special Moehawks concert ticket. I bought  because I am mentally ill. On top of all this theyre giving us a new Battledome event. Ive spent a fortune on codestones training. My Uni is ready to breathe fire on her enemies.Dont get bummed get hyped and support the site. Theyre trying to do right by us. If their customer service is bad then spend some money on NC or premium. Help them.Anyways thats just my two cents. I will say I think they royally fucked up the economy. In a capitalist society theyd have to subsidize a good  of the products due to oversupply. Just sayin Jumpstart if you are reading this. The original system was designed by an economist to prevent oversupply in the face of diminishing demand. An extra row would have sufficed to eliminate unfair risk to players who clear spaces only to be sniped by opportunists. But the refresh was way way overboard.,neopets,dbk7se2,14,t5_2r64t

I was very excited to paint my Usul Starry of all colours as it was the first PB I wanted that I could afford. I remember being so proud of my Usul! These days my taste in colours has definitely changed for the better lol but that Usul will always hold a special place in me.I hope this next year gets better for you.

The fact that you do not know who I am or anything about me yet you claim my items are obviously duped clearly shows how envious you are. If not why claim something you literally could not know? Let alone it being obvious. Merely seeing an item and claiming its a dupe without knowing anything else is just your jealousy manifesting itself. And by that logic anything anyone ever posts on here should be considered fakedupedw.e. so why even come to this subreddit?I guess posting screenshots of activity on your account counts as bragging now.

Im premium and battle Jetsam Ace every day. Do you know how many Triple Tier Space Faerie Cakes and Nova Scrolls Ive tossed not realizing they could be used for an event like this?

But when I tried for real my first time I actually managed to get something nice. I know how frustrating it can be to feel like youre losing out when so many other people are getting these amazing things. Id say just keep trying. Play a lot of Ghoul Catchers through out the event and then use those NPs to buy items for CC. I really hope you get something good!,neopets,dda9whe,1,t5_2r64t

I was thinking about splitting half the bets on Ed and the other half on Ned but that wouldnt leave any room for safeties.  My only gripe with this set is the high chance of a possible  return.  If I could have it my way Id sneak in a few booster sets... but I can live with the return as there are several possible gt outcomes.  I think todays the day Ed can finally get it done.   straight losses assuming he can win this round will have him sitting at  win rate which is pretty piss poor and comparable to Stuff as of his most recent run.

11592523,0,t1_dg9z7gc,In my experience a lot of the SSW sniping I do doesnt really seem mispriced. For example I recently bought  Colorful Beach Shirt for k each from one person who had them priced as such. I threw them back into my shop  k. I dont see how they could have mispriced that unless on purpose. JN price doesnt say k no one else on SSW has an offer anywhere near k so they didnt see a similar offer on normal SW. This scenario is easily  of the sniping I do. I just see it as the quickselling of TP. Its not that they dont know the price its that they want to sell it quickly. I dont really see how it could be much else. Ive seen nerks being sold at  before. Its unfortunate but it happens... but much more commonly is the above scenario. ,neopets,dga0r8l,10,t5_2r64t

As far as Im aware you dont get banned using the price only option but generally thats only good if youre looking for UBs. If youre just trying to snipe cheaper things though youre not going to be able to tell by the average price if there are ones priced way cheaper so youd have to use the regular function eventually resulting in a ban for the remainder of the hour.,neopets,dgcrdtr,2,t5_2r64t
