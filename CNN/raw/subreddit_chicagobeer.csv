11623714,0,t1_dgdev3q,Agreed there are countless aboveaverage to fantastic breweries in Chicago proper and while FFF consistently puts out solid offerings I wouldnt say Im driven to seek them out over everything else available.A lot of their status as global best seems based off of the already existing hype for them and this is what enables them to charge  dollars per bomber at their kiosk for whatever limited run of blended stouts theyre selling that week.  Look at Dark Lord.  People seek it out the world over but unless youre talking about one of its rarer and more sought after variants basic DL is a really really poor RIS.  If FFF were to open for the first time tomorrow with the same exact catalog and output theyd probably be seen as a good Chicagoland brewery and nothing more.,chicagobeer,dgdk5et,2,t5_2sq9q
