I got the grill cover and bag of pellets for basically . Came will all the paperwork and warranty information.

385729,0,t3_1yhypy,I cut them in half at the pelvis giving me a whole breast with wings... and thighs amp legs attached. They look like THIS This allows for perfect doneness because I can pull the breast at  and let the dark half get to  or .  The backbone ribs and the cavity also shield the breast from some of the heat. A neat tip is to pin the skin with toothpicks to stop it from shrinking just dont use colored toothpicks.My prep is to mix a lite brine which is quart of water  ounce of salt and a couple of teaspoons of white sugar.  I inject the breasts and thighs then submerge the pieces in the remaining brine for at least  hours then I rinse amp dry add coarse pepper then some rub and return the chicken to the fridge for  hours.  I give them a light spray of olive oil before going on the pit.  One of my favorite rubs is Plowboys Yardbird another is Birds amp Bones by the Slabs.  For a spicier kick I like Dizzy Pig Swamp Venom or Jamaican Firewalk.  Layering the DP and either of the first two works great too.  I smoke them between  and  turning the dark halves at least once.  Sometimes I never have to turn the breasts.,BBQ,cfkqvs2,8,t5_2qxww

622310,0,t1_cgaz44r,Agreed on the mustard bit it took me a bit to find the right quantity thin but not invisible and when pulling the pork the bark it produces incorporates nicely back into the meat.  Im not sure Id use it for a piece of meat thats not going to be pulled.   I dont know how easy it is to find American mustard in England but its def worth trying.My current process is more of a competition approach in that that I lay down my dry rub on the meat by sprinkling it on then packing on a layer of brown sugar and allowing it to sit on the raw meat for a bit until it caramelizes.  Then I toss it on the smoker and sauce it very lightly at the end.Parboiling is definitely a different approach its not BBQ but it does work well in colder weather or when you dont have a device or the time in which you can smoke the meat for a longer period of time.  Once I got my Weber smoker Ive not done any boiling but it does produce a nice flavor for the meat.  ,BBQ,cgb09py,1,t5_2qxww

667491,0,t3_21sl50,Just about every lamb glaze or rub that I know of involves mustard. I made cubed shank meat last week using a glaze of dijon mustard honey rosemary cumin salt and pepper. It went over pretty well. A loin sounds real nice. Maybe a dry rub of roughly crushed cumin mustard garlic and rosemary along with salt and pepper would fare well given an overnight set up with the herbs and a slow bbq. ,BBQ,cgg55nx,1,t5_2qxww
669826,0,t1_cgfxor1,The build quality is good with the newer models. I have a black one I bought from Lowes. The side trays are metal instead of wood. There has been some rust show up on the lower pan bottom part that receives no heat and in some crevices in the side trays but its mainly because Ive been lazy with putting the cover on. I do keep mine on a covered porch though it has gotten wet a couple times. Some grill spray paint should cover up the rust spots and inhibit or minimize some further corrosion. Ive had mine for a year and I love it. It was worth getting if you are thinking about getting a BGE or similar ceramic kamado but dont want to spend the money on one. They hold temperature just about as well as a BGE but are a lighter and easier to move around. I got the Akorn primarily because Im in the military and move around. A metal grill will not be as fragile as a ceramic grill. BGE and others do not cover accidental damage only damage that occurs through normal use. Theres also a bit of a learning curve because these types of grills hold heat so well. They can get hot very fast and are hard to cool back down if you overshoot your temperature. Once you get used to the vent positioning you can do anything from low and slow smoking to high temperature pizza. For pizza I use two stones. One for deflecting heat closer to the coals and a second on the main grate for the pizzas themselves. Depending on temperature I like around F you can cook a pizza in less than  minutes. Check out  for good tips. Theres a section just for the Akorn. People do all kinds of mods and stuff to theirs. I havent changed anything out of the box and I still love it. Another note I would buy one that is not preassembled and get some stainless steel bolts of the same size and use those. They will last a lot longer than the ones out of the box. Ive seen the preassembled ones and some are banged up and put together poorly.edit grammar,BBQ,cggepj9,1,t5_2qxww

It will come in very handy.Aside from that  trial and error.  Start simple.

The sirloin end and the center are leaner.It can never be like pulled shoulder.... but if shredded is what they require Im thinking the only way to get close is to smoke it until it gets to  or so then into a foil pan with some apple or white grape juice cover and cook until it somewhere around  or  and maybe you can sort of tear it.

Pat dry then wet down with a mix of     cup good beer     Tb Chinese black bean garlic sauceThen coat with the following rub     Tb salt     Tb black pepper     cloves garlic crushed    . Tb New Mexico red chile powder mild or paprika    . tsp cayenne     Tb dried oregano     Tb fresh finely minced rosemary     tsp dry sageCover loosely and let rest at least  hours or chill overnight.  Grill over indirect heat to F internal temp for MR.  Either throw wood chunks on the coals or wrap some chips in foil and set near the burner.  Wrap meat immediately in foil and let rest under towels for  minutes until internal temp hits F.  Nice thing about tritip is people who like well done can have the tips those who like MR can have the middle.  Cut roasts in half then slice against the grain.Wrap stacks of small flour tortillas and warm through serve under towels or in tortilla warmers.

You can toss unlit coals in but do it gently because you dont want a giant ash cloud engulfing your food. You can tell when the water starts running low because the temp will start creeping up for no apparent reason.

You need to make sure your drill bit is bigger than the threaded area on the thermo that will insert into the cooker but smaller than the nut. If the hole left after drilling is bigger than the nut you will need a washer. Also I disagree with the posters that say digital or GTFO.

It was easy to use and control temps but after  or  cooks I quit getting a smoke ring on my meat.  After trying everything I could think of including putting so much smoke wood on the fire that I ended up oversmoking a brisket I decided to try lump charcoal.  The next brisket I did had  smoke ring all the way around.  And the flavor was better as well was a little closer to that Texas style I was looking for.I know the ring is nothing more than color and doesnt impact the flavor at all but the chemicals in the kingsford blue were somehow blocking ring formation.  The taste may have been all in my head or even even just differences in meat or how well I cooked it but I havent looked back.  I used the last of my kingsford to grill some burgers and have stuck with lump ever since.Lump does burn a little faster so I generally have to add fuel if Im cooking past  hours or so.

My flair makes it obvious.  I never claim they are the endall beall.  They are great products for what they do.If you dont like Weber no problem.  Doesnt affect my life.  But at least make statements that are based on some level of truth or firsthand experience.  You dont see the value in a well made product that performs as advertised supported by excellent customer service and lasts for decades.   Many people in this sub disagree with your perspective.  Especially when you stretch the truth or outright make claims that are not true.For clarification where did I claim the Akorn was not a Kamado?  Akorns are metal kamado style cookers what is your point?,BBQ,d3bv50t,3,t5_2qxww

7668625,0,t1_d3dlah1,Not really true.  Grilling on something like a weber gasser still has the  flavoriser bars or whatever theyre called.  When the drippings hit them they vaporize and produce a different flavour than youd get out of an oven..What that difference really equates to?  Beats me..,BBQ,d3dvnig,1,t5_2qxww
7708575,0,t3_4ktpom,Brisket is tricky. It has a lot of stubborn fat that only breaks down with prolonged exposure to a high temperature and its thick.Thick means you cant cook it at a high temperature because the outside will be overdone and the inside will be raw. But cooking at a lower temperature takes longer which means that the meat has more time to resist the cooking.How does meat resist cooking? Evaporative cooling which is basically the same thing as sweating so Im going to call it sweating. Sweating keeps a brisket from overheatingin other words from cooking. This is what is called the stallstalled brisket can sit and sweat for hours at the same temperature. Sometimes its temperature even goes down.Eventually the stall has to end if the brisket dries out so much it cant sweat enough to keep from cooking. At that point its temperature will rise and its fat will render. But it will also be bone dry because it sweated out all its juices. Of course if you take the brisket out before the evaporative cooling really starts the meat will be tough as leather because the fat hasnt rendered.The secret in cooking a good brisket is to minimize evaporative cooling. You minimize evaporative cooling by preventing it from working. Since the air can only handle so much water vapor high humidity negates the effectiveness of sweating. Im sure youve noticed this if youve ever been to a swamp in the summer. If the humidity is high enough around the meat you wont see those dramatic meatdrying stalls. Sweating will be kept to a minimum and the internal temperature will rise faster.The simplest and most direct way to increase the humidity around the meat is to wrap it in foil. You can do that in the oven or a smoker but it certainly wont get smokey if its in foil the whole time. Its common to wrap it in foil once it hits a certain temperaturesay  or . Thats called the Texas Crutch and it works though I dont recommend it because it tends to make the briskets exterior bark soggy. I like a crispy bark and moist interior.The hardest way to increase humidity is to maximize your smokers seal and avoid opening it at all costs. This is the same principle as foil but in a bigger space if water vapor cant get out the brisket will steam up the chamber on its own. Kamados are famous for making moist briskets due to their excellent seal and temperature stability.The easiest way to increase humidity is to keep a full and boiling water pan in the smoker at all times. Not every smoker needs a water pan but most do. Gas and electric smokers need them without exception. And if you need one I recommend a BIG water pan though remember that it doesnt really work until it starts boiling so make sure you thoroughly preheat before throwing the meat on. Water pans also help keep the temperature rock solid.Youll want to keep the temperature at least  especially if you have a water pan to keep replenishing the smoker or oven humidity from something other than the brisket. Ive found  gets the best results. And yes by the waythis will all work in an oven just as well as in a smoker though obviously you wont get the smoke ring or smoke flavor.Finally you may want to consider injecting. I know a lot of people here consider it heresy but it works by giving you extra wiggle room on your brisket sweat. Add another pint of fluid and you have another pint it can sweat without drying out. However if youre doing everything else right its easy to go overboard on injecting. And for all my negative talk of the Texas crutch I do like to wrap my briskets in butcher paper when they get to . Its a nice compromise between ultramoistbutsoggy Texas Crutch and crispandsmokeybutsometimesdry of a naked smoke.,BBQ,d3iew73,4,t5_2qxww

Thats why these low carb diets work because you body naturally gets rid of a ton of water when you lower your carb intake. Problem is once you start eating carbs you gain that weight back.Carbs are not bad.  Eating too much calories is bad no matter what type.  Simple sugars like processed sugar and processed grains are much easier to eat in mass quantities. Thus many think all carbs are bad which is ridiculous.

Once youve got enough to fill a crock pot fill it up and turn it on low all day.  This will render all of the fat out and you can remove the solids.  Pour the liquid fat into a pan and throw it in the freezer until it hardens then break it into blocks.  Its called tallow.  Im sure youve heard of lard before which is the same thing but from pork instead of beef.You can use it for cooking a lot of different things.

10108351,0,t3_5kjx8s,Great start to years of enjoyment on the pellet smoker!  Couple of pointers to try next time  Tie the twine to get the roast as round as you possibly can it will lead to more even cooking.  Get the roast above the entire drip pan and the heat will be applied more evenly also it will give you a crust around the entire roast instead of the top two thirds.  Go with a lower temperature for the entire process  I would use  to keep the entire roast in the medium rare range  pull it at the same temp just dont use the high heat to get it to that temp that is what caused the gray upper section and the perfect lower section.  At the end give it  to  minutes in a  degree oven to crisp up the crust.  For the people that prefer more done than MR I slice off the pieces near the ends and either leave them in the oven for a few minutes or skillet for a few minutes.  Great start and only a few minor tweaks and you will have absolute an absolute AllStar prime rib coming off the smoker!,BBQ,dbp4nqq,8,t5_2qxww

10452283,0,t3_5poapq,You got the basics right and corrected yourself in your post.  Most of what youre going to hear is going to be opinion...  How much fat to leave inject or not etc.  You can definitely keep a moist brisket whether you wrap in butcher paper alum foil or dont wrap at all.  They all add different characteristicsflavor to the meat.  Many choose butcher paper because it is permeable to a degree allowing more smoke in and steam out.  As far as trimming goes just try to take note of how much and be consistent.  I always score the fat deeply in a large hash pattern so I can more accurately see how much I am trimming as I am not a butcher and havent trimmed hundreds of these to know the muscle that well.  You got the temp thing right.  I use my insta read thermometer just to probe the meat and feel how softdone it is and pretty much ignore the temp til it feels right.  Most of mine finish above  often above .  Charcoal is wood so keep that in mind when deciding what smoke flavor you want some people buy specific types of lump charcoal to get the flavors they want.  I just use kingsford blue Im not sure what type of wood it is made from.  Many despise beef smoked with any fruit wood but for me a brisket is best with a mesquitecherry blend.  I also like white oak but I have to try a little harder to get it.,BBQ,dcsv8a3,2,t5_2qxww

11497577,0,t1_dfyytcg,This is about how I do it as well.  I have it going on the smoker then about  minutes on the smoke preheat the gas grill on high.  At about an hour into the smoke its F internal temp.  Put it over on the gas on high with Grill Grates a few minutes each side to get the sear.  When it hits  internal pull it off the grill wrap in foil wrap in towel then put in a cooler.  That way can finish preparing everything else in the kitchen then pull it out of the cooler when ready to cook.,BBQ,dfz90ac,1,t5_2qxww
11502030,0,t1_dfzpzlg,No I painted it with high temp engine paint. I looked into powder coating it but the few places I tried didnt do high temp powder coat. Also I wouldnt put any paint or powder coat on the inside just the outside. If you get a lined barrel youll probably want to get it sandblasted out as the liner can be a dick to burnscrub out. ,BBQ,dfzr6xn,1,t5_2qxww

11753119,0,t1_dgs8ht5,I dont have a Costco but with my experience at Sams Club its trimmed off. I usually go to a more local butcher though who will cut and trim it pretty much to whatever way the customer likes. A place like Costco will likely do the same if you ask or call ahead of time. ,BBQ,dgs8ul7,2,t5_2qxww

11758061,0,t3_67s3h8,gtonion catches a bit of the sauce and absorbs it while grilling and gets some of the flavor that way.Im pretty sure an onion wont absorb a marinade but I havent done any extensive testing on it. The science part of my brain knows that an onion has a semipermeable membrane and you could add something through osmosis but Im not sure how to use that for flavor. Id honestly be more worried youd lose flavor instead of add flavor. ,BBQ,dgst12s,1,t5_2qxww
11761349,0,t3_67t5xm,Have you thought about entering the world of kamado grills? If you are look to spend that much try looking at a Primo XL kamado grill or Big Green Egg. They are extremely efficient with coal and are usually ceramic. This does mean they are heavy and fragile but can reach temperatures of F or more without any damage which is great for searing steaks.Temperature control is easy as these kinds of grills are sealed pretty well and can maintain a given temperature once it is dialed in.I have an Akorn kamado grill. Its cheap and is made of steel. It is lighter but will rust eventually if left out in the rain. Its also slightly harder to hold lower temperatures but for around  works for me.One thing I do notice on mine is that its best to put chunks of wood buried under the charcoal. If it is on top there is a greater chance of getting white smoke instead of blue smoke.Because these grills hold heat well when you start a fire for smoking you have to light up one small area or else the temperature will get too hot. If the temps get too high it is hard to bring them back down.Look up some videos on them to see if that fits your grillingsmoking needs.,BBQ,dgt6foe,4,t5_2qxww

Then toss that baby over the direct side and sear it off on both sides rest it and eat. Congrats you have just done a reverse sear and are trendier than your friends.,BBQ,dgxi2db,1,t5_2qxww
