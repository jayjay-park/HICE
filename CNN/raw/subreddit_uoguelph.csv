2259331,0,t3_2l2jwv,It is on the UofGs website however it is really hard to find. It is about a  cut off for Human Kinetics They are not really going to look at specific courses too much except maybe Chem and Bio it is your average that really matters! Goodluck! ,uoguelph,clqz376,1,t5_2sb2e
3365909,0,t1_cpbtyji,So its the exact same program except without the COOP? Thats basically another way of saying Youve been excepted however you did not qualify for a COOP position. So at this point Guelph has no benefit over Queens or even Western when it comes to getting experience? I may even be at a benefit with Queens QUIP or Westerns internship program?,uoguelph,cpbxt35,2,t5_2sb2e

5694091,0,t3_3t34u7,Hey! I have been through the same thing as you. Your program councillor can explain in more detail but there are some options.I believe the most common method is to apply to a committee for Academic Consideration. Academic Consideration may take the form of an extended deadline a deferred privilege a late drop of a courses with or without failure withdrawal from a semester with or without academic failure or permission to continue on probationary status.  here is the URL with the whole explanation  You can drop out or even defer your exams to a later date. Also if this is an ongoing problem I highly suggest that the next time you take on a semester  you register with Student Accessibility Services SAS. They provide support and accomodations for students with physical disabilities  learning disabilities and mental health issues. The accomodations can include anything from taking exams in smaller quieter rooms to people taking notes for you to extra time on exams. There are a lot of really compassionate people there who are willing to help you as much as they can. They have really helped me in the past.I hope this helped. Also I hope everything goes well with you. If you have any more questions let me know. Good luck!,uoguelph,cx2wo5q,2,t5_2sb2e

5763996,0,t3_3u0e20,Most of the Making Box shows ARE standup.Keep an eye out for their First Timers shows and Im doing stand up there on Dec   also on Sunday mornings a lady named Erin White runs a stand up workshop at the space nicknamed comedy church.The shows usually have an open mic afterwards. Go and do the open mic and you might be able to snake into a stand up show eventually. ,uoguelph,cxbks6y,1,t5_2sb2e
6071220,0,t1_cyfa5td,One more thing the texteditor of choice for a lot of people seems to be Sublime on Mac. Familiarize yourself with that and youll be ahead of the game. UofG has everyone using Nano because its very simple to use but youll want to get into a better text editor ASAP preferably one that colorcodes your C and Java code and has line numbers.,uoguelph,cyffb3a,1,t5_2sb2e
6113751,0,t3_3yqdu4,Order only matters within school applications. For example Guelph cant see that you listed them first and Waterloo second but if you made two applications to Guelph for example one to Eng and one to BComm they can see which one was ordered above the other so they know which to process first and if you dont get accepted to that program move down the list to your second choice. But no Guelph cant see that they are your preference. ,uoguelph,cykkjr5,2,t5_2sb2e

7341258,0,t3_4ftc72,You could apply for East Residences maybe? If you get a single room there you have some private space but you still get the social aspect of it.Its pretty rare that people get along really well with their roommates but even the people I know who had the shitty roommates managed pretty fine through the year without it really taking away from everything else and now they have some great stories.If anything being placed with a random person is a great way to expand the people you get to meet. My roommate is an engineer and  years later I know a lot more people in engineering and related degrees that I would have never met otherwise.,uoguelph,d2cng5l,1,t5_2sb2e

9749356,0,t1_daemklq,If people want to use a MacBook let them. Some people like how they look and how they operate. You could put Mac OS on a Windows laptop but I think he probably just wants a computer that will work without the hassle. I totally agree with that if price is a major issue for him then yeah apple products arent good moneyvalue,uoguelph,daetkol,1,t5_2sb2e
