12597,0,t1_cefhl3r,I might be able to help you out. Your costs seem a bit high and so does your time spent. I assume the two hours is because youre cutting them yourself and using a die to thread them?Lowes and home depot will do this for you for free. You call ahead or just stop in and wander around looking for new ideas while you wait and give them the specs of what you want. You only pay the cost of the pipe.It then goes from  hours of work to  minutes. Also black iron pipe the big stuff is .ft and the largest one in the picture would only use  feet of pipe. The fittings are  a piece. That would put the biggest one just over .Also throwing them in the dishwasher on the rinse cycle really quick and hot and double drying them will remove the machining oils which can rub off on the books. Replace the machining oils with clear gun oil mixed with a solvent on a rag  to . The solvent allows it to spread evenly over the metal while leaving the absolute lowest amount of oil to stick to the metal once it evaporates. Any scratches wont rust and the books wont get ruined.,minimalism,cefva29,3,t5_2r0z9

28591,0,t3_1ueygp,Im not a fan of aesthetic minimalism in terms of always wanting to have surfaces covering everything. Im a fan of open kitchen cabinets while some people complain that they create visual clutter... but if you save the money from not buying doors you can upgrade everything in the cabinets to look very nice. I think when people want aesthetic minimalism what they really need is a sensory deprivation chamber or pleasant backyard garden or some small area in the house they can relax in. Nature is not aesthetically minimalist but it is hyperfunctionalminimalist so I err on the side of preferring functional minimalism solutions with the least complexity that provide the best timeenergyspace savings over aesthetic minimalism which I think is often rooted in cluttered minds that require external visual simplicity to overcome a lack of mental focus.,minimalism,cehor7f,6,t5_2r0z9

230084,0,t3_1wq9dt,Its a lot more than just moving.  The stuff costs money which could be spent on experiences instead Theres a tendency to accumulate stuff beyond the space available which encourages you to get a bigger place which youre then likely to overfill which encourages you to get an even bigger place which youre likely to overfill as well... The stuff becomes an integral part of your life which makes you feel like a fish out of water whenever you dont have it. This leads you to spend more while traveling which means you cant travel as much and it hurts a lot more when stuff gets broken lost or stolen. Constantly owning things creates an aversion to renting things which makes it harder to try new things.

351709,0,t3_1y2e6m,In my experience there will be some things that need to be landfilled I had a big pile of old CD jewel cases most of which had no CDs in them and no reasonable method of recycling them but other things such as clothes or books are generally pretty easy to get rid of.If youre trying to get rid of old electronics check our local countytownship and see if they maybe have recycling days in the month. Also Best Buy will take old electronics to recycle. In both cases you may want to double check to make sure they arent just getting shipped off to India to be burned in poor neighborhoods for the trace amounts of gold.If you have excess books check local libraries or schools  they may take them. If youre in a large enough city you may have a drop off point where you can donate books  for instance here in Chicago theres a book store down in River North that you literally just walk in and drop it off dont even have to talk to anyone.Clothes in my experience tend to be the easiest we have a bunch of clothes depository bins all around the city big things you just open up and toss a bag of clothes in. No hassle no fuss.Overall you can likely get rid of a lot of it without it hitting a garbage can but there will be a fair amount of stuff that might have to throw out depending on how much stuff you have and seeing all that stuff in the dumpster might be a bit disheartening. Keep in mind however that most of that stuff may have been thrown away youre just doing it all at once now.

372854,0,t3_1yajun,Cred my portfolioBefore I critique Ill say that this is a strong start! Id argue that the main job of a photographer is to isolate the subject and remove extraneous and unnecessary things from the frame. Therefore one can argue that at the heart of all photography is minimalism..  images is too many for this. Id pick three to five of your favouritebest ones and post those instead. It makes it easier to get feedback on specific images rather than in general. Plus it makes you look more talented smaller number of good images is better than a large number of good plus mediocre images. . vkzpE.jpg  This is my favourite of the bunch. Youve got the subject the girl in an interesting part of the frame look up RuleofThirds but dont follow it religiously. I also like ZYTphjp.jpg for similar reasons. You could crop it even tighter removing the extraneous pillars to make it a bit stronger like this But thats up to you. . ZYTphjp.jpg PQVCnS.jpg DtelpRE.jpg  I like the composition of these images. One thing to keep in mind is ensuring that lines are either totally straight or intentionally skewed. Pointing a camera up at a brick wall from a distance like PQVCnS.jpg will cause the lines to be a bit skewed but not enough to make it look obvious. Lenses also distort straight lines and it just looks weird. You can correct for this in Photoshop a bit but its better to just shoot from farther away with a telephoto lens which compresses and reduces the distortion or to shoot at a more extreme angle. Heres my Photoshopped suggestion.. DtelpRE.jpg  In addition to straightening the frame rotate it about  clockwise to keep the pole vertical make sure to crop out the buildingtrees in the bottom right of the frame.. VnnrFr.jpg  I think this is a promising composition. Id say that theres just a bit too much sky or not enough haha in the image. Perhaps crop it super wide.. Lighting for these types of outdoor images cloudy and overcast days are the best. Direct sunlight casts shadows and increases contrast. For really solid minimalism photos Id shoot only on overcast days and save the sunny days for going to the beach. . Technical Id use a smaller aperture bigger number to ensure sharp focus on all elements in the frame. Tripod it if you have to. Google stop ND filter if youre curious to see some really minimal photos and how to accomplish them with just a filter and a tripod and time.Thats all for now. Feel free to reply if you would like some clarification. And continue shooting!TLDR Decent start to producing some minimalisminspired images. With a few minor tweaks theyd be every stronger.,minimalism,cfjetrt,3,t5_2r0z9

Find some trash something broken or something you have two of. Clothing that doesnt fit is an easy one because you can easily donate it. When you start to feel anxious describe in words how you feel. Pay attention to your physical reaction such as accelerated heart rate sweat rapid breathing. Imagine how you would feel if the physical response was taken away. What would be left? Your brain knows you dont need it. Your logic knows youll feel better with it gone. The only way you know you are anxious is because of a set of a few physical reactions. Think to yourself that the anxiety will only get better if you push yourself slowly to get rid of it. Push yourself until you get that physical reaction and then breath focus on the positive image of a decluttered life and let the physical reaction reduce.,minimalism,cfzo7w9,2,t5_2r0z9

Make use of your full ceiling height for shelves by adding extra pieces on top and using pullout baskets on the shelves so they are more visually uniform. The IKEA catalog has so many great tips for that stuff.  Teach your kids the onein oneout method when they get new toys and gifts and also the idea of donating toys to kids who are less fortunate.

The color of the frame the material of the frame the color of the wall the materialtexture of the wall the color palettedefinition in the picture itself etc etc. All those tiny little details have to work together in perfect harmony and thats what makes minimalism beautiful to me.

1750537,0,t3_2egbnz,My first minimal distro that was good looking with a good set of defaults OOTB was CrunchBang which works great didnt have any real issues with it. Eventually though even Openbox felt like it was holding me back in terms of navigation and window management. Since CrunchBang is really just a few scripts and sane default programs on top of Debian Stable and since I wanted to use slightly newer but still relatively stable software I switched to Debian Testing and stuck the i window manager on top. After getting used to a tiling WM over a floating WM I feel this is the best mix of usability minimalism and speed for me. I dont run very new hardware my dailyuse laptop is a year old handmedown so I dont want flashy graphics slowing my workflow down. Im very satisfied right now with this mix and i itself is quite customizable as far as window management and external program hooks go. Id definitely recommend it if youre willing to spend some time configuring it to your needs and learning how a tiling WM works.,minimalism,cjztaui,2,t5_2r0z9

1802008,0,t1_ck65jdt,Im going to have to disagree with the color surge accent suggestion. That would draw all attention to it and the purpose of the room is to not have anything very distracting or attention seeking. The lack of vibrancy is probably intentional. Many people want their homes especially their bedrooms to be a restful calm place. They may be bombarded by stimuli every day and want their home to be a simple retreat from all of that. I mean this is rminimalism.Personally I thought this room had just enough interest with the white accents and art. Id only add something natural to it.  Some simple white pots with succulents on the side table or a jade tree to look like a bonzai in a rectangular pot or go big and do a large agave in the corner would bring in some life to the room to stop it from feeling static. But all in all I really like it. Adding in an accent color would make it...typical. ,minimalism,ck6aodq,2,t5_2r0z9

You can take as many pictures as you want then delete the ones you dont care for only keeping the ones you like. Pictures dont really take that much space on hard drives. Vacations arent something everybody can take so I wouldnt take it for granted. I havent been on a real vacation in about a decade.With that said if I had a chance I couldnt go on a vacation without taking pictures especially if its a place where youve never been to and or probably might not be going back to for a while. I would take as many pictures as I can but nothing too extreme like a selfie for every song or taking a picture every  minutes. I remember going to an auto show with my camera and I found myself taking more pictures of the cars than actually checking the cars out themselves. I went to the same autoshow again but without my camera and then actually experienced what the show was meant for. As for facebook..

But as a fashion stunted adult woman its a GREAT tool.Since I like when others share Im going to share... even if you dont give a fuck!First I did went through my closet in a bunch of passes. Quoted from another commentgtFirst I pulled out stuff I dont wear any more because of its condition pilling rips etc. For me this went into one of two piles trash and definitely donate.gtNext stuff that I dont wear because it  doesnt fit right now  the color isnt flattering  the fit isnt flattering or  the style doesnt fit with where I see my wardrobe going. These went into one of three piles definitely donate maybe donate and keep in case of weight change.Last stuff that I wear only because its there but that doesnt make me feel good about my body etc. I put this along with the rest of the maybe donate in our guest room. I neurotically sorted this into a few piles based on how likely I thought it was that Id miss it.gtOccasionally Id be getting ready in the morning and want one of those pieces of clothing from the guest room. If I took it out Id wear it for a day and then assess how much I liked it. If I wore it only because it was what I have and not because it works really well or because I love it then I put it back into my closet but started a list of items to replace. If I totally felt icky all day wearing it Id add it to the to buy list and put it the definitely donate pile.Once you have all your clothes IN style book then the fun begins.I sorted things by the categories I think of them in sleeveless tank sweater cardigan... etc. and then played Style Sudoku I dont actually have a capsule wardrobe so some of the outfits were pretty bad BUT it really helped expand my thoughts as to what might go together.Id love to see your results if you do decide to try it!,minimalism,cokjn1m,1,t5_2r0z9

4504306,0,t1_csxzdvl,My aunt passed away unexpectedly. She had many collections items she spent a lot of money on and a lot of time shopping for. Her house was filled to the brim with many lovely things but too many of them. Many items were still in the shipping boxes and she never even had the chance or the space to really enjoy or display them.Most of the things in her house were very dusty and dirty and covered in cat hair because there was no possible way for her to actually be able to clean and care for everything because there was just too much. Working on dealing with her possessions has been so eyeopening for me and really pushed me further into the minimalist lifestyle. I was already leaning that way but thinking about my aunt and how much of her life with devoted to buying things and rearranging her collections and cramming her house full of stuff made me realize so much that it isnt the way I want to live my life.

4941459,0,t1_cugsk19,I agree that the idea of makeup has a lot of strings attached and at different points in my life Ive been very pro and very anti makeup. Currently I have a couple different approaches to makeup depending on the day. If I wake up fresh glowing bright eyed Ill usually forgo makeup. If Im tired or generally feeling crummy Ill usually use a little bronzer and mascara just to make myself look more alert than I am. If its a special occasion Ill usually spend a little extra time to really go for a knockout look. I think the best way to alleviate any anxiety you have with wearing makeup is to identify your intentions. Most days if Im wearing it its because I want to look in the mirror and look like the brightest version of me but I also recognize on certain occasions Im wearing it to impress others.

5347409,0,t3_3o9ao1,There is pretty much NOTHING that you HAVE to have. Every ad and pretty much every other parent especially grandparents who want to buy things for their new grandchild will convince you that EVERYTHING is necessary. Primary.com  has a line of baby sleepers that are in simple designs solid colors. Pants and tops all coordinate and no busy weird prints. True necessities Something to cover babys tush whether you choose disposable diapers or cloth unless youre into elimination communication but Ive never done that. Clothing for baby a few onesies and a few sleepers. Somewhere for baby to sleep that might be a crib or it might be your bed. Something for baby to eat breastmilk or formula bottles cans of formula.  Something to swaddle baby in the world will try to convince you that you need eleventeen thousand. You need like three or four. A car seat. Something to carry baby in I use a moby wrap its just a long piece of cloth and works a million different ways. You dont need though I do not judge you if you WANT multiple sleeping venues for baby most people have a bassinette a crib a pack and play a rocking fisher price thing that people think cures colic and more. A changing table Lordy I never used my changing table. Probably not even once. A baby tub I plan to get one of those weird squishy flower things that you put in the sink for this baby but I have never had a baby tub before. Toys I feel like my kids are weird in this but as babies they didnt really play with baby toys. They played with empty boxes my face their siblings cups etc. Toys are nice to have but only get them if you want them. If you are nursing buy a very comfortable very good quality nursing bra but dont buy multiples until you are sure you like it. Buy thousands of disposable breast pads or at least four pair of wool. I never buy nursing clothing I just buy two or three bravado nursing tanks and then just wear regular shirts over them this makes every shirt a nursing shirt. Borrow a boppy or My Brest Friend pillow from a friend until you figure out if you need or want a nursing pillow. If anyone tells you that they had a miracle product that made breastfeeding easier I would probably buy that because Ive had lots of problems in the past and I dont mess around with that. Dont feel guilty about returning ANYTHING you dont love. Throw away baby blankets. Donate them or throw them away preferably donate or return for store credit. For your registry no one will listen but its a good idea to let the word get out that you are actively seeking to live a minimalist lifestyle and would appreciate gift cards to make purchases as needed. You will still wind up with ten thousand Sorry I just couldnt resist outfits in garish colors but you can just return them. ,minimalism,cvv6x1s,22,t5_2r0z9

I still have like  books that are not available digitally and I may buy one that I need. But I do think a lot about it. Not downloading music  illegally  anymore buying it.  So I put myself a budget and now I buy music. This make me choose what I really want and appreciate more.  Instead of having Tb of media that I will never use I have  gigabytes of stuff that matter. Scanner  This one comes later I use to have letters from old friends from my girlfriend mom stuff from when I was kid. Not joking but was tons of these.  I scanned everything and saved online. Boom. Space and I still have the memories when I want it.   this also applies to bills and whatever paper that arrives to me now . My scanner is a small one size of a box of sweets. Save stuff online  I pay some bucks to have onedrive plan with a lot of space. My computers became kind of dumb terminals when I work or have fun. But every file is online.   also most of my source code is on github or on the scm of the company I work for . My last acquisiton was a miracast dongle. I see the screen of my mobile phone on tv. Netflix and whatever my family want to watch is just streaming from the device.  I should get rid of the xbox and apple tv soon.    I dont play to much videogames anymore also . I have a old tv and I preferred buy the dongle instead pay over  bucks for a smart tv.  bonus can use the skype on it using my mobile phone camera.

5674003,0,t1_cwzpyyq,I get what youre saying but twin beds are less common over here. Or at least I get the impression they are. Single beds are fairly much the norm especially for children.I know that the bed sizes are different too. In the UK a single would be  by . So in a  by  room youd get a bed a wardrobe a chair and probably nothing else in. In my room when I was a kid I had two wardrobes built into the walls. So I had a bed a chair and a kind of shelf thingy that I had some toys and a music player on. Then there was a strip of carpet I could do puzzles on or whatever and that was it. It wasnt a big room.In terms of house size though the UK is small. If you Google UK house size you get a few links.The first is this one to a site called shrinkthatfootprint.com If you believe their figures a UK house is about m. Thats compared to small places in countries such as Hong Kong about m and China about m. At the other end you have the US at about m and Canada at about m. So Britain is half the size of the US in terms of house size.The second  and third for some reason  links are to the Daily Mail. Its not the best regarded paper but their figures seem to agree with other stuff Ive read.Whats interesting is that they have a diagram to help illustrate a point the author makes about parents partitioning bedrooms to create an extra room for a child. In both of the diagrams  one with three bedrooms one with four bedrooms  the house has only one double bed. Thats probably the master room for the parents. All the rest are singles.So yeah.

5812286,0,t1_cxhgkzq,The Japanese bathing ritual is very different from that of the rest of the world. Im not a scholar but its probably due to the historical influence of the public bath house. First you do the actual cleansing portion in a shower outside of the bath tub  the soap shampoo etc. Once youre actually clean you then enter the bathtub purely to soak and relax. The water is always extremely hot say  C F even if you soak in the summer. The kinda gross part about all this is that the bathtub water is shared amongst multiple people. Respect is shown by allowing certain individuals eg guests or elders in the family to bathe first so they get the hottest water. The bathtub is then covered up instead of drained after the soak and the next person will use the same water. This is why youre supposed to cleanse BEFORE entering the tub. In Japan soaking in the bathtub is pretty much a mandatory event central to the cleansing ritual particularly in the winter. They get pretty stunned when you say you dont need a soak and are down to just take a quick shower. And honestly those boiling hot soaks in the winter feel pretty damn amazing.,minimalism,cxhkhnp,16,t5_2r0z9

What I tend to do instead is watch for good sales on things and buy two. That way I have a back up one to last me until I see the item or one like it on sale again.  My husband and I made one large purchase at a warehouse store when we were first married and hated the result. It was a huge outlay of money at once it was awkward to store everything we got tired of things or suspicious of whether they were still good before they were used up we are frugal with our use of things so they dont get used up quickly and the unit costs were higher than what I could get by watching for sales at regular stores.  My husband buys a couple things he wants in bulk and I will buy things like nuts for holiday baking in bulk but for the most part I just watch for sales.

Get a pair of jeans you absolutely love even if they cost  and wear the shit out of them. And travel. Even for a weekend. Take almost nothing. Thats the best way to refine your gear down.

OK so if I were you I came back to the origins minimalism is about having around just objects that bring you joy. If they are not bringing you joy in the process of buying them maybe the way youre thinking about the object is wrong. A good thing I like from this sub is how it promote nonattachment when it comes to objects. I think thats whats missing in your process youre attached to the object even before you got it. Dont be afraid of doing it wrong and make mistakes youre probably buying things you dont even need and using quality as an excuse so you dont have to get rid of the object.Thats at least my opinion for what I read in your post I can also be wrong. Anyway good luck with that! I hope I can read from you another post soon about how you solved this problem ,minimalism,d2uwcrv,2,t5_2r0z9

7615172,0,t3_4jljc1,My fiance and I try to limit our screen time as we call it. It was his idea but I noticed a need for it in my life. At work I stare at a computer and reddit for breaks. Once home Im on my laptop or I was binge watch shows. I was only getting more and more dissatisfied with life as I kept seeing how I wanted to live online Why cant I have clothes like these girls? This room looks amazing! I want that. Ugh I need a better thing if I want to get better at that hobby I hardly do.. I needed a balance.    There is a lot to be said about learning and growing with the wealth of information online but I was on too much. My fiance realized the same about his life so in the evenings we try to do other things. Sometimes its a show we found together that well watch still screen time so thats cheating but sometimes its smoking hookah and just listening to a new album together. We go on walks a lot and most evenings we go to a nearby nature park and run lounge on the grass and throw a Frisbeefly a kite. Stop by a coffee shop and people watch. On the weekends well try to find free activities to do in the city. Or well head over to our friends house in the country and just enjoy the outside while drinking. We stopped by  half price books yesterday and picked up a book on krav maga. My fiance used to do a lot of martial arts when he was making more money but he cant afford it now. We think it will be fun to try to learn something new from a book. We start later this week. Well see how it goes. ,minimalism,d37t02u,16,t5_2r0z9

You may be able to afford your food and the clothes on your back but what about the roof over your head? Your healthcare? Your future? These are all taken care of by someone typically by your working parents or the taxpayer. Not to mention all of the services that a society provides such as police fire department public parks and so on.gt We live in a society of such affluence that the idea that everyone should generate more economical value is not only unwarranted its harmful both to society and to the person doing the work. Doing the normal thing means agonising yourself over a bunch of stuff you dont needIm sorry but this just seems like Fight Clubesque ideological nonsense. You imply that people only work in order to buy bigger TVs but productivityespecially on the scale of a society vs. an individualis absolutely not just for consumption. The more selfsufficient and thriving an economy is the more it can contribute basic sustenance who those who cant. The infirm the chronically impoverished the undereducated. There is a reason that high rates of unemployment are a bad thing hunger housing loss lack of adequate healthcare mental illness crime domestic violence are all correlated with underemployment.To clarify Im not saying everyone needs to have a  but the alternative does not need to be bumhood.

I just packed a small backpack  coin purse I didnt bring one but I wish I did. So many coins I recommend if you dont have one purchase one over there and bring it home as a souvenir. They really like exact change and lots of vending machines snacks games take  yen coins  packing cubes.  It keeps clothes organized in your bag. And then you can use it to store in your hotelbnbhostel. I stayed in a hotel. Then you can use your bag when you walk around. You will get thirsty and hungry so its good to carry a bag for snackssmall notepad and pen. Good for keeping notes  obvious one but chargers and cords. If you have a ds grab one to try and collect all the regions. I almost did. camera. If you have a phone like a iPhone  you can skip unless you are a super photographer. Everything comes out nice with just a phone. Phone download some apps like some basic Japanese to learn on the way over. I downloaded a small book that was free off iBooks that gave you some basic words and phrases depending on the situation. I can read symbols and know a little bit but it helped a lot. Google translate is your BFF. external battery packbuy extra storage anti diarrhea medicine. Just trust me on that.  light and warm jacket depending on weather. I just went recently and IT WAS FREEZING. Im glad I bought both a heavy and light jacket. i just brought one pair of comfy shoes.  I brought my toms I didnt need another pair. Things to pick up there and not to bring Small towel. You can buy these in Tokyo. Just grab one to dry your hands. A lot of places dont have dryers.Suica Card again  buy in Tokyo. Lets you use JR the subway and random vending machines. umbrella. Dont bring one. They got super cute umbrellas for cheap.A ton of yen. Pull out some. I and my two companions pulled out  yen.

8433006,0,t3_4uy20a,Our shoes have a purpose and a lot of work and time likely from some underpaid overworked factory worker in bangladesh went into making them. Try to think about all of your clothes this way too. I encourage you to watch the documentary the true cost on Netflix. The values it instilled within me about changing the way I treat my clothes and my shoes has many themes that can be used to reinforce a minimalist culture in the sense that its helped me make my buying habits ethical and sustainable. IMO all of your shoes look to be in very good condition. If they still serve you well and you still like them when you wear them and they arent overworn and falling apart you have no reason to get rid of them. Honor them.For example I used to have too many shoes just like you. And although its taken me a year in time to practice when I first watched The True Cost I changed my habits and my thinking overnight. A year later of my new frame of mind and that leaves me here today with three pairs of shoes that each serve a different purpose and that I try to keep in the best condition possible that way they last a long time before I need to replace them again. And even then they get donated as long as theyre in good enough condition. I didnt chuck all my excess shoes out at once even the ones that were still in good condition just for the sake of downsizing. I let the wear and tear and their use take their course and simply didnt replace every single one. Instead I picked the ones I knew I needed the most and kept those around Slippers running shoe casual walking shoe Along the way I wore a pair of boots and flip flops down to their absolute dying days. In the future I know Ill want a pair of boots again. I intend on saving up a little extra money to make sure theyre ethically and sustainably made and made to be durable with good quality leather so they hold up to a beating for much more than a year and that I will always just be able to take them to get repaired with new feet soles as they become worn down. To me this feels very minimalistic and clean and refreshing  opposed to how I used to treat shoes and clothes. So my favorite pair of Calvin Llein jeans that Ive owned for about  years now ripped in the butt at the pocket a few weeks ago? Took them to be mended. Five bucks. Good as new. Still my favorite jeans. Still only own  pairs of jeans this way.Rather from now on you should just be sure that you only get a new pair when you need a new pair  allow yourself more time to let old shoes clear out their space when its really their time until youre down to the amount you feel is ideal  and maybe opt for a different shoe storage that has enough room to honor these ones.In the meantime you can figure out what categories you absolutely need to fulfill with your shoes. i.e. Walking running dress comfort and fill those places with the ones that last the longest and are most able to be maintainedrepaired.,minimalism,d5vnzd5,3,t5_2r0z9

The Bible is also quite clear the Sabbath is Saturday not Sunday and I think the Jews can agree with us on that lol. I too think its very likely that Adam and Eve ate plants but only in a way that didnt destroy the root! I think only after sin when they had to go out and start farming the land that they began to kill the plants by destroying the root.I personally have been Highcarblowfat vegan for  years now.

8664872,0,t3_4yl1ro,Yes OP! Preminimalism I used to be a huge stationery fanatic. Id collect different notebooks and limited edition pens. Id have  notebooks in my cupboard with only one or two pages used. I think one of the most exciting moments I had was my first semester back at unicollege after getting right into minimalism. I vowed to myself that I would primarily use one pen with a few back ups that I would avoid using unless I really needed to. I ended up using the whole pen until it had no ink. I dont think Id ever used up a whole pen before.For someone who has spent almost all of my life in schooling with SO much stationery over the years I felt like this was one of my ahha moments with minimalism. I now only own one leather refillable quality notebook and a display folder. I can now justify spending a decent amount on a lovely pen because well Im gonna use it all up and get my moneys worth!

8694021,0,t1_d6rnv1s,I agree with the everything Bathmutz mentioned. I would also go through all of your supplies and make sure you actually use them. I am also an artist and reevaluated all of my supplies. Its different for everyone of course but I realized that I had inks pencils screen printing materials and some canvases that didnt fit my current style of work. Expensive or not I gave them to fellow artists that I knew would actually use them. Just a thought.Also you could either invest in renting a slightly larger space or if thats not an option you could get a storage unit for the time being. If youre not filling it with useless items and are actually utilizing all of your square footage between your room rent and storage unit rent to me it would be no different than renting a larger space for you and your stuff. I would also think about discussing the use of shared space with the hoarding roommate. If you both split the rent then it isnt fair that you are paying for space for their junk while meanwhile you live stuffed into one room. Personally Id find a new roommate andor room to rent but thats just me. It would be way too much of a mental burden for me to live long term with a hoarder.

I started to eat poorly I stopped going to the gym and never had any money despite a great job. So after a while I had enough. I just stopped talking with her or hanging out.

9542902,0,t3_5bje6x,I posted this another thread but its worth sharing. I find that making mindset changes is a valuable way to adopt a new lifestyle. So I worked out  things which minimalists dont do. Of course I am not in any way saying that everyone follows this or that you have to. Simply some observations.. They dont hold back when it comes to decluttering. Minimalists are willing to see what happens if they reconsider what is supposed to be a necessity. They try cutting things out of their lives  like home internet a couch subscriptions social media a hair dryer. When this does not go well the option to reimplement it is always there. More often than not they learn that they can live without said item.  . They dont let others force things on to them. A tough part of implementing this lifestyle is dealing with gifts from friends or family. The giver means it as a positive gesture yet this can be frustrating. Lots of minimalists know that it is important to tell others about your values in particular if the change is recent. Do not expect everyone to understand. Know that offense is a common response to a discussion about lifestyle changes. If someone does give you something you dont want or need always thank them anyway. You are not obliged to keep everything whoever it is from. There is nothing terrible about donating or giving away a present even if it feels wrong at first. . They dont shy away from emotions. This video by Anthony from Break the Twitch is a wonderful exploration of the tougher side of minimalism. Without a barrage of logos trinkets and sentimental items it becomes necessary to face up to yourself. If you have not experienced this it is hard to  appreciate how emotional decluttering can be. Minimalists confront their feelings  even when this is painful. It is not easy to disentangle yourself from the layers of possessions which were part of your identity.  . They dont succumb to the pressures of society.  Trends whims and advertising are of little meaning to minimalists. Many focus on their personal style or taste. They buyown what meets their needs not what is  considered cool. It is common for minimalists to focus on durability in their choices rather than aesthetics.  . They dont try to please everyone. Minimalists accept that their lifestyle might jar with that of those around them. Instead of worrying about this they focus on what makes them happy. They know that sometimes negative relationships have to be ended for their own benefit and that this is not selfish.  . They dont fear scarcity or deprivation. Most people hold onto countless items due to the classic just in case fallacy. Minimalists know that it is not a disaster to go without  for a short time or for good.  .  They dont dwell on the past. Holding on to sentimental items can restrict you both mentally and literally. Minimalists know that sometimes it is necessary to let go of mementos and move forward.  . They dont have a fixed mindset. Instead minimalists maintain a growth mindset. They see themselves as a work in progress always working towards balance in their lives. Every day is a fresh experiment. . They dont confuse needs with wants. It is easy to think that when the urge to buy something appears this means it should be fulfilled. Minimalists know that this is not always the case. Time and experimentation have taught them to separate the two sorts of desire.  . They dont expect instant progress.  It takes time to make changes in your lifestyle though the benefits are worth it. Once the habits are in place minimalists have enough momentum to keep going. This could be a rapid process or it could take months or even years.  . They dont look for fulfillment in the wrong places. Minimalists know that stuff wont make them happy. Instead of focusing on fads or pacifiers they find meaningful work relationships and projects. They have more time to make these areas count.  . They dont make endless pointless decisions. Analysis paralysis is a real issue and a key part of minimalism is leaving it behind. When you have fewer possessions small  choices melt away and leave more energy for bigger ones. There is less debate about what to wear or which makeup to use or what to buy or where to put stuff.  . They dont prioritize items over experiences. On the whole minimalists prefer to spend money on travel selfdevelopment and other nonphysical purchases. ,minimalism,d9pczlu,7,t5_2r0z9

10434077,0,t3_5parke,gt For me minimalism as lifestyle means first having an understanding of which things in your life will make you happier for having them and which wont. And then having the courage to remove from your life the things youve decided you dont need. These dont necessarily need to be physical possessions  they can be behaviours relationships foods notifications and many other things.That sums up half of it. Minimalism is a tool to help you remove anything you dont need which makes more room for whats important. Thats the second part making timespace for whats important not just what makes you happier. Its also a time saver to say Im a frugal minimalist and live simply. ,minimalism,dcqrtdi,1,t5_2r0z9

The number of people I see carrying chargerspowerbanks with them at all times is just huge. It seems as if almost everyone is constantly charging their phones. I went to a happy hour with friends last night and I saw no fewer than dozen people charging their phones at the bar and several ladies had their phones plugged in the powerbanks in their purses.How can people use their phones so much and not get fired?I have a typical office job which keeps me productive probably  out of  hours so even if I wanted to use my phone I couldnt because Id get fired for not getting work done.What all do you do on your phones and how do you have so much time to use them to have to charge them constantly?,minimalism,dda3ilq,1,t5_2r0z9

Granted if you move the desk into the corner where the bed is that is also not ideal Feng Shui as you want to be facing the open door from your desk so you are in the power position not with your back to the door.Good luck OP,minimalism,dfdkxs3,2,t5_2r0z9

Just have enough wardrobe items that you get value from and if you have items that you dont use or dont like get rid of them.Personally I have several pajama shorts and a few pajama pants for when it gets colder.

11678866,0,t3_66mj8x,idk. Just take it one step at the time. Minimalism is a progress and there is really no end. You always have to be active in it.

There is no doubt that there is exploitation somewhere in every supply chain and that we are both the victims and the victimisers in the capitalist system. That does not mean I cannot criticize severe exploitation such as what happens in Dubai. I can choose to make informed choices. And one of those is to never visit a slave state. the logical conclusion of your argument is that the only way I can criticize a place like Dubai is by living as a hermit disconnected from society and making my own clothes.
