5758409,0,t1_cxarrl8,Maybe that helps? I know theres a video of someone complaining about a clicking noise somewhere but his was RMAd.Edit Found it.This is under SOME load. CSGO isnt that hard to run right? The clicking is the fan hitting or something. But ignore that and you can sorta hear it? Still not heavy load though I think.,LaptopDeals,cxavvot,1,t5_2tvg5

6005508,0,t3_3xq6fr,Ordered a Pebble watch from them. Said used and fair condition or something along those lines. Received it and it wreaked of cologne. I mean strong. The watch couldve only been a year old. It was insane how strong the odor was from a silicon band. Ok planned on changing the band anyway. Turn it on screen tearing all over. If you dont know what that is its these black lines the cover and jumble the screen. This was the nd incident like this I had with them. TldrThey clearly hasnt even turned on the broken product they sold me let alone refurbished it. ,LaptopDeals,cy6upi7,5,t5_2tvg5

10740309,0,t3_5tnw5u,this is a cheap gaming laptop.Ideapads have pretty good build quality compared to HP Pavillion and Acer Aspires. An itb around this price point is normal but with a m this makes it a pretty great deal.Expect to run GTAV on medium at around fps and skyrim on probably medhigh around fps. Since this i is similar to a desktop i dont expect to play anything too CPU intensive. Its worth noting that this quad core i beats a dual core i UBear in mind this GPU is equivalent to about a GTX . Not a Ti just a . Maybe a tad weaker. Will definetly run games but dont expect to max anything outAlso sorry OP I hope you dont mind me commenting on all your laptops.
