Cool is one type of good so its an easy example. The other side of things has people demonized for doing well in school or trying in anything at all creating this whole culture of everyone telling everyone else how little they studied or did.  is a similar example from the other side because it demonized plain old successmoney more than being cool.

9213666,0,t1_d8iv44a,Id go so far to say people still consider gender identity disorder a mental disorder is due to the obsession over ultimately irrelevant things getting triggered by the most irrelevant of things flipping shit at people who didnt mean to hurt their feelings personally and the delusional nature that makes them think theyre so important that making other people feel like shit as a way to correct them is an okay thing to do because that doesnt just result in losing further respect and credibility not to mention creating a negative stereotype to be the butt of further jokes. Theres a fine line between being a completely functional human being who chooses their gender and someone who needs mental health treatment because they obviously have some issues they should seek treatment for that go beyond gender. Or they could just be an immature child who hasnt learned respect is earned and that acting like theyre psychotic irrelevant of how they identify is a good way to live an extremely lonely and unfulfilling life when no one can stand to be around them for personality alone. ,BestOfReports,d8jwfjj,1,t5_33e8s

10221421,0,t1_dc1jsyx,A lot of it is down to the culture a vegan grew up in. If someone ate lasagnas shepherds pies pizzas carbonaras fish and chip dishes for  or so years before they became vegan then they are going to try and recreate the dishes of their youth to some extent. Same goes for someone who finds out they cant eat wheat anymore for health reasons. Theyll still want the familiarity of things like bread and breaded chicken so people find out ways to provide for them. I see your argument like if a nonvegan Indian complained to a vegan Indian that their curry was just a chicken curry with no chicken in it. Yeah no shit. The difference is Indian food culture has had centuries of vegan and vegetarian dishes European food culture has not. In a few hundred years time saying oh my god why make my meatbased dish vegan? will sound as silly as it does today with Indian food or some Japanese foods.Another reason is that these things taste good. Nobody said the umami flavours in red meat such as bacon dont taste good and therefore its not hypocritical to make an umamiflavoured tofuseitantempeh foodstuff and call it fake bacon. Its just the nearest conduit we have in our western food culture. Vegan buddhists in ChinaJapan have been eating mock duck for hundreds of years and its named that way for the same reason. Giving my fake bacon a totally new name would just make it that much more confusing when trying to explain what it tasted like to others.Thirdly another reason people make veganised meat and dairy dishes is because they might be slowly transitioning to veganism and scared to do it cold turkey. Therefore slowly learning ways they can make their favourite dishes meatfree helps them transition more smoothly and less likely to relapse. Same goes with smokers who transition to nonsmoking using a vape or patches.So yeah I agree that constant veganised meat and dairy dishes are probably over represented in western vegan food culture but there are practical reasons for it. I myself was born vegetarian and so I dont have a craving to replicate most of these dishes but I still try some of them out because they sound like theyd taste good and they usually do.,BestOfReports,dc2nlhq,4,t5_33e8s

10301278,0,t1_dcb4ymw,I highly doubt that someone who smoked one cigarette would be listed as a smoker its generally self reported and people who barely smoked wouldnt list themselves as someone who smokes. According to the CDC  of people who smoke who get lung cancer is a gross misrepresentation. gtPeople who smoke cigarettes are  to  times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke. Even smoking a few cigarettes a day or smoking occasionally increases the risk of lung cancer. The more years a person smokes and the more cigarettes smoked each day the more risk goes up.The second leading cause of lung cancer is radon which accounts for  of lung cancer cases. If  of people who get lung cancer could say that they were a smoker and would be a common link between all of them it seems like thats the cause of lung cancer and not other ways.
