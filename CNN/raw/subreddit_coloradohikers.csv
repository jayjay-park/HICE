I havent done this entire loop yet but have done Hessie TrailheadgtJasper Lake and it is a beauty!

1379763,0,t1_cimsly6,I was there last weekend. Plenty of people on the trail but I didnt see anybody at Crater lake past pm. The trailhead is super crowded though...Super beautiful and most of the snow is gone though I recommend waterproof shoes and a walking stick.Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions.,coloradohikers,cip8kz7,1,t5_2tc5h

3652265,0,t1_cq37epj,Ive never fished Tenkara so Im not much help there but a ft. wt. is perfect and plenty versatile.  Dont spend a lot on your reel just get a low end one from a trusted brand.  DO spend money on your line so many beginners cheap out here and it has the potential to ruin your experience.  Good line will be at least  but it is worth every penny trust me.  ,coloradohikers,cq8l2eu,1,t5_2tc5h

3832538,0,t3_34b8lv,Elbert is still pretty snowy I would recommend micorspikes or snowshoes. Last I heard Half Moon Road is still snowed in so if youre planning on the NE ridge route you will probably have to hike a good chunk of the road as well. I did the SE ridge about a week ago with just microspikes but we have had more snow since then so snowshoes might be the way to go.Edit Heres a picture of Elbert I just took out my window. The NE ridge is in the center of the photo with the SE ridge to the left.,coloradohikers,cqt54xx,2,t5_2tc5h
4484088,0,t1_csvtlio,I completely agree on all accounts. Ive got a pretty flexible schedule which will allow for me to wait until weve got some nice high pressure in the area.  Ive heard of a few people pulling it off  and have considered the fact that i might get up there and only get  due to fatigue.  I hike about  miles a week on steep and rugged terrain so Im hoping that Ive got the legs...,coloradohikers,csvvuqh,1,t5_2tc5h
4528040,0,t3_3d39rz,Its really hard to tell this far out. At the moment its looking like your typical afternoon thunderstorms. The closer we get the clearer the forecast will be. I still try to be off of whatever summit Im on by  or  in the summer.Heres a link to the NWS forecast for Silverton. I usually look at the bottommost box to see tstorm probability. I also use the precipitation potential plot a couple boxes up.,coloradohikers,ct1ea1h,4,t5_2tc5h
4614761,0,t3_3e7cob,For big views check out the Tombstone Ridge hike on Trail Ridge Road.  Calypso Cascades is a pretty nice forrest hike in the Wild Basin area.  Can be pretty crowded but Emerald Lake is nice and you visit several lakes so you could turn around at any one depending on how you are feeling.  ,coloradohikers,ctc9qoz,4,t5_2tc5h

6378733,0,t3_4308jl,The Sandbeach lake trail at the Wild Basin entrance to RMNP has some great vistas just a few miles in. The trail is  or  miles round trip but you can turn around whenever you like. The entrance station is closed but the road is open which means FREE!!!! I went in late December and didnt see anyone else on the trail during my  hour out and back. The road to the upper lot is open if you think your vehicle can make it. Probably even more deserted. ,coloradohikers,czeoyir,5,t5_2tc5h

8037771,0,t3_4payia,The back side of RMNP tends to be a bit more secluded. If youre open to hikes starting in the grand lake area trail ride road dumps you out somewhat nearby Id be glad to suggest some hikes.,coloradohikers,d4jir8f,4,t5_2tc5h

8362220,0,t1_d5mk5xb,Its about  miles with  feet of elevation gain. I started from the Long Lake trail head at Brainard Lake. Getting to the base of the peaks is easy I didnt have to cross any snow until I reached the toe of the glacier. I put on my helmet crampons and axe once on the glacier and headed up Queens Way. Im pretty new to snow climbing and Queens Way felt short and mellow the angle isnt bad and theres a huge run out. It puts you out a little ways below the summit then its a quick Class  scramble to the top. Good views would climb again. ,coloradohikers,d5mtv3v,3,t5_2tc5h
