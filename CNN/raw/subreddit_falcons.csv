I think we are looking to get away from screens and head towards power run game with the  punch of Ingram and Robinson. Plus we love later round draft picks but the cap savings was of course useful while were at it though.  That being said we really are putting ourselves out there with risk in terms of assuming what the cap will be in the next couple years. If it doesnt get raised enough we are gonna have some big problems. But it really is an allornothing few seasons for us here since Brees is getting up there in age.The one reason this spendnowpaylater might work this time is because of the thursday night games.

2036726,0,t1_ckyhj9l,Smitty is doing EVERYTHING he can to not lose and there is a difference. At some point you have to stop being conservative and try something new. Simplify the defensive scheme stop playing so much nickel and zone coverage let the corners play man to man and tell your front  to attack the line of scrimmage. Are you going to get burned on a few plays? Sure but you have an offense that has proven that it can win in a shoot out. You arent going to win any games when the opponent is putting together long sustained drives because you cant stop the run or pressure the QB.  Next put the rookies out there and see what they can do. Is Hageman going to screw up and be taken out of a few plays allowing the RB to run free for a big gain? Yup. He might also make a few stops in the backfield or sack the QB though. Is Mass going to get beat on a screen play for a big gain when rushing the QB? Yup but he might also get a sack on rd down that gets the defense off the field. Is Shembo going to miss some reads and get taken out of the play on several occasions? Yup but he might also come up on a blitz and stop the runner in the back field or sack the QB. Right now Smith is just relying on a bunch of under achieving veterans to go out there and execute at a level greater than what they are capable of. He refuses to try and put more athletically gifted players on the field because he is afraid that they are going to make mistakes that might cost us the game. Id rather lose the game on a big play thanks to a rookie mistake than lose the game because we are consistently dominated from the kickoff until the final whistle. ,falcons,ckypobu,6,t5_2ql17

You dont think that led to Ryan trying to make something happen?I dont think Smith not allowing Ryan to run the no hudle at the end of the half had anything to do with that pick. That was all on Matt.gtOr the sheer stupidity of running Julio in that route and giving him NO CHANCE to be ready for that quick pass?I will defend this call. Same play worked very well earlier. If we ran its either no gain or a loss. If Julio catches that ball its at least a decent gain. Julio should catch that ball every time. The play was designed to be an extension of the run game through the pass game it was a high percentage pass that should be caught every single time. Had we tried to throw deep downfield I would agree with you.gtThese players are good enough to be a top team if they had Coughlin or Bellichick or any other star coach.Disagree. We just simply dont have the players. We have virtually no impact players on D. We have no pass rush. We have no coverage over the middle. Our safeties suck. Our oline sucks even harder.

What did the Falcons do right and what did they do wrong in last weeks game? More conversation on our divisional rivals would be nice.  Just simple things to generate conversations. Personally Id really like to see more playbyplay breakdowns of how our oline played or safety play. Or maybe just like a player of the game spotlight kind of deal where someone analyzes a particular player that had a great game.Just some suggestions.

They called a personal foul late hit on the falcon diving into rogers while he was on the ground. It looked like he was going for the ball while also putting some emphasis behind landing on rogers. Qbs are overprotected especially in that case where there was a suspected fumble....unless they had blown the whistle ruling him down but I dont think that they did.

3476968,0,t1_cpod8f1,Not as much as WinstonMariota vs. the rest of the QB field but there is definitely a gap between the top two and the rest of the runners to me.  Show me another back that has their sizespeed combination along with consistently dominant production against SEC and Big  defenses at that on teams with poor quarterback play where the defenses stacked the box against them.  They can both block catch return kicks by all accounts are great teammates.Although the recent bias against the value of running backs is understandable due to the fears that guys like Richardson have created in current GMs it is still paradoxical and nonsensical that other than the QB and C a workhorse RB will touch the ball more than anyone on the team and thus can have a decidedly huge impact on the success or failure of a team.  And yet still the position is valued less than guys that rarely if ever touch the ball.Value is relative to the other options available and guys like Peterson and Lynch do come along every few years and when they do they deserve to be top  picks regardless of position.  Do some redrafts of yesteryear and youll see RBs make a rise.If it wasnt for the bad timing of their position being devalued and Gurleys untimely injury these guys would be talked about as first round picks with more ease.  So this isnt a case of people debating whether they are two of the top  players available but rather whether they can get a productive runner later in the draft and prioritize other positions first.Go back and watch some of their games to see what these two guys did in their careers if you dont think theres some noticeable separation between them and every other running back at this point.I dont believe youd really take any other RB over Gurley or Gordon.,falcons,cpollr8,1,t5_2ql17

My only concern on defense is free safety but honestly you see a lot of defenses every year go into the season with some question marks but they turn out fine because they have talent in other spots to anchor them. Our defense has a lot more talent this year. But honestly the offense probably isnt getting enough hype. I think Kyle Shannahan is a much much better OC than Koetter.

The line played well in the second half of the season until they got dominated by Carolina. I guess Im optimistic I dont see where we will be bad this year. Learning a new system will be challenging but as I pointed out Dallas Baltimore and New Orleans didnt have much trouble making the conversion. I think our run blocking could be top  this year. Shannahan will use plenty of play action to keep the pass rush on its heels. ,falcons,crnkmkp,2,t5_2ql17

Maybe we really needed this L to expose these issues and we can no longer just shrug it off since we won anyways. The intermediate passing game for the Saints was easy and it wasnt just because they had Drew Brees I could have thrown to those receivers they were wide fucking open all game long. The offence obviously had some issue with ball security Im sure the coaches will pay attention to that as it seems to fall under the fundamental football that Quinn preaches. Last week honestly wasnt much better but it got masked by the win. We knew a loss was coming it was a matter of when and its really not all that surprising it was to the Saints at home. There are a lot of bright spots on the team still Freeman Trufant Ryan he will refind his form the Run D...In the end were still  and they are  Ill take our record any day.

6070328,0,t3_3yoymg,I think Roddy will be tough to replace th overall pickvia FA. We have Hardy a true possession receiver kinda like Roddy has been. I think Hester is gone before Roddy goes I see Roddy around for  more season.I like possibly drafting DeRunnya Wilson in the rd round even th would be awesome. He has the size of Julio hes   lbs. and the basketball background like Tony G. Would give us a big time intermediate WR but his character issues may be a problem. He could be the guy Hankerson was supposed to be and with his size should be able to take hits better than most other WRs although how Brandin Cooks hasnt gotten crushed yet is probably due to his athleticism.Im fine with taking a quality WR early because of the lack of depth of OL in this draft. We can draft BPA for DL OL or SS with our st nd rdth rounders or depth at those positions if FA signings. Then draft BPA in th round. EDIT Wilsons character issues involve  arrest in May for marijuana and drug paraphernalia. So far it seems that he hasnt screwed up since then. Also gives JulioRoddy a young receiver to mentor who has the physical talent to be a career Falcons player. DeRunnyas highlights  he has yet to declare but NFL scouts are interested in him so likely will after bowl game.If for some ridiculous reason Hardy will be our new  receiver If we go vertical speed recever draft Corey ColemanTyler Boyd. If we want Hesters replacement Braxton MillerPharoh Cooper.,falcons,cyfb4b3,8,t5_2ql17

6592231,0,t1_d014pqm,I kinda meant to keep it general.  We need to upgrade both ILB positions or at least bring in someone with some more speed to cover slant routes and tight ends.  As much as we play zone  and man coverage we really feature the ILB in coverage of the HB TE and sometimes slot recievers and we are really lacking there.Im honestly not sure the exact differences between the SAM and LEO spots other than the LEO is almost always on the line and the sam is only there sometimes so I suppose what I mean by OLB is SAM and thats where I think we are most likely to spend big Bruce Irvin perhaps or maybe Aldon Smith but unless Beasley gets bigger or biermann gets a lot faster and better at tackling then we still have holes on both sides. Thats where I would put JJ Watt and yes I know we wont get him.As far as safety goes I thought we had Therezie at FS only out of injury necessity but he was brought in as SS.  Didnt he play corner in college anyway or am I confusing him with someone else?What are your takes on the Center position?

DQ was thinking of trading up for him hes clearly the guy in his mind and he knows better than any of us.Shaq also honestly wasnt a huge need. Yeah we didnt get many sacks but Vic will start turning those pressures into sacks. Plus Shelby Jarett emerging safety was a much bigger need.

7445449,0,t3_4h8xje,So yesterday some people were really excited about this Will Ratelle guy we signed as a UDFA. His  cone was . .  time and a  vert at his pro day. Also after seeing some highlights some people think hell definitely make the team. I know we compare a lot of people to Paul Worrilow but this whole situation is actually extremely similar. I dont want to say hes just going to be another Paul because theres simply not enough information out there to jump to that conclusion but just keep in mind Paul had almost the exact same pro day numbers except Paul jumped . inches shorter and ran a .  cone time. And for those who love Ratelles highlight real its just a highlight real against inferior talent. Also Will Ratelle is only .. Very short for an ILB. Now those numbers for the most part are good for Ratelle Im just saying I have  expectations for him and wouldnt be surprised if he turned out to be nothing too special.,falcons,d2oi0mo,3,t5_2ql17

9104590,0,t3_54wjlf,I like watching this team too. The offense was just incredible against the Saints. Its the best thing in the world to see the Falcons run the ball because weve been so inept at it since the NFCCG and the offense was so one dimensional. Now the opposing defense just doesnt know which guy is going to make a play. Double Julio and it doesnt matter because it frees up other guys. Stack the box to stop the run game and you risk Julio getting open. Last season we forced the ball to Julio on too many plays and Matt threw too many picks because of it. But this season seems like the entire opposite. Every single guy on this offense is capable of making a play and thats what I love about this team.,falcons,d8684nr,3,t5_2ql17

And the Broncos D is the best at creating turnovers. If there is a defense that is going to bring back the Matt Ryan we saw last year it is this one.

9189616,0,t1_d8gt4lg,Broncs beat you twice last year with Brady. Dont get me wrong. It was a near run thing and the AFC Championship was arguably more of a Superbowl than the Superbowl. Pats vs. Broncos is becoming a good rivalry in the AFC but that is only because Denver has managed to climb up to the level of New England. NEs time at the uncontested peak is over.  Toms not getting any younger   I think the Pats need to make a push this year to get that fifth ring. Nothing will be guaranteed once he is north of forty years old. That stated NE doesnt really have anything to prove at this point beyond establishing that they can still win the big game after dominating the league for so long. ,falcons,d8gungw,3,t5_2ql17

9229523,0,t3_56rnlr,It still seems a bit premature to me. I am a Falcons fan but the defense performed against a rookie back up QB. Im not sure how many of those sacks were his fault with adjusting the protection or holding the ball etc. Without question the offense is for real. Able to adjust based on who the opponent is through  games and still perform. As much as I hope the defense is coming around especially hope Beasley is finally arrived I cant trust it yet. However the thing I am happy with is for the first time in a few years the Falcons are beating the teams that I feel they SHOULD beat.

In the  season Leicester City were only a couple of points away from relegation. Against all the odds the team clicked and won the  title with a  point lead. Secondly the Australian Football team the Western Bulldogs were a little like Cleveland currently are it was in  they last won a title and suffered a very very long drought. In  things slowly started to change and despite being written off and facing the usual big teams they went on to storm the play offs and win the title in .

10233554,0,t3_5miztr,Vick is plain and simple stupid for what he did. Had he not been involved in what he was involved in he would have most likely played his entire career with us. What he would have amounted to is completely up in the air. At times he looked like a quarterback that couldnt read a defense and couldnt fit a pass into any sort of window. But at other times he looked like he was by far the most talented player on the field that no one could figure out how to plan for. Essentially he could have possibly been the reason we never won a championship during his tenure while also possibly getting hot and singlehandedly winning us a Super Bowl. Either way his actions might have ultimately helped the team. Due to his actions we were able to acquire the best most consistent quarterback in franchise history. We will never know what Vick could have done or not done. We do know that Vick was talented and brought Atlanta football to the forefront of the league. However Matty is more consistent and ultimately a better player. ,falcons,dc4146k,4,t5_2ql17

10400387,0,t3_5oxsq4,Speaking realistically I dont see us picking off Rodgers on any short to mid ranged throws hes too conservative to throw it directly into coverage look at last week his interception came on a slightly off long ball. So if we do cause any turnovers I think theyll either be from an interception on a long ball or from a forced fumble after one of their receivers catch it. And the guys in position to make these kinds of plays are Jalen Collins Ricardo Allen Keanu NealIf Jordy is out I expect to see Rodgers test Collins deep probably with Davante Adams. This would be a perfect opportunity for either Collins to outmuscle Adams and go for the ball like he did against Michael Thomas in week  vs the Saints or for Allen to swoop in from centerfield like he did last week vs the Seahawks.Keanu will be huge for this game because hes the most likely player on our team to cause a forced fumble from opposing receivers he has  on the season. If we cant expect Rodgers to make a mistake we can gamble on putting the pressure on his receivers to not mess up.I think these are the two most likely ways we get any type of turnovers. And as such we once again need all our guys especially our young guys to rise up to the occasion.,falcons,dcmy8b3,3,t5_2ql17

Of course he has changed as has Ryan this season but its good to see that both can evolve. I think the Julio deal criticism is still valid since we did have some major struggles due to lack of defensive talent and depth but theres been enough time that that issue is more or less fixed.

Seen with Julio Ryan Alford Schrader etc. TD also traded up for Julio despite what BB suggested to him. We made Julio the second highest paid WR now highest I believe.  Im confident we arent far from a Trufant extension. Plenty of sources said we were close during the season but I bet the injury derailed it. But I could be totally wrong. ,falcons,dcz80h7,6,t5_2ql17

10658252,0,t1_ddemlj4,Frankly I believe this myself and thats why this loss hurts me.  Ive said it already that I can take Brady beating us because hes Brady.  But I cant take how much hope people felt before this how genuinely different this team felt from previous Georgia teams from any sport and then how this team ended up doing the exact same thing and worse than all of those teams anyway.  I want people to believe in Atlanta but the more this keeps happening the less people will ever do so.  It hurts knowing that by being diehard fans were the minority in our own city.  And it hurts because taking away the years I was at UGA for college Atlanta has been my home my entire life.  This is my city and I love it too much for it to constantly be ridiculed by outsiders or abandoned by those who do call it home.  This city will never truly be a passionate sports town in the eyes of the public until these colossal chokes end.  And I hate it because I am passionate.  And so are all of you on this sub.  I know we all want this city to care like we do however it takes.,falcons,ddfbfko,1,t5_2ql17

10670429,0,t3_5so8rl,Important partgt Prior to that Sarkisian led PFFs highestgraded passing offense in the country in  his first year with the Trojans.gt In that  season Sarkisian had QB Cody Kessler WR Nelson Agholor and WR JuJu SmithSchuster all playing like firstround talents. There they ran a mix of prostyle run and pass concepts out of spread formations. They utilized play action at the sixthhighest rate in the entire country . percent of passes leaning heavily on receiver screens and runpass options.gt Philosophically that all aligns with where Atlanta has been trending under OC Kyle Shanahan the past two seasons. And thats likely the most important factor in this hire.

Hes barely a day  pick. He was blessed with Garrett on the other side of the line and having him eat up a few blockers. Hall disappears even when he is going v with a tackle. He relies too much on his frame and size which is impressive and is a huge project player. Hes really a Hageman ..

11736350,0,t1_dgqb61p,I can see the argument both ways.  The fact were in a tight window right now with the talent we have means taking a flyer on a guy who the coaching staff thinks completes the team for this coming season could be argued for.  I see your side too because were going to have to start jettisoning talent in the next year or two due to cap we need more depth at just about every position.,falcons,dgqcfh6,1,t5_2ql17

11747688,0,t1_dgrjf9u,How about the one where your team purposely harmed other players to get an advantage. From that your headcoach was suspended for a year gm for half a season and a number of other individuals. But sure go ahead and act like you deserved that win. I mean its all you have. Only your team could waist the better part of brees years.  years on your team and only  winning seasons lol ,falcons,dgrmoo2,9,t5_2ql17

As far as McKinley himself Im not sold on it especially not when we had a chance to get Lamp or Foster. I hope i not picking either of them will bite us in the ass. ,falcons,dgusf4a,-3,t5_2ql17

11778804,0,t3_682lnv,Were probably going to take an OT possibly Antonio Garcia or Taylor Moton in the nd if not then maybe Davenport or Aviante Collins in the th if one is still there.  Also likely to take a LB in the th or th possibly Vallejo Duke Riley or Blair Brown.  I still think its possible we see a safety but that could really come anywhere.  I would still like to see them grab a TE but the only draftable ones theyve been connected to are Engram Howard Jonnu Smith and Jacob Hollister who is more likely to be UDFA.I think beyond these next  draft picks we make the team has looked at a lot of really intriguing UDFAs.  Seeing if any of those guys turn out on the  or PS will be more interesting to me than these drafted guys.,falcons,dgv5y2p,1,t5_2ql17
11779321,0,t1_dgv188i,definitely guard unless FO thinks Wes is absolutely ready. With Poe Garret Vic and Tak I think were ok to skip rd  on Dline. ,falcons,dgv8242,1,t5_2ql17
11779708,0,t1_dgv8w4y,Versatility and because the majority of the drafted OL they have been connected to played OT in college.  I think if they do theyre looking for somebody to compete and possibly drive our starting OTs to be better.  Specifically give Matthews a run for his money before we back up the Brinks truck.  OTs are also generally more athletic than interior linemen so a lot of times teams target OT prospects and move them inside.  Lamp was an OT.EditForgot to add we dont currently have a remotely decent swing tackle so bringing one in for that alone makes it worth it in case of injury.,falcons,dgv9myy,1,t5_2ql17
