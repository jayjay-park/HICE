449037,0,t3_1z6mas,I loved it. I thought it was the best local release of the year. Monk and Thig are both so smooth and those Justo and Jake One beats are amazing. Northern Lights was my favorite song off of it. Ive probably listened to it  times since it dropped.,hiphopheadsnorthwest,cfrb2zs,2,t5_30j5c
489835,0,t3_1z1rzf,Back in the mid s around  I started listening to DJ Nasty Nes Sunday night show Rap Attack on Seattles KCMU . now its Street Sounds on KEXP.  It was a dope hip hop show which was rare for the time in the Seattle area.  He played hiphop from all over but focused on new and upcoming artists or songs.  He would retire artists from the line up if hit the Top  on Billboard there were some exceptions.  This show got me into underground and independant hiphop.There were a few segments where he would feature local artists which got me into Kid Sensation Funk Daddy the Rascalz and a bunch of NW DJs.In my small town across the sound from Seattle there were a bunch of people I knew that were rapping and DJing but it was mainly at like talent shows and other small gigs.  One of the most popular MCs was my friends brother who went by Geological.Fast forward a few years I was talking to another one of my friends and he told me that GeorgeGeological had just put out an album as part of the group Blue Scholars.  I immediately picked up the Blue Notebook album and was hooked.  After a few years I started seeing more and more artists coming from the UpperLeft and have been a big fan ever since.,hiphopheadsnorthwest,cfvy4m0,1,t5_30j5c
