6866072,0,t3_3l1qog,What happens if you switch car insurance?Had a policy with my mother and due to conflict between the family I got my own policy and she moved out of town and has her own. However she was behind on the payments I had no idea I just gave her the money every month in the form of a check and after splitting the insurance Im stuck with a  dollar bill just to continue my insurance that wasnt paid by my mother. I would like to somehow get around this and I was wondering what the consequences were if I were to not pay this payment and get car insurance elsewhere.,ihowtoinfo,d0ukvn6,1,t5_33mo5
