8715061,0,t3_4zbcgl,Ever since I saw Days of Future Past I thought it would be interesting to have an Xmen series where theyre mostly persecuted and you see only some nonmutant heroes that are often persecuted by association so they lay low they avoid the mutants and many have been hunted down just like many of the mutants until the sentinals destroy everything then once wolverine goes back and changes it you have a timeline where theyre mostly tolerated so they team up with nonmutant heroes a lot more go out in the open more and more of them are alive at all now. more mutants too. This would become the main final timeline.,RewritingTheMCU,d6v0r7u,2,t5_3fzza
