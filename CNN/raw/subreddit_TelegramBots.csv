4624175,0,t1_ctd7mmo,Haha yes Im definitely tired  Now the situation is finally normal again and ready for the growth. About my contact Ill add it youre right. It was available on Paquebot but as it was not working well its bad. About the advertising the message at the end is my only way to promote my service which is free. Also I dont put it on start which make it not invasive at all in my opinion  Ill think about it!Thanks for your feedbacks!!!,TelegramBots,ctdg8wt,1,t5_38taf

5150754,0,t1_cv5mhed,So bad. But I guess its a real problem when the bots talking to each other do not belong to the same human. or its not assuming you could kick one or bothThat wouldve been really cool.,TelegramBots,cv6uxs7,1,t5_38taf
5159026,0,t1_cv7ufw1,why not a small and simple command?like p pikachu for example.,TelegramBots,cv7urus,1,t5_38taf
5810900,0,t3_3urltv,Since you cannot write such a link as a normal message in a normal chat as far as I know its not possible. I would suggest you to use commandparams and also recognize this pattern by your bot. ,TelegramBots,cxhebac,2,t5_38taf

8638917,0,t3_4wpe8p,Seems like it would be cool but my group doesnt want to play all at once. Why does it force the game to end if no one is active for a couple minutes... Its a chat room we can play all throughout the day.,TelegramBots,d6lh1rj,1,t5_38taf
9905010,0,t1_dayin2u,Youre right. I cant do this for show xx menus because of single message problem but I will do this for other menus. ,TelegramBots,dayn9p6,1,t5_38taf

11137342,0,t1_deuefq4,Theres something really cool about those arm servers but I havent quite made them work out yet. In this case the CPU speed was a bit too slow and it affected the latency so you ended up giving up before the gifs were generated. I do think these arm servers will probably take over one day they seem to have a lot of potential advantages. ,TelegramBots,deuen9b,2,t5_38taf
11214651,0,t1_df1mrd9,Ah didnt know that. Cant help you then sorry. ,TelegramBots,df3617t,1,t5_38taf
