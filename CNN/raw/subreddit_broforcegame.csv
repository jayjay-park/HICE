2572161,0,t3_2i5mxn,This is a pretty old thread but heres my input anyways.  There is an easy way to make almost any singleplayer mode PC game including Broforce the Expendabros and Broforce Brototype run in super slow motion using CheatEngine  Once you have it installed do this. In CheatEngine go to Edit gt Settings. In the list on the left side click on hotkeys and find where it says Toggle the speedhack and Speedhack speed .. Click on Speedhack speed  and in the box at the top right under the word hotkey press a key you want to trigger slow motion I always use  for some reason.  Click the box that says Speed and put in a number like . or ..  . Click on Toggle the speedhack and pick a key to disable slow motion I always use   It doesnt matter as long as the key isnt used by the game.  Click OK.  These settings are persistent so you dont have to redo them all every time you open CheatEngine or switch games.ampnbspTo UseStart your game and alttab out of it.  In the top right of the main CheatEngine window under the word File theres a little CRT monitor icon thats probably flashing gently.  Click on it and navigate to your running game in the list of processes.  Open the game back up and try out your hotkeys it can take a few seconds to get started.  You can switch from game to game by simply selecting a different process from the list without changing any settings.ampnbspIt has worked for nearly every game Ive tried it on including Borderlands  amp  Far Cry  WatchDogs and the Portal and HalfLife games.  It does not simply display your frames slower  you can still play at FPS while the game is running at th the speed.  Audio continues at a normal speed though so if youre trying to make a falsified montage of you quickscoping NPCs in Far Cry youre going to have do do some work with the audio to make it realistic.  It doesnt work in online multiplayer games but does in player Broforce  computer multiple controllers.  ampnbspampnbspIt would suck if devs decided this was a problem and found a way to prevent it from happening  please distribute this information responsibly,broforcegame,cmubiyr,3,t5_31iov

5612677,0,t3_3rz303,Ill always have a soft spot for MacBrover. Hes the one who first got me hooked on the game because when hes introduced you cant keep going in guns blazing. You have to be more strategic. That changeup of the game dynamic really appealed to me. Also if you look closely he climbs walls using gum not a knife.,broforcegame,cwst1yu,7,t5_31iov

6959715,0,t3_4avdkh,Hello Bros  Yeah Im just a poor student so I depend a lot on these free games to get me through the month. Saying that I try to get the most out of them by trying to get the  complete score. Anyways this is the only game so far in which I cant bc with the start up glitch IRONBRO mode is impossible. Hard mode was a mess as I could only past the forcefield with TimeBro. This means to pass ironbro I have to survive with TimeBro make it to the forcefield and then pass on the first goal and take on Satan. Oh no bros.,broforcegame,d157vq9,1,t5_31iov
9824533,0,t3_5fz0d7,I actually talked to one of the devs about this four months back. They said gt Its a huge job releasing a PS update  were already lagging behind with trying to get the performance fix update out. I think its likely well wait until theres another PC update out and then release both together on PS maybe early next year. Not sure yet so dont quote me If you see this anonymous dev Im sorry for quoting you.,broforcegame,dao5o3v,2,t5_31iov
