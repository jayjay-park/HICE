714978,0,t3_22cqj9,. Boat leaving from cartagena is the way to go.  Not going to be as cheap as you want it to be..  No reason to spend any time in Costa Rica if you are on a budget with Panama and Nicaragua next door.  That being said it is possible to backpack cheaply anywhere in the world if you are committed to it.. Very true go from Bocas in Panama to Puerto Viejo spend as many days there as you wish staying at Rocking Js.  Take the rafting trip and get dropped in San Jose you will probably have to spend a night before catching a bus north.  If nature is your thing it wont kill you to stop in Santa Elena but dont waste your time on Arenal.  I spent  nights in Costa Rica one in Puerto Viejo one in San Jose one in Santa Elena and that felt like plenty.. Why are you asking any of these questions if you have done any backpacking before just hop on a plane and go.  Everything will sort its self out..  Realistically the best place is Banos in Ecuador because you arent going to make it to Leticia in Colombia.,Shoestring,cgljopz,0,t5_2vv1j

Its nice and fun and you will probably spend less than in the city. Also other adventure sports bungee paragliding rafting etc. Theres some awesome culturally rich  heritage sites. Lots of other things to do based on what youre into. Some cool volunteering opportunity too.Heres a rough price estimate btw   Hotel midrange    per day  Food   per day  Trekking  tourist permits averaged   per day.So a bigg estimate would be  per person per day or  for two.,Shoestring,chzm6ri,3,t5_2vv1j
1341517,0,t3_29fljc,for    daysI would strongly encourage you to abandon the idea of  day stays. Even in the context of an organized tour where you have everything organized and booked for you such short starts become grueling very quickly. If you are sorting out your own accommodation transport etc let alone hitchhiking you will literally spent your entire time sorting out the mechanics of the trip and will never have time to do anything else.If you really want to blitz through a lot of locations do a tour and let someone else worry about your transport and booking accommodation.You can do  day stays one after the other if you are prepared to just get your wallet out and pay for things with limited ability to shop around for good deals. If you want to travel cheaply you need to slow down. The faster you move the more expensive everything is.Have you done any hitchhiking or couchsurfing before? Hitching is going to play havoc with your schedule. Only do it either as a last resort if you dont mind how long it takes you to arrive or if you dont mind where you are going. Meanwhile couch surfing is likely to demand a fair degree of scheduling. From what I know you will have more luck if you line up your stays with some advance notice ie I would like to stay for two nights on these specific dates a week from now. Saying I am in town right now and need somewhere to sleep can work but it turns a lot of hosts off you.,Shoestring,cikjb87,7,t5_2vv1j
1526296,0,t3_2bntyy,Im sure some London locals can give you more advice than I can but heres some stuff for starters Conveniently uTheMackdockery just posted this article which should give you some ideas. As it says in that article there are loads of free museumsgalleries in London hopefully you should be able to find something youre interested in. The Tate Modern and the VampA are my favourites but you could also try Tate Britain the National Gallery or the National Portrait Gallery for more traditional stuff. If youre not really into art the British Museum has an amazing collection housed in an amazing building the Science Museum is pretty good and Ive heard that the Natural History Museum right next to the Science Museum is good as well.If the weather stays as hot as it is right now you might want to go visit the swimming ponds on Hampstead Heath. Theyre free to use and theres a mens pond a womens pond and a mixed pond.If youre into music here is a link for some places to see free gigs. If you go down to the Southbank Centre you can also hang out by the riverside and watch the skaters in the graffiticovered park underneath  definitely worth a look.As for places to stay Id recommend you Couchsurf if you can! A hostel in London would be expensive particularly as youre going at the height of summer and if you Couchsurf your hosts will definitely be able to give you tips on more free things to do.Hope that helps have a good trip!Edit also re transport  London is massive and trying to walk everywhere will be knackering. It would probably be best if you bought a day travelcard for whichever zones youre going to be in that day. That will give you unlimited travel on the underground on buses and on trains within those zones. Londoners use Oyster cards which give you a bit of a discount but because youre only there for a short time I dont think it would be worth you buying one  maybe check with someone who knows more about it!,Shoestring,cj7ljvl,1,t5_2vv1j

2205071,0,t1_cl9gjin,Volunteering to help others in need is very commendable but please please do your research. Think of what it is you will actually be helping with for example if you are there to build then what construction knowledge do you actually have? If you have none then it may be that you will be more of a hinderance than a help and not only that but a drain on resources and taking an opportunity away from a local who needs training.In addition to this you need to be very aware and knowledgeable about the companys you are working for.

My plane ticket was  and I flew with Southwest in February dates play a huge role in plane ticket price as does the day you search and the days of the week you fly. August is a little bit more expensive to fly but search for plane tickets I just ran it thru Google at first and see which days of the week yield cheapest results and do this search more than one day IME searching on Tuesday yielded the best results but YMMV. I stayed in an  person dorm at a hostel called Adelaide that was about  a night.
