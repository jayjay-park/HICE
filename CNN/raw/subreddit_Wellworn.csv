8310080,0,t3_4tbqfd,I wonder if there is more to it than simple foot traffic. Cleaning chemicals for dropped food perhaps? Or even one dropped dish could have caused a crack or chip and the chip progressively became larger. ,Wellworn,d5gbezp,8,t5_35ozl
9220947,0,t3_56nvdy,Ive had this for five years  the film winding mechanism always jammed on the fifth or sixth frame so I pulled off the leatherette opened up the camera and blew at the gears which seemed to fix things. I painted that half of the camera white.The automatic shutter cocking mechanism was always iffy so I just removed the bar. With the Mamiya TLRs the shutter is in the lens so the box just holds and winds the film. It still works and the lenses are super with lovely bokeh.,Wellworn,d8ktmnh,3,t5_35ozl
