6588727,0,t1_d00tf7o,Je suis francophone habibi and Chinese. English is not my mother tongue.This is why my English can seem shaky from times to times.My main area of focus in term of research is actually public policy as a doctoral candidate and Ive done my fair share of translation from French to English which is why I was selected to be on the mod team.EDIT edited out my research specialization.I know you might still be unhappy about the removal of the ronpaulinstitute article and i do understand why but we cannot allow blogpost that wouldnt be tolerated as a selfpost from our users.However you are right on the media content analysis and they are absolutely welcome as a selfpost if they are actually relevant. If you want to do one feel free to do so. If you need a quantitative analytical tool such as lexisnexis and you dont have it you can always PM me.,watchthemods,d00ttok,3,t5_3cigh
