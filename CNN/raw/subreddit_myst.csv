1317220,0,t1_cihsnp0,Yeah I figure by  well have some semblance of a finished product and then maybe by  the game that everyone always wanted. I dont care what that game costs I will pay for it. as for this latest version of realMyst  Im thinking the critics who say it looks a little fake are likely seeing whatever effects the engine generates that will provide the look and feel for obduction. shininess of surfaces day and night cycles and water seem to be a major focus for the engine it seems. ,myst,cihsyl9,1,t5_2qhdu

2873679,0,t1_cntoq7d,Ive been super critical of pretty much every fan film Ive seen especially all the recent ones looking for crowdfunding but that trailer was phenomenal. You nailed the look and tone of the series everything from the candlelighting to the colour palette to the sound of that stone grinding at the end for me that sound will forever be tied to Myst.Im sad this isnt going anywhere you seem to have had an awesome vision for it. Although you arent allowed to crowdfund it are you allowed to shop around for grants or media funds? It probably highly depends on where youre located but here in Canada we have a number of funding options for independent filmmakers.Also Legendary should totally give you a call. If Robyn amp Cyan were considering you anyway I think thats accreditation enough.,myst,cnuqkua,1,t5_2qhdu

3763712,0,t3_33b2oy,You mean something like this?Heres what it should look like with Jehons Dni font at the top and Cyans on the bottom. I think it looks better with the former.

6958609,0,t1_d151yvh,According to the Book of Atruss Anna directed Katran as she altered Riven moments before Atrus jumped into the fissure and made his escape to Myst island. As for why Gehn never removed them... I like to think they were so incredibly heavy and difficult to move and with the thought of doing so potentially being sacrilege that he left them there and chose to focus on active control rather than symbolic control.,myst,d153cml,2,t5_2qhdu
7112759,0,t1_d1mknx6,These files You may directly be able to copy them off the disk without running the installer. Apparently people have been successful with that.Unfortunately I cant help you more I used the GoG version of the game to get the data files the GoG version fixes a lot of compatibility issues but was still too buggy for me. You can try that if the CD continues not to work its  ,myst,d1mmgq1,1,t5_2qhdu

8963597,0,t1_d7p1y1i,I agree Myst  has its issues but it looks amazing minus a few unpolished parts. Definitely worth playing. In fact the only thing Im not crazy about is the story but its ok enough for me. The rest is pretty great actually.,myst,d7pafe7,2,t5_2qhdu

9017791,0,t3_53rjcz,If you find that you are really stuck and thinking about giving up rather than looking at a guide consider using something like UHSHints.You can reveal hints onebyone that will nudge you in the right direction before finally giving you the solution if you really cant do it.As for figuring out the puzzles by yourself along with what the others have said if you arent already taking notes you should start taking notes. Draw out the problem note down what you have tried what you think needs to happen etc.,myst,d7vsq7v,7,t5_2qhdu

10016844,0,t1_dbb389g,Can confirm. I dont know much about Myst or played them really but it uses the original assets when it could have used the D models of real Myst DS can handle it if at lower resolution and the biggest problem being the terrible controls. It takes the literal X and Y values of the circle pad and uses them to place the cursor at the corresponding X and Y value positions on screen rather than using the circle pad to move the cursor like a mouse guess it made too much sense.,myst,dbd81u9,2,t5_2qhdu
10260828,0,t1_dc423i8,I can definitely recommend Uru! Its the largest of all the games in scope with loads of Ages along with the Dni city. Ive always looked at Uru as an exploration game you are specifically playing an explorer meant to be you in classic Myst fashion discovering the remnants of the Dni civilization. And that feeling of exploration is nailed perfectly its a very atmospheric game with lots of stuff to find.A common complaint about Uru is that it doesnt have any plot which is true in a sense there are no current events unfolding around you and you almost dont meet any characters save for voice recordings and such. But there is a lot of storyrelated content to discover about the Dni about Yeesha about the modernday restoration efforts... Its very rich overall and regarding story connects strongly to Myst V if youve played that.Of course one should be aware that Uru did not turn out to be what it was originally intended to be a constantly evolving multiplayer experience so there are some places that are strangely empty or some elements that dont quite fit. But it really adds a lot to the franchise.,myst,dc74cvf,2,t5_2qhdu
