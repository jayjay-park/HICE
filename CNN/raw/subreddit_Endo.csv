So it is really important she finds an endo specialist.

524666,0,t1_cfzvzr9,I hear ya! Its so hard to focus when youre in that much pain. It really drains you. I used to work in a stressful office job. It was good that I was seated and I could use a heat pack but maintaining the veneer of being normal in front of my boss and workmates who didnt know the full extent of my condition was much harder than slapping on a smile for the kids!

535477,0,t3_2096du,I tried to get my periods regular for several years on the pill and no matter which pill I tried none of them worked. I did a depo shot and bled for the entire three months and then the dr. talked me into trying it a second time. I bled for three months after that one too making it six months straight of having my period. I also gained ten pounds and saw my preexisting anxiety issues get WAY more intense.It didnt work out for me but you could be different. What ended up working best for me was the birth control patch. Using that my periods are mostly regular with maybe one day of breakthrough a month but thats way better than its ever been for me. And I havent had any negative side effects but it is more expensive on my insurance.Good luck with whatever you choose!,Endo,cg152d8,2,t5_2s8ot

One thing that really felt good was knowing that I was fertile lol.

2635796,0,t1_cn2fcdm,I would definitely ask. The medication basically shuts down your ovaries chemically inducing menopause. How you respond to it is a great indicator of how youll respond to a radical hysterectomy. That said it can be very expensive and not all insurance companies cover it if youre in the States. It has nasty side effects too especially if you dont respond to the add back therapy. Once my progesterone dosage was adjusted to what I needed the mood swings and hot flashes went away within a few days and I know now exactly what I can expect after the oopherectomy.

3045030,0,t3_2uogjm,Birth control did not help me at all. I was given the depo provera shot because its one of the BCs commonly recommended for endo and it not only didnt stop the pain I started getting UTIs and kidney stones every few months and also gained  pounds in  months even though I was eating healthier than I had in years and was getting tons of exercise. When I came off depo it was a full year and a half before my period came back and it only came back because I was given another hormone to try and get me ovulating again. I had one period only and it last two days during which time I had horrible almost unbearable cramps nausea the shakes and vertigo. It was hell. A few months later and with a lot of convincing on his end my doctor got me to try more hormones this time Visanne. Its a lowdose hormone specifically engineered for stopping endo from worsening. Its not birth control so you need backup but its been very helpful. Ive been on it  months and while it hasnt stopped the pain it has made it easier to function. Before my pain was so bad that my whole body would be weak and shaky and Id wake up at night in pain and have to take percocet or morphine. I still take the morphine once or twice a week but its nowhere near as bad as it was and Id recommend it to anyone. The only problem is that its not available in a lot of countries so youd have to check with your doctor or order it from overseas. I know its available in Canada and parts of Europe but not the States Africa Australia and a bunch of other places.,Endo,codm7dw,1,t5_2s8ot

5937959,0,t1_cxxvfi2,Youre welcome! Have you tried an app on your phone such as myPill? I know when my schedule is really hectic the reminders help me a lot! Also you can track bleeding and other side effects in the diary. Useful especially with how crazy it can get for us! I got a bit sick of taking pills and having had a great experience on Cerazette opted for the implant. The two are very closely related desogestrel and etonogestrel progestogens therefore in theory your side effects shouldcould be similar on each of them. However the route in which they are administered seems to cause some changes to the side effects women experience. I have PCOS as well as endo so Im very much prone to acne and oily skin and hair and the slightest hormonal change can affect them so much or even cause my hair to fall out for a few months. Were this not the case I would definitely have stuck with Nexplanon. However I think youre actually on a really good choice for endo. Unlike the Mirena Cerazette actually prevents ovulation as well like the combined pill depo and the implant so its better in some ways. I know what its like to be told by the doctors that something is perfect for you yet all you hear are negative reviews from women who actually have the thing inside them!!! Youve not been on Cerazette for long enough to give it a fair trial and I really would encourage you to give it about  months because by then most issues such as bleeding and skin changes have settled. Ive had nurses tell me to wait  months before deciding when it comes to progestogens but I think that depends on the severity of your side effects and your sanity!. I know doctors usually say hormonal methods require  months before changing but it takes longer with progestogenonly methods and your opinion can change a lot! I know that for many women Im childfree and that definitely affects how my womb reacts to an IUD! it can take around a year for pain to settle and for the positive effects i.e. lighter or no bleeding to really show. Im personally not so keen on this right now but might try it in my late s or s regardless of whether I have children. Honestly though having experienced an IUD insertion before I am NOT in a hurry to have it done again. In terms of early removal of LARC methods it seems to depend on where you live. In the UK if you insist on having your IUD removed they cant refuse though you might not get it done on the same day of your request. With the implant you have to schedule a removal at a clinic but they will do it regardless of how long youve had it. You can arrange this yourself. But if you complain of symptoms to your doctor youll likely be told to persevere for another  months etc. Ive had doctors actively discourage me from trying the implant as so many women get theirs removed before  years are up. But the Mirena is promoted like crazy! I hope this helps. ,Endo,cxxzw9n,1,t5_2s8ot
5957777,0,t3_3wym06,Oh man Im sorry that happened. Two of my big triggers are when I have a huge rush of adrenaline and when I hold my pee or poop for too long. For whatever reason it makes my endo flare SO BAD. The only thing that really helps me is to OD on Ibruprofen or if I drink even a little bit of alcohol it helps...even though I pay for the alcohol later because it messes up my endo in a different way. But the initial flare is so much worse than a little bit of sciatica from the alcohol. Endo is so weird. The only other thing I can suggest is to maybe take a little nap. Sometimes I find that this can reset my symptoms to like it is when I wake up at the beginning of the day. Even if its a short nap it seems to trick my body.I hate telling people this because I would really love to see this thread pick up but Nancys Nook has so much more traffic.

6050921,0,t3_3xtig5,I really think that eventuallywhen youve recoveredyou should seek a second opinion from a specialist. On Nancys Nook on Facebook there is a list of endometriosis excision specialists that you should take a look attalk to your regular doctor about it. As others have said some regular gyns miss endo because it can be hard to spot and takes an experienced expert eye. The thing that made me most raise an eyebrow in your post was that your gyn said that you could get endo in the future. All of the evidence at the moment points to the likelihood that endo is present at birth laid down during fetal development and becomes activated with hormonal fluctuations i.e. estrogen surge in follicular phase postpuberty. So the fact that your doc said that you might get it in the future indicates that she isnt current with endo literature and research. I think a second opinion is meritedendo presents very differently from vulvodynia or PCOS. Best of luck and stick around darling.

6080187,0,t3_3ytfvi,I just went off after a year but I started taking norethindrone the week I was due for my shot so Ive still got progestin going in Im not comfortable going completely off hormones and letting the endo run unchecked. So far the transition has been ok.  I did not have as many side effects as you did though the gyno and neuro think it was possibly the cause of some serious new migraine shenanigans Ive had in the last year.  Those have slowed down Im hoping theyre right and theyll stop as depo Provera is apparently notorious for migraine troubles.  Im only three weeks past when my injection was due.

6808937,0,t3_48jef5,I think you have some great responses already but I will add my story here as well. I also received my diagnosis young  . I had my full hysterectomy last June at . I also had the DaVinci robot surgery and cant recommend it enough. Very small incisions and the recovery is much faster than the abdominal procedure. I worked with a great gynecologist and we tried many many different things before we even discussed surgery.  I didnt take this procedure lightly. My doctor absolutely suggested removing both ovaries in hopes of decreasing regrowth of the endo. I now take one pill a day a bed time for HRT. The procedure took about  hours for me. I woke up and didnt have any complications that day and as such was sent home around  p.m. that evening. I needed help getting up and down for about the first  days and was very tiredgroggy. They do suggest you walk as much as you can to move the gas they fill you with for the procedure. I liked the walks because it made me feel like I was doing something. I did avoid looking at the incisions as they were very shocking to see the first week or so. The only issue I had during my whole recovery was that I got a secondary infection on in one of my incisions. After showerings I suggesting living the incisions sites open to dry as much as possible. I believe this might have been my error as I tended to bundle back up and curl back up in bed right away. I have to say that what utheonusta says below is right. Emotionally it is a loss. My husband and I decided not to have children for many reasons well before this surgery but there was still an emotional side to the surgery that I wasnt fully prepared for. During my recovery I tried to give myself time and space to feel what I needed to feel.Now for the good stuff.  I had my surgery in June. I didnt get out much until late July but when I saw a group of friends one pulled me aside and asked me if I had lost weight or was doing something differently. What she was seeing was that I was not in constant pain. I looked healthier and happier. In August I was released back to regular activity. I started back to yoga something I have always loved. I have made more progress in the last  months than I have in  years of practicing. Im able to get up every day and not have plan around the pain or the possibility of pain. I know we can travel or plan to do physical things well in advance now. I still sometimes wonder if the one morning I am going to just wake up and the pain will just be there like it use to be but for for now WOW what a difference! I know there is always a chance the endo will come back but for me I think this was the very best choice I could have made. ,Endo,d0o38id,3,t5_2s8ot

7150682,0,t3_4dfpx7,This does sound like it could be endo  but it could also be other things too. I would recommend you start a symptom journal our sidebar has a link to how to track symptoms via paper or with apps. The symptom tracking can not only help you learn more about whats happening to you over time but also tends to help doctors take your symptoms more seriously. Second Id start asking your OBGYN for some tests to rule out other things. Tell them you are concerned about endo and want to rule out other conditions. Your OBGYN will likely want to rule out things anyway. The Tests document in our sidebar walks through common tests to rule out other conditions that often are found with endo or can mimic endo.Finally Id say that if your tests come back clear and endo is likely the culprit  then youll want to get to an endo specialist for any further treatment. Our Successful Doctors Map in the sidebar has a host of doctors in it were still growing! but look for those marked with hearts to find specialists who use excision as a surgical treatment.Surgery is ideally not just diagnostic. It works best when the surgeon can actually remove the endo lesions to protect your organs from long term damage. If endo is allowed to progress unchecked it can have lasting effects on your fertility. However endo doesnt mean you will have fertility problems  each situation is truly unique. Most surgeons use excision to remove all visible lesions and then suppress recurrence with hormonal therapies. These can be as simple as birth control or can be more intense such as rounds of LupronDepo Provera Danazol or other GnRH analogs. I would say that if you are still having periods hitting a  or   its possible that if its endo youre not entirely managed. Planning around your pain isnt really managed  its better for sure but could still indicate something else. Start by getting some things ruled out and tracking your symptoms.

7235839,0,t3_4ej5kf,Hi. I have been through a lot of similar experiences. Finding the RIGHT doctors was an absolute struggle. Here in rendo they have the successful doctors map on the right side you might want check it out to see if there is one in your area. A couple of things that rang true from your post that did for me too  My sugar tests all came back normal until we did a very early  a.m. fasting test. This was the only test that showed insulin resistance and my doctor said that it was a very big jump in test results.   What hormone levels are you having checked? For PCOS I found that progesterone was a hormone that wasnt being checked until I found the right doctor amp by regulating this hormone did help my periods some. Might not be your issue but just something to think about.   Just because your ultrasound came back normal doesnt mean you dont have PCOS or Endo. PCOS is an endocrine disease and endometriosis can only be positively diagnosed by surgery as endo doesnt show up on an ultrasound. Obviously something isnt right and you know it. Keep asking questions keep track of your symptoms and know that you are not alone! There are many of us here that are with you. ,Endo,d20nuxy,4,t5_2s8ot

7630798,0,t3_4jtpte,A lap is absolutely worth it based on your symptoms. How I discovered it was a little different but how it progressed has a few similarities to you.In  I had a laparoscopy to remove a growing ovarian cyst and that revealed that I had to have my left ovary removed cyst had twisted up my Fallopian tube and effectively killed it and I had something called stage IV endometriosis. My obgyn knew enough to diagnose it and treated it with ablation and that I should just wait and see if I had pain before exploring drugs or surgery. Ive since learned that that approach mostly kicks that can down the road and is a reason women end up with multiple surgeries.I thought Id been treated but started getting increasingly awful cramps at the start of periods. Id spot a little between them and they started coming closer together and lasting longer. Having a week period every three weeks sucked. I also noticed that Id get constipated too. I tried all sorts of diet experimentation but nothing worked. I got into the habit of taking mg ibuprofen and laxatives starting a day before my periods and continuing for  days to make them bearable.So not great but heres the kicker Dec I go in for my regular gyn exam and my doctor discovers a few small hard lumps way back under my cervix. She takes a biopsy and sends it to the lab and figures its probably an STI. Results come back and those are...endometriosis. Shed never heard of it appearing there even though shes the one that did my lap and diagnosed it. Her overall approach was wait and see but she said shes give me a referral if I wanted one.So heres what happened once I did. I met with Dr. Ocampo in the Kaiser systemhe was actually a student of Dr. Nezhat. He described the different styles of endo hes seen and heard about and how excision is the most effective treatment known. He  sent me for a few tests an ultrasound MRI and barium enema that revealed I was getting constipation because endo scar tissue was slowly pulling my colon out of alignment. I got confirmation my colon was healthy on the inside it was just the outside scar tissue that had to be cut away unbeknownst to me the endo scar tissue also had blocked off my left ureter so y left kidney was completely blocked. the rectovaginal bits were scarring wrapped up between my uterus and cervix and some in the posterior culdesac oddly enough I learned about that amusingly named spot just a week prior from a friend going through med school!So I had a laundry list of stuff to be excised. I had a . hour laparoscopy in March  with Dr. Ocampo another excision specialist he called in a urologist to clip off and reconnect the healthy part of my ureter and a bowel specialist just in case they discovered more work on that when they got in there. I had my uterus and cervix removed fixed my ureter got rid of the scar tissue pulling my bowel. Note that getting your uteruscervix removed a hysterectomy is sometimes mistaken for a cure for general endoit is notbut in my case thats where a bunch of the problematic scar tissue was. But its fine because I have one functioning ovary left and thats actually all you need to get your hormones and not go into menopause early! I was surprised too. Im  now and wasnt looking forward to that possibility though given that or pain I still wouldve made the same choice.If I hadnt looked into this if Id just treated the pain I would have lost my kidney. And who knew there was a physical fixable cause of the constipation? And I dont get periods anymore since I have no uterus...and thats been an unexpectedly awesome side outcome all of this.In years of learning about this Dr. Nezhats name comes up repeatedlyyou are very lucky to have found one of the few dozen truly knowledgable specialists out there. Good luck to you and Id be happy to talk more in the future. ,Endo,d39kwo1,6,t5_2s8ot

7779556,0,t3_4lt54l,Well the Diane  is basically the same as a generic birth control pill in the States. Its supposed to be good at treating acne as well. The sudden pain may be a reaction to the switch in formula.For the IBS  try taking a multivitamin. I started doing that as the extra magnesium has been shown to help IBS. Its made a big difference for me.  If you have a lot for diarrhea make sure to keep your electrolytes up with some GatoradewaterB. Again that multivitamin can help.  I take the One a day for women  if that helps.If you can get an email to your doctor  or even a phone call it may be worth it. Your doctor may be able to work with your insurance company to get your regular meds to you. Especially since youve tried theirs and its not cutting it. Its also worth asking about your flare up. That sudden build up of pain and then release makes me think you might be dealing with a cyst. Those can be a real problem. Its so hard to be on your own in a new place and I do think you are right in that most doctors in China dont know much about it. The most important thing is to not stress. Stress will make it worse. Try to take care of yourself  take a nice bath go for a swim do some yoga  whatever helps you decompress. Read watch crazy TV and try to eat simple things  rice soup juices. Eat in small amounts  like half a serving at a time every hour. Your body will likely get upset but it should hopefully ease up. When I get an IBS flare  its usually three to five hours then it will subside but be angry if I eat normally too quickly. If I eat small snacks and easy foods for the rest of the day Im usually back to normal the next day. Try to avoid stimulants for the next three days or so like caffeine and chocolate or irritants like red meat dairy and soytofu. It will get better  its always a process. ,Endo,d3qgz1m,1,t5_2s8ot

8197990,0,t3_4rkmpm,Hello. I had my laparoscopy done about three years ago. My left ovary ended up being so stuck and twisted around my bowel that they had to remove it along with the fallopian tube. I remember my abdominalpelvic area feeling overall very sore for the first few days after the operation. I would also get side pains that felt like a sharp ping here and there nothing bad compared to the pain I was getting before the surgery. As I recall they did occur mostly at night which was annoying as I tried to go to sleep. The oxycodone they gave me didnt really do much to help ease these pings though it did make me drowsy enough to sleep through it eventually. The postop pain mostly subsided after about three weeks for me but I actually still get random pains on that left side every so often to this day because of scar tissue. I call it my phantom ovary acting up. About a year ago I had a hysteroscopy wdampc in order to check for polyps to see if my fibroids could be removed and reduce my heavy bleeding. The fibroids were too embedded in the uterine wall and there were no polyps so they didnt have to take out any growths. I hardly had any pain from that procedure just some mild to moderate cramping for a few days that felt mostly like normal period cramps. I hope you recover well! Im new to this subreddit and somewhat new to reddit in general. I wish I would have thought to check out support forums for endo back then when I was having these issues. By the way have you ever tried ginger for nausea? I like the spicy taste of ginger to begin with so I brew ginger tea and eat GinGins or Chimes brand ginger candies which I find addicting. It helps me with the nausea side effect of one of my medications so it might help you with stomaching the codeine. ,Endo,d52avlk,2,t5_2s8ot
8304130,0,t1_d5f83f7,Thanks! My doctor told me that  months postop is the the best I would feel following surgery. After that it tends to vary for people. I went . years between surgeries but Im hoping the time between this one and the next one is longer. I mostly had this surgery done because my new doc knew way more about endo than my own doc and I thought he could give me a more complete picture of my reproductive health which he was able to do.I think its a great surgery to have. Pain at least for me was very low as long as there wasnt direct pressure on my incisions for a while. Speaking of incisions make sure youre washing them with hydrogen peroxide  times a day unless they tell you something else. I had one of mine get a very minor infection so it took longer for that scab to fall off and start healing like the rest. I was able to clear it with antibiotic band aidscream. I did take care of my incisions post surgery but that one was just finicky.It looks like youre on top of things! I think youll do well! And really just rest. I felt so good following surgery that I overdid it and ended up having to lounge around a little longer than I thought I would. If you start to feel tired just give yourself rest. Thats probably what Im worst at doing. Good luck! ,Endo,d5fkniv,2,t5_2s8ot
8474877,0,t3_4vpey3,Im so sorry about your experiences. One thing I always recommend is to take a friend or partner with you to the doctor. Its hard to take in all the information or to make sure your questions are answered. Having another person there to remind you what was said or to ask questions you may not have thought about  can be helpful.I also recommend writing down everything you want to ask before you go  bring that list a pen and write it all down. Dont leave until you get all the answers you need.Also try a symptom journal. Sometimes doctors seeing the log will help them understand the pain better. We have apps and a guide in our sidebar to help get you started on that. Im so sorry youve been dismissed. Its not a good feeling. If you wouldnt mind sharing who you saw from our list we do note doctors who have a good reputation for treatment but who feel dismissive to others. You can PM me if you feel more comfortable.Its common for women with endo to show an increase in symptoms with an IUD because having something in your uterus can irritate it. Some women dont and find the hormones regulate things for them. But my specialist did tell me that in his experience he finds IUDs to be a mixed bag.,Endo,d60wg67,2,t5_2s8ot

If you dont thing birth control is treating it right when you doctor tries that  step up and say thats not the course you want to take. If you want a lap tell your doctor you do. Dont say things like well Im not sure the birth control is going to control my symptoms. Instead say This isnt working. I want to try something else. Ive read about laparoscopy. Lets discuss that. Dont leave them any room to say its worth a try. I had to go into my doctors office and say my symptoms are . I think I have endo  and it runs in my family. Ive been on birth control yet its getting worse. Id like to discuss laproscopic surgery to figure out whats going on. They tried to change my birth control but I stuck to what I wanted. Turns out endo had completely covered my colon to the point it couldnt most and work properly. Just be firm. Make them listen. They may be an expert in medicine but youre the expert on your body.

9314597,0,t1_d8vw13a,gtcauterizing is temporary at best.Okay a few things I just gotta nitpick because I feel its important for people to know and be informed on...First of all the lazer can be effective in some cases. The thing is the laser can only penetrate a certain depth which is exceeded in stage III and IV endo by the most basic descriptions of what defines those. When lesions are too thick to be penetrated fully by the laser cutting them out is the only way to get rid of that tissue. The second thing impacting this is surgical skill  lasers are very appealing to sloppy lessskilled surgeons which honestly obgyns have a stereotype for being in general. So even though a specialist who is very very experienced and knows all of the places endo can hide could theoretically eradicate all visable traces of endo in a case where lesions arent too thick for complete penetration so in cases like stage III endo or minimal endo using a laser  which does have benefits like shorter recovery time easier maneuverability in hardtoreach areas BTW  it does seem the market is flooded with obgyns who got a shiny new toy and cant wait to point and shoot at things and feel like theyre doing a good job. So moral of the story  see a specialist sure but dont get too hung up on whether they use a scalpel all the time or not  just make sure they can and will switch to one when the case calls for it. Second of all even excision is often a temporary measure. Endometriosis is understood to have multiple factors that lead to the stray endometrial cells within the abdominal cavity and even if you cut out all you can see those factors that predisposed you to get those lesions are still around as are many microscopic cells the surgeon cannot possibly see to remove. How susceptible a woman is to reoccurance depends on her own natural susceptibility to endo in the first place and the factors most inplay for her as they can be different for different women but one of the best ways to prevent reoccurance is to modulate your hormones so long as you can tolerate such. The simplest way is to take birth control because progesterone suppresses endometrial tissue growth and division and endometrial tissue is what makes up the lesions in endometriosis. Supressing periods altogther is a step further because that prevents the associated inflammation which can support lesion growth as well as a possible source for new seeds in cases where retrograde menses is a strong predisposing factor. It also seems that women who are treated younger and when they have more minimal presentations have lower rates of reoccurance this may have to do with the prevention of scar tissue which older women who have had lesions longer and in greater numbers accumulate more of. ,Endo,d8wozsu,3,t5_2s8ot

It used to only consist of severe cramps during my period now its severe cramps  less severe lower backpelvic pain for  weeks leading up to my period.  And the cramps are more severe.  While all my nonendo friends say their cramps are getting BETTER in their late s and early s mine are getting worse.  Worsening menstrual pain is a major red flag for endo.  If anything cramps are usually worse in teen girls and get slightly better as you age or at least stay the same.

Whilst on the progesterone pill I had no periods at all. I stopped progesterone pills at . Within six months my periods were so painful on day one that I couldnt function. A solid . I had some mild IBStype issues during this time too but nothing I was concerned about. At  after about  months of horrendous periods the pain started to be constant but very low level a  or . One of my best friends has endo and it was at this point she told me the name of her consultant he is an endo specialist in the UK where Im based I went to see him in May of  and had my lap in July. This was about  months after the constant pain.My story is not typical. Most endo sufferers have pain from their teenage years. I was lucky in that I was taking the right hormonal treatment by chance so I didnt have to live with the pain until my late s. For that Im very grateful.Whats important is that studies show early excision surgery on endo is much more successful in the long term than excision surgery on patients with very advanced endo.

Hopefully in the future Ill be in a position to afford insurance. ,Endo,dfxjn4g,1,t5_2s8ot

11679946,0,t1_dgjx499,To add to the sweatpants also underpants a size too big. I didnt even think of this until I tried putting my regular knickers on and they rubbed the incision site! Thankfully I had some old big ones left. ,Endo,dgjxsqi,5,t5_2s8ot
11707376,0,t3_666kiq,My clarisonic and proactiv have been able to keep my acne manageable. After my lap my face completely cleared up and now Im stuck with these hideous scars. I cannot take birth control either and proactiv worked the best for me. ,Endo,dgn27ia,1,t5_2s8ot
11771261,0,t1_dgtrlja,This made me feel so much better xx Im so glad you got an answer. Youre right the worst part is not knowing! I recently told my referring GP that the worst case scenario for me is that I wake up and they say I dont have it and she looked at me like I had two heads. She was like why would you want a disease?? Its so important to know whats going on!,Endo,dguayaq,3,t5_2s8ot
11798697,0,t3_68c8gg,The lap surgerys really not bad.  I had it done on a Friday.  They removed endo tissue stage  several uterine fibroids the largest was around  inches and my doctor even did some remodeling work to correct the shape of my bicornate uterus.  The whole thing took about an hour and a half it was done in an outpatient surgery center and I was back to full speed by Monday though still bleeding due to the remodeling which my doctor warned me would happen.  I wouldnt be too terribly afraid of it.  The lap version isnt bad at all as far as surgeries go.  I had a lot more luck eating ketogenic than I did the endo diet but your mileage may vary.,Endo,dgxf8hd,6,t5_2s8ot
