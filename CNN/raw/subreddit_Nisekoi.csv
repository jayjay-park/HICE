Also something is up with Marikas health and that needs to be flushed out too. Yui is new as well and not too much has happened between her and Raku.  is a probable time for an ending looking at how this series progresses.,Nisekoi,chxadm0,1,t5_2ur9n

The fact that you uploaded this many images and took the time out of your day to do this is incredibly amazing. That having been said is there a potential for a plot summary?

2526416,0,t3_2oju14,Id have to put three pagesI just feel that all three of these images just show how far Tsugumi has gone in terms of character development and growing up as a person.  Shes no longer the stereotypical tsundere trap that we saw in the beginning but she is actually Raku and Chitoges friend.  I realize that this essentially means that she will never actually win but its a nice idea to think that shes getting her own space as a character.Onodera on the other hand....,Nisekoi,cmoc85m,7,t5_2ur9n

3881518,0,t3_2pm86d,There is a very simple answer to that.Based from Nisekois plot complexity the ending would not be cliche although it may be predicted.First of all let us look at the facts. Kosakis key seems to be the correct key it is the key in the Nisekoi english logo. Yui mentioned that Chitoge and Kosaki were the best of friends  years ago. She said they did everything together. Kosakis mother said that the Zaxia in Love Storybook was given to hershe didnt own it.According to the storybook the locket contains rings engraved with their names.Based on these facts here is my theory of the ending. Kosaki and Raku finally use Kosakis key to open the locket and it opens. However they are shocked to see that the names engraved are Chitoge and Raku. They later find out that Kosaki and Chitoge had exchanged keys in the past at the same time when chitoge gave the storybook to onodera.This is just ny opinion though and Im entertaining other endings ,Nisekoi,cqyq5xf,2,t5_2ur9n

4033991,0,t1_crg3hni,Can you show me where it said that Raku kept seeing the promise girl after that night?  I dont remember where that was.I wouldnt be surprised if Marika forgot about the night due to her over infatuation with meeting Raku.  Im not serious with this theory btw Im saying that an explanation can pop up to provide the same results.I didnt say you were using the eye argument Im simply stating that a detail against Chitoge was easily tossed out.  Just the same details against Marika and Kosaki can be easily tossed out.Objectively something like eye color would be a definite detail yet a simple explanation removed it.  Marikas health is a definite detail but has proved to not hinder her when the plot calls for it.  Kosaki owning the picture book was a sure sign that she was the girl but it turns out the book was given to her.Also your last paragraph is my point in its entirety.  Im saying that until the past is more clear its a bad idea to use it as a base for theories.  Youve picked out details that seem definitive at this time just as other details seemed definitive when they first popped up.Again until the past is more clear I cant get behind a theory that relies on it.,Nisekoi,crg3tih,1,t5_2ur9n

4383408,0,t1_csjpp03,I highly doubt there was any key swapping between them or any of the girls its a bit far fetched given what we know what I think Raku remembered was Chitoge handing Kosaki the key she currently holds we see two hands and given what Raku said after he remembered something about Chitoge so its fair to assume its Chitoge there as for whose other hand do we see... there are two possibilities... Either it was Chitoge handing the key to Kosaki or it was Chitoge giving the key to Raku for him to give it to Kosaki and for that matter the rest of the keys to the other girls... Take into account that amnesia Raku took a pause and decided not to say what he was about to say why? I dont think what he recalled was a happy memory that image of the key and the two hands was probably just the beggining of a rather sad past...It hasnt been explained how everyone got their keys but there are a few facts that have been already established.... Raku was given the lock by the promise girl who also held one key.. Kosaki said that she got the key from the boy she played with  years ago when they parted ways.. Marika said she didnt know there were other keys there is also a picture of Raku and Marika with Rakus father as Marika holds her key and Raku already has the lock.If we can trust Kosakis memory and it wasnt just a blur that she somehow put together how she seemed fit if she got the key from the boy and the promise girl was the one to give the lock to Raku and already had the key then it points to Kosaki not being the promise girl...The way I see this play out in my head is something like this...Chitoge is the promise girl she makes the promise with Raku as well as giving him the lock and the other three keys to give to the other girls. Raku goes ahead and gives each girl their respective keys take into account that this was probably the last day of the whole group together he probably started with Yui who seems to know a bit more about the whole set of keys and how the lock opens then Marika who didnt know about the other keys but perhaps knew about the story in the book and willingly took Rakus key as well as assuming it was related to them being arranged to marry and it representing a promise to do so when they met again hence why she feels like shes the one... Last but not least its Kosaki however this farewell gets a bit more emotional as Kosaki confesses her feelings before saying goodbye something that Chitoge may have witnessed all the more if Raku returned her feelings it could have made Chitoge feel betrayed perhaps Kosaki knew Chitoge liked Raku and as they find out Chitoge was eavesdropping on them Chitoge runs away and Kosaki is overwhelmed by guilt and throws her key away there are still a lot of details to work out I havent even introduced the book into this whole thing thats a whole other mess...,Nisekoi,csjqvji,2,t5_2ur9n

4765410,0,t3_3g6286,Im really curious about this pageI dont feel as if Honda is the type of person to lie but... this medicine they talk about it almost feels as if its something Marika fears perhaps she needs it in order to live but it has a heavy backlash or sideeffect perhaps it keeps her on an almost fully bedridden state... Just my thoughts...It could very well just be anemia medicine but then what was the handful of pills she swallowed the previous chapter... Honda seems to have been very explicit to Marika about her limit so perhaps she cant fake being healthy anymore because her body has grown usedresistant to the effect of the meds and thus she needs even bigger doses that last for less time... Thats the impression Im getting the limit being the point in which the meds are almost ineffective or perpaps they were just delaying something that cant be delayed any further...I wonder why all the secrecy around Marikas condition from everyone that seems to know... I mean I guess they had to disclose some information with the school Bonyari when she transfered in but for her information to had been deleted from record skillfully as Tsugumi added... Its very suspicious... Feels as if they dont want anyone to know out of keeping appearances perhaps as I had assumed in the past Chika Tachibana and the whole Tachibana name is a big deal in Kyushuu and she comes from a big household that only cares about honor pride and that stuff... At least on her mothers side... could be the case though I cant tell I guess Mikage will reveal what she knows about Marikas past and what just happened soon enough on next chapter...,Nisekoi,ctv82lk,13,t5_2ur9n

7040158,0,t1_d1eblxy,At the first half of the manga I feel that Onodera and Chitoge had similar amount of appearance maybe just slightly more Chitoge just cus she was around Raku more but I think Onodera was there more to add drama and a rival than to be a real contender. She could of been an active rival but instead she only had progress when alone with the MC and never actively went for him like for example the arrow thing where she was hiding in a bush. I think it would of made the story more interesting if she and Chitoge both went after him so that the author wouldnt get the chance to nullify the progress as he always did. Just like he did with Marika and Yui being in the open it was more interesting to see the girls confronting their feelings and going for what they want. Just my feelings tho. She had potential but was wasted and thus I lost my interest and expectations,Nisekoi,d1ecx6f,1,t5_2ur9n

7065768,1,t3_4cdjen,I think this picture defines my dislike for Onodera and my love for Chitoge. Here we have Onodera after  in series years  of which weve seen in detail and in real time and for me personally over  years of this build up I guess you would call it that between Onodera and Raku. Youve had chances at least like  of them and youve pussied out every time when trying to confess and now that you know you have to or else you well forever regret not doing knowing time is running out knowing this is fucking it now or never instead of being fired up instead of finally being determined being ready to take the initiative accepting what ever Raku wants taking action and not sitting idle by your again scared to death. If this series wasnt on its ending flags I would swear to god she would pussy out again. If Raku wasnt SPOILERS Unconscious you wouldnt have confessed. And now your again for at least the seventh time afraid.MEANWHILE we see a Chitoge who looks ready to kick ass and take names. Shes had these feeling for about   years and shes had them build up its been a roller coaster but she knows where shes at. Shes taken it slow to preserve a relationship stability with her friends she really hasnt tried because she hasnt had to plus being as socially awkward as she losing that stability would be critical i should know Im socially awkward myself and at least with her shes been in love for like half the time of Onodera. Now that time is of the essence instead being scared instead of being worried shes fucking ready. She wants this to happen is she nervous? Fuck yeah who wouldnt be but does she look like shes ready does Chitoge look like shes not gonna let it slip shes not sitting by. If given the opportunity well she confess fuck yeah. It maybe be because her time at high school is ending but given the situation and the romantic setting this provides her I would bet she would try anyways. Shes not letting her obstacle which is fear get to her shes gonna face the music like an adult.Thats a character i can get behind i understand why people like Onodera... in the beginning of the series at least HEY Im not here to stop you for doing that like whoever the fuck you want but the characters i like are these they push the plot they make things happened they conquer there obstacles they go on and get their prize not because its convenient. She had to earn Raku love. This people is what I call a character and development in an actual story. Shes ready to fight shes probably even anticipating it a bit. Now compare that to Onodera and you see where Im coming at.TLDR Onodera makes a pussy face and Chitoge looks like shes ready to whoop up some confessing ass. ,Nisekoi,d1h9mif,2,t5_2ur9n

I think its WAY too cliche and wouldve preferred if Chitoge heard Raku say he likes both of them and Chitoge gives up Raku for Onodera instead of the usual didnt hear everything. It would be awesome if Komi had plans for an After Story kind of situation but I doubt it. ,Nisekoi,d1km36c,1,t5_2ur9n

When i was a senior back in high school im fabulous af good gradessportsclub presidentinfluental. I became what Nietzsche would be proud of an Ubermensch. Im powerful enough that I no longer felt pain i couldnt shed a tear even if my parents are dying and hence the kuuderedandere personality. I remained in solitude while donning my extrovert mask until a girl a classmate of mine came to my life. And she resembles a lot like Kosaki. Shes intelligent sweet a shy girl innocent beautiful maturedintrovert a good cook lol kosaki and very traditional. In my country Malaysia this kind of girl is known as the Last Malay Girl or in Malay Perempuan Melayu Terakhir a rendition of Yamato Nadeshiko for Japan. She has what i dont have empathy and weakness. When you are too powerful no pain couldve damaged you and you will become stoic bit by bit until you lose your empathy. This girl she brightened my life she painted my black and white world to an euphoric one. She taught me how being weak is being strong and thus i embraced my emotions to be a Human. I adored her way of treating people the way she talks.....and i didnt even confessed to her in my last day in school even though we were alone in the classroom that time and that is the last time i contacted her. I dont regret it. I shouldnt pursue any commitments with girls until i discover the meaning of love. That is one of my philosophical tenets. Ideology comes first even though it hurts like hell for  and  years. It has been three years already and until now she is the closest thing i can relate with the meaning of love.

Shes become a more caring person and open person even having a couple moments of having moments of adorability  I know theres some sort of dere for that but idk what its called. She even shows feelings of regret and apologizes for her Tsundere moments lately look at chapter  for example. Kosakis character on the other hand hasnt developed one bit from chaper one. The only thing thats changed is she doesnt go hyper blush mode every time she sees Raku now but thats it.,Nisekoi,d50l6bq,3,t5_2ur9n

8204130,0,t3_4rplrv,Honestly Im hoping Kosaki gets shittons of development now that Raku isnt weighing her down anymore. She deserves to be free of that denseness.That aside I think the whole point of Kosaki not bringing the promise up because it doesnt matter right now. Whats more important is current feelings over how they felt as children especially when Kosaki figured out that Raku loves Chitoge now.Also wouldnt bringing up how she was the promise girl be a blow below the belt? Kosaki might be selfish but I would think she would hate herself if she brought it up just to bolster herself over Chitoge. Especially when a few chapters ago when she wanted Chitoge to remember the past so she would give up on Raku but internally scolded herself for thinking that way in the first place because her friendship with Chitoge is important to her.,Nisekoi,d532jy7,4,t5_2ur9n

8304219,0,t3_4t0t2h,I found it tiring im not into these kind of manga but i somehow wanted to see Onodera winning in the end so i kept on reading. Maybe its because she resembles the girl im in love with. Anyway the main character was simply boring like many other similar stories no way he deserves having so many girls behind is back. I dont know there was literally no character development or moments that would make me feel bad about him at all. I didnt really care about his happiness either. I barely remember his name even now meaning that he was simply unintresting to me. Actuallly there was almost no character development at all for everyone. I just wanted Onodera to be happy. I dont remember laughing or having a smile on my face either so i guess the humor was a bit lacking as well. Just the regular im a girl baka or oh no im naked he might see meoh no he saw my panties amp lets fight for stupid reasons baka things. Weve all probably seen this elsewhere too not to mention better presented. All in all i might get some hate for this but the plot and some moments of the manga in general felt a bit too childish. Im sure there are similar romances out there that are better in all aspects so id have to give this a  if not worse. It had a decent sketch.,Nisekoi,d5fl1wx,1,t5_2ur9n

8374797,0,t3_4uanw5,Hey man I honestly wouldnt mind if you managed to ship Kosaki after Chitoge won. I know that feeling exactly. I wanna use this example because its almost a one to one situation. Theres this girl that youve developed feelings for and you continuously talk to her and you end up liking this person ex you ended up favoring Chitoge and finally she tells you that she likes you ex you got the ending you thought you wanted Chitoge winning over Raku. Now you have it and you thought you REALLY wanted her to confess to you and you thought it was gonna be this amazing blast of a celebration but when it came down to it you didnt ACTUALLY want it as much as you thought it did. In this case maybe you realized how much you actually empathized with Kosaki after seeing how much she really cared about Ichijou. If you definitely feel you changed ship after the last chapters that transpired it wouldnt be surprising. Its absolutely normal to not know what you actually want. Dont let any of the people in the comments discourage you. I definitely think that if you changed ships to Kosaki its not impossible. Its the same way Raku switched to Chitoge. You thought you liked Chitoge but you ended up caring more about Kosaki. Yknow? The only for sure way to know if you did switch over with us is if a month from now the first thing you can really recall is Kosaki being shattered despite Chitoge being the end girl. But thats also your decision to make just like Raku made his.But I mean who knows. what are feelings amiright,Nisekoi,d5oee60,3,t5_2ur9n
8377684,0,t3_4ud184,I definitely think Komi is a mediocre writer actually. He has some VERY nice plots and ideas but he has trouble developing them. I also feel that he doesnt give his characters proper care Kosaki being the most underappreciated by him.I accept that Chitoge and Raku were going to be the end ship but I do think that even I would TRULY hate it if Kosaki stays friends with Raku after her rejection and after Chitoge and Raku begin a relationship. At that point it just feels like some netorare where Kosaki is being forced into submission by the author himself and I cant accept that kind of writing. It pisses me off that he wrote it so that Kosaki didnt even bother to ever ask Raku to choose her. She didnt give a final fighting stance. I mean. Really?? The final trigger that Komi could pull on me is if she stayed as close friends with Raku and Chitoge after all of this. I just absolutely cannot accept that.Its not in the sense that Ive come to hate Raku or Chitoge but if she stays friends with the new couple it will be as if Kosakis personality and feelings were never a serious concept for Komi. Itll confirm that Kosaki was actually purely just a tool. Nothing more nothing less.As a writer Komi could really kick his game up a little bit more and avoid the things he did wrong in Nisekoi. He created a promise plot revolving around a Romeo and Juliet parallel combined with a harem. He has good ideas but theyre so scattered and underdeveloped. In that sentence alone I see three different potential manga that could revolve around the other girls with different main guy characters.  Promise Plot Kosakis Story Romeo and Juliet Parallel Chitoge and Raku Harem Works doesnt it???Just. Ughsdhsdgagd.,Nisekoi,d5orcs7,15,t5_2ur9n

8516743,0,t3_4wbjgr,My personal favorite is Lovely complex a comedyromance manga. The anime is good to but its kinda like books and movies. The books are usually norr detailed etc. Ive read it over and over a million times and I still laugh at every joke. A brief summary of the plotKoizumi Risa is a reasonably normal high school girl but feels insecure about her abnormal height.  cm which is pretty tall in Japan. She eventually meets Otani Atsushi who faces the same problem but instead of being extremely tall  hes very short  cm which is the same as me if anybody wants to know. The two of the decides to compete whoever can get a lover first and then the story just takes on a joyride through their lives. Not a harem or anything but immensely entertaining. Like.. Its so good.
