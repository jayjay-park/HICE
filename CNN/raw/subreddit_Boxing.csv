63149,0,t1_cekwp2e,I just rewatched the fight and while Cotto is one of my favourite fighters of all timeMayweather fought on the inside and was clearly winning up until round  it took Cotto until round  to land a clean shot. Cotto was trying every hall of famer trick he knew and eventually seemed to time Mayweather on the inside and won round . So Mayweather switches to the outside in round  and clearly wins. Theres more infighting in the th round but Cotto doesnt land cleanly he seems to be too focussed on keeping his hands up at this point to see where his punches are going. During the th round Mayweather keeps his head up and is able to successfully pull tricks of his own for example slapping away Cottos right hand with his left in order to penetrate Cottos guard with his right. The th round is pretty much even Cotto for the first time looks like his normal self but realistically floyd probably landed more cleanly. Round  Floyd wins on the outside. Round  Mayweather wins the outside exchanges the inside exchanges look close but Cotto lands at most  clean punches whereas Floyd lands many.  round Cotto comes out fast going for the knockout its scrappy evenish in my opinion Mayweather gets the better of the exchanges but thats definitely arguable then around  minutes in Mayweather rocks Cotto and we all know how hard that is and proceeds to outclass Cotto to the bell.The reason I said schooled is because. Mayweather dominates rounds  on the inside. After Cotto figures that out Mayweather changes his style and takes the next round. Cotto has several strong performances in the last  rounds but rarely catches Mayweather cleanly while Mayweather is able to pull tricks on Cotto. In the end Cotto is the one who has his feet shaken and anyone who can do that impresses me,Boxing,celmaw4,3,t5_2qj0l

PostDLH Mayweather was a pussy relative to true fighters.De La Hoya was getting old and the money was good.Hatton was a little guy. Undefeated but SMALL.Marquez seeHattonMosley was OLD. Now not saying Floyd ducked him til he was old Floyd maintains that Mosley was the one ducking him prior to the DLH fight.Ortiz was okay but eh. From Cotto onwards Mayweather ceased to be the pussy that he was. Though Cotto had already been stomped a couple times he was still a legitimate win. So was Guerrero and to a lesser extent Canelo. A bit of that old puss started showing when Floyd got Canelo to come down to . After he had talked shit about Pacquiao and his catchweights?

He lost to Floyd who else is really going to give him  million to fight other than Manny who is starved for opponents?But that would seem to be a rational purpose behind the move. Lets not forget that Guerrero is the guy who had a gun in his luggage while going to New York to do press at religious channels. This idea of his might not be based upon any sound reasoning.Now Schaefer is going to spin the story to be more favourable for Golden Boy but Id lean towards his story of being baffled as to why Guerrero is trying to get out of his contract.

Based on your awesome way of measuring a boxer.  Canelo should easily dismantle Floyd because he beat up mosley in a more espectacular manner than Floyd did and Manny should retire Floyd because he beat up DLH and floyd narrowly outscored him but wait didnt Marquez knocked out Manny so that means he should knockout Floyd because he knocked out a dude that should beat Floyd ..but wait there is a lot of contradictions because facts tell us a different story maybe this formula doesnt work IRL it only works amongst fanbois in rboxing.Now back on topic thurman didnt beat up JSK more dramatically or harder than chino did chino had already soften JSK up for thurman therefore theres no way of knowing until they fight each other.

196828,0,t1_cf0suxd,Understood.My point was that Floyd isnt turned off by Broners talk because its just a guy doing his thing. It has nothing to do with Floyd so theres no reason why he would stop associating with Broner. Now your point that a fighter has to win is a different matter and its all in how you view it. There are a lot of top fighters that the fans dont care to watch because they dont connect with an audience. People might dislike Broner but for someone with no quality wins he was extremely popular as the television ratings showed. He got there by being antagonistic. That doesnt mean its how every fighter can get popular but it worked for Broner and Floyd understands what Broner is doing. Thats the context in which I made the statement.And Floyd isnt threatened by Broner. Just like when people or ESPN say Floyd is only hanging around Bieber to appeal to his fanbase. But thats a viewpoint driven from their dislike of Bieber. Most dislike comes from insecurity and Floyd has very little insecurity. He can see the value in being around Bieber as well as being his friend. He doesnt view that as contradictory. The same way most successful businessmen seek out and work with other successful businessmen. You better yourself by associating with successful people.So with Broner Id guess its the same as his relationship with people like Nate Jones. He spent years telling Nate not to drink but Nate didnt listen and had to retire because of some brain injuries. Floyd didnt turn his back on him he told Nate to come to Vegas and he worked his way up to being the main guy Floyd talks strategy with for his fights. So he might give Broner advice on how to handle the boxing world but he isnt going to distance himself if Broner disregards his advice or keeps acting like a fool or loses more fights. Those are some of the thoughts I condensed down to a few lines. ,Boxing,cf0uzx9,1,t5_2qj0l

254781,0,t1_cf74ebn,Not saying Boxing isnt deadly. But the statement people in die in boxing and not in MMA is wrong if we cant agree on that theres no point in continuing this conversation. If you want to say more people die in boxing go ahead thats quantifiably correct. But not without context. UFC and K are leagues not the entire sport of MMA and people have indeed died in MMA. Saying MMA fighters dont die only in UFC.. is like saying boxers dont die onlyonTopRankHBO.. Comparing the single advantage of height in a team sport to the physicality of a one on one sport is ridiculous. But as ridiculous as that analogy is the best teams in the NBA dont win simply because they have the tallest players on the court. Similarly there arent rules in regards to height for joining the NBA but there are for age. You have to be  years old and spend at least one year in high school. Kevin Durant was  foot  in high school and was still ineligible for the NBA his first year. Please dont act like height is the determining factor of who wins in basketball thats just silly and you only have to look at the teams that win championships to verify that. Football and basketball do in fact have different leagues for different sized players and there are rules in place to separate younger smaller players from larger bigger ones due to the clear physical differences.

More specifically we know floyds right hand will be there to disorient and discourage if not knockdown. But how powerful is Mayweathers left hook? Khan attacks in blindingly fast flurries but he has bad habits. When he steps in with his jab he cocks his right hand back. Notice the opponents left hooks have been his achilles heel as of late Diaz Garcia.  Will Khans length be enough to stay out of range of uppercuts and hooks while limiting opportunities for floyd to pepper him with hard rights? Of course thats not all that needs to be said.

352389,0,t1_cfgzmsw,Ive seen that LomachenkoToledo fight.  It was a good shot but really just a flash KD.  Toledo was up instantly and didnt really seem bothered. As far as Ramirez we really dont know how durable the guy is because he has a very weak resume.  Bautista is the only person with a pulse he had fought.  I could understand if he was a journeyman and had been in with a lot of top talent and never been stopped but that wasnt the case.  A scenario like your describing very well could happen well see.  I know he has great footwork but I also think he burns a lot of energy in being so active on his feet along with upper body movement and hence why it seemed like he was trying to conserve himself some against Ramirez in case it went deep into the fight but in doing so he was allowing Ramirez to close the distance and get roughed up a bit and we might see the same thing here.  If this were a  round AM fight or a  round WSB fight Lomachenko likely wins easy.  The hope for Salido here is that hes a grinder where a fight going into the later rounds favors him and Lomachenko has never actually been deep in a  round fight and like I said he seemed a little off in his first scheduled  rounder against an inferior opponent.

I think only one or two were ever broadcasted live on TVA Sports.I can watch NBC Sports Network illegally online but Id much rather have it available legally in my cable package.It sucks so bad that we Canadians cant sign up legally to NBC Sports Network s website and watch it live there.The Internet is global after all but I know there are laws and rights and all but still its pretty frustrating to not get what you want legally.,Boxing,cfhvt59,1,t5_2qj0l

457711,0,t3_1zbr4a,ESPN guy Marcos Chino Maidana has a very special fight ahead of him on May rd more precisely against Floyd Mayweather.  According to the Santa Fe native this is the fight he has been waiting for his entire life.  Beginning mid March he will start training in California but for now he trains in Calchaqui in his native province of Santa Fe.  Our reporter Carlos Irusta was there and this is what the boxer had to sayCarlos  Is it true that you had no Idea about the online poll Mayweather organized?Marcos  I knew he was having an online poll but i didnt place too much importance on it because I knew he was going to end up picking who he wanted and I was sure he was going to fight Khan because they had already planned a fight against Khan.Carlos  And that mindset made you lower guard right? And say well Im not gonna train too hard because hes picking Khan in the end correct?Marcos  No it didnt matter to me because I had just fought Broner and I thought to myself well If he fights Khan then I can take a bit of a rest no problem.  But I was indifferent on wether he picked me or not.  I knew that eventually as time passed I would get the fight.Carlos  How did you receive the news that you were officially fighting Mayweather?Marcos  Well Sebastian Contursi travelled to meet with Al Haymon and he told me he would keep me informed and well I was here training and he called me and said that Mayweather had just publicized the fight so I continued training.  I got this kind of sensation you know... but well its just another fight and I cant be intimidated or anything.  I have to treat it like a common fight because... its an important fight and everything but I cant behave like Im afraid of Mayweather or anything.  Im treating him like a common rival because otherwise Ill show him too much respect in the ring.  So I say hes a common rival and Im going to fight with everything.  I dont care who he is.Carlos  Do you realize the extent to which many aficionados are anticipating this fight and are expecting your victory?  Is that on your mind or is it something you dont bother with?Marcos  Yeah I hear things here and there but you know I expect to beat Mayweather.  There have been many who have tried to defeat him and hopefully Ill be able to beat him.  The people are waiting for that... for Mayweather to lose... and for them Ill beat him.  Carlos  Something like that happened with Adrien Broner.  Marcos  Yes yes yes.  Something like that.  He came undefeated and I ruined his cake.  Something like that happened with Victor Ortiz too.  So every time i get a fight like this I like it.  I like that its difficult.  Every fight Ive had over there the states I have never been the favorite.  I have always been put in a fight to lose but well I come out winning.,Boxing,cfsahft,6,t5_2qj0l

538942,0,t3_20a4tx,I think your analysis is solid.  I think the two keys to the fight are going to be Cottos jab and Martinezs movement.Cotto is going to use his educated left hand meaning jabs and hooks to work his way inside and to control Martinezs lateral movement.  I agree that the pairing of Cotto amp Roach are going to go for the KO.  Martinez has been hurt in his last  fights and it is well established that head injuries are cumulative.  They are going to go for precise stinging punches on the inside.  That said I think they will try to force Martinezs hand in the first round and try to get a sense of exactly what his legs have to offer.I see Martinez trying to use a strategy similar the one Cotto unsuccessfully tried to use against Margarito in their first fight.  Movement movement and more movement and then try to catch Cotto with punches once he has him out of counterpunching position.  And never linger on the inside.If Martinez is able to show the physical tools he possessed as recently as  he should be able to win the fight easily.  If postsurgery he still resembles his  self than Cotto has a good chance at pulling off the upset.,Boxing,cg1j92p,1,t5_2qj0l

655248,0,t3_21lhit,Hagler did not want this fight. He wanted to retire and take care of a really tumultuous period in his personal life. I believe he had actually stopped training altogether. Leonard knew all this. Leonard knew a lot of things about Hagler and theres a lot of sleazy history there with Leonard taking advantage of Hagler. IMO Leonard is as good of a fighter as he is of an asshole just listen to him and his manipulations to get to this bout were pretty gnarly. He also knew like everybody else that Hagler had gone through some wars including a punch out with extremely heavy handed Mugabi who at the time was standing at like  KO ratio. The fight happened because it earned Hagler a huge paycheck but the dudes heart was definitely not in boxing by this point.IMO the fight is very difficult to score. Leonard had more production but Hagler was definitely landing the heavier blows. I can see it going either way or even ending in a draw. I dont really tend to score in favor of people trying to steal rounds  thats just not how I judge fights. That said the sad thing about this fight is how out of it Hagler looked. He just never looked like his old self. I dont think he had aged overnight. I think he was just going through the motions. As soon as this fight was over he was gone  making movies in Italy and just living in seclusion.,Boxing,cger2k0,1,t5_2qj0l

799107,0,t1_cgv0xzv,So basically you start off with a premise that athletes of today are massively strongerfasterbetter with no evidence except because unspecified advanced training methods and drugs. Then you extrapolate from that premise to argue that because everyone is so strongerfasterbetter now than in the past we have selected out fighters that would have been viable in the past but couldnt hang with todays fighters because advanced training methods.So if that was true a place like say the NFL would have guys running much quicker  times than in the s and the guys from the s would be way quicker than in the s right? Lets look at some  timesThis year the fastest  was Dri Archer at a .. Somehow despite all the advanced training methods available to Terrence and everyone else in the last  years they couldnt beat Chris Johnsons . time from . And Chris Johnson couldnt beat Deion Sanders .. And Deion Sanders couldnt beat Bo Jacksons . in . My point is you cant just dismiss elite athletes from prior generations with absolutely no evidence and just chalk it up to advances in modern training. Biology and genetics trumps modern training any day of the week and we have not evolved as a species enough in  years to say fucking Tommy Hears cant hang anymore with todays guys.Secondly you talk about this idea that somehow weve weeded out guys that have less punch resistance without taking into account the skill necessary to avoid being punched in the first place. Floyd may get punched  times a fight but that man almost NEVER gets hit clean. Skills mean something too and the fighters of the past were extremely skilled.So you can write another essay back it up with no evidence call me names but the fact is nothing at all that you wrote proves anything. And if you truly believe a guy like Tommy Hearns couldnt hang with todays generation of fighters I question whether you have even ever seen the mans fights.,Boxing,cgv40ok,0,t5_2qj0l

827516,0,t3_23lk1e,Takes great timing which is more of a natural gift or a veteran level skill.  You see guys either have it or they are older and know how to do it against the right opponent.  If perfected the jab is a punch that is easy for a savvy opponent to vary distance power double up andor change speed on.  If a guy can read your eagerness to counter you can be exploited.  Unless you have higher level range timing andor defensive slipping ability trying to counter jab could result in you eating the double or triple up or running into a stiff arm like shot.What we saw with Hopkins was the science of the sport overcoming an amazing physical specimen.  Shumanov was made to pay for EVERY mistake he was making in their such as not bringing his jab back on the same trajectory it went out while shifting his entire weight quickly forward at the same time.  Hopkins expertly put his arm out there and let Shumanovs aggression rawness and momentum do the rest.  Beautiful.,Boxing,cgyc9bo,3,t5_2qj0l

The knockdowns were all pretty lucky and I dont think the fact the punches didnt bother Collazo was just because Collazo is hard.

However you can tell that he was definitely honest in how he was feeling in both his appreciation to Broner when he got the money and in just how absolutely horrible he felt after it was all taken away from him and he ended up WORSE off afterward than he even was before.Again really fucked up world this is.,Boxing,chu9aul,3,t5_2qj0l

On the other Algieri did a good job of stymying Ruslans gameplan and was slicker faster and landed more. On the OTHER hand he didnt really hurt Provo much at all. On some further still other hand his boxing was better. Even if Ruslan took the decision his stock would still drop and even if Algieri lost his stock would rise.

He really had to work hard and mentally adjust to overcome some serious adversity in the first  rounds.  Crawford starts kinda slow anyways so if you couple that with Gamboas quick start it shouldnt have come as a surprise.I really feel Gamboas got legit raw talent and athleticism even though this fight was well north of his natural weight class he still had a great showing to start.  He put everything out on the table for the fans he tried to win this fight at all costs.

This is just reality sorry if it is not some honourable fairy tale but once again that bullshit goes out the window when you are getting punched in the face and your meal ticket is on the line. ,Boxing,ckdes2k,-1,t5_2qj0l
1862244,0,t3_2fx2qo,Heres my theoryEveryone probably went to see his ass get dropped back to the ghetto floor but went disappointed. Taylor was winning if not for the knockdown and we continue to find that Broner is quite talented despite it all. But the seatseller is almost a cultural agenda. Its the TMT formula that works but only with fighters like Broner. Mayweather said Broner got the remedy but he must know when to turn it off and when to turn it on. Now if you imagined Pacquiao making documentaries about his rich life hot wife crazy mother national hero  gun salute from Philipines and close to fight if he was asked by his PR to go out and say Algieri is a Long Island bum. Ill fuck him up and let him taste the Filipino typhoon gloves. Then he went on to go to Algieri who appears to be a tremendously decentmannered man choked him on press conference then the seats would sell out! But this is not culturally appropriate for some of the fighters. Fighters we have right now come to fight thats it. Most of the great sellers have been bloody feuds that start from badmouthing or disrespecting ones opponent. I assume everyone read the famous article where Frazier who has a gym upstate still burns with hate for Ali who at one time came to Frazier and planned how big a fight between them would be and when Frazier reluctantly agreed ali went right back to the seatseller mode and started calling Frazier an ugly moro that belonged to the zoo and whatnot. Frazier never forgave him. But thats the remedy the formula. People love feuds emotions drama. Who can disrespect anyone without a problem? People like Broner who never have respected anybody anyway. But it makes money. Seat sells. Boxing gets more popular. So I dont really feel too indignant except to want Broner and the like to go down in the ring. ,Boxing,ckdlfll,2,t5_2qj0l

1879380,0,t1_ckfklgc,gt Im not sure its possible to truly act this way.Act what way? like youre a badass when youre actually not?  One sees it happening all the time in boxing stare downs left and right.gt You know a man when you look him in the eyes.I know him when I look in his eyes as Im FIGHTING him  not when were not fighting.If someone looks in my eyes during a stare down theyll likely see a lot of fear trepidation and hesitation.  If they think that that will translate then into the actual fight and theyll be able to kick my ass because of that? then theyll likely get a REAL bad bad awakening.  Again it doesnt necessarily translate.  Im proof of that.gt Thats in all facets of life.Well I can just say that a lot of it depends on how you properly INTERPRET what youre seeing if youre looking into another persons eyes  and most people dont know how to properly interpret whats really happening and going on.  In life in general Im not particularly fond of staring people down or making too much eye contact even when Im talking directly to them.  Does that mean Im scared in general or scared of the person?  No.  In my world most of the time I tend not to look directly into the eyes of the person Im communicating with for two main reasons   It actually distracts me from whatever it is Im actually thinking about and wanting to communicate to the person because I tend to sometimes get lost in the stare in one way or the other and  since I can stare so intensely at things and at people it kind of makes me feel uncomfortable to think that I might be making THEM feel uncomfortable with how intensely I tend to stare at things and people.Perhaps Im a bit Aspergersy or OCDish or something but thats how I feel about the whole stare down thing...and in my case there are enough layers to me where one will likely not really be able to tell or interpret properly just what type of person I am just by looking at my eyes.gt A man is one that can be poised and courageous even in his most vulnerable state.Then  there really arent too many men on the face of the planet and  again as far as boxing is concerned you find out how poised and courageous even in the most vulnerable state a person is by FIGHTING WITH THEM more than just looking in their damn eyes.I can tell you how courageous or vulnerable a man with even NO EYES is if I can get in the ring with him.  Its about THE FIGHTING  not the looking.gt How can a spectator know a fight is believable without drama?Fuck the drama!  Jesus Christ the drama IS IN THE ACTUAL FIGHTING.  Man...I so totally hate the idea that you need drama! to sell a fight.  Fuck that.  That makes so many people be assholes like Mayweather and Broner when they simply dont have to be that...Just fight.  Thats it.  Its ridiculous really.gt Who wants to hurt their friends?In boxing its not about hurting and its not about friends.  Its about simply completing the task of boxingfighting effectively.  Its about being professional.  Ive sparred and fought a LOT of people that I liked and got along quite well with...and kicked their fucking ass while in the ring or got my ass kicked by them.  Right now even I have a fighter whos a female that Ive been training who I have been guiding on a oneonone basis for a few years now and who I am pretty damn close to on a fightingprofessional basis only...and I KICK HER FUCKING ASS ALL THE TIME.  We spar a lot.  Thats the only way she can really learn what Im telling her...and I beat. Her. Ass.And as a result shes gotten to be a real beast.And I am not a domestic abuseviolence type of person mind you.  I SUUUUPER dont condone that type of activity and I tend to want to REALLY hurt people that do that type of thing so I dont beat her ass because thats just part of who I am or some shit.  We boxfight because thats simply part of what has to be done in order to learn the craft.Its all technical stuff.Another guy I really get along with is Craig McEwan  He and I have sparred dozens of rounds.  I totally dig and respect that dude and we get along great...but boy have we beat the shit out of each other in the ring.Same with Roberto La Amenaza GarciaThese are great dudes.  Great people.  Again however it doesnt matter about being friends or not.  Its about being professional and DOING THE JOB.Its like any other sport  baseball or golf or soccer etc...Do you have to be MAD at your opponent in order to kick the ball right or his the baseball or put the golf ball?  Hell no!  You just have to focus and concentrate and do the job.  Thats it.Same in boxing.  Just do the job.  Be focused be professional.No anger or whatever is needed.  Therefore being friends or not is simply not even an issue.Hell take the fight that just recently took place between Roman Chocolatito Gonzalez and Akira Yaegashi.  Those dudes were all hugs smiles and hand shakes leading up to the fight.Then they got in the ring and beat the living shit out of each other.Take Arturo Thunder Gatti and Irish Mickey Ward.  Two class acts.  Had mad love for each other.Also had three back to back fight of the year battles that rivaled any fight in boxing history.Friendship or anger has really nothing to do with effective fighting.gt Happens to be my gripe with Pacman vs Aligieri. They simply to friendly to be fighting each other.Fuck that.  Manny is about THE nicest person and fighter out there...and will STILL beat the living shit out of you .gt I think people are often worried about fights being thrown so the antics let them know that they can believe in the fight.Again fuck that.  Its because most people dont know what the fuck theyre looking at.  And you just said it yourself right here.  You called it what it is  ANTICS.  Fuck that.  Boxing is too dangerous and too real to have antics.  Fuck the flair.  Just fight.Obviously a lot of people dont see things this way but well...I do.gt The idea of the stare down is to show the public how you are going to react to looking fear in its very eyes.Again thats completely stupid because that actually ISNT anywhere near whats accomplished during stare downs.  Its not necessarily indicative of how effective you will be IN THE ACTUAL FIGHT.I know how Ill fight and react in the ring with or without fear.  How I react when Im looking at it and giving it a stare down has zero bearing on that.gt If fights are more mental than brawn IMO its an important thing to know about your opponent.Fights ARE more mental than brawn and  again as Ive been saying this whole time  you DO get to know your opponent  IN THE RING FIGHTING THEM...not staring them down trying to act cool or intimidating or whatever.gt If you cant look at a fighter in stare down you cant be expected to dominate them in a fight.Wow.  Facepalm...But that is just the stupidest think Ive ever heard cuz this world is replete with examples of people that dont like stare downs and will STILL absolutely fuck you up and kick your ass DURING THE FIGHT.  You dont understandget that?gt That doesnt mean youll lose either.It VEEEERY much doesnt mean youll lose and anyone that thinks Aw yeah.  I dominated them in the stare down.  That means Im going to have an advantage and probably beat their ass during the fight. is just setting themselves up for an ass drubbing in the actual fight as far as Im concerned.EDIT  No disrespect meant by any of the harsh language by the way.,Boxing,ckfnpmt,1,t5_2qj0l

That I was in one of his many dozens of camps means really nothing as far as my knowing all the many other possibly hundreds of people hes sparred with over his life. gt I read your comments and I got this thought that all great fighters produced a sparring partner who later became a champ.I dont know.

2444774,0,t3_2ni9s1,If you are going to throw boxing politics out the window to make the main event why not the under card?Well I believe these to be realistic Demetrius Andrade vs. Erislandry Lara I read that Andrade inked a deal with showtime then he cancelled with Charlo then I read he still has one more fight with HBO. Either way it shouldnt hold up this fight. With Showtime signing him they view him as a future star and what better place to showcase him? Lara is Mayweathers WBA super duper paper champ title so a win by Andrade would give him a claim to fight Floyd. Lara can get back on the big stage with a chance to entertain albeit not likely following the Canelo fight also the Ishe Smith fight which will be a boxing clinic by Lara. That said I would rather this headline a showtime card but this is a dream. My prediction Lara SD Amir Khan vs. Kell Brook of course this is assuming Khan gets through Devon Alexander. This is a huge fight that could get made we just need to ask Al Haymon Its big in the UK and I am assuming Khan will still be expecting to get that Mayweather fight so he will get a showcase again. Again we are living in a fantasy world and this would headline its own card. If Khan loses Brook aint fighting yet by then just insert Keith Thurman My Prediction Brook midround stoppage unless onetime is in the ring. Adrien Broner vs. Jessie Vargas this one would probably headline its own card as well given Broners popularity. I put this on here because Vargas is on every Manny undercard and Broner is Floyds mini me Vargas is being hyped as a possible next opponent for Manny has a version the WBAs Super Bullshit title Broner wants Manny Broner could get a lot of negotiating power with that title  even if it isnt for a Manny fight. My Prediction Broner SDI filled the card with future potential matchups for both fighters win or lose. Welterweight is the glamour division of boxing likewise for  or  a weight class since Floyd goes up and Manny goes down so why not give the future a stage and chance to impress.edit BronerVargas prediction,Boxing,cmdvmx2,3,t5_2qj0l

I believe it is best to never get genuinely angry in the ring. If you smell blood and look for the kill thats a great use of aggression. If you are getting schooled get pissed off and you think that this will somehow make you more effective I would love to hear that argument. I dont think it ever works. Your power wont increase your defense wont get better your mind is now more occupied than it was before your technique certainly wont improve and the list goes on.

Another example is very recent  Lara vs Smith Lara got into Ishes head so bad during the fight  he frustrated Ishe that Ishe started to mimick lara with the hands down approach and ate a few Jabs for that. When he went back to his corner he said and I quote Hes so hard to hit man pissing me off I didnt see that in the second Liston fight as you say  Ali just beat Liston thats all..

2888615,0,t3_2t5k4b,Don King gets a lot of shit in this sub and deservedly so but I fear that our contempt for the mans shady business practices has blinded us to the fact that he is or was a consummate businessman. Make a mental list of the biggest fights in the history of boxing did The Rumble in the Jungle or The Thrilla In Manila come to mind? Those are Don King promotions. Make another mental listthis time of the biggest fighters in the history of boxingdid Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson make the cut? Those are Don King fighters. Now Ali and Tyson both claim that Don King screwed them out of millions and he probably did. But should we really accept their version of events as gospel truth? Ali and Tyson were notoriously reckless with their personal finances and boxers in general are typically poor money managers. Is it really Kings fault that both men struggled after their prime earning days were behind them? Dont most fightersirrespective of promoterface similar challenges in retirement?Ill tell you why Don King can still sign high calibre boxers because he is a legend in the business because he has the connections to get fights made and because he can offer cashstrapped prospects upfront money. DO NOT for one second underestimate how critical upfront money is to a struggling fighter. If you watched HBOs leadin  documentary to Hopkins v. Kovalev you might have heard Sergey say something truly bizarre in his interview early in his career he actually paid promoters out of his own pocket to get put on. That bears repeating Kovalev had to pay promoters to receive fights. If you think King is a crook what do you even begin to make of the sleazebags Kovalev was dealing with before Kath Duva showed up?Conversely King not only places fighters on his cards sans fee he also gives them much needed cash so that they can afford necessities like gym time trainers food and rent. Sure you could argue that this arrangement is exploitive Kings boxers are trading potential revenue in the millions for chump change. But from Kings perspective for every Ali and Tyson whom he backs how many prospects never secure a real pay day. King is entitled to a return on investment. If our collective antipathy to Don King was based purely on his treatment of boxers wed hold the anonymous hucksters ripping off the Kovalevs of the world in much worse repute. But we dont. We focus our rage against King. Why? Because he highly visible and unapologetically an asshole. But hes nowhere near the worst thing going in the dodgy world of boxing promotions.

2930029,0,t1_co0d22s,I get your point but why turn it into a You Brits thing?   You are always going to have fans who push for a prospect to be in a world title fight within a year of them first hearing about it thats not unique to the UK at all.  Price and Joshua are different too they both have Olympic pedigree Price bronze Joshua gold but there was always the concern that Price didnt have time on his side. He was  years old when he fought Tony Thompson and maybe some people felt he needed that step up in class as hes clearly no spring chicken.  Joshua doesnt have that problem hes not long turned .  I can see him looking at domestic fights this year to really establish his name to fans on this side of the pond.  Price and Chisora are the obvious candidates I dont think he looks at Tyson Fury until  if both guys careers continue in the direction they hope.  Its probably going to be  before Joshua moves into the top ten contenders spots but he will still only be  or  at that time which is in theory at least the start of the peak years for a fighter. ,Boxing,co15mcg,3,t5_2qj0l

3205079,0,t3_2wt7n0,So obviously no one else fights exactly like Floyd. But some fighters share particular similarities with him and I think it would be possible to build a group of sparring partners who collectively share enough similarities with Mayweather to really help Pacman prepare for this fight.For example some of Floyds signature defensive options are his philly shell see May v. Maidana  and his excellent sidetoside movement see May v. Maidana . So I would pick some fighters who utilize the philly shell such as Amir Imam mentioned by urudkillr below to practice finding effective angles and some slippery fighters who move sidetoside well maybe Tim Bradley? to practice cutting off the ring.

If that happens I think GolovkinLemieux is highly likely by years end maybe his th fight of  in NovemberDecember.  Cotto will never fight him but at some point he will have to vacate his title if he isnt willing to make the fight and at that point  Golovkin will fight the next highest contender for the vacant title.  Its slightly possible this happens this year.  As for the WBO title GGG really needs Lee to beat Quillin if he has any hopes of going undisputed.  Read my lips if Quillin wins the WBO strap he will never ever ever ever ever fight Golovkin under any circumstances.  In the meantime while hes waiting for these title shots to come up he should keep trying to go for the highest ranked fighter at MW he can find that will fight him and hopefully he can get himself a nontitle big money fight like JCCjr.,Boxing,covnrxx,9,t5_2qj0l

3243668,0,t1_coxfa4k,I wanted to add my two cents I feel like the mods have a disdain for certain kinds of discussions. So like in the run up to the fight a lot of people were talking about it speculating on it and building up hype that admittedly this was a surprise finally paid off with what will be the biggest match in recent history. I feel like this sub missed that whole ride because the mods had become a bit jaded with the fight not getting made and let that influence how and what should be discussed and honestly thats kinda lame. I can understand that kind of bitterness but I feel like as mods yall should keep that to yourselves and if people a little less jaded then you guys want to speculate about the biggest fight in recent history they should be able to. And not just in threads you decide are worthy of discussion.  I get the whole pactards vs im not sure what the mayweather equivalent is....fomos? thing and that yall dont want that. But this is kind of exactly the time for that we should have die hard pac fans talking shit and vice versa. If people dont like it theyll down vote it off. I admit I dont see whats coming in so I could be wrong but based on interactions Ive had with some of the mods in particular noiragent it seems like theres a bias against a specific kind of fandom that is a huge part of boxing. Im talking about clumsier sometimes misguided fans who root for fighters out of a more visceral fandom. A lot of sports have fans like these and theyre represented in all of their corresponding subreddits. On here though it feels like the mods have an axe to grind. So I feel like this sub is super over regulated and my other gripe is stuff like in the story a bit further up where a dude put together some OC for the sub and it was dropped because a mod was putting together something similar. That shits pretty weak. OC is great and its cool the mods take a lot of time to put things together but a lot of it isnt necessary and I dont feel like it accomplishes much more than linking to articles that do the same thing. I do feel like the mods OC is starting to flirt with making this sub their own personal boxing site which I dont like at all. I mean maybe yall could make a sunday puncher subreddit with the podcast and the writeups and the organized mod discussions and maybe in turn yall could ease up a little on regulating and curating rboxing.   So take from that what you will Im getting my boxing news from other sources right now but Id love to come back if this place picks back up especially as the sport is getting all these new viewers and fans.

3316563,0,t3_2y46bl,Floyd throw between  punches a round landing at his usually clip means he finishes landing about oo punches or about  a round.  This number may go up depending on Pacs activity.  The early rounds will be close as is usual in a Mayweather fight with it probably tied going into the th round and by then Floyd has Pacs rhythm down and begins a more accurate and varied attack which will see him pull ahead on the cards until he starts to walk Pac down around the th and maybe losing a little ground so he uses more movement in the final  rounds to switch up speeds and ride through to victory.  Pac will definitely have his moments but the amount of looks that Money shows in the fight is too much for Pac to adapt to and the unanimous decision goes to Money Mayweather. ,Boxing,cp6bdqw,2,t5_2qj0l

3325948,0,t3_2y5y22,First of all I dont believe theres one style or strategy that is best against Mayweather.  Weve seen him struggle against both Zab and Maidana who are about as different stylistically as you can be in boxing.  Also Mayweather is a great strategist proven to be an excellent midfight adapter whos been coached by world champions boxertrainers since the age of .  Hell adjust to any style thrown his way. To beat Mayweather its not about the specific style you use against him its about fightingboxing better than him and making fewer mistakes whichever style you choose and obviously nobody has managed to do that yet.So pacquiao needs to find the best style for himself of course tailored to this specific matchup.  Mayweather does have weaknesses or certain aspects that arent as amazing as his strengths he cant produce a ton of volume mostly due to issues with hand injuries and also doesnt have the best power in his punches. He also is very willing to back up which can cause him to lose rounds in the judges eyes even if he lands slightly more punches.  Also the biggest mistake he made against maidana in the first fight was backing straight up too much rather than making liberal use of lateral movement. He did correct this in the later rounds and in the second fight.  Against Zab his biggest mistake was thinking too much being cautious and allowing Zab to pick his shots and use his amazing hand speed which back then matched Mayweathers elite handspeed and Zab landed a lot of left crosses to the body.His strengths are many of course but in terms of biggest advantage over Pacquiao what stands out to me is infighting. Pacquiao needs to stay out of the pocket with mayweather. Pacquiao is not an elite infighter like mayweather is nor is he a master of fighting in and and out of the clinch like mayweather is.  If they get in close I think mayweather will win that exchange almost every single timeI know mayweathers most obvious asset is handspeed but one of the reasons Pacquiao is the best fighter PBF will have ever faced is because Pacquiao also has elite handspeed so I dont think handspeed is going to be mayweathers guarantee to victory in this fight like it has been against so many other fighters.Anyway after that intro this is is what I think could be pacquiaos best chance  He needs to be aggressive but also very disciplined. Pacquiao is liable to leave himself open to counter shots and mayweather is the best counterpuncher in boxing today.  Thats also how JMM managed to beat him.  So Pacquiao needs to take advantage of mayweathers passivity and backing up to win points in the judges eyes but he cannot push it too much or mayweather will punish him heavily.Pacquiao could throw  punches in the first round but I dont think that will be a good idea. He needs to be in the  range enough to please the judges but not so much as to open himself up too much.  Even if he wins the first round in the judges eyes with  punches thrown the spent energy and damage from countershots will haunt pacquiao throughout the rest of the fight.He also needs to use the jab a lot to attempt to throw off mayweathers anticipation. Something like this which Zab pulled off with limited success looks like a perfect tactic for pacquiaos abilities Also one of pacquiaos greatest improvements over the years is his right lead hook.  He needs to try to throw over the top of mayweathers jab and if he can eat a jab to trade a lead hook thats a winning exchange for pacman. Pacman needs to masterfully combine that right jab and lead hook. The dream for pacquiao is this Also with Roachs help he needs to come up with new possibly never before seen angles that not even mayweather Sr. will be able to prepare against.  Ideally this would be angles and punches that I a random redditor cannot really predict but I can speculate one exampleOne punch i actually never noticed before until recently is GGGs overhand lead punch he used it beautifully in his last fight   Heres another example from GGG Maidana had some success with his overhand right against pbf and if pacquiao can train to develop an overhand lead right it should have more success even than maidanas nonlead overhand right.  The overhand right attacks one of the rare openings of the philly shell defense and if pacquiao is successful with it he would be able to force mayweather out of his philly shell into his more textbook high guard a huge strategic victory if it happens.  Another slight clue to breaking the mayvinci code we can get from Maidanas second fight Mayweather made a mistake trying to sneak in a reckless right straight at the end of the third round .  Roach and pac have to study  mayweather fights to see if they can learn to time mayweathers attempts to sneak in a reckless punch as the bell sounds. Especially in any round thats close pac can steal it if he lands something like this   Also remember that mayweather basically gave away the next round to recover from the best shot maidana landed all night if pacquiao does it perfectly he could win two rounds with one punch like that.Like Roach said pacquiao needs to fight the perfect fight and I think these are some of the things that well see if that happens.,Boxing,cp7dwfl,1,t5_2qj0l

Floyd often gives away the first  rounds and then takes over.Floyd struggled in the first few rounds vs DLH he had very little success he struggled in the early rounds vs Mosely he got caught.

They better do something while they still have star power in the sport.There are only two TR fighters on our PP list and no GBP fighters.  Regardless HBO doesnt do output deals anymore and doesnt guarantee a number of fight dates.  They dont care about the promoters or their prospects.  They care about their programming and as soon these guys stop providing what HBO wants theyre out.  Look at Main Events.  Without Kovalev they can say good bye to HBO.  Without Canelo Golden Boy can say good bye to HBO.  Whithout Golovkin K can say goodbye to HBO.  Without Ward Roc Nation can say goodbye to HBO.  Whats worse is that these guys no longer have the platform to showcase theyre contenders.  The only option they have is to put them on undercards but more and more youre seeing they dont even have that.  K had to cross promote with Teiken and bring in Gonzalez for the Golovkin card.  Where do they put their prospects?  How do they build stars?  I wouldnt be surprised if HBO makes Duva bring in another promoter for the next Kovalev undercard after GlazkovCunningham.  What is Main Events going to do with their fighters if they cant put them on Kovalev undercards?

It was two guys in a ring trying to be the better man.  That fight had no politics and no bullshit. It was a fight. Both fighters showed amazing will power and determination. If you look at the body shot Gatti took when he went down and then see how he rallied back in the same round you just ask yourself how? Also  I loved the commentary during the fight. For whatever reason I always remember Gatti throwing multiple combinations at ward while he was tired and then Gatti got tired so ward shook his gloves and the commentator described it as ward saying cmon lets fight and then almost immediately ward explodes on gatti with some great punches.

3531428,0,t1_cpusl7w,I agree with the first part of your comment about Khan taking on all comers at .  However since his loss to Danny Garcia Khan hasnt done much.  The  Alexander fight should have happened in  but Khan avoided that because he assumed the Mayweather fight was locked up.  In my opinion Khan is still riding off his accomplishments at .  He needs to sack up and bring back the same attitude he had  years ago not play boxing politics with the media.  ,Boxing,cput27i,6,t5_2qj0l
3531961,1,t1_cpuuyso,Youre too transfixed by speed. Yes speed is a good attribute but what good is speed when you fight in a rhythm and your opponent can time you? This is why Khan lost against Garcia. Indeed Khan was faster than Garcia but he was also very predictable. As the the rounds went on Garcia was able to time Khan better and better  until he caught Khan flush and sent him to the canvas. Now Im no Algieri fanboy but theres no way you can tell me Algieri is outside Khans league. Julio Diaz was supposed to be outside Khans league. Danny Garcia was supposed to be outside Khans league. Dudes who are supposedly outside Khans league keep giving Khan trouble. What does that say about Khans league?,Boxing,cpuv8xm,5,t5_2qj0l

Again i dont approve of having children that small around that kind of language and activity but for the fighters.... meh. Shes just trying to toughen them up whos to say any of us could keep a guy like James Kirkland straight for as long as she did? ......edit......And to all these comments about James being overrated by whom? Who here has ever said James had ANYTHING in his arsenal but heart? Who here has been saying hes the next Toney or Pep? Who here has talked up his speed? Nobody. Because he doesnt have it all he has is his will to win and its been getting him by. And bring on the downvotes but James is a worse fighter without Anne the results speak for themselves.

Their records between receiving their TRT exemption and the UFCs ban on TRT were either  or  depending on when you start Chael Sonnens postexemption clock its unclear when he actually received his TUE. The draw was later overturned because of elevated testosterone levels and one fighter didnt fight before TRT was banned.Their average age at the time of their exemption was  years  days and only one fighter Todd Duffee received his TUE before the age of .So with  fights worth of data on TRT use weve produced an average fighter who wins  of his fights after the age of .This may all be a case of false equivalence though because boxings insistence on keeping TUEs anonymous means that the average boxer on TRT may receive their exemption at  and stay essentially doped up for  years.

He called Bradley out previously and his camp is alleging they have no clue who said no.  Of course the right response would now be for Khan to make a video confirming in person he wants the Bradley fight and the two of them being public in getting the fight made.  FWIW my money would be on Bradley as being too awkward for Khan but I hope that fight gets made.Peeps dont give Algieri the credit he deserves.  He has the heart fitness and isnt slow.

3795281,0,t3_33us88,as an amateur fan of boxing i wish there was something we could do about clinching and breakups in boxing like a  second rule let the fighters work out of the clinch or something along those lines. I believe the worst example of this was a mayweather possibly mardiana? fight where the ref broke up every clinch way to fast i want boxers to box more in the ring will less ref involvement. example if a boxer is in the a clinch let them throw body shots or pushes to get out of it. How come pushing away from a fighter is frowned upon in boxing?,Boxing,cqow4zu,1,t5_2qj0l
3795858,1,t1_cqoxsde,gt If he was fucking ft he wouldnt be fucking Wladimir Klitschkolol.  Agreed.  Hell thats part of my point.  Hed had been beaten down long ago.  He might get to the Sergei Liakhovich level and have won a world championship...but nothing like hes gotten.gt he wouldnt fight the same wayPossibly  but even if his style would change I can almost guarantee you that he wouldnt have the success hes had.  Its mainly and mostly his size that has gotten him to where hes at and the fact that he is so much bigger than everyone else.gt he wouldnt have the same skill setHis skill set would in all likelihood not be so different however that he would accomplish at a lighter weight everything that hes accomplished now as the massive human being that he actually is.gt The whole analogy is bullshit.No its not.  You just want to tell yourself that to try to make yourself feel better...but the fact of the matter is that you simply cant get around how much an advantage some would say an unfair advantage is his greatly massive size over almost everyone hes ever fought.Hes essentially the equivalent of a middleweight fighting welterweights.  If you have that kind of advantage over everyone you fight all you have to do is GET IN SHAPE.  It really doesnt matter if you know the finer intricacies of how to actually feint and slip or if youre a really intelligent boxer or not.  That doesnt matter.  Youre so much bigger than everyone else that all you have to know how to do is basically keep your fucking hands up generally know how to throw a one two and not be COMPLETELY uncoordinated.  And Wlad fits that bill to a tee.gt Im not disputing that his style wouldnt work if he was ft but the whole point is he is actually a giant and no matter how much you whine tomorrow morning and every morning until he dies Wlad will wake up ft.Goddamn bro.  You are SOOO fucking missing the point here.  Are you like...purposefully trying to ignore what Im saying?  Wow.  Maybe you are Wlads urologist.Im not trying to make the dude NOT . lol.  WTF?  Im just calling the shot and saying that he simply WOULDNT BE AS ACCOMPLISHED if he werent as big.  Wow.  What about that do you not understand?gt Saying hes shit because of his size is the fucking dumbest thing ever.No you fucking stupid ass. lol.  facepalm.  Im saying hes shit because OF HIS SHITTY STYLE.Hes awesome because of his size.  Thats whats made him be as good as he is.Man...Youre just...not getting it.  This isnt even worth it any longer.

3796219,0,t1_cqoz1z5,Floyd is obviously still elite but he doesnt have the legs he used to.  Consider his Maidana fights.  He found himself on the ropes all to often.   years ago Floyd wouldnt have touched those ropes once.  Now watch the KhanMaidana fight.  Khan was zipping around Maidana like a gadfly rarely getting caught on the ropes.  I have no doubt Floyd wouldve done the same if he was  years younger.  Also seeing Floyd sitting on his stool in the later rounds of the Maidana  fight thats the first time Ive seen him look his age and seen him realize his age.  You could tell he knew he wasnt the boxer he was in years past.  Still amazing but his legs are starting to fight him imo.

But then there are those who will gladly take many to land one big shot and at times some boxers can win by brute strength or engaging in a firefight. Of course you get those inbetween. Boxers can be divided into three groups Boxer Puncher and BoxerPuncherBoxer  Uses his technical skills and boxing fundamentals to beat the opponent while avoiding hits. Boxers who like to counter punch fall under this as well. Example of a boxer is Mayweather and Rigondeaux.Puncher  screw technique its hulk smash time. Well okay some punchers still have good technique but they tend to prefer come forward and swing. Tend to rely on physical prowess to get them through. Although a stereotype Mexican boxers tend to be like this due to pressure from tradition. Example of a puncher is Maidana Carl Froch and James Kirkland.BoxerPuncher   A mix of the two above. Tend to like to wear down opponents or assesses them early rounds can be feel out rounds and then bullrush them and knock them out or at least tenderize them. See Gennady Golovkin Sergey Kovalev Carl Frampton BUT just because a boxer is one type doesnt mean they dont display parts of a different type Vasyl Lomachenko is a boxer but hes capable of exhibiting boxer tendencies when the moment is right.  maintaining your energy and striking when your opponent is drained can be a viable tactic and it can also cost you the fight as you lag behind on the scorecard.

I know Floyd is able to inject illegal substances to help with his hands that is only allowed in the state he fights in which is probably why he doesnt fight anywhere else. But on the night of the fight Pac had an shoulder cuff injury that may affect his performance and was not even allowed to use an inflammatory drug or anything else to help it.

You should really understand how it works before you start presuming what people are doing with their money.Well i asked a question.However the reason i said that is because the Philippine people believe that he has to pay money to the Philippines specifically Henares.  In fact theres heavy conflict of how much. So if hes giving money to Philippine charities theres a reason and its satisfy his tax obligation. That doesnt mean theres a fair amount of good will.

3954403,0,t1_cr7005t,This is going on pretty long so Ill try to cap everything a bit shorter know I wont succeed. Mainly it sounds like your trying to defend UFCMMA or whatever. Though its pretty hard to do. No matter how you try to minimize it the UFC is not devoid of racist fans. Neither is boxing as it is in fact I would hazard to say boxing is maybe a bit worse because its a global historical sport with a diverse array of talented boxers that often times are the face of a country. I can go to Mexico Philippines or Russia and find hostile fans to other ethnicities or whatever and still find some at a press conference that are perfectly amiable or root for the other guy. Thats not amazing.Secondly you keep trying to bring up Broner. Broner actually showed some humility and admitted Maidana is a good fighter post fight. Theyve even taken amiable pictures together and all that jazz. I also dont know what racist thing your saying Broner said. Hope its not that can man incident because if it is I might as well just stop here. Though youd be hard pressed to show me where Broner with his faked his heel persona is at the point where hes hopped over a cage and ran up on competition or tried to start a brawl at press conferences or has insulted the entire division or personally on twitter and stuff at the level McGregor does it.As far as your No True MMA fan deal. While most people know he doesnt have a chance against Aldo either thats kinda besides the point. Because all of last week and even still this fucking week rmma is talking about Boxing is Dead and all the casuals like MMA. So you dont get a pass of talking shit about boxing being dead and for purists and all that other hoopla and MMA is better yall and then get to discount the rampant amount of casual fans in the MMA world who are so monobrained. There still a substantial part of the pack. In fact Ill say that theyre one of the driving parts in the UFC.Anyway all of that is just a bunch of humdrum shit I dont care about let me try to get to the real point that is irksome. QuotegtI know you didnt write that MMA fans like one type of fighter. But it was sort of implied in your statement. It is ignorant to assume that most fans are like McGregors Irish fans in Boston I have seen their counterparts in NYC. Firstly that is incorrect. You inferred that. Im not responsible for that error. Lets look at the actual brief sentences.gtBasically hes the soup du jour badass for UFC fans.Maybe it was soup du jour which just means currently he is the UFCs model badass. There is no denial of that which why Dana white is encouraging him and helps make him headline. Its also why McGregor himself keeps on with his atrociously charlatan act.gtHes brash cocky flashy and white Irish! Already talked to death. Everything is accurate here!gtWhich is fucking grade A for a big number of UFC heads. Key word. There is no absolutism. I am aware that there are other people like myself that see thru his weak acting. Thats why I said a big number if UFC fans. Its obviously been successful for those involved.gtOnly way that it could be better is if he was a heavyweight.Selfexplanatory.,Boxing,cr71akp,1,t5_2qj0l

Honestly I think ggg moves better than mayweather just on the fact that he mixes aggressiveness with his movement.

If you think Mosley ducked Floyd then I will say Floyd ducked Collazo. Hahaha I like how you intentionally omitted the Manny KO loss to JMM yet you count the margarita win from .. All your talk is false Oscar was DONE when Floyd met him. I dont care how many Impressive wins he had.. Its like arguing that HOLYFIELD beat a prime Larry Holmes because Holmes was coming off an Impressive win over Ray Mercer. Floyds style lends itself to longevity and Mannys style doesnt.   Look at Guerrero right now at  he is washed up more than Floyd and Manny.. yet they are both older than him. See lennox vs Tyson  Lennox is about a year older but Tyson was far washed up when they met. Floyd was in his prime when he met Oscar Yawn Bro I am sure that there are some yr old welterweights that Manny pacquaio can also school.. Canelo was . Too green and .

4269268,0,t1_cs6sq7n,gt Could it be the same in the Netherlands concerning kickboxing?Yes and no. Kickboxing isnt really a big sport here compared to say football or tennis or hockey or cycling or even skating. Its a big thing for younger people but thats a pretty niche demographic and even then its only on TV every few big months when a big event happens like the K.Its a popular past time for kids but that too is a niche among mostly immigrant kids e.g. Morocco Surinam Turkey and kids from a lower socioeconomic standing. Kickboxing isnt seen as a way out like say basketball or the NFL for black youths in the US whose socioeconomic position shares similarities with immigrant kids do here in the Netherlands or even Europe in general but its definitely seen as sort of a release valve for a macho and hyper competitive street culture which is why martial arts in general have some popularity.So why kickboxing but not boxing? Its a good question thats not easy to answer. One big component though is that its a well known fact that theres a lot more money in kickboxing and that its mostly criminal money. Boxing is a sport where Mayweather makes m in one year while Khan top  fighting Alexander top  makes k and Brook top  fighting Porter top  makes k or Pacquiao for his second divisional world title made k against Ledwaba and probably k after prize taxes and paying for the gym rent team salaries for the training camp and flight tickets. My point here is that unless youre at the very pinnacle of the sport even if youre a solid athlete on the world stage and can firstround KO . of the world population you tend to only make a few thousand bucks a month meaning an ordinary but solid pro boxer in the Netherlands in a sport with no league salaries but only prizes will only make k  k for a fight and hopes to fight every  months. Thats just the nature of prize fighting instead of a singlefederation league with salaries. e.g. Mayweather makes m in a single fight to Brooks .m a x difference and theyre both arguably in the top  in their division. In Football for example Rooney makes m but the average top  player in the Premier league makes m a mere x difference between the nr  and average . And as big as the gap is between Mayweather and Brook financially as big the gap is between Brook and another pro fighter who is ranked nr  or nr  who probably makes k for a match which again doesnt exist in other sports like Football where even a top  in  of many big European leagues makes just x less than the nr  earner in that leagueThat kind of income is completely unworkable for a dangerous amp short career. Kickboxing in the Netherlands however doesnt get its money from ordinary tickets but from mostly criminal guys who organise fights tournaments bring over their entire crew etc and then pay the fighter k under the table and then offer him a job as a runner or bodyguard or some shit like that. And thats huge in the Netherlands I live in Amsterdam and its a very safe and pleasant place but beneath it theres a ridiculous shit ton of criminals living here for a cit of less than a million its a crime capital but its not known as such because its organised crime that doesnt really affect ordinary citizens or tourists much and there is little collateral damage in the various assassinations that happen every few months. You can read about it a little bit here A lot of that money some of the biggest drug lords of Europe lived and operated here goes into various things and kickboxing is one of them. Both as sort of this gladiatorlike entertainment for organised crime as well as as a de facto recruitment platform. The list of assassinated professional kickboxers here is pretty long from guys getting assassinated while taking a stroll with their families to guys disappearing and stories surfacing of them being dumped in cement and thrown into the river.Now as of late kickboxing is trying to change this image this indeed has changed from the s and s when this was much more common place than today. But thats essentially how kickboxing even became a thing a ton of money that brings in sports talent and retains talent that would otherwise have gone on to other sports. While boxing here has so little money amp commercial potential at the moment that it just doesnt draw much talent not many gyms exist because theres no real money in it instead theyre kickboxing gyms and do  days a week kickboxing and  day a week boxing or something like that companies dont sponsor fighters because the fighters have no exposure TV doesnt broadcast it because theres no quality competitions etc. And its hard to get it off the ground its a chickenegg problem. If you dont have talented boxers you cant create a viable boxing business industry. But without a viable boxing industry that makes money youre not going to get talented boxers. Unless either boxing is deeply ingrained in the sports culture historically e.g. more like in the UK or say ice skating here in the Netherlands which nobody cares about except for that its tradition or if you get some outside force like in kickboxing criminal money or in e.g. basket ball  running  tennis etc etc in e.g. China since recently and for the next few decades lots of government funds looking to build worldclass worthy olympic amp professional teams.,Boxing,cs6v41n,4,t5_2qj0l

4282132,0,t1_cs8ajq3,Yup true.Although Ive hear two legitimate reasons for that to put it into perspective.One is that he was a football player and weighed  which obviously has very different goals to boxing and requires a bigger guy yet he was also boxing during this time as an amateur.The other is that hes said to have weighed down his pockets with weights to make certain fights like his pro debut he fought a guy who weighed  and he supposedly weighed  while he fought at  less than  month later indicating he probably loaded up with weights in his pockets to make the debut fight happen.So Porter is definitely a big guy but the ridiculously high weights gt  can be explained... still his natural division is closer to SWW than WW making a fight between super lightweight and welterweight really hard for him I think.But he looks very good in recent videos. I dont see him look drained at all and hes virtually at his target rate already.

4285132,0,t1_cs8mj9q,The simple fact with Andrade right now is that no one knows. Andrade looked good against Martirosyan but not the future pound for pound goat some people saw. He does a lot of things that make him look talented but who knows. Martirosyan is as onedimensional as they get and he dropped him. In Andrades next fight against Brian Rose he destroyed him but anyone who knows Rose knew that he was clearly domestic level and had arguably lost his fight heading into the one with Andrade. I think Andrade benefits from a few things. Hes a southpaw who fights in a defensive style which we always give a lot of credit to until we see it beaten that has shown power in recent memory. The truth about Andrade is still to be seen. He might be really good and he certainly has the physical attributes that back up that sentiment. The problem is that hes faced no one or done anything that should make you confident in proclaiming him a top tier fighter. ,Boxing,cs8nktw,5,t5_2qj0l

4381353,0,t1_csjfadw,That business acumen is precisely the part Im curious about. He saw something in the boxing industry that many did not he saw weaknesses and clear opportunities to strike at with a longterm plan of development. Meanwhile theres lots of wellestablished heads in the business that havent grown for quite some time. Id like to know exactly what it was that caught his eye his game plan for getting in what surprises he found once he got in challenges he faced in attracting the initial stable of fighters challenges hes facing now as an established power butting heads with old power in the sport. Id like to know about how he relates personally to boxers. Who have been his biggest allies? we all know several big enemies already. Whats his strategy for cultivating relationships since this is a heavily relationshipdriven business. How does he feel about the criticism hes received thus far and how would he want to justify himself etc.Most importantly  what is the end goal of the moves hes making? Is it to just consolidate a profitable stable of fighters? Does he have plans to change the way that fights are made once he has enough power to set standards? Whats his relationship like with the regulatory bodies and does he plan on trying to influence them as well? Finally Id ask about the business itself what kind of margins has he been making on fights? Im guessing hes sinking a lot of money upfront on a lot of fighters in hopes of getting better payouts from a select few to cover all of them and make a profit. Id love to see his PampLs for the past few years to see where all the money ends up going. What are his sources of capital particularly when he was just starting? How healthy is his cash flow? How is that TV deal working out and what are the goalposts hes shooting for to deem it a success? Whats his employee structure like and how is he drumming up new business i.e bringing in established fighters vs. picking out prospects early? I might even ask him a few questions about his past but really Im more interested in him as an entity than as a person. Boxers influence the landscape of the sport within their weight division the best of them influence people above and below their division to try to get a big fight made. Over the course of their career they might shift divisions. Haymons arguably a bigger influence than any boxer out there. ,Boxing,csjiivy,3,t5_2qj0l

Most people seem to have Bradley winning by a large margin. The end really doesnt justify a rematch with the could he have knocked Bradley out in the last ten seconds mystery. Bradley probably wouldnt have gone down and even if he did he would definitely get back up by eight. At which point when the count is over the fight would end. Even with a  round Vargas wouldnt have closed the gap in points.I might be alone in this but this fight really made me want to see Bradley against Khan. Regarding that though I think Khan takes it by UD. The handspeed and reflexes of Khan plus the small amount of power Bradley has is what tips the scale in Khans favor for me. Plus Khans age height and reach advantage. I noticed in some rounds a jab from Vargas was able to disrupt Bradley. Khans jab is vastly superior to Vargass so I think that would also cause problems for Bradley. ,Boxing,csl7se9,7,t5_2qj0l

4492529,1,t1_cswxik7,gtSo hes conceding that Ward is the better fighter and he needs an advantage.No hes conceding that Ward is a better fighter than the other opponents whom he would willingly face at .  GGG is unwilling to give a weight advantage to Ward and the catchweight is an attempt to make sure that no one fighter has any weightrelated advantages.  I dont believe that GGG is trying to level out the skill playing field by trying to meet Ward at a catchweight which is awkward for both of them.gtNot exactly the wrecking ball people make him out to be huh?Well many people tend to hype GGG too much.  I agree with you that those who say that GGG would easily steamroll Ward at  are wrong.gtBtw their fight night weight is virtually the same so its not like Ward is this giant compared to Golovkin. Where are you finding this?  The first result of the google search ward fight night weights states that Ward weighed  the night he fought Dawson and that GGG weighed  the night he fought Proska just ctrlf ward for the noninternet savy users out there as it is a rather large page.  If you provide some support for your claims Ill be more than happy to believe you but if the first link contradicts you Im inclined to believe that you are making things up...Edit upon closer inspection of the data available it does seem that there have been nights when GGGs fight night weight has approached Wards fight night weight.,Boxing,cswxyqk,1,t5_2qj0l

Other than a tiny sentence at the beginning there was no mention of Danny until over halfway into the article. There was a bit of Get to the point already.As for your solution Im not so sure. Youre basically suggesting Danny Garcia to be a completely different fighter or to purposely become a punching bag.  I think Bradley has always been the Bradley people loved postProvodnikov and people simply didnt know or just forgot about it after the Pacquiao mess. Ex Getting up to beat Holt after getting dropped hard in the first. People found out or remembered who Bradley was with the Provo fight.Your solution feels like a smokescreen to the actual problems. Why is Danny hated? The cherry picks and the gifts.  How do you resolve the cherry picks? By not fighting guys like Paulie Malignaggi.   How to you resolve the gifts? By giving Herrera and Peterson rematches. Heck if he really wants to become loved again give Matthysse a rematch so people remember why anyone liked Danny in the first place.,Boxing,ctlxscq,9,t5_2qj0l

4741858,0,t1_ctrtm6y,So I am from the UK so I will speak with a smidge of authority. Now it is certainly the case that he gets asked about it constantly. He started all of this though he did ramble on about it especially as he got closer to getting the fight when the whole Maidana or Khan debate began. It is now just an extension of that he has thought he was at the front of the queue for ages and it has meant he doesnt want to step aside and say take on Brook for fear of losing his place in the queue. The problem is that despite being near the front of the queue Floyd doesnt seem remotely interested in entertaining the fight. I get that the press badger him but he very much started all of this and it why he is where he is today too scared to take a risky fight but at the same time perhaps winning that risky fight makes Floyd pick him.,Boxing,cts97tw,1,t5_2qj0l

No great fighters on his resume. That is the truth. How can he be the greatest when his brother was reigning alongside him? He has some good wins Rahman Peter Haye Byrd. Those are all guys who stood out and accomplished something in their careers beating tougher competition and winning titles. Leapei and Mormeck are not that. Wach? He is doing a good job of beating young lions too Brock Jennings Pulev etc. I rank him in the top  of the division for sure based on dominance and defenses and length of reign.

5103368,0,t1_cv0vuc6,gtAlso you criticize Floyd for fighting the smaller Marquez yet you thought it was strange how he dismissed Paul Williams who during the time of the Marquez fight was fighting at middleweight and is significantly taller than Mayweather.Williams was once competing in the same lbs division as Floyd and he called him out. Marquez had never been past lbs and May was at  calling Marquez out. Think Thurman vs Gamboa. gtCan someone explain how exactly does Bayless count as rigging? I never understood that honest question.Watch the berto fight. Kenny basically asks the opponents not to fight Floyd. Im being serious. Let me give you more examples gtgt In the Chino rematch.. He was really quick to break them up there were a few instances of him anticipating and jumping in before they were even really clinched. Maidana couldnt do any work on the inside because Bayless broke them up as soon as Mayweather tried to clinch. You see Maidana he is a power puncher  very flat footed and slow but devastating in close quarters it is better for him to exchange in reduced spaces since his opponents are guaranteed to receive punishment let me also add that maidana will not be a victim of dirty tacticsring smartsstreet smarts he will hold his own if not victimize you.Now floyd  he can fight anywhere in the ring either on the ropes center on the run he is a complete fighter. Floyd likes to throw fast punches jabs lead rights and almost immediately smother or clinch his opponents or just basically use his physical fortitude against his opponents. Then after he has controlled his opponents he fights more openly and lively  clinching less and making it seems like he fights like that for all  rounds.For the maidana fight. Lets start with Weeks letting them fight both floyd and maidana imposing their will and veteran tactics in the ring with maidana getting the best of it. Now this is weird since floyd is usually the one grabbing and shoving his opponents now we have maidana man handling floyd and also connecting him at an unusual rate. After  rounds floyd is behind and cut and apparently uncomfortable Floyd starts complaining to weeks about maidanas infighting fighting on a clinchforcing floyd to the ropes and almost immediately weeks adjusts and all of the sudden referee is breaking up clinches more often and thus limiting maidanas success in relation to the early rounds and still since maidana had some success throughout the fight.After this fight Mayweather exclusively asks for Kenny Bayless.

5311562,0,t3_3nqv0o,Lemiuex has size on Triple G but thats it. Golovkin is by far the superior boxer has a ridiculously storied amateur career has fought better opponents and has looked better against better opponents. I think any of Murray Geale Macklin give Lemiuex a competitive fight.Lemiuexs best chance will be to back Golovkin up but hell have to be on the losing end of a number of trades before that can happen. If Lemiuex starts moving backwards once he tastes Golovkins leather thats a wrap  a matter of time before it is over.If Lemiuex manages to get Golovkin going backwards then it gets interesting. His shots will have more on them due to the momentum of being the forward fighter which should somewhat balance out with Golovkins accuracy. GGG is hittable his offense is his defense and he relies on a lot of subtle movement to evade shots. Hes usually either catching them on the guard or avoiding them by small margins  incredibly skillful stuff but prone to sometimes going wrong as it is more reactive than proactive defensive movement. Floyd Mayweather and Pernell Whittaker use proactive movement thats what makes them so hard to hit because the target is already on the move by the time a punch is thrown.So first Lemiuex has to make Triple G respect him which I think he will then he has to get him to back up which I dont think he will then he has to be able to land cleanly enough to hurt Triple G which I dont think he will.So Im saying Triple G knockout rounds ish with Lemiuex backing up after a few early furious rounds.,Boxing,cvqm45m,3,t5_2qj0l

But if you start adding other aspects of it such as the reach advantage it adds a little more to Canelos favor. Then if you add the youth advantage it adds a little more to Canelos favor.

Before MayPac fought each other both of their PPV numbers were trending down. Neither had reached a million buys since  with Pac dipping as low as K against Rios and K against Algieri. The problem has been promotion by Roc Nation Sports. RNS wont be in the game in two more years theyre the ones overpaying for fighters. Cottos highest PPV that he headlined was k against Margarito which was held in NY and had a great storyline. It was also promoted by the best Top Rank. Canelos highest PPV he headlined was K against Angulo. You got Cotto getting paid  mil allegedly and Cotto around  mil allegedly. They put it in a  seat arena in Vegas. The tickets are overpriced. Theyre asking people to buy a  PPV a  days before Thanksgiving  days before black Friday and  days before Christmas. This has been a shitty promotion between two guys who have shown not to be mil PPV buys on their own. And to top it all off both camps have admitted they wont be fighting the mandatory their next fight. So well get Cotto vs a farewell fight if he wins or Canelo vs Bradley if he wins.

5819596,0,t3_3ux43v,I dont want to take these ideas as my own but after speaking at lenght with unoirargent amp ubrightongoose it really boiled down to two simple things Wlad was unprepared for Furys game plan amp Wlad is a robot who is unable of adjusting in the ring. The vast majority of Wlads opposition bum rush him head on and try to land that lucky punch on his chin to knock him out.  So thats what he trained for but is that what he got?  No he got a guy who was content on boxing on the outside and chipping away and outpointing him.  Fury was able to use his size to his advantage and fought a very smart fight.Wlad is also a robot whos unable to adjust to a different game plane while in the ring.Personally I think the writing was on the wall if you look back at the Jennings fight.  That was a fight everyone expected Wlad to KO Jennings w in a handful of rounds.  No one expected that fight to go the distance but it did.  I saw a Wlad who was incapable of throwing the right hand and finding the correct distance to throw it at.  Mostly due to Fury staying out of range but partly due to Wlad being gun shy too.  He was legit worried about what was coming back because these are HWs anyone can knock anyone out on any given night.Fury fought the perfect fight he basically short circuited a robot and won a clear UD.,Boxing,cxih4kp,40,t5_2qj0l

Once he has seen you put all you have into a shot and sees no threat hell let you get excited offensively while readying a counter punch to take you out  just like he did against Geale famously.  Lemieux is the first boxer Ive seen GGG to willingly take shots from hence using the jab x more than the average boxer in the weight class.

In this video he states clearly despite his very poor English that he thought the ref did the right thing by stopping it so his opponent would still have his health. You seem to want him to be a villain but there is nothing to support that save his honesty about the dangers of his profession. I dont believe people are dying more now than they did in the past and actually would guess its the opposite...I think he should draw attention to the risks and maybe fans will be a bit less bloodthirsty.Ward is a tougher fight I think. If Kovalev destroys Stevenson it will be like the maypac fight  it needed to happen when it needed to happen in order for it to be meaningful and the fact that Stevenson lost says as much about his abilities eroding as it does about Kovalevs talent.

Imagine if he hit you as soon as he sensed the tiniest movement in your body every single time and each time it fucking hurt. By the time youve decided to throw a jab hes already throwing that counter wham you shift your body wham you pump fake a jab wham you look at his feet for a split second wham.Sure it wouldnt knock you out it wouldnt make you very concussed but its like every time you take a step youre stepping on a nail. Then after youve stepped on about  nails youre like fuck this shit im just gonna brawl and then you brawl then while you windmill those arms he blocks every shot and then he goes back to nailing you in the face constantly but this time youre exhausted. Its death by a thousand needles.If youve ever done boxing I can tell you being gassed halfway through the bout fucking sucks you cant block or slip punches anymore so youre just a walking punching bag. You want nothing more than the match to just be over and you just hope your opponent hits you in the head hard enough so you can fake a KO. Sure I wouldnt do that in a match but Ive done it in sparring on a couple occasions.This is what happens to every fighter against Floyd they go out their thinking theyve got the perfect strategy thinking his punches wont hurt and they just get nailed in the face constantly while not being able to do anything and getting extremely tired in the process so they get frustrated as fuck and just want the match to be over.Just like the famous words of Tyson everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. ,Boxing,cyhcsty,1,t5_2qj0l

6129212,0,t1_cyllyoy,Great point. Theres actually some neat heavyweight history to back up this argument. When Eddie Futch was preparing Frazier for Ali he focused heavily on Fraziers bobbing head movement because he knew a major weakness in Alis arsenal was his right uppercut. In the famous footage of Ali and DAmato before Alis comeback Cus actually mimics Fraziers movement in front of Ali to point this out. Sure enough Fraziers bobbing and weaving proved a nightmare for Ali and allowed him to consistently back Ali onto the ropes.Contrast that with the ForemanFrazier bout where Fraziers bobbing and weaving is completely neutralised by the long uppercuts of Foreman that come from a starting point where such shots should not be possible. Whether an aged Foreman could have done that to Tyson or not is another matter. But with respect to Foreman Frazier and Ali alone it speaks to the old adage of styles making fights.

6140146,0,t1_cynk99e,gt personally I was never interested in the GGGWard matchup purely because Kovalev exists.I would much prefer the Golovkin fight to the Kovalev fight for Ward simply because its the easier fight for him.gt Kovalev and Ward are both ft with similar reaches so size wise its not as big as I initially thoughtWow.  Didnt know that.  Man Kovalev just seems so much taller than everyone he fights.  Perhaps its because hes such a skinnylooking light heavyweight.  I dont know.gt this is a fight that will either make or break Ward and i cant fucking waitI personally feel hes made enough and wouldnt be the least bit mad at him if he even decided to retire never fought again and just remained a commentator on HBO or wherever for the rest of his days.Too many fighters that have gotten injured and punchy.

He could call Kovalevs use of black racist but most Americans wouldnt agree. How useful is his opinion to the Russian audience? Now recall he iswas a rival of sorts and a Kazakh.

If Khan can channel that energy and continue on the same path as he did for the Alexander fight we might get something interesting. At the end of the day even though the odds are heavily in favor of Canelo I have a feeling we might possibly get to see Khan fight a beautifully technical fast fight and win on the decision.

I think that hed fight better if he cut less water weight more activity and stamina for a start they just wanna bring GGG down as much weight as they can staying at  gives them leverage. Also if your cutting more weight than you should to make a division it puts you at a disadvantage against guys who can make the weight more easily. But it puts you at a big advantage over smaller guys moving up khan or guys your size or smaller who would have more difficulty making the big weight cut GGG not that it would make any difference.

I dont see anything in your post that reasonably refutes the idea that Khans putting his health more at risk than is usual for boxing in this fight.

That weakness were exposed in his loss to Erik Morales. On the other hand Junior Jones was a very powerful puncher who knew how to employ the Mexican style of going to the body and the head. I saw Junior Jones fight as an amateur in New York City. Jones won two NYC Golden Glove titles and he had more TKOs and KOs than any other NY city amateur boxer from his era. I knew he was special and I told my coach from the Webster Avenue Police Athletic League in the Bronx two things One NEVER set up a fight between me and Junior Jones.

The opponent dropped his hands multiple times and taunted Rigo for his passivity offering Rigo a chance to reply with his gloves and show the opponent and the crowd that they were wrong to mock him.Everybody knew Rigo was going to win even his opponent knew it. This fight wasnt about whether or not Rigo would win it was about trying to showcase his talent and entertain a crowd so that he could draw the star power hed need to earn some real fights. Roc Nation was trying to boost him by giving him this fight. The commentators did their job by pointing out the skills the footwork the ranking on pp lists. The fans bought the tickets and PPVs to see him fight. Rigos fans hyped him to their friends telling them to come see a boxing masterclass.

6602499,0,t1_d0266b2,This is because you literally do not know what youre looking at.  If you did youd realize the arc that he throws his punches with  particularly his left uppercuthook  is pretty unique.  No other fighter throws the uppercuthook as effortlessly cleanly and accurately as he does.  Its usually just a hook forearm more parallel with the ground or an uppercut forearm perpendicular to it.  Chocolatito throws a hybrid of the two so that A you dont know whats coming at you and B it lands at an angle youre not ready for or expecting.Also the way he throws his combinations is very different than the normal fighter.  Its usually from the orthodox stance  left jab  right cross  left hook   right cross  left hook etc.   and goes back and forth like that.  Not only is this how combinations are most often thrown it is also what most fighters are used to dodging as they move.  If you know how the combination is going to be thrown then you know how to effectively move to defensively slip the combination and make it look easy doing it.Chocolatito however often doubles up with one hand and throws the whole expected combination rhythm off.  He tends to throw his combinations by throwing for example  left jab  left uppercuthook  straight right  right uppercut  left uppercuthook  left uppercut etc etc.This COMPLETELY throws the opponent off in terms of how to evade whats coming at them.  They have no idea how to get away from the punches being thrown.And Chocolatito throws these weird types of combinations soooo effortlessly that it is just...its amazing.  These awkward combos just flow out of him so smoothly that most people have no idea what they just saw and it just looks to most people like he threw a basic    and the opponent went down.  Most people  people like you  think Meh.  Whats the big deal?  Hes not doing anything special.  Hes just throwing punches and the opponents going down.  So what?lol.  Thats how good he is bro.

Another example is Amir Khan when he was with Roach and even though he looked good against Virgil he began to revert back to his hard hearing self in the algieri fight.Another example is Zab Judah as skilled as they come had ATG skill but never applied himself his mentality was on and off. Cus damato famously said Boxing is  physical and  mental. What are you going to do when you get hit? Will you fold? throw your plans out of the window and swing for the hills?

Ketchel was offered more money if he deviated from the plan with Johnson and after  round of following the script Ketchel he swung a surprise punch that Johnson didnt expect knocking him down.Upon regaining his feet Jack Johnson knocked out Ketchel with a blow full in the mouth.

You develop discipline by keeping these emotions in check when it matters Tactically  following a plan of action or a game plan is imperative in most fields of work and its the same for boxing. At the high end of the sport being able to follow and excecute a crafted gameplan can more often than not be a seperating factor. The excecution of a gameplan or perfecting a particular style requires discipline in itselfTLDR Physically Emotionally and Tactically Boxing is a cultivator of discipline b,Boxing,d0hovwl,3,t5_2qj0l

Whether the fight ends after  round or  depends on how crafty his opponent is and I dont think someone like Dominic Wade has the craft and guile to pose as a mystery to GGG.

He beat Pascal twice in front of his fans in Montreal fought a nothing fight against Mohammedi in Las Vegas and beat Hopkins in AC OK I take that back perhaps the ONLY fighter with homecrowd advantage in AC due to its proximity to Philly. I will admit though its hard to gauge his popularity in Russia based on his success stateside. It would be awesome to see him unify the belts and then defend it in Moscow or something.

He wasnt really looking all that great until the uppercut landed.  He was looking a bit flummoxed and not really knowing how to get in on Ortizs boxing.Ortiz just got caught.  Props to Berto but I dont think Ortiz really got that much taken out of his reputation with this loss.  Id definitely watch a third fight.Theyd need to make that third fight soon though.

He did not grow up in poverty and he was already a pretty huge success in Mexico even before he got to the US so he was making money for a LONG time before he got here.What youre saying though it does indeed apply to many boxers I dont think really applies a great deal in Canelos case.  Money is not the main factor in his having taken the fight with Khan and Canelo shouldnt get an Okay pass for fighting Khan just because hes getting a shit ton of money.  Additionally the winlose balance in this case as I said earlier just doesnt seem very good for Canelo.  I understand if maybe HE HIMSELF didnt realize this but Id say his teampromoterOscar should have known that this wasnt a great fight to have taken and is a big big risk.If Oscars really concerned about protecting his investment then this wasnt a very smart fight to take because THIS one fight can derail all the work hes done if Canelo loses it.,Boxing,d2skvx8,1,t5_2qj0l

I love the video cuz it gives a personality and vague background of the fighters that even the casual feels like heshe knows something about the fighters presented. This video even got my GF at the time into boxing a bit. She even started asking about the fighters and their prospecting matches.   It does an outstanding job in also showing how the fighters carry their country and people in the ring with them. Watching it now gets me feel good rush now that they all kind of matched up enough to see who really was the top dog and now reigning king though hes now getting loads of hate for his weight manipulationsnevermind floyd did that as far as I could remember which was since his fight against Marquez I think.

Because it is small budget compared to most higher tier PPVs they only need k buys to breakeven but they will even struggle to reach that imoTR cant get the exposure for fighters like PBC because they dont have a hedgefund burning money paying networks to put boxing on.

If he does too much with his arm in a way that engages the rotator cuff then it twinges very painfully. That is what Pacquiao will have been experiencing why he needed an injection and why he pulled up in the th when he had Floyd on the ropes.After that it was a case of trying to avoid further twinges.

8344219,0,t1_d5kkknl,sigh Look I certainly agree that some people are hyping Crawford up a bit too much given how early in his career he is.  But I dont think theres a credible boxing analyst who will deny that he is a very intelligent fighter who has the rare gift of being able to adjust to exploit his opponents weaknesses rather than fighting to their strengths.  Whether he can do this as the level of competition goes up is an open question but its ludicrous to deny that hes shown a great deal of promise.  If you disagree then argue your point.

But the least prestigious is probably the WBO.The road to a championship belt and keeping that championship belt facing mandatory challengers is much easier than it used to be.  A lot of it has to do with money and who can attract a bigger audience.  Then you have real champions real talent power skill everything.Theres a lot of bullshit in boxing and you just have the experience watching boxing to see through it.  Guys like Andre Ward ducking your boy Adonis Stevenson and then retiring for  years.  Kovalev calling out Stevenson then couldnt agree on the money.  Stevenson was unable to get the big money names to fight him like Ward and Bernard Hopkins in  when he was at his peak.  Hes fighting bums right now so we cant really say if hes slowed down or not.  But let me tell you this Adonis Superman Stevenson was the real deal  years ago.  I havent seen a light heavyweight fight like that in years.  Great skill great timing incredibly elusive fast quick and superhuman power.The light heavyweight division is really heating up.  Because you got the Kovalev vs Ward fight coming up in November.  And a very hard hitting prospect in Beterbiev with an outstanding pedigree.   is going to be crazy for the  lb division and I hope youll join us.

8364204,0,t1_d5ms90a,Thomas and Mack isnt associated with a casino. They wouldnt be putting up a site fee as theyre just a rental venue. Steve Wynn when he wants to back Arum fights or when Bob was fighting with the MGM will put on fights there but the Wynn is like five Vegas blocks north.If youve been to Vegas you will understand the daunting task of getting people to move one block. Thomas and Mack is just behind the MGM Grand but still it might as well be across town. MGM is pretty much the only spot left that offers site fees for big shows. The D has Knockout night at the D but theyre not in the same league as the MGM Grand because the MGM can draw on the entire players database of all their affiliated casinos. Theyve got the Mandalay Bay the MGM Grand and now the TMobile arena.Cosmopolitan and the Hard Rock will put on cards but I dont think they offer site fees perhaps just flat rates or free ballrooms. And their capacity is only good for small cards. Caesers Palace hasnt done a show since their outdoor Holyfield vs Bowe II vs FanMan days if I recall correctly. Their indoor arena only seats just under  and the Fan Man pretty much killed outdoor shows in Nevada for sports.Its why the Barclays center could never pull Floyd out to Brooklyn. Nevada has a favourable tax rate as well as a site fee that cant be matched because big boxing matches allows them to pull in their whale gamblers. God Floyd asked for a Bugatti from the MGM after the Canelo fight and they gave it to him so that kind of shows the value they see in big fights. Now its shifting to the UFC but boxing still attracts a higher spending crowd.The people behind Madison Square Garden and the Forum in LA are planning a new venue but its supposed to be a concert hall geared towards music. Its tough to go against the MGM Grand group. Theyve got too many casinos attached to the venues.Now its possible that there is something booked but the calendars are clear as of today. Theres usually a lot of lead time for acts when they go to Vegas. You can spin up the MGM group and see bookings into December right now.,Boxing,d5n2s5p,3,t5_2qj0l

8383255,0,t3_4uftod, Too many fighters when fighters like Glen Tapia and Provodnikov joined Wild Card they wanted to be trained by Freddie and officially they were but Freddies assistant Marvin Somodio had to train them and others most the time instead when Freddie focused on Manny and more recently Miguel Cotto last year. Language barrier plus Parkinsons Freddie has his disease managed pretty well but when you factor the timelimit between rounds and his ability to give instructions quickly hes limited to what he can communicate to adjust a gameplan on the fly when he has a fighter that isnt a native speaker of English and you need an interpreter in the corner to help relay that message I think this was especially the case for Provodnikov and Postol. Even if its not a language barrier sadly his disease limits him in giving more instructions between rounds because of how fast he can speak clearly.I agree they also tend to fight better competition too.,Boxing,d5pgeav,5,t5_2qj0l

Once he starts fighting guys his own size or guys with toptier talent his success will be dependant on the  judges just like Mayweather Ward and Hopkins.       Kellerman was talking about this during the fight. These are cerebral fighters and its a staple of the American school of boxing. They rely on waiting walking their opponents to sleep and the crowd for that matter and stealing rounds. I was hoping Crawford would be a more exciting and dynamic talent but even at his young age its apparent hes not. After seeing PostolCrawford I think a motivated Broner kicks his ass easily.

Boxers boxing coaches boxing fans and even boxing commentators sans Max Kellerman are in general really dumb  almost completely devoid of the ability to think rationally in some cases. I guess I shouldnt expect much from a sport based around givingreceiving blows to the head. The smartest boxers usually just have average intelligence in the real world save for a small handful of outliers.  . Slick African American fighters with good movement and defense will be extraoverrated in the wake of the Mayweather era.  . related to  Andre Ward is a very good HOF caliber fighter but hes not an ATG like Mayweather and hed be torched by a prime RJJ.  . related to  Terence Crawford is great but hes not that great  Id pick him to beat Pacquiao but Id be going with my heart and not my brain especially after seeing how Pac dispatched Bradley in their rd matchup.  . Eastern bloc fighters and Russians in particular are treated unfairly by parochial Western sensibilities. The same goes for Cubans. Notice something in common? Long amateur careers and late entries into the progame as well as fighting under oppressive Communist or Authoritarian regimes or those not too far removed from that oppression.    . Alexander Povetkin is PP the best heavyweight boxer and clearly the most skilled he just happens to fight in a division where everyone expects height weight and reach to not matter as much. Id love to see him shed all the baby fat and fight at cruiserweight.  . Salidos win over Lomachenko was a complete robbery and Lomachenko is PP top .  . Rigo iswas PP better than Mayweather. Lol.  . Rances Barthelemy is super underrated and creeping up on being a PP top  fighter.. The heavyweight division was not weak during the reign of the Klitschkos they just made it look weak.    . In general the fighters of previous generations are overrated in comparison to the fighters of today. Bigger global population  bigger talent pool  more talented fighters overall. When I watch video of Joe Louis I see someone lacking the athleticism to compete with todays elite fighters. Hed get KTFO by basically everyone.  . Chocolatito is definitely overrated.

8598304,0,t3_4xkgux,Depends who I am talking to. I was able to get one of my best friends into boxing slowly by showing him how it is a martial art like any other martial art. Hes a martial arts instructor so I explained to him boxing requires discipline strength fortitude and respect. Respect for the sport for your coach and especially for your opponent. I showed my friend how boxers respectfully touch gloves before they fight how if one commits a foul during a fight they often touch gloves as to say even though youve been punching me for the last  minutes nothing personal. I show how its expected that after the match is over the boxers often hug or touch gloves again and go to their opponents corner to shake hands with their opponents coach. After the match there is no longer any bad blood between the fighters and they congratulate each other. These displays of respect are expected in all of the traditional martial arts. Finally while boxing is violent viewers should understand it is just a sport that the fighters chose to participate in. ,Boxing,d6gdp94,2,t5_2qj0l

8921089,0,t3_52gfk1,You can absolutely lose your eye and its not just a minimal chance either it is a very real possibility.There is also a cavity near your orbital bones. Depending on how the eye socket broke zygomatic or frontal the cavity might become compromised meaning you can be exhaling air into it as it is no longer separated from your sinus. If this happens breathing through your nose is now problematic as the breach in your maxillary sinus will cause each breath to potentially blow air near the eye. As you know in boxing breathing through your mouth is incredibly dangerous.Furthermore an orbital fracture depending on the way it goes can compromise eyesight immediately. It can do it by damaging the optic nerve causing double or blurry vision which as you can imagine is a pretty big problem in boxing. It can also pinch or trap your optical muscles compromising the mobility of your eye thereby reducing your field of vision. Your eye ball could also be displaced due to the orbital break either sunken in or bulging out.So yeah if its a serious orbital fracture it is a very big problem and I think the corner throwing the towel made the proper decision. Personally if I was in the corner I would have very strongly suggested getting out of the bout after the first round. An orbital fracture could very well be a career ender and it shows how much of a god damn warrior Brooks was that he went out there with his eyeball hanging out against the biggest hitter in the division.,Boxing,d7k6n76,12,t5_2qj0l

Some people like Youtuber Dontaesboxing nation claimed that GGG was exposed by Willie Monroe Jr. because he landed a few shots on GGG.But as weve seen time and time again now GGG is perfectly willing to open himself up to punches after hes determined the power isnt there to threaten him and he knows he can exploit whatever openings are presented.Hes done that in many many of his fights now.

This was a street fight that drew Brook into fighting toe to toe and led to his orbital bone being broken.And yet you still choose to believe that it wasnt intentional and this is despite the fact that hes clearly done this in previous fights. He does this stuff because he can and because right or wrong he thinks the fans appreciate it.

8950911,0,t3_52vn8p,Floyd Mayweather JrHis wins over Pacquiao and Alvarez are better than any other two wins this decade. He beat Marquez in  and thats a great win just before the cutoff point but Id argue the s was a better decade for Ali than the s.Andre Ward and Gennady Golovkin are stirring though. Ward is in a great situation as he became The Man at  when it was stacked and is now in a stacked  division. Golovkin is going to have to do the leg work himself and chase down fights at  but there isnt really anyone there like Kovalev is at .

And I want to say its not about whether or not Im willing to support this sport which I too love.  But it is about supporting boxing.  Where it seems you and I differ is in our belief in how to support boxing can I assume you believe that any monetary support of a card or match is in support of the sport?  I feel to pay for bouts PPV especially is in conflict with the longevity of the sport when there is an entire card of clear mismatches.  Were monetarily telling promoters managers and fighters that we dont care if they walk away with a lessthan compelling victory over someone wholly out of their league so long as they are fighting.  Thats not a statement I want to make or support.  Contrarily younger fighters do need their comeuppance and the opportunity to fight more challenging rivals to both test their mettle and to gain the experience necessary to fight on the world stage.  This is where journeymen and non PPV fights have their place.  Yea yea they all had the boxers chance and upsets happen but lets not delude ourselves too much about these fights.  Surely upsets happen but I think well will continue to see fewer and fewer on the PPV stage because of people like you supporting blatant mismatches with their wallet such as Saturdays bouts.  You say you can afford to pay for the match and will continue to support these fights in the name of boxing.  Ill agree your money will assist in providing longevity and continuance of boxing but you should be ashamed of claiming your money is spent for a love of sport.,Boxing,d7tf4w2,3,t5_2qj0l

Brook has shown pretty good skills in fights against Porter and GGG and experience against guys like that can make a bit of a difference assuming GGG didnt ruin him. Weve seen it so many times fighters who show elite immaculate skills at the lowerlevel but arent able to put it together as well on the top level. Which is natural considering you are fighting someone who is evenly matched with you.

Just like how some sports like basketball for example they watch replays to make the right call. Why not do it with boxing? Its a good idea to get more people to do compubox but it would be an even better idea if they at least showed a real time punch count on TV so we can know exactly what they are counting and scoring yeh? Otherwise they can always manipulate compubox and it can sway peoples mind. Not saying boxing is always corrupt like that but I wouldnt be surprised. Ex of compubox making a mistake That is easily fix by simply rewatching and the compubox guys can get a more accurate count. While the fight is going on they can have different people rescore the previous rounds? So when the fight is over they can be able to show the results quicker? Just my thoughts. Either way compubox is too old and out of date. They need to improve it.,Boxing,dak16q3,2,t5_2qj0l

And Max has a history of making a call during a fight and then after facing criticism coming back and changing his tune.And Compubox stats have to be kept in perspective. This isnt the amateurs from the failed points era landed shots have to be paired with effectiveness. If the judges dont feel they were effective then they arent going to score them over a lower output fighter.

10173250,0,t3_5liq4s,I think its selective memory that makes modern fights seem higher quality to some people. We forget the boringlow quality fights of today. Also the style really hasnt changed that much in terms of what works.  The modern style is just more homogenized more textbook  back in the day the textbooks werent really established as they are today.If you watch Fury Klitschko Tyson has a very old school style.  He drops his hands a lot for example. And it worked!  I dont think the technique is better today than it was  years ago.  But there simply are more big heavyweights.  But then again Primo Carnera weighed ! He would have had  pounds on Fury and Klitschko!  And guys like Tyson and Holyfield won the heavyweight title weighing right around .I think we forget the boring fights of today while there wasnt that much film back in the day so even a slow paced heavyweight championship is still a part of history.  But look at a fight like Valuev  Holyfield from a  years ago that fight was slower paced than possibly any old heavyweight title fight youll find on film.I do think the fighters you mentioned like Dempsey and Lewis might have been too small to dominate in todays heavyweight division but guys like Carnera and Max Baer would beat the shit out of a guy like Wilder. Would they beat Fury? I would say not but I think Furys performance against Klitschko was ATG status  he was fighting like Ali that night!,Boxing,dbx6ztd,3,t5_2qj0l

10233868,1,t1_dc40ofi,The weight difference isnt so large that the fight wasnt put in front of both parties. Pacquiao talked about going down to  just a couple years ago after Algieri and I think he also mentioned it even more recently but I cant find the source. There also isnt anything stopping Crawford from fighting at a different weight. Theyre also close enough in weight that a catchweight where they both might be more comfortable would be feasible because there is only one weight class of difference.The weight is honestly irrelevant to my point anyway. They specifically stated it was a monetary issue. Pac wants a shitload of money so hes not going to fight someone who thinks theyre good enough to deserve anything when they step in the ring with him. Pacquiao is avoiding Crawford but its because Pac is looking for a big pay day from a middling fighter who would actually take such a ridiculous offer.Youre right Pacquiao has nothing left to prove and his team is conducting business accordingly.,Boxing,dc42e79,2,t5_2qj0l

Hasnt even fought at all in years and was willing to leave Bob out to dry by allowing his contract to expire.

Garcia is a really good fighter if anybody else fought Garcia Id go with Mikey.....not Lomanchenko dude has the best mental processing Ive ever seen next to Alis witEdit Arum should make Ax Man go up in weight to fight Mikey. That would be a great fight both fighters come forward can box and have good power. If Mikey can get through Ax man easily then the Loma fight should be made.
