137334,0,t1_cesr2p3,Great post but I would add one big thing Porcello is only  this year. He hasnt even hit his prime yet in all likelihood and he can still improve dramatically just from having another year of working out as a pro athlete and being exposed to big league instruction. Also in  years as a starter his highest innings pitched is . You dont see  year old pitchers with  years starting experience low miles on the arm and an ERA that has improved slightly for  straight seasons available in free agency but if you did I am certain you would be looking at a multi year deal worth over  mil a year. Also while the . ERA isnt spectacular a third of the league had a higher average staff ERA. . is high for the Tigers we are spoiled with the best staff in the bigs but its pretty much middle of the pack for the league. If he continues to improve at the rate he has steadily done and gets a boost from the better defense he could easily be in the mid to high s in ERA this year. I like the deal just wish we had more years on it.,motorcitykitties,ceu2m7p,2,t5_2s5m5

The odd man out seems like DK or Worth. They might surprise us and drop Corey Knebel who seems to be up merely for BP depth.

1638223,0,t1_cjlnak8,My main problem with the role of the closer or the closer mentality is that not all save situations are high leverage. A tie game in the th inning with the bases loaded and no outs is just as difficult a jam to get out of as a two run lead in the bottom of the th. But only the latter is a save situation where a closer would be brought in. My point about demoting Nathan to lower pressure roles was about allowing him to pitch in situations where he cant lose the game by giving up one or two runs. I failed to elucidate that I believe he has severe problems with his mechanics and cannot throw strikes. Like Coke giving him the opportunity to work out his problems rather than throwing him in for every save situation would be a much smarter approach.I think that you give too much credence to the save stat. Why not look at ground ball rate strikeout rate walk rate and recent performance to decide what pitcher should be put in the game? Just because Nathan has a few saves doesnt mean he actually pitched well. ,motorcitykitties,cjlnv5o,9,t5_2s5m5

He has a good eye at the plate which is hard to tell by his high strikeout rate but this year he took a lot of walks and worked the count a ton. Also his defense is unmatched hes one of the best defensive CFs in the league. His bat can obviously use some work but if he figures it out he can be a very solid player in the near future.

2861425,0,t1_cnt989c,You know Price would ask for near the same amount as Scherzer? So you basically are saying sign Scherzer and Shields. Thatd mean youd have Miggy at  mil JV at  mil Price is going to get VERY close to ScherzerLester so over  mil for sure and then Shields at  mil.  million in  guys. Not to mention Sanchez and Martinez are at  mil. Almost  million in  players. That is a recipe for disaster. The Tigers have never been over the luxury tax and have never shown signs theyre willing to do that. Maybe for  year sure but not consistently like Yanks or Dodgers. That means wed need  mil in the rest of the roster  guys? Not happening. Im fine with extending Price OR signing Shields  not both. Next years FA market is loaded. I dont want James Shields at  years old. I want any of the guys next year that include but are not limited to Jordan Zimmerman Johnny Cueto Doug Fister Hisashi Iwakuma Mat Latos Mike Leake Jeff Samardzija Rick Porcello etc. Why Shields and Price now when we can maybe one maybe neither and go into next offseason with deep pockets filled with cash. ,motorcitykitties,cntcg8u,2,t5_2s5m5

Best case I could see something like the Blue Jays last year where their starting pitching was shoddy had an explosive offense but was completely renewed by the Price trade and lit up the MLB.As long as Norris  Fulmer stay out of the talks Im  down to go for someone like Shields Rich Hill Sonny Gray.. any other names people can think of? Im guessing Shields trade stock would be relatively lower than the others since his contract is m per year until  at the earliest. In general Rich Hills stock is going to be really fascinating to me.. with questions of whether his sudden dominance is sustainable and his cheap contract I honestly have no clue what kind of asking price hell fetch and Im quite intrigued to see how that plays out.,motorcitykitties,d3lryfb,4,t5_2s5m5

8435655,0,t3_4v6yni,No way Beane parts with Burns at this point considering that A hes having a poor year so his value is low and B isnt a free agent until  so thats out.  And Vogt wouldnt really be an upgrade as hes more a replacement for Saltalamacchia both veteran catchers who hit righties well than he is for McCann who hits lefties better than either Vogt or Salty.  Vogt vs L  wrc vs R  wrcSalty vs L  wrc vs R  wrcMcCann vs L  wrc vs R  wrcSo I dont really see how this trade makes sense for either party,motorcitykitties,d5vzvso,11,t5_2s5m5
8436389,0,t3_4v6yni,In case people wanted current rankings as opposed to RoS based on fangraphsLF thCF thRF thB thSS thB thB thC thSP thRP thOF is mainly because JUp as sucked JD is hurt and people like Aviles have been playing right. Catcher is not as low as youd think because of defense. If we went by catcher offense Tigers are th. IMO Vogt is not the answer though. Terrible framer and while he can hit righties so can Salty. There is no point trading for a catcher imo. Lucroy would be nice but I think McCann has improved quite a bit. Among full time catchers hes nearly average whereas last year he was dead last. I think our catching problem would be solved if we went with a stronger platoon. Ik that means more Salty than McCann but if were going for a playoff spot you gotta do whats best and whats best is getting McCann away from right handed pitchers. ,motorcitykitties,d5w36n4,3,t5_2s5m5

10596050,0,t3_5rnnws,Its nice having a crafty southpaw to be able to throw in to mix things up.  The way I see this year going the only sure thing is Verlander at the  spot.  Starters  could be any combination of Norris Fullmer and Zimmermann.  That string of differing styles could allow for a very interesting combination of having a power pitcher starting off a series Fullmer Verlander and having an underyourskin passive pitcher Norris Zimmermann ending it. This rotation could force the batters on the other side to adjust to a new tempo each game.  And when it comes to pitching confusion is a huge asset.  This staff has the type of moxie to propel a team to a competitive regular season and maybe a return to our divisional dominance.  Of course as always the big question mark is health.  Having the old guys like Miggy and Victor at the heart of a lineup all but guarantees your offense is gonna be without one of both of them for a good chunk of games this season.  Itll be time for the young guns to pick up the bats  and it will definitely be on Ausmus to put out a lineup that fits the skill set of the players.  Im interested to see how this plays out. All in all the results could be there this year.  The Cats are definitely hungry after what happened to the end of  and I think the veterans will respond in a big way.  Couple this mentality with an emerging Castellanos JD in a contract year and a strong leader behind the plate in McCann and I think youre looking at the core of a scrappy confident team looking to go deep in the playoffs.Im optimistic about  but I always am when it comes to baseball in the D.

11735083,0,t1_dgpubo7,Yes.  Badly.  And I wonder if Justin Upton could be a good influence on Martin having gone through similar issues with the mental side of slumps last year.  I would love it if we picked him up though.  Even if the bat never comes fully back around its been quite a while since weve had an elite defender out in center and with the size of our ballpark I think that really hurts our run prevention capabilities.,motorcitykitties,dgq79e1,2,t5_2s5m5
