1756772,0,t3_2drj87,I am really shocked that your doc is recommended the interstim so early on. There are tons of other medications to try instillations stress reduction pelvic floor physical therapy etc. The IC Network webapage is awesome and can go into other detail about some of the option that the other ladies mentioned here in their posts. Your doctor seems clueless. I saw that you are in PA I would also recommend that you check out Dr. Kristene Whitmore in Philadelphia.,Interstitialcystitis,ck0lk77,2,t5_2s35s

4867381,0,t1_cu3eanf,My IC was definitely worse during pregnancy.  Though once I was out of the first trimester and into the second and third trimesters I continued my nerve block treatments to help some of the symptoms.  However after I have my child via CSection...I was in remission for almost a full year of bliss...right around ish months or so.,Interstitialcystitis,cu82jod,1,t5_2s35s

7247948,0,t3_4en7ea,Ive had a few doctors tell me that IC makes you more susceptible to actual UTIs. I have no idea if thats true but in my experience it has been. I stopped having actual UTIs about  years ago because I started taking my hygiene more seriously. There are a lot of things that used to irritate me and give me UTIs even something as simple as daring to wear the same pair of underwear for gasp two days. I change them daily now sometimes twice a day. I actually wash my hands before and after going to the bathroom because Im hyperaware of any bacteria getting near my urethra and I dont want to wipe if I have dirty hands. I dont let my boyfriend touch me unless hes just recently washed his hands as well. Things like that actually took all of my real bladder infections away. Im not accusing you of being unhygienic in the least but in my experience a person with IC has to be extra clean moreso than the average person. I would suggest starting that right away. Also youve gotta stop taking the cranberry pills. Cranberry is great for bladder infections but they are terrible for IC. I used to take cranberry pills too and I was left wondering why I was still in so much pain!  I can tell the difference between an IC flare and a bladder infection. It takes some practice. For me an IC flare is almost solely felt in my urethra whereas a bladder infection is felt in my urethra and bladder at the same time. Bladder infections also cause the WORST sense of urgency whereas my IC flares do not. The next time you get an IC flare I would recommend making a column in a notebook labeled Flare and writing down all your symptoms. Then the next time you get a bladder infection make a column in the same notebook labeled Infection and write down all your symptoms. Some will overlap but hopefully you will notice some differences. By doing this youll hopefully be able to avoid more kidney infections in the future because youll know when to see the doctor.My motto is better to be safe than sorry. If Im having an especially bad flare I will see the doctor just to make sure it isnt a UTI. Always.Also I agree with the first commenter. AZO is amaaazing.Hope you get feeling better soon OP. ,Interstitialcystitis,d221gnl,4,t5_2s35s
7287415,0,t1_d24n5n2,No Im English. I will definitely have a look at that. Im prescribed amytriptyline and gabapentin daily and then morphine for a strong flare but I dont tend to find that helps. Thank you ,Interstitialcystitis,d26j3hb,1,t5_2s35s
7326003,0,t3_3si7xn,Hi I hope your account is still active. Ive had pelvic pain since  when I was  but was not diagnosed as having IC until . So Ive been battling this for quite a while now and yet to find something that really helps.  Im gonna try your pilates idea.  I saw below that you wrote that you only attended two pilates classes the rest you just did on your own.  How many times in an average week did you perform the exercises? And how long did a session take?,Interstitialcystitis,d2awzxo,1,t5_2s35s

8007348,0,t3_4ovv44,Hi! I have had an interstim for almost  years now. The trial was only five days for me though my aunt had a week long trial so it varies. I absolutely love this thing. It gave me back my life. I had such an issue with frequency that I never wanted to leave my house. The results were instant. I will say that my aunt had two trials ten years apart before getting hers and she has had a lot of problems. I cant help thinking that it is because her doctor sucks she was diagnosed over ten years ago and was never told about dietary changes and other basic stuff. Ask a lot of questions and get to know your medtronic person. My medtronic rep was in the room and held my hand during the placement of the trial and was there during the surgery. I have his cell phone number and even though he isnt my rep he was promoted anymore he always answers when I call. Let me know if you have any questions and go into this knowing that it isnt for everyone but it is the best thing that ever happened to me.,Interstitialcystitis,d4g3nt4,5,t5_2s35s

8493716,0,t1_d638d0f,To be honest I cant imagine the kind of lifestyle one would have to lead to blow  on a single doctors office visit. And I do appreciate the time and attention the institute appears to devote to each patient but I just find that an absolutely unconscionable amount of money to charge for such care. His description from his website sounds exactly like my urologist  hours on the first appointment focus on patient education as gentle an exam as possible multimodal therapy but my doctor costs me my  copay and thats it. Especially with chronic pain theres a lot to consider that kind of treatment should be the bare minimum not a luxury you have to spend thousands on! Rant over sorry Im just so frustrated on your behalf. Unreal. What a world.I noticed that this institute is in Pennsylvania you might as well take your  book a nice vacation in New York and go see Robert Moldwin while youre there! I mean good grief.,Interstitialcystitis,d639iqg,1,t5_2s35s
8678625,0,t1_d6qbd9t,gtThey also did some procedure that involved me sitting on a strange chair over a bucket with a lot of tubes in me. Urodynamics I think. Its just diagnostic. And I hear ecigs have some funky stuff in them. ,Interstitialcystitis,d6qg9yi,1,t5_2s35s
8839238,0,t1_d7ac7nb,I know that they said that they noticed the higher white blood cells. I assume it mustve been an infection just because they continued to give me antibiotics. The antibiotics work. But the UTIs come back randomly. What are some other ways I could ask them to test to be sure its an infection other than just looking at white blood cells?,Interstitialcystitis,d7acnjp,1,t5_2s35s
9471398,0,t1_d9gc8bx,I would definitely recommend giving it and other LRAs a try as side effects are rare I had none at moderate doses. Whilst it didnt work for me it may work for you.,Interstitialcystitis,d9gjzjk,1,t5_2s35s
9524152,0,t1_d9n1tnn,Yes! Its...good. It helps a little but not all the time. I have learned through trial and error not to put it anywhere near my urethra because that makes the pain worse.Some docs do lidocaine injections in trigger points to shut down briefly the pain signals but I havent had much success with it.ETA those lidocaine patches they sell at pharmacies are the bomb. I put them below my belly button when my bladderdigestive system feels sore and they work well.,Interstitialcystitis,d9n1xnc,1,t5_2s35s

10435693,0,t3_5pevf8,Okay I AM a pro when it comes to urgency. gtThe problem was bananas and rice tend to flare up the IC anywayRice should never flare you... but bannanas can flare you because potassium is harsh on IC bladders. Did you ever eat JUST rice and not bananas or chicken? Like literally nothing but white rice with no enrichment which is something youd have to pick up from an organic foods store since most rice is enriched. ..the enrichment would probably not flare you but my elimination diet was nuclear. I ate nothing but white rice and drank nothing but water for a week. It sucked horribly but from there I could slowly add things back. Chicken should be safe.. but do you read the ingredients? A lot of times they put preservatives. Neutral greens like spinach also shouldnt be flaring you.. but its possible you are intolerant? White potatoes make me burn while most everyone else finds them soothing... but you really shouldnt be intolerant to all those foods that you mentioned. Second.. I would focus on the water that you are drinking. What is the PH? I flared for half a year and it didnt matter what I ate thanks to most bottled waters being acidic. Turned out that my tap water was way safer. Urgency is usually tied to pelvic floor issues. Sadly most pelvic floor therapists dont take medicaid but if you are through a normal insurer you might be able to be covered. I had a pain level of  every night but pelvic floor therapy got me to  after I could go no further with diet modification. Other helpful things for urgency was vaginal Valium suppositories heating pads and packs of Hot Hands that rode in my panties. ,Interstitialcystitis,dcqyes5,2,t5_2s35s
10672492,0,t3_5smtff,I find the cereal coffees an ok substitute granted its not the same but I get such bad pain from the real deal I found it quite easy to give up. I add some flavour syrup and that helps the flavour.  Black tea is ok in extreme moderation  ie a cup every three days or so and living in England thats harder  I used to guzzle mugs all day! Green tea and rooibos are both fine for me. Its a weird disease. At least chocolate doesnt flare me so thats a small mercy,Interstitialcystitis,ddgsbwo,3,t5_2s35s

10975035,0,t3_5wmpai,I work at a university where a fair few of my students have had medical disabilities. Have you contacted your disability accommodations department?  Usually those people can help you with things like extended deadlines for assignments rescheduled exams note taking if you need to miss class things like that. It can be a big help if you just need a day or two to rest and recuperate a bit before you can tackle your work. Every university system tends to have their own policy about withdrawal limits.  But the disability folks would probably also have resources about medical exemptions and how to handle student court. You might even be able to get a student volunteer or advocate to help you prepare. ,Interstitialcystitis,dec0ur1,2,t5_2s35s
