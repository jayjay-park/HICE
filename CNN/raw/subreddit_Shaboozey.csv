2839744,0,t3_2sktdp,I was interested to see if the game have better or worse parkour than Mirrors Edge bad parkour could really sink the game. As far as I can see it doesnt look as fluid and quick but not by much and that may just depend on the player and the players experience with the system.  So it looks good enough at least and the general game look decent as well. And a big plus that the melee weapons actually react when hitting something instead of making a sound a mysteriously passing through the object being hit.,Shaboozey,cnqvinu,2,t5_2tvx7
