863330,0,t1_ch1k4p0,Well if it were me Id use a hollow concrete structure made of flyashmodified portland cement thus imparting seawater resistance to it resists sulfate corrosion and either stainlesssteel rebar or else basalt rebar which last forever.Float it into place flood internal compartments to right itself set it up with support wires and there you go. Its secured to the bottom yes.For pricing a structure like this you can figure high end concrete around   cu.yard but the flyash can replace up to  of that so you can cut cost by  since flyash is so cheap its basically free.,seasteading,ch2ezl8,3,t5_2qzwp

5128426,0,t1_cv44ygs,I think its the fear of static generally. I mean lightning? Probably not a problem that high up. A random meter hit and youre on fire? Maybe. Dunno.
