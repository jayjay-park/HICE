First they probably trained extensively with long blades.  Second their weapon is basically a lightsaber so having the maximum kill area is good.  Third the light mass of their weapon paired with the strength augmentation of their armor means they could probably point with their sword out in one hand and not get tired.Kaladin was functionally fighting his equivalent.  Yeah Szeth didnt have as much efficiency but both had shardblades.  A tag might not win as they could heal from small matrix wounds but it would probably lead to a follow up death strike.Kaladin needed the surprise of a constantly shifting weapon to beat Szeth or at least convince him that he wasnt using an honorblade and get Szeth to not defend.,Stormlight_Archive,cgs80kg,1,t5_2sq9v

857281,0,t1_ch1hzo6,My interpretation is that the use of the Julia set as the basis for the shape of the main continent of Roshar is representative of its chaotic nature.  If you look at the wiki article linked by our bot friend youll see that the Fatou set is complementary to the Julia set meaning that the union of the two sets is the whole.  The Fatou set is the opposite of the Julia set it is comprised of nonchatoic values where the defining function is wellbehaved.Looking at the map of Shadesmar we see that Shadesmar and Roshar are complementary to each other.  The overlay of the two landmasses is a complete set.  So does Shadesmar the Cognitive Realm have an ordered wellbehaved nature?  Im not sure we have enough to go on to make that assumption but we do know that the Spren have rules.  A Daughter disobeys...  There are things they cant do based on their nature.

1847873,0,t1_ckbs1ia,Yeah thats always the question. Near as I can tell no two paths are quite the same. Perseverance helps. Being good with people helps a lot. Being good at the job itself is kinda vital too.My bits of semiuniversal advice are as follows Be sure that you love doing it more than being it. You will spend more time doing the job than enjoying the benefits. Learn smallbusiness management basics especially how to handle taxes and expenses as an independent contractor. Diversify as much as possible I am primarily contracted to be an animator an illustrator or a storyboard artist depending on the client. The more roles you can fill competently! the more options you have. Dont fuck up. When you agree to do the job do the job. The further you go and the better the clients you get the more your reputation as an effective trustworthy person will matter. People often think that getting into The Big Leagues is about who youre friends with whos your daddy whos dick youve sucked. But for the most part its about who trusts you enough to risk their own job or reputation to hire you. The more people who can say youre reliable the more and better jobs that will be within your reach. Good luck!,Stormlight_Archive,ckbv4bk,8,t5_2sq9v

Sure he gave up to hatred but the guilt hell be feeling towards losing control in such way will most likely propel him into an amazing growth arc.I think Adolin loves his family too much to succumb to Odiums influence. It would be outside of character to have him go from very good to completely evil not to forget it would require him to fight against Dalinar. For me the most plausible story arc for Adolin involves him falling down from grace losing his way but ultimately standing up for his loved ones at some trouble start brewing in Radian land.

2975794,0,t3_2u7wwr,Speaking as someone heavily invested in Stormlight being as popular as possible... Im not expecting it. Becoming a popculture phenomenon in the vein of GoT or Harry Potter pretty much requires adaptation to film or television and Stormlight is one seriously expensive proposition. It might one day be animated which would make me very happy but even then its only likely to be as popular as say ATLA... animation itself has a hard time being very mainstream actionfantasy animation even more so.Unless the nature of greenscreen and VFX changes significantly I dont ever see it being adapted live not without serious cuts and would any of you really be happy with a halfassed rendition of Roshar? Id be ecstatic if it became a hugely popular animated series but its a big jump from there to reaching the point where every grandma knows the brand name.Steelheart on the other hand is perfectly poised for film adaptation. And now is the perfect time to introduce a teen dystopian superhero series. So as much as I love the Archive and I have no investment at all in the Reckoners aside from an interest in Brandon being Rowlingrich Id count on that series being the first of Brandons books to  actually be adapted for film.,Stormlight_Archive,co6d3nt,9,t5_2sq9v

4378582,0,t1_cs5tj40,No offence I feel that your objection to Kaladin with Shallan seems to be really personal i.e. you seem to actively hate the possibility and hate the time they spent together. Of course youre not going to understand why other people like the idea when you yourself are so firmly against it. You just have to accept that other people view relationships in a different way to yourself for example some people like the banterbickering in the chasms which you thought were contrived and forced. Its just a subjective thing if youre unwilling to accept it then youll just have to accept that youll never understand it and move on. I will say that you seem to dismiss the idea of them both being broken and being able to understand each other a bit too easily. Long term relationships do call for a deep understanding of your partner so it would at least help with that. Common goals are important too of course. But these can be developed over time and for now they do have much in common in that they both need to explore their new role and meaning as new Radiants. ,Stormlight_Archive,csj79q0,1,t5_2sq9v

Theyve got their most determined Herald all alone so it took him longer to break than the whole group normally did. The weaker Heralds couldnt hold up as long.The speculation is that the desolation actually happened when the first of the heralds broke.  Hence the reason for fairly quick desolations in ancient history not everyone is as mentally strong.  Taln may or may not have known that he was the only one but he had an incredible strength of will and survived  years of torture before breaking.

6675801,0,t3_472co2,You shouldnt feel bad for approving of Adolins actions after all many of us would have done the exact same things given the same circumstances. This being said I do fear for Adolins fate but I do not fear he will fall onto the dark side. Adolin loves his family too much he cares too much about peoplethings to truly let go of his love in order to pursue only anger would practically require a brain surgery. Besides Adolins actions are less dark than Jasnah... Jasnah singlehandily pursued thieves with the selfacknowledge goal to kill them just so she could teach a lesson and yet she gets to be a Radiant. On the other hand Adolin stumbled on Sadeas by pure happenstance while he was emotionallyphysically weakened and disturbed he was provoked until he resolved himself to kill the man as he completely lost control of himself. These werent the actions of an agent of evil in becoming but those of an emotionally unstable physically injured and probably exhausted young man struggling to cope as the world is shifting around him. This cant be the end for Adolin as a character but the beginning. Just as we got confirmation as to how much of a good boy Adolin actually is we see his facade the one we have seen glimpses of him trying to maintain slip down and reveal the young whos been hiding inside it. One who is so afraid something bad will happen to those he loves he is willing to sacrifice everything for them. Of course hell have to deal with his actions on top of having to deal with knowing everyone he knows is a Radiant knowing everyone is worthy but him figuring his best efforts just amount to nothing in the end as all that mattered was an old dusty book.... Well this is not exactly true but being Dalinars son this may be how Adolin will see it.In any advent I say he is by far the most interesting character going into book .

6697036,0,t1_d0brayz,this is from the TOR.com readthrough Derethil was a great king an explorer who built a ship to explore the westward sea. No one had ever explored that far due to the peril of facing highstorms on the open ocean but he commissioned a vessel he was sure could manage it. As Hoid plays and speaks Kaladin begins to see or imagine the smoke twisting into images to accompany the story. Derethil sought the origin of the voidbringers and rode the stormwinds west nearly crashing on a distant island. There they were taken in by the Uvara a people who always seemed to agree but punished any breach in failure of behavior among their people with death. Whenever they carried out one of these grisly executions they would say that their emperor will not suffer failure.Kaladin sees a tower rising in the smoke just before Hoid explains that the emperor lived in a great tower. Derethil and his men ventured into it but came out carrying a desiccated corpse. The emperor of the Uvara had been dead for years. The Uvara collapsed into terrible chaos and Derethil fled with their local guide and caretaker fleeing with them. When asked the reason for the terrible riots the guide Nafti replied Do you not see Traveling One? If the emperor is dead and has been all these years then the murders we committed are not his responsibility. They are our own.,Stormlight_Archive,d0c153n,6,t5_2sq9v

Theres actually quite bit of WoB on it but since investiture is actually the spark of creation it really comes from Adonalsium not any of the Shards. They can make some adjustments but theyre all still bound by rules. You say Odium wouldnt let others use it I dont think he gets a choice. Theyre powerful but they arent omnipotent... hes bound by the Oathpact for one and weve seen that all Shards are bound by rules of their Shards. In fact picking up a Shard is more a prison than the reverse Mistborns Sazed has far more limits in his decision making now that he has become Harmony. Edit As for your point about Storms and Stormfather I want to revise what I said. I think the Storms always existed and possibly always invested. I think Honor may have adjusted the storms when he arrived. Perhaps made them more regular maybe adding the weeping as well. It seems like coming to a storm battered world and realizing you cant remove the storms theres no reason to not make em a bit more organized or easier for living. The Stormfather says hes a Spren of Honor so its unlikely he existed before Honor got there. Other spren yes but probably far more simple ones like flamespren painspren etc. The types the more sentient Spren seem to look down upon.,Stormlight_Archive,d0i7h5d,3,t5_2sq9v

Adolin was a plot device for both of them.  a connecting factor between them.  a peer  rival for kaladin while also being everything Kaladin hated.

He isnt adventurous nor an explorer he prefers stability to change. He may be resolute but not headstrong stubborn resolute and he certainly doesnt strike to me as a builder. While I agree the chances of seeing more than one Blade being revived is very small I certainly think the fact some of them have been given mighty name carried on for centuries certainly diminishes the chances of them ever being revived even if they fell into the right hands.Now why did Adolin get this specific Blade is another question...

I was just reading your Dumbledorepost and I found it to be an interesting and positive read What I love about you and your books in regards to the LGBTQtheme is that you never make a big fuzz out of it. You take great care to include gay characters and you strive to make them great characters. I love Ranette! She is so sweet!I feel personally that movies tvseries and books need more LGBTQ characters like yours. You make them be people first. I am tired of watchingreading through a hundred different versions of the coming out process which is almost always portrayed as something huge and scary and life changing. It is so refreshing to see Ranette obviously being gay and see that none of the characters make a big deal out of it.Of course I know a lot of people have real struggles with being gay and so on... But those kinds of stories are told repeatedly and with high quality in a lot of other places.Therefore I want to commend you Brandon! As a proud gay man in my twenties I feel it is my obligation to tell you that the work you do is being appreciated greatly. I keep telling people that being gay is less than  of who you are as a person. Thank you for seeing that!,Stormlight_Archive,d5xq9bn,7,t5_2sq9v

Conversely if they come back with a great script it would be proof that it can work.Basically we cant know until someone takes a stab at it either way.

First of all you might want to read this scene Its not officialcanonical and its hard to say if it will ever appear in a Stormlight book. But it gives you an idea of some of what Brandon wasis thinking with Jasnah.So a few points... First I dont think she can just teleport back and forth with a snap of the fingers. In fact this is the first time she has ever Transported herself fully like this. It also seems to suggest that she is unable to hop right back for some reason. Not enough Stormlight left? I dunno but it seems she needs some alternate means to return. i.e. Honors PerpendicularityIn any case I think Jasnah felt that she had a special opportunity which was even more important than reading the Shattered Plains. Remember that she left Kharbranth not entirely satisfied with her findings. The plan to search the Shattered Plains for more clues was a Im wasting my time here might as well get out there and start looking kind of plan. The epilogue tells us that she went to speak with the Highspren Skybreaker spren whom she apparently learned a lot from. Well have to wait until Oathbringer to see what exactly. gt Also what can dustbringers do?The Prelude mentions something about scorch marks. Brandon has said they have the ability to basically tear apart molecules. Presumably they can start fires among other things? We dont fully know.gt Any idea about the  types of magic on Roshar?Source? Cant remember where this is from.  surges  branches of fabrial magic and  voidsurges is probably the best theory I can think of.gt What is voidbinding and old magic? We dont really know. Voidbinding is presumably what the Listeners are doing with the end. Bonding with voidspren? Getting powers like the surges but not?

Stylistic considerations aside The Stormlight Archives take place in a setting where almost everything is unique and unEarthly. Spren are everywhere constantly. Nearly all the plants and animals are alien. Shooting locations would require you to travel worldwide. And thats not even getting into the VFXheavy superpowers. At this time the development of the Cosmere for film or television is entirely in the hands of the current licenseholder with Brandon having some oversight. Theyre gonna do whatever theyre gonna do. I sincerely hope that they opt for a longform animated series but as an animator I have significant bias. I also understand well more than most why that option isnt the only one or even the first one theyd chase. But I still think its the best one. ,Stormlight_Archive,dcgz7ps,18,t5_2sq9v

WoK is kind of like a prequel to WoR as all the characters plots begin to intertwine and they interact a lot more in the second book. As I read WoK I found myself jumping between characters who I wanted to get back to. First it was Kaladin then it was Dalinar then Shallan back to Kaladin and it jumped between Kaladin and Dalinar. IMHO Shallans plot was the most boring out of  as we were tied to a location and really  character interactions as opposed to the variety of the other Plots.

10751147,0,t1_ddon4dx,Kaladin Dalinar Szeth and Eshonai are in the first five. The back five feature Taln who we know close to nothing about Shalash who is the thieving kind and three people who are not warriors Jasnah Lift Renarin.    To me they are noncombatants.  Jasnah does not spend her days learning the spear or the sword. She does not plan battles. So I repeat most of the flashback characters in the back five are noncombatants. Even if they are very dangerous types of noncombatants. They are not there to lead armies or pound ground or fight evil with steel and shardplate.  If you feel like a book about Renarin will feature his military conquests I honestly can do nothing to dissuade you but I do not think so.So if the books feature noncombatants as major characters which is what I think I also think that as a result the back five are going to be less about you know combat and more about something else.  There are various ways to fight evil. or hatred. Not all of them involve military action.,Stormlight_Archive,ddowcpa,4,t5_2sq9v

11294245,0,t1_dfc4k3r,To address the easier bit first you expressly say that Jasnah was wrong to kill the murderers because they had never done anything to her implying she had no right to avenge their previous victims or defend their future ones. Yet Sadeas deserved what he had coming to him because hes killed more people which is only relevant if youre saying its good that Adolin avengeddefended. So which is it?And again... youre literally doing it again. Youre saying this is my moral code and saying its the one universal objective code for all society.Different states have different punishments. Some places give you the death penalty for murder others life in prison. So does that mean morality is geographic? Is it a worse act to kill someone in Texas than Virginia? What about entire other countries? There are places where its immoral for women to walk around with their faces visible there are places where its not immoral for women to be topless. In New York City some orthodox Jews think its immoral for a Jewish woman to let her hair be seen by men outside her family yet they recognize that its fine for gentiles to do it.What society do you even mean? Where you personally live? Your country? Your local region? The entire planet? You speak of courts yet you havent established that morality and legality are the same thing. If I need to cross the street and its am and there are no cars it would be illegal for me to run across the street. Can you say it would be immoral?You ask which would be worse killing one man or killing three. In many places in America at least which is where I live and the only place I can claim to be fairly wellversed youd either be killed or spend the rest of your life in jail for either. Since the punishment is identical the case could be made that the courts you fall back on see them as one and the same. Im not saying I believe it or that I think it could be proven Im just saying youre presenting it as though its a fait accompli as though its a foregone conclusion and I think you have a long way to go before youve proven it that conclusively.As Brandon himself says in that quote and as hes talked on a lot elsewhere especially when people ask about the inclusion of sex in his books yes he has his own moral code but his isnt the only one or the universally right one. He chooses not to drink. Its important to him. Hes said that he believes for him to drink alcohol would be an immoral act yet he acknowledges that other people can do it without being immoral. Like I said as Syl has said all the spren have different ideas of what is moral. Highspren think whatever is legal is moral as youve implied yet Syl flatly states that she doesnt care whats legal just whats right. She finds lies immoral Pattern clearly does not.You have said there is one moral code for our society. There simply is not. Even if there were Roshar is not our society. Vigilantism is illegal in America at least and for good reason. If a group of people were committing murders and the police were deliberately ignoring it in our world Jasnah could write a blog post she could submit an article to papers she could protest in front of the police station. She could make it public and make sure the mayor loses the next election. None of these options are available to her in Kharbranth. It is a different society a far more brutal one where unlike in our society killing someone is sometimes the right and moral thing to do.You dont have to agree. You can hold Jasnah to your own personal moral code and find her failing. Thats perfectly all right. What you cannot do is say that your code is universal or that its societys code that its the one and only right code and no other codes are valid or even exist. And if you try I disagree with you the characters in the books expressly disagree with you and Brandon himself expressly disagrees with you.,Stormlight_Archive,dfc6q3z,1,t5_2sq9v

11494894,0,t3_641riq,uRay and I came up with theory about Autonomy being a driving force behind the recreance. I wont explain it here as he will be making a new thread about it later but Autonomy could be a threat to the spren as well.Plus the spren cant grow and learn without the bonding of humans. It is one of the reasons Pattern mentions that he came over to the physical realm. So even without a threat I believe that the spren will always be wanting to bond and there will always be surgebinders.Edit Fixed some typos.,Stormlight_Archive,dfyy1lm,2,t5_2sq9v

11589943,0,t3_65e8jx,I think people worrying about this are missing the main point. The whole thesis of this book is precisely this moral dilemma is it right to do something apparently wrong if its for the greater good? And everyone defines the italics how they want.Jasnah is directly asking this of Shallan as part of her training.Kaladin is struggling with the question with the added bonus of his dual profession.Dalinar shocks everyone by valuing human lives above a shardblade.Sadeas uses the Alethi culture to justify his actions.Hoid is taking this to a whole other level willing to see Roshar burn for the good of the Cosmere.Moash justifies himself with revenge and Elhokars incompetence.Syl cannot answer this when asked directly by Kaladin and is conflicted by her taking lives as well.Shallans conflict is a bit more metaphoric mainly between truth and lie.Taravangian  do I need to?Nale uses the most absolute solution to the conundrum by blindly trusting in Law.Lift is literally the opposite not caring about laws and moral customs but probably having the purest intentions from all the characters.Szeth uses his peoples rules as the supreme truth while realising that hes committing atrocities. This conflict probably drives him mad more than the killings themselves.The Parshendi make strange choices where some sacrifice is always involved starting the war with the Alethi being strangely defensive in the Shattered Plains taking stormform.So Adolin simply begins to understand the value of upholding a set of moral codes until the decision is too real and the consequences too stark. This will probably challenge Dalinars set of values as well when he finds about this. Its not about the actions themselves but how all this shapes the characters in my opinion.,Stormlight_Archive,dg9q7nl,47,t5_2sq9v
