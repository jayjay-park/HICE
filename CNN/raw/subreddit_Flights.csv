7383064,0,t3_4gctw6,I took a NYCSingapore flight on Singapore Air recently. Having never been to Singapore I approached one of the flight attendants in the galley and asked her for suggestions on where best to eat in Singapore. She told me she would make a list. Half an hour later she approached me back at my seat and I was handed a long list wherein all the other flight attendants had enthusiastically given their suggestions. They were more than helpful and the list was so so helpful.,Flights,d2hekf6,2,t5_2wmh0

Maybe if the flight was a better schedule and the miles put me into AA Platinum but otherwise Id rather have the .Id also consider crediting the AerLingus miles to United and collecting some MileagePlus miles.

11741210,0,t3_66yuvq,Generally the OTAs like Travelocity really Expedia have access to the same published fares as everyone else. If you are looking for a deal opaque fares frm priceline might be avaialble but generally small destinations like EWN will probably have little to no availability. I strongly recommend Google Flights to better search for alternate airports and always check the airline website before booking. If you go to an alternate airport carriers like Spirit and Frontier have special fares only for their members that are only searchable and bookable on their websites. Southwest can only be searched on their website they are not on OTAs or on Google. ,Flights,dgqw9nk,1,t5_2wmh0
