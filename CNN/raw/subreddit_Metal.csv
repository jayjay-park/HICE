117116,0,t1_cerats5,Im not saying that a musician would never sell out purely for love of music I was referring to the ones that do so willingly without any materialistic pressures to do so. The artists that simply look at the opportunity for high gain through pointlessly over zealous merchandising and choose the path that leads to it. The band that comes to mind along these lines most immediately would be Kiss. Sure they made some good rock n roll and for a long time that was enough. But eventually it became less a musical expression and more a franchise industry. Can they still write good music? Yeah I would think so. Are they more focused on selling anything they can slap a label on instead? Yeah that seems to be the current goal. I understand being done with performing as well. They spent decades being musicians and would rather try new things now. Okay understandable but why are all the new things labeled with a big red KISS and wildly overpriced? It just became a cash cow for the group and those that are working with them. Thats the distinction I was trying to get at. I dont know if this cleared it up at all or not but I feel that the distinction is still there between making music and manufacturing a labeled product solely for maximum dividends. I dunno I think it is more of a feeling thing than a quantifiable thing. I could be way off though my meds make my thoughts muddy sometimes.,Metal,cerrn0f,1,t5_2qhud

Go with him its not that its unsafe but a band like Amon Amarth will draw a pretty big crowd so if youre not in the venue youd probably want to be in the pubcafe across the road.I started seeing bands around yo with my old man and it was pretty cool bonding shit as he was into metal also.I cant speak for your local scene but as a young dude I found metalpunkrock showgoers to be pretty good to younger folk.  As long as they werent the oh Im such a badass yo arrogant little fucks.In terms off safety metal shows arent as violent as they look.  Even up front if you end up on your arse someone will help you up.  Fights dont generally happen unless youre being a dick.  Drugs may happen in the venue but I doubt anyone is going to be trying to give your kid something.  Drinking may happen in the venue but again I dont think someone is going to give him a beer.  Hed be better off there than a rap or EDM show I reckon.

Id put it ahead of War Master honestly.Everything afterwards definitely ... although I think the drop from great to good doesnt fullon happen until after For Victory.

Its like when someone calls a band pop punk  its such an oxymoron that any real  fan of traditional metal and its subgenres  will never take it seriously unless thats all you listen to. Metal is more than distorted guitars and blistering solos  its about subject matter.  Can you really be metal if you are professing your love for a deity?

SHIRTS AND MORE SHIRTS!Three D shirts Ketzer shirt Gospel of the Horns shirt and hoodie and Inquisition shirt.Maaaaaaan so of all my girl problems the one girl problem Ive always had is finding girly shirts from bands I like and these last few weeks Ive stumbled upon so many bands I like selling not only girl shirts but also girl shirts in my size! Because usually when I do find a band selling girl shirts theyre usually sold out of small sizes and all that is left is large so I bought a bunch of shirts these last few weeks. The orders are still trickling in so no pictures.I also ordered some patches and small little things like that with my shirt orders.MUSICFor actual music purchases I ordered Ketzers Satans Boundaries Unchained and Endzeit Metropolis on vinyl. I also picked up Inquisitions Obscure Verses for the Multiverse after totally forgetting they even had something new coming out.Im debating if I want to buy Jupiters new singles because I do like my dumb frilly power metal but the singles are coming out in two types and if you want all the songs you have to buy both. I hate that chart padding gimmick Japanese bands do and Im not that into frilly power metal right now anyway.Also not metal but I bought some rare signed photosets from aa old broken up gawff band from the s.

604501,0,t3_2124py,Im only  but Ive been into metal for about  years.Its funny because Ive been thinking about the progression I made in the metal subculture lately especially as I watch my wife go through pretty much the exact same progression I did.I started with the numetal shit of my youth.  Limp Bizkit was a big one for me but I felt that there had to be something heavier out there.  Not knowing what that was I bounced around a bit and landed on Slipknot.  Again decent but not heavy enough.On some forums I found a few folks recommended that I check out the normal starting points Megadeth Metallica the easily accessible starting points in metal.  I started out hating Megadeth because I couldnt stand Mustaines vocals but I really dug old school Metallica.  The first time I heard Dyers Eve it grabbed me by the balls and didnt let go.  I was like Holy shit this is exactly what Ive been looking for!  But now...I need to go heavier!A friend introduced me to this up and coming band called Amon Amarth  I thought that was a fuckin weird name but I listened anyways.  The vocals were a little hard for me to handle but I loved the musical aspect.  So I did some research and found out that they were in some genre called melodic death metal which sounded quite contrary to me at the time.  How can death metal be melodic?!Anyways that ended up with me grabbing some old In Flames and starting to fall in love with harsh vocals.  Then melodeath became my home.  Dark Tranquillity I still maintain that Damage Done is one of the best melodeath albums of all time At The Gates In Flames Amon Amarth all were what I was looking for.But again we came back to the heaviness...I needed something brutal because dammit I was edgy! dumb reason but there you have it from my stupid teenage mind  A friend of mine was really big into black metal but I just couldnt take the bullshit recording quality the vocals or really anything about it.  I ended up at a death metal show on a whim one weekend and was hooked.  It was an Origin show and they fucking blew me away.  I knew I was home.During this time I really only listened to death metal and melodeath.  I had zero time for thrash and less than zero time for any of that boringass doom metal or power metal or prog metal or really anything that wasnt death or melodeath.Now though I spend a significant amount of time listening to metal from all genres and I have a huge hardon for thrash lately.  Some other stuff that I hit on now that I would have never listened to  years ago is folk doom and stoner metal.  It just resonates with me now for some reason.  I still listen to a boatload of death metal though my tastes have gravitated more towards melodeath recently.On a side note I think all of this is why I really like all of the definitions for metal subgenres.  I know people love to hate on them but its really a big help when someone is trying to get into metal.  It gives you a starting point to start to sharpen your recommendations for that person.  If they like power metal and you tell them to go listen to Wormphlegm theyre gonna think youre a fuckin idiot and rightfully so ya know?Oh shit sorry for the rambling reply.  Didnt expect it to be this long.,Metal,cg8zh4d,3,t5_2qhud
604502,0,t1_cg8xji6,House shows are the best shows! One time I was playing in some dudes basement and before the show started everyone was spray painting the walls and shit and pretty sure everyone was getting high off the fumes. So when we were playing people were getting rowdy and moshing. Than all of a sudden I see one of my friends punch through the ceiling dry wall and the whole ceiling comes crashing down taking the lights with it. So we continued playing in complete darkness while I keep getting hit from everyone still moshing. That was a good fuckin time,Metal,cg8zh9p,8,t5_2qhud

They just make more inspired music that way. Once youve scratched the surface that you hate Jews and Zionists theres not too many places you can really go.

It has at least  or  memorable songs but I feel a lot of it drags on without hitting the highs I come to demand.I also bought a set of  roadrunner albums of Type O Negative. Worth it considering it was the price of one album and that though I hadnt properly listened to them before I was pretty sure Im up their alley. Correct. Their early stuff seems to be doompunk which is amusing but I more enjoy the later gothic style.I put down money for Arctic Sleeps kickstarter for a new album I really like the one other album of theirs that I have.

806335,0,t1_cgvxdom,Sexuality is genetic. Otherwise humans wouldnt exist. Not objectifying women is actually a learned behaviour. In societies where people are not taught not to do it women are treated like objects. In our society a big part of why women are so objectified is related to how women treat sexuality as well. Women treat sex as something that has to be earned therefore giving sex a somewhat measurable material value. The richest guys with the nicest things get to have sex with the most desirable women because men needwant sex more than women do and therefore women get to select who they mate with and when.Its difficult to get to sleep with attractive women so things that enable men to do so are given a monetary value and sold as such. For example very nice cars are sold with scantilyclad women because theoretically owning this car would give you more chances of sleeping with those women. And you know what? Its true. Having a nice car DOES get you laid with more attractive women. Because women instinctively select for material worth security and resources. Its genetic.In this way men are objectified in an even worse way than women typically are  men are very often seen as mobile ATM machinetaxi drivers and relationships with men are seen as a means to acquire wealth and security. Men deceive women for sex. Women deceive men for everything they own.So is it really men who are  to blame? No. Its both genders and marketers. Fucking pricks.,Metal,cgvxnbo,-6,t5_2qhud

He might not come close to the sheer amount of notes in a song as Dailor but in my opinion he has a better grasp on playing what the song needs Interesting grooves and tastefully adding some amazing fills and polyrhythms only at the right time to further their impact. ,Metal,cgwfrnf,1,t5_2qhud

842801,0,t3_23qsuo,Extreme metal is one of those tags that very rarely comes up outside of metal journalists and media. It doesnt really mean anything and can link any number of bands who only share distorted guitars and blasting drums in common. Its a catchall but a pretty useless one. It might be easier to call something extreme metal instead of blackened technical progressive metal but one actually gives me an idea of what to expect despite how convoluted it sounds.If you look at how Meshuggah  evolved and where they started they have much more to do with thrash.  Theyre loud discordant and have gruff vocals but technique wise aesthetic wise riff wise song wise theyre not death metal. The one death metal song they have was on a compilation Likewise a band like Gorguts can play music thats a million miles away from most death metal bands yet their music is still firmly rooted in the genre.Now Ill admit that none of this gives you the answer youre looking for and Im not suggesting that calling Meshuggah thrash is the most fitting description for their overall sound. I hate the djent tag but it just so happens that if you wanted bands that resembled Meshuggah i.e were heavily heavily influenced by them youd find more bands than if you searched for death metal.tldrExtreme metal is a useless tag. Genre labels should be descriptive and for a tag thats supposed to be all encompassing across various sub genres extreme metal says the exact opposite.,Metal,ch02v6r,2,t5_2qhud

862546,0,t3_23xxqb,I just discovered Follow The White Rabbit off of rprogmetal the other day and they are amazing simply put. They are some great blend of progressive experimental and death and they give me the biggest music boner Ive had since I first heard Anciients. The track that stands out the most to me is Zzzzzz. Its lighter and shreddit may not like it as much as me. You may want to check out The Great Worm if you want to hear their heavier side first.

I totally agree with you about censorship as well.  Free speech exists so that art can make me uncomfortable!  Thanks for providing some examples of other bands dealing with this... that bit about Nokturnal Mortum is really interesting and Ill have to look into it.Im also really really glad to hear that theres no political agenda with Darkthrone... Ive been really binging on them lately find their integrity  lifestyle really inspiring in some ways and while I thought that was the case based on a number of interviews Ive seen from recent years where of course they are way past the early s black metal scene its nice to have someone confirm it.

881917,0,t3_247ra1,I introduced my mother wife and sister to Opeth on a car ride with Drapery Falls and talked them through what the song evoked for me in terms of imagery totally unrelated to the song but it always makes me think of someone lost and vaguely amnesiac in a deadquiet forest without a sense what to do next and then the deathy part is the scary things that come out at night and taint the naivete of the amnesiac and the quietude of the forest and the coda is sort of a lessons learned next day. just a sensory thing.

Axioma Ethica Odini amp RIITIIR were the main albums they were playing stuff from on those tours and some stuff from Vertebrae and Ruun and ISA inbetween.   as for the best I say its Blodhemn. It seems either current Enslaved or really old Enslaved Frost era is more popular but Ill always like Blodhemn and Mardraum more than anything. Theyre the last albums before they started singing in English and going in a more proggy direction which eventually lead to those two excellent most recent albums. Mardraum has a little more of a death metal sound to it while Blodhemn is closer to the earlier more black metal stuff but with shorter songs than those albums. ,Metal,cha50sy,1,t5_2qhud

947461,0,t1_chbp52b,St. Anger was a spring cleaning record so it was deliberately meant to be ugly. I appreciate the album even if I can give or take the music. And All Within My Hands is just an awful piece of music. But I really like Death Magnetic probably more than I do Kill em All. KEA is all YEAH! METAL! BOOZE! which is exactly what youd expect angry and overconfident  year olds to sing about. My life is closer to some of the themes on Death Magnetic  survival recovery forgiveness hope  than it is to the themes on Kill em All. Put another way Metallica are into their s now. If they were still writing songs like Motorbreath and Whiplash thered be an equally large section of fans denigrating them for desperately clinging onto the coattails of their youth as there is a large section of fans denigrating them for writing music that suits their older perspectives and experiences. EDIT Forgot to mention Justice. Its a great thrash album but some of the songs the title track and Dyers Eve come to mind are just heavy and long for the sake of being heavy and long. I read a review of the album that said Justice was Metallica taking thrash or at least their thrash to its logical conclusion. It makes perfect sense really Puppets was more complex than Ride which was more complex than Kill. So Justice was more complex than Puppets and where are you going to go after Justice? Its a great album but Metallica showed that progressive metal doesnt come naturally to them. ,Metal,chbzew2,3,t5_2qhud

1107231,0,t1_chu51l9,Theres no need to make anything of it sometimes. I want to join a band for fun personally not to do anything interesting the guitar while I love it is just a favored hobby of mine. If you want a beginner bass Id recommend getting something used with the help of a friend who can help get you a working one at a reasonable price for what the bass is worth. Set yourself a decent price range and go for it the biggest reason people quit as far as I can tell is people playing on shitty gear and having a bad time. Shitty gear really can ruin a new players experience. A working amp is important but having a nice one is less important to a beginner beginners cant usually tell if their tone is bad anyhow. When youre starting remember all of our fingers were retarded at some point. I can sweep fast enough that my fingers are doing that creepy jerky spider thingy were you can barely see the individual movements sometimes but when I started I couldnt even convince them to do basic power chords.If you have the money and like video games look into something called Rocksmith  Its basically guitar hero but with an actual guitar or bass.

Overall I have been pleasantly surprised by just how cohesive everything sounds and the atmospheric tones that setup some heavy black metal riffs that are accentuated by violins often. A strange but compelling outfit of progressive metal.Symphony X  The OdysseyNothing should ever had to be said about Symphony X other than they are one of the greatest power metal outfits out there. I began my journey with Symphony X with V and have found the culmination of their efforts in The Odyseey. It is a concept album with amazing vocals screechingly hard power metal riffs and simply an awe. Its one of the few power metal albums I will listen to the entire way through.Nevermore  Dead Heart in a Dead WorldNevermore is a progressive thrash metal band that really deserves alot more attention then they deserve. While their latest effort The Obsidian Conspiracy leaves much to be desired by a Nevemore fan that has been around since Dead Heart in a Dead World and This Godless Endeavor it fails to encompass what made those albums so great experimentation. Dead Heart in a Dead World is a fantastic experiment in progressive thrash back with some glorious vocals and plenty of ear bleeding thrash to keep you interested.

1283773,0,t3_28shqx,Ill be totally honest a good portion of my digital music collection is pirated. Its probably not an acceptable excuse but I simply cant afford the amount of music I discover. I pay for my music as often as I can and I buy shirts and go to shows as often as I can. The simple fact of the matter is that I wouldnt be buying those shirts and going to those shows because without pirating the bands music I probably would never get familiar enough with them to want to buy a shirt or go to a show.That being said I actually still think pirating is bad as hypocritical as it sounds. Pirating music is stealing revenue from the band plain and simple. Id have to be a complete idiot to think that was a good thing. Im aware there are probably some bands who dont really care if people pirate their music like Alestorm who I think I remember saying dont care if you pirate their music but thats fucking Alestorm. Its not that surprising. But even if the band says Eh fuck it pirate your music all you want we dont care I still dont think its right.However Im slowly whittling away at buying the music Ive pirated. Its a slow process but Im sort of seeing at as paying for what Ive borrowed.,Metal,cie1hou,2,t5_2qhud
1283873,0,t3_28shqx,Its good for great independent bands so they get discovered.  And people can find more music and easier. Its just that far less new generations are searching for Metal.

1284262,0,t1_cie1m90,Yeah Ive definitely had similar conversations. For many artists putting out albums is more of a way of doing promotion for their tours rather than making bank directly.It wasnt a metal show but I remember going to a Thursday show several years ago and Geoff the lead singer instructed everybody that hadnt already done so to go home and download all of their music. He said that by attending their live show you earned that privilege.

1285716,0,t3_28shqx,As a musician and music fan Im against pirating. I couldnt just steal a bands music especially of bands I love because I want to support them and help them succeed. Its not a big deal to me to listen to a band on youtube or spotify to decide whether I like them enough to purchase their music.I used to listen to Youtube to check out new artists but over the past few months ive been using Spotify. I wouldnt call listening to music unofficially on Youtube to be hypocritical because its just a stream. Plus if you watch official videos from the bands channel they make money off the ads so why would it be equivalent to pirating? Granted Spotify and Youtube sales yield very little actual money but its something right? Realistically most bands that arent huge will see very little money from music sales but their labels will be more keen to keep them onpromote themetc if they are doing well in sales.I personally would only pirate something if there was no other way I could get it. I dont even mind paying extra for japanese import cds of bands I like. Im a collector. This isnt entirely related but I dont even go for used cds anymore unless its a limited edition that I cant get new.Piracy does allow for a lot of exposure but only a small percentage of those who pirate music will actually buy it. If you already have it whats the incentive to rebuy it? I just think of the band Mutiny Within. They only had one major label album. It got great reviews across the board but they only sold  copies of their album  pirated. They were set to have a bright future but Roadrunner dropped them after just two years. Dream Theater even offered them an opening spot on an upcoming tour but MW had to decline because they couldnt afford it. They were literally THAT close to getting to the next level. Thats what piracy can do to new bands.,Metal,cie9cks,1,t5_2qhud

If youre looking for how they helped start some of metals trends such as dual guitar solos then its the first few albums that will show that. Victim of changes is a very hard song to love however you can hear it live performed throughout the decades as their sound changed. The absolute best years for Halfords voice was when he was actually split from the band and doing his solo work. You could give some of his off work a try like Fight nailed to the gun or into the pit or Halford made in hell resurrection crucible fugitive silent screams the mower.

Its like they took mainstream metal rock early grunge turned it all entirely into a single hook with no real variation or even good sound amp then a soft part per song or vice versa sometimes added a voice that not even a mother could love and after getting famous for a reason I still cant think of may as well have told everyone that Alice in Chains was a piece of shit since no one mentions them ever they still make music according to Wikipedia and reviews on the Metal Archives sludge metal now.

I prefer metal as my default and preferred genre but it confuses the hell out of people when Eminem and Atmosphere and Slim Thug Kid Kudi etc. pop up after Mastodon and Lamb of God Job for a Cowboy etc.  I dont read fantasy or anime and am not a computer nerd or even own a computer I just use reddit mobile Im just a auto electrical mechanic that listens to metal to stay motivated and upbeat. I used to listen to metal to relax believe it or not when I was really young and thats how I got into it. I wear my Lamb of God tshirt with my Dickies shorts and Jordans lol. I only wear basketball shoes and I hoop and dress sort of hip hopish but wear my metal tees and skate tees. I have skated my whole life and played bball my whole life and grew up in a rough outskirt of Seattle so my style is sort of a hybrid of metalskate culture with a basketball hip hop hybrid No one would guess that I listen to either metal or rap. A lot of my metal head friends actually get frustrated that I listen to rap and hip hop but I dont understand why people create such a void in between the two genres and cultures. If you enjoy the music then whats the problem? People just need to lighten up and be themselves and not let music or other people determine what they listen to or how they dresswho they hang out with.,Metal,civ8pxi,7,t5_2qhud

Inhale growls by default come from the throat and while its technically possible to inhale growl without killing your throat its harder to get a good tone and you probably sound pretty bad on recording if youre anywhere near actual inhale growls. I like the way this guy puts it his opinion matches mine decently Ive really never heard any good inhales that sound good and Ive never heard of any actual good at least death metal using them theyre pretty well hated and a big deathcore thing.

1561999,0,t3_2c4uno,Subrosa  No Help For the Mighty OnesI revisited this album a lot this week since Subrosa came through my town earlier this week. Theyre one of my favorite bands and I remember seeing them a bunch of times when I was in high school in Salt Lake. I normally dont really go for female fronted bands but I really like the vocals on this record. I actually think its a better album than their latest but Im sure thats subjective.Num Skull  Ritually AbusedThere was a lot of buzz last week about this record being reissued by Relapse a label which I quite like but I had never heard of the band. I normally dont like thrash but this record was really fucking good. Its got just the right amount of grimy production to sound old school without getting boring.Panopticon  Roads to the NorthI like this less than I like Kentucky. There I said it. Sorry. The black metal is excellent as always and I really love the American folk influences but for some reason the vocals dont quite resonate with me as much and the random melodeath bits really dont do the band any favors. However when the flute kicks in and they really go all out atmoblack this is great music.Trepaneringsritualen amp Sutekh Hexen  The Hundred Year StormThis is really one of the most unique things Ive heard in the last few weeks be warned if dronepower electronics is not your thing maybe give this a pass. Its a collaborative set between death industrialnoisespooky guy Trepaneringsritualen and drone metal guys Sutekh Hexen recorded at the last Stella Natura fest. Pretty neat stuff and certainly worth an hour of your time. Sutekh Hexen have always been one of the better drone outfits and Im never disappointed by their work.

I just searched through my old CDs and I even found the track listing with it on it  Unfortunately I dont have the CD anymore just the paper listing. I threw all the old CDs out when I cleaned them up a long time ago but I kept my track listings just to remember the funny mixes I used to make. I listened to this one constantly and it was pretty much what wound up being released. There was no cleandirty versechorus switch. The fact that nobody seems to have it gives a pretty good indication that its not true. Maybe Lars is just remembering or maybe he thinks it validates their behavior more. ,Metal,cjezfqv,19,t5_2qhud

1648196,0,t3_2d61hc,I think theres a breakdown in communication and I shouldve explained better. I said philosophical links which is to say that there are modern day Satanists that look back to Manichaeist and Gnostic thought in their ideology. This is without a distinct line of transmission or direct lineage. Anticosmic Satanism or rather ChaosGnosticism is the most explicit example of this. This is interesting in light of the fact that within Manichaeism and Gnostic thought there is the idea of a cosmic dictator the demiurge identified as Yahweh who created the world as a prison with himself at the top. This manifested in interesting ways in that traditionally evil entities were revered for their opposition to the cosmic order. One example of this is in the Testimony of Truth one of the texts discovered at Nag Hammadi the Garden of Eden story was told through the viewpoint of the serpent who presumably sought to teach Adam and Eve good and evil and be like gods.So for AntiCosmic Satanists ChaosGnostics they adopt this principle into their worldview and worship Lucifer as a Promethean figure who sought to teach mankind and raise them up only to be punished for this act just like Prometheus was punished by Zeus for gifting humanity with the secret of fire. To this is often added ideas from heretical Kabbalah specifically the existence of the Tree of Knowledge the antipole to the traditional Kabbalic Tree of Life. Traversing the Tree of Knowledge ends in the practitioner freeing himself from the causal structures chaining him to this prison he is fence emerging as a god in his own right no longer a passive creation but a creator in his own right.Another crucial part of this worldview is the Chaos vs. Cosmos divide. Cosmos is the limited structure created by the demiurge whereas chaos is pure unmediated and uncontrolled being. Obviously ChaosGnostics venerate Chaos and more or less reject the Cosmos and seek gnosis with this great beyond the very substance on which Cosmos stands. This allows some to link chaos with shakti in Hindu thought as pure feminine energy that sustains and upholds all transitory cosmic structures. Furthermore this realm of chaos is inhabited by deities like dragon monsters in various chaoskampf myths in addition to other deities like the Kings of Edom. But thats another digression.In addition to this is the usage of the Left Hand Path a phrase borrowed from Hindu Tantra to refer to transgressive and hardcore methods of practice. Often equated with black magic the Left Hand Path involves often violent practices involving alcohol menstrual blood ritual sex grisly cremation ground rites and impure substances in the pursuit of liberation and power. This phrase and numerous parts of its practice were brought into western Occult discourse and often find expression in modern Satanic metal groups Behemoth included.All this is just scratching the surface of the various incarnations and influences of contemporary Satanism. Is it a literal lineage from the primordial mists of time passed from teacher to disciple? No but why should it have to be? This subculture is creatively working with a wide range of material in the creation of a selfconsistent worldview that gives meaning to their lives and practices and indeed its probable that all religions started in a similar manner rather than emerging fully formed out of the ether.This is why I think its unfair to flatly dismiss them as newage mad at dad types.

Seriously if you took Slipknots riffing and put it in transposed them to work in Standard tuning would anyone call them metal? Downtuning for heaviness doesnt make you metal automatically and while they might not BE punk riffs theyre certainly closer to being punk riffs than to being metal ones.I cant argue the drumming on account of not being a drummer but people I trust to be right on subgenreing things that ARE drummers have told me repeatedly that thats what the drumming is like.

I started off with bands like Metallica and went further so an operatic style of vocal I guess would be the best term was a huge turn off to me but this album grew on me tremendously. I love the end of Nightmares it is so creepy and haunting. The whole album has a special kind of darkness that most bands out side of the more extreme side of metal cant seem to pull off as well. Maybe its Kings lyrics or maybe its a combination of things? Who knows but it damn sure kicks ass. Its hard for me to think about the fact that this album came out right after Kill Em All.

1939537,0,t3_2gva4y,Well its more like they added Progressive elements to their music and that became known as the stereotypical type of Progressive metal that Dream Theater would then popularize further but I would say theres no set sound to progressive metal and instead progressive is applied to various types of metal ie Death Heavy Power. Progressive is more often a nature and way you play as opposed to a fully defined genre which is why a band like Opeth doesnt really sound anything like Voivod who in turn sound nothing like Intronaut. So I would say that while those bands are known as being progressive their musical genetic make up is still very composed of Heavy MetalSpeedUSPM just played in a progressive style. As for why? Well Queensryche was more about concept stories which are probably a lot of fun to write and Fates Warning had so many crazy ideas and the prowess to do it so why not?,Metal,ckmwql0,30,t5_2qhud

I think they just thought having a big twerking segment in a metal video a scene which is sort of culturally not tied to twerking at all would be funny.  To be honest I laughed during the video and thought it was hilarious when the Windows Media Playeresque psychedelic graphic came in.  In the pitchfork interview Brann even basically says it was done just to be shocking.I dont think a band has to constantly have a motive or some sociopolitical purpose behind whatever theyre doing and certainly dont think they should be criticized for the inclusion of a relevant contemporary cultural phenomenon Its not sexist and its not deep or intelligent but it doesnt try to be either,Metal,cky3au1,10,t5_2qhud

2237593,0,t3_2ksa6f,I think Tolkien and Lovecraft have equally important influences on heavy metal. Both seem to offer a dense world of immersion which resonates with outsiders. Also that HP. Lovecraft band is pretty decent if you are into psych. Oh look here is my Lovecraft mixtape I made a few years ago. Its like I am carrying it around for some reason.

Pretty solid DM with some catchy hooks. So when they released the promo for Sun of Nihility I was fucking entirely astounded.That bass is probably the best bass sound Ive ever heard on a death metal album. The songs blend together brilliantly and has a serious compelling groove to it. Now Im no death metal expert I usually only follow the top rated DM releases each year Dead Congregation Origin Vallenfyre etc but I personally havent heard much DeathMetal with that kind of slow groove to it. Almost classic doom vibe in some of the rhythm sections.Also.Winterfylleth  The Divination of Antiquity.A perfectly generic atmosfolk black album. And I mean perfectly.

2463944,0,t1_cmg36dl,If you were to ask me Id say In Rock was a more dedicated Heavy Metal album than Black Sabbath st. They were in production at the same time and only a few months separated their releases. Black Sabbath only put out their record first by grace of recording and releasing quicker. In fact Deep Purple were already playing some of these songs live before In Rock was released much in the way that Highway Star was their opener for the In Rock tour despite the fact that Machine Head was not in recording yet. Besides these two albums are the parents of all modern metal. Sabbath beget doom and extreme metal Purple beget speed and power.

2536143,0,t3_2oqax2,Saw Ghost perform at Live Evil festival in London back in . For those of you who arent familiar with the festival it revolves around bands who were featured in Fenrizs Band of the Week. This was their second gig and like a day after the release of Opus Eurynomous. It was a relatively small venue compared to where they play nowadays as there were  people at most. The show was fantastic although they only played a four song set. This was right at the tipping point when Ghost went from being underground to the full blown massively popular band they are today.

2637899,0,t3_2q2t7g,Nightwish will always be my favourite band not necessarily because I listen to them a lot any more but because they were the band that got me into metal in the first place.  Id really like the album to be an album with more metal and less ballads.  Imaginaerum suffered from the fact that it was an album written for a film and all the songs were just thrown into the order they appear in the movie which didnt make much listening sense when listening to the music apart from the film.  The ballads individually were very beautiful but were all lumped together creating this weird boring middle section of Imaginaerum where you had to endure ballad after ballad.  Im happy to hear that the album concept is around the Creation of Life as when I heard Dawkins was making an appearance I was worried that Nigthwish would focus on the athiest part of Dawkins career.  Ill undoubtedly enjoy their album as their song writing is always on point and Im excited to see how returning to their roots is achieved in this album.  While I love Orchestras  Choir with metal I personally enjoy the earlier albums of Nightwish such as Centurary Child and Wishmaster where the songs were basically just using the instruments of the  band members.  ,Metal,cn2wmoz,2,t5_2qhud

This doesnt mean Lateralus isnt good or has significance with you personally rather I feel you...and most Tool fans confuse subjective attachment with objective judgement.

As far as the extreme genres go there seems to be a departure from ideologicallydriven music to aestheticallydriven music. While there is some staleness black metal bands like Inquisition Spectral Lore Deathspell Omega and Panopticon have demonstrated a fuller aesthetics of black metal. Also bands like Amon Amarth Gojira and The Black Dahlia Murder have managed to make extreme metal popular to an audience I dont think the styles have seen before. I would argue too that they havent compromised much regarding heaviness and style. I think we are seeing a lot of similarities here.,Metal,cnh4pq5,4,t5_2qhud

However one thing I didnt forget was Dracula which is some King Diamond pure heavy metal worship in the best way. Its quite lofi compared to other things but it sort of adds to the whole aesthetic of vampires and shit like that. Really nice riffs and bass work on here as well.Axis of Light  Lappel du vide  Im going to talk about this one more because I reckon Misyrming  Sngvar elds og reiu will get more attention as well as Heathen but I absolutely loved this record. UK Black Metal that is raw as hell. I actually think its less lofi than the other one previously but it still holds up with some great songwriting. Its nice that they continue with the short  minute full lengths because I feel like this would be tiring as they dont explore too many ideas in the time they make music but they do it VERY well. Lots of shrieks tremelo picking and blasts for you to all enjoy.Arnaut Pavle  Another Fallen Empire records? well shit its from a year ago why not. DO YOU LIKE ND WAVE BLACK METAL WORSHIP LIKE DARKTHRONE...yes? of course you do. Then do yourself a favour and pick this up. Im going with the more shorter albums this week but its such a good listen. I woke up and listened to it twice in one go then another before bed and it just doesnt let up. Its such a fucking good demo really pissed off they might not be doing anymore.Ruins of Beverast  Yeah Devin Townsend is a one man band  but Ruins of Beverast is a nonmeme metal band that focuses on different aspects of extreme metal. Blackdeathdoom...sounds like Beherit or Archgoat right? wrong. The last  albums are way more experimental often with every other tracker being some weird ass interlude but the long songs offer a great variety of pace of haunting vocals kick ass drum work and just sheer ferocity of riffs.

There are a lot of Incantation clones but they can be unique in a lot of small ways just like a heavy metal band can be a clone of Iron Maiden but still be unique in a lot of small ways etc.In my limited experience the more I listen to a certain subgenre the more Im able to appreciate clones because Im able to see the small differences more clearly and appreciate them for their quality rather than the lack of innovation.

3161118,0,t3_2wcbyw,First a word about what mastering is. Imagine youre building a table. You draw up a plan songwriting you get your raw materials and carve out the individual pieces tracking you assemble them into a table mixing and then stain it and varnish it mastering. The purpose of audio mastering is threefold to get all the tracks on the same level and sounding largely uniform give them that nice professional sheen and to get another set of ears on the mix. That last part is critical. The way our brains work its impossible to hear something accurately if youve been listening to it long enough so mastering gives you a fresh set of ears on the mix. If the mastering is done by the mixing engineer it isnt really mastering.The thing is when an album sounds good there are a lot of factors that go into it. A good recording environment a strong performance by the band effective sound design by both the band and the studio engineers effective microphone placement and tracking effective mixing and effective mastering all play into it. When an album sounds good or bad its difficult to point to one single element of that process and effectively impossible to tell what the effect of mastering was unless you have an unmastered version to compare it to because theres nothing that happens in mastering that doesnt also happen in mixing to different degrees in different ways and towards different ends but that cant be sorted out in the final product without an unmastered reference.The one major complaint about modern metal production is hypercompression as you seem to be aware. A little bit of compression is generally necessary in any metal recording at least during tracking. Too much can hinder or completely destroy the music. Heres an example of a notoriously squished song Carved From Stone by Fallujah from recent memory and also an example of a mixing engineer doing his own mastering so at least in this example you know who was at fault. Zack Ohren is probably the best there is at making a hypercompressed album still sound decent but for me at least the lack of dynamic range has been a major barrier to being able to enjoy this album and I think its one I otherwise would have really loved. If you follow this link to the review blog Angry Metal Guy youll find an honest review of the effect of hypercompression a very informative conversation with Zach Ohren in the comments section and a link to a review of a more dynamic version of the album for comparison unfortunately not available to the public. Zack mentioned somewhere that the final squish was added during the mastering stage but without another version to compare it against its hard to tell precisely how the master changed the overall sound.Comparing a digital album to the same album on vinyl might serve as a good basis for comparison. The mix is always going to be the same Im not aware of any exceptions but often vinyl uses a different master because vinyl is marketed towards a difference audience and there are physical limitations to how loud you can make the music before the needles starts flying out of the groove. But then youre also dealing with the inherent differences in the media so it wouldnt be an exact comparison but might be informative.Here is an example of an album that went completely unmastered. Outside of underground black metal Im not aware of any other unmastered albums in metal. And this one was mixed by Kevin Shirley so it came out of the studio already sounding fantastic and as I described theres no way to compare it to what a mastered version would sound like. But I can say that its one of my favorite sounding albums. Maybe with some mastering I would enjoy it even more maybe less. No way to know.,Metal,copnceu,8,t5_2qhud

3199123,0,t1_cotf01w,The thing is that its not just the loudness thats important but also the exposure time. For example say the average level at the show youre at is dB. According to OSHA the daily permissible exposure time at that level is  hours. After that you may experience permanent hearing loss. Will it be noticeable? Probably not but it will add up over time and eventually you will have some significant hearing loss.Now consider this if you wear hearing protection that only attenuates dB your exposure time goes up to  hours assuming again that the average level is dB. Thats a very small change in loudness compared to how much exposure time that buys you. Typically most ear plugs attenuate more than that.Now no one is going to make you wear hearing protection but you may want to visit an audiologist and get a hearing test done just so you know if and how much hearing damage you may have.,Metal,cotl7fg,8,t5_2qhud

I havent heard the latest Ne Obliviscaris and Im not a follower of any of the djenty bands so Im not burnt out on that style.  Actually tbh nothing has reminded me of Cynic at all so far.

3467995,0,t1_cpn6rsw,I cant assume that you have a lot of musical knowledge I mean music theory not listening to music but think about how many of the metal anthems for lack of a better term are in a minor key. Whereas the punk anthems are typically in a major key. There are of course tons of exceptions to this since both the genres have pretty extensive libraries but there is enough that I think you can draw the conclusion that I have. Vocals dont matter a lick to me in discerning the style. With all the sub genres there are lots of different vocal styles that can make it hard to pigeonhole a certain vocal style to metal or punk. From Despised Icon to Megadeath or from Leftover Crack to Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Both metal both punk. Completely different vocal stylings. ,Metal,cpnkrfw,1,t5_2qhud

3490196,0,t3_308lb5,Ethereal Shroud  Absolution | Emptiness   Whoa. I mean what the hell. In the interest of academic honesty Im not even sure this is even metal. It comes across more like Burzums more accessible works but simply performed by Sigur Rs. The tremolo fills are melodic and the atmosphere is thick but strangely pleasant. But seriously listening to this album is like watching a feature length film about ancient warfare a lost lover and the floodtide of grief of a man who watched his only son die. Suspension of disbelief isnt even the right phrase to do justice with how enthralled you are you are taken by the film. As you walk outside into the cold after the movie is over you light a cigarette with a thousandyard stare. You drive home in silence with your mind never finding peace. After finishing it you just want to ponder how utterly mortal you are and how vast the universe is. This enigmatic haze in which you find yourself is this album. Do you like rabid riffs pounding percussion and hardhitting howls? Yeah? Well dont get this. Get this if you just finished Fear and Trembling and want a soundtrack as you stare distantly into the night sky wondering if everything really flows according to the whims of the Great Magnet.Angelica  Angelica   Angelica were just another heavy metal band in the vast ocean of the nineteen eighties. True they werent trying anything particularly new  but they were part of keeping the flame going for traditional metal and they managed to put out a nice little piece of work here. The musicianship and songwriting are both solid here. They do favour the more melodic when it comes to making riffs and the guitarist is a serious one but unfortunately they can be a little too Stryperesque for my tastes at times especially with the ballads punctuate this album. Overall its a fine listen and there is a nice instrumental track that plays like a tribute to Joe Satriani. So even if this isnt your particular cup of gin this dude has some serious chops that demand respect. Recommended for fans of melodic metal and guitar heroics.Saligia  Sic Transit Gloria Mundi   I have loved Saligia for a long time but it wasnt until very recently that I was able to land a copy of this full length album. This is pure and simply some of the most compelling atmospheric black metal. Like their musical forebears they are also from Norway and have put together an album that is captivating and haunting without relying excessively on what a lot of atmospheric black metal bands use in order to increase accessibility. Now I would not describe them as inaccessible but I would not describe them as overly accessible either. This album seems to be a magnificent marriage of atmospheric qualities and black metal that still retains everything that makes it metal. But possibly the greatest attribute of Saligia is the vocals. They reverberate like forlorn cries in a hollow coffin. You simply must experience this album. Recommended for fans of Burzum who may want a little more depth in their metal.Scanner  The Judgement   Ah Scanner. If you have been following my posts you know of my recent love affair with them. Imagine my delight when the German power metal giants had released an album this year. As soon as I put this record on I was reminded of that time I heard Elton John perform Yellow Brick Road thirty  years after he wrote it. His penetrating tenor was gone and had been replaced by a sullen baritone like a sixteen  year old boy visiting his aunt after a three  year hiatus. Now Scanner still have plenty of decent ideas but they dont quite make up for the loss of that voice with the rest of their music. I do like how they have embraced their German identity with their singing though. Shit they dont even try to hide it. Its like Herbie from Seventh Avenue trying to belt out Southgate but only being able to muster Saugeit! I mean he must just not give a shit if hes going to name his album with an English word that he knows he cant pronounce. Same with this album. They know theyre German and they let their sexy accents shine through. All I can say is Repekt.,Metal,cpq3ve0,2,t5_2qhud

Night Of The Stormirder on the other hand seems like the true predecessor to the mentioned two so it got quite a few spins in my car.Leviathan  Scar Sighted This is me trying to get into this album but so far it is only half successfull.

And postMetallica then people would jump to other conclusions like alternative grunge or whatever. Really I just was listening to a bunch of metal stuff and I was realizing as a guitarist myself that it is pretty difficult to come up with heavy riffs that dont do it. Its almost like once you make the decision to remove that element you suddenly find yourself doing some punk style riff or a bluesy kind of thing that Ratt might play. Not that it really matters it just happens that I was really enjoying some particular metal stuff not punk or anything else but I found myself wishing the fallback on that chugga chugga would disappear and started to wonder what else I could listen to.But I cant think of everything. Thats why when something new and different comes out its mindblowing and I go why didnt I think of that?! So I was just wondering what else is out there that fits this very openended description.,Metal,cpst7af,0,t5_2qhud

And by that I mean SW is basically a living embodiment of every black metal trope. Corpse paint bullet belts spikes? You got em. Songs about Satan? Yep. Paganthemed romantic nationalism? You betcha. Some NS stuff thrown in there for good measure? Jawohl.  Its no surprise that his music is pretty much solidly second wave and he has no desire to change it. But is it good? Its not the most exciting or original obviously but he can write a good frigid Finnish style sounding riff. Will never be my favorite band but its a decent one. ,Metal,cpwt9q3,4,t5_2qhud

3662362,0,t3_32a3vz,Female metal head here My boyfriend is in a well known Doom metal band where Im from and gets hit on a lot. It comes with the territory. I am well known in the community. I get friend requests from dudes all the time. People I briefly met at shows. I accept them because I am my own person and I am allowed to have as many male friends as I want. Same goes with my dude. I accept requests mainly because I am a social butterfly Im interested in local bands and its good to have connections. Ill give you some advice since you asked for it. Itll be harsh but you need to hear it.There could be three reasons as to what is going on and my final conclusion will be your answer. Either he accepts requests for the same reasons I do. Purely platonic reasons.. He is being an asshole and doing shit behind your back.. You are just simply the jealous type probably not what you want to hear who automatically assumes the worst in your SO. Probably leads to arguments or problems right? Conclusion It really could simply be a metal head thing. it is where I come from. Bottom line is you dont trust him and he doesnt care how you feel. That will not ever in a million years get better between you two. You will always be jealous of other women you will always never trust him and he will continue doing what hes doing. If you choose to censor his online shit he will dump you.

I stumbled upon this when Fallen Empire posted this album on their Facebook page on Monday and I saw it got some love here yesterday too. Edit and ukaptainkarbon beat me to posting it today. This features one of the members of Nightbringer as well as some person named Ain who I am unfamiliar with. I am trying to come up with a FFO descriptor but Im striking out. Deathspell Omega immediately came to mind but AKHLYS is only kind of similar to DSO. Just listen to it if you like solid dense Black Metal.

I played the third generation quite a lot Monster Hunter Tri for the Wii and in addition to the stuff the others already told you the game gets easier the more you play it because you actually try to memorize certain patterns I mean you have to thats the point. But its pretty cool how youll struggle with the Great Jaggi or the Barroth try him a hundred million times and then after you slay this fuck everythings easy until you get to the next enemy.But for advice You dont need to focus on much of the complicated stuff in the beginning.

3970637,0,t3_35xkuk,Shamelessly copypasting this from last weeks thread because I was late to that one and this didnt get as much attention as I hoped it would. TLDR Local nonmetal band recs.I want to recommend a couple local nonmetal bands that I feel deserve more attention. Ive seen both these bands live twice on the same bill both times and I enjoy them a lot. Id love to get these guys more attention from some people here.So first up Have you been wanting a side of Uptown Funk with your Red Hot Chili Peppers? Well then NEVEREADY is just what you need. These guys play jazzyfunky rock with that beachy California feel that RHCP bring but then they throw in a mini brass section to shake things up. Their live energy is absolutely fantastic they got the whole venue jumping and singing in no time and made me a fan immediately. They have one fulllength on iTunes alreadyAll I Wanna Do Is of their most energetic songs they close out the set with this one and the circle pit was pretty much just people sprinting in a circle.Can You Dig It? a local rapper on guest vocals this is probably my favorite song by them. The bass is especially funky and stands out here.Trouble of their slower tunes very relaxing atmosphere besides the gunshots and stuff that still picks up a bit at the end.Youre Gonna Find Out Soon chorus makes for great audience participation.Second we have a threepiece garagepunk rock band known as THE SNYKES. The guitarist and bassist both go to my school and theyve gone from being founded to headlining sidestage shows in a relatively short periodprobably due in part to the higherthannormal amount of support they get from classmates. They sound a lot like The Black Keys and the White Stripes but they inject a good amount of straightup punk energy and even some hints of grunge a la Nirvana into their songs so that theyre not ripping the aforementioned bands off. Theyre great at whipping up a crowd as well and it would really be cool to see them play on bigger stages. Right now I believe theyre recording either a demo or fulllength.All Hail the Queen only music video and only studiorecorded song on Youtube as of now. The Black KeysWhite Stripes influence is highly noticeable in that riff but they ramp up the energy near the end too.Na Na Na not the most creative song title but this is a good showing of their fast punk side. This video was shot at the last show I went toIm headbanging and running around in the pit somewhere in there.And if you really liked that second song you can go vote for it in a battle of the bands contest here The winner of this contest gets to play a set at a local music festival. Itll be a huge break for them if they win so go ahead and vote if you dig them. No they did not pay me to say this. Totally.Lemme know if you liked either of these bands! Theyd love to hear about it.,Metal,cr8vw9f,5,t5_2qhud

4293012,0,t3_3a5bm0,Kalmankantaja  Muinainen   I was really impressed by this albums two actual songs. They really paid off on the promise they made with their EP that also came out this year. Each song builds to some amazing climax and is really awesome. However they did the same thing I felt Ifing did last year two songs and one ambient track does not an album make. The two songs total up to  minutes and while thats pretty long its just a long EP not an album. Other bands can get away with  minute albums because they have like    songs on there looking at you Nails but this kind of music cannot. So I dont know. I want more from this album. Right now Im just calling it a very successful EP. Les Chants de Nihil  Armor   okay seriously no joke I honestly thought this band was called Les Chats de Nihil. If you look at the album art youll see a fucking cat face in the sky like thats supposed to be spooky or something? Anyways Cats of Nihil is now what this band is to me. Silly name aside I actually thought this album sounded pretty good considering Ive never heard of them and gave it a try because of that fucking cat. I guess youd call it black metal with some atmosphere but not atmospheric because there is like  songs and none is over  minutes?s  s   have I heard of this band before? I dont know but their name look so familiar. But then again its three letters so who knows. Oh wait no I was thinking of Eos without the accents. Anyways look Funeral Doom! Yes thats right I sometimes get out of my wheelhouse to listen to other genres. This is just a short song  minute EP but I listened to it late one night and thought it was perfect for the mood! Who knows maybe its awesome maybe its actually boring. But it was a hit for me that night and its still sounding good so far!Vallendusk  Homeward Path   this is an edit because I totally didnt realize I didnt cover this last week. I think I also forgot to cover Vattnet Viskar its great!. Okay I said it above but the ORGANS! I fucking love them. They pop up throughout this album and they are a really unique instrument to add into the mix as we rarely hear them in black metal at least the way they are used here. I think this album is really great it has some awesome moments on it and they really do now how to make those guitars sparkle. Add to the fact that I feel like their vocals have improved and theyve generally gotten a bit more aggressive and you have an amazing album! Probably going to make its way onto my top  list but I hate being predictable.   Ive also been listening to like every Agalloch album because did you hear? Im going to see them omg tomorrow and Ive been relistening to lots of stuff in prep for Saturdays official midyear weighin. ,Metal,cs9jloe,4,t5_2qhud

The startstop bit at  is another part sort of like the last couple bars of the Wings of Predation riff as is the similar  stuttery rhythm. Im not saying the posthardcore influence is a bad thing  heck posthardcore and noise rock influenced almost all dissonant metal via Voivod and Gorguts  its just more prominent here than in Fas though that has its own fair share of mathy startstop rhythms like the outbursts around  into Repellent Scars which feel really reminiscent of what a band like TDEP or Ion Dissonance would do you know those needling highregister riffs.,Metal,csofp24,2,t5_2qhud

Might want to try the instrumentals at first since you can then identify if its the vocals that turn you off. Heres From Skin to Liquid off Gallery of Suicide one of my favourite CC tracks overall. Then theres Infinite Misery off Kill.

4797566,0,t3_3gl2ho,So in preparation for the new Iron Maiden album Ive decided to do my homework on newer postreunion Maiden an era which I have criminally overlooked especially considering I put them as my  band alltime based purely on their s output. Ive given Brave New World Dance of Death and A Matter of Life and Death complete relistens. While I certainly cant make definitive judgements based solely on those listens my impressions are as follows.Brave New World Ive listened to a handful of the songs on here regularly The Wicker Man Ghost of the Navigator The Mercenary Out of the Silent Planet but the rest of the album always escaped me. Dream of Mirrors has a killer chorus but lulls a bit too much. Still a very energized record you could tell the band was back spitting fire and this is really fun.Dance of Death Rainmaker and No More Lies are also previous regular listens but nothing else. This one kinda pulled in a few different directions like the band didnt know where they wanted to go. Not bad at all but slightly schizophrenic I guess. Favorite song by far is New Frontier which sounds straight out of Number of the Beast. I think this one needs more listens to properly digest all the songs.A Matter of Life and Death Same mostly as DoD. I love Different View. Brighter Than A Thousand Suns was decidedly epicsounding. Most of the longer songs were somewhat lost on me. I need to listen to this one more too. Geez Iron Maiden are just piling on the homework here. Next up is The Final Frontier. I may or may not preorder The Book of Souls.,Metal,ctz9t5m,6,t5_2qhud

5575165,0,t3_3rhdvw,Right so the past week Ive mostly been working on my knowledge of essential hard rockearly metalScorpions  Virgin Killer and Taken by Force. The obvious highlights here are Virgin Killer so fucking mean and aggressive The Sails of Charon superb composition built around master race riffs and Hes a Woman  Shes a Man great blend of catchy and heavy. Beyond that... Im not sure really. Most of the tracks are clearly competently written and enjoyable to listen to but they dont really excite me Catch Your Train and Your Light are two exceptions.The Scorpions have a pretty distinct sound built around somewhat whinysounding vocal and guitar harmonies  most clearly noticeable on Pictured Life Well Burn the Sky and the chorus of Catch Your Train. It works for some songs but also gets a bit grating after a while.HellCat is full of amusingly blatant Hendrix referencing. I see what you did there Uli.UFO  Phenomenon. Here there are a lot more songs of the exciting kind. I cant stop listening to Rock Bottom  those riffs! That solo! That chorus! Other bangers include Doctor Doctor and the somewhat more introspective Space Child and Queen of the Deep.Built for Comfort is meh  when it comes to covering Howlin Wolf Led Zeppelin clearly did it better and for that matter so did MegadethAccept  Balls to the Wall. Well this was a disappointment. A classic case of awesome song boring album with the awesome song in this case of course being the title track. Except for that and London Leatherboys I felt none of the tracks were worth keeping in my library. I know Restless and Wild is a tough act to follow but they couldve done a better job than this.Thin Lizzy  Jailbreak. Now were talking! This is a solid hard rock album throughout carried by very strong songwriting Phil Lynotts strange soulful voice and in some places unusually mean lowregister guitar work for the time the title tracks riff is the clearest example. The boys are back in town!Ive also embarked on a long long journey to learn more about speed metalMetal Church  Blessing in Disguise. A mixed bag this one. Definitely not on the level of their first two albums though Fake Healer and Badlands come close. Most of the songs are good in concept I mean that riff on The Spell Cant be Broken... damn! but go on for way too long to stay interesting.Where their aforementioned first two albums were in that kind of weird inderminate territory on the borders of speed thrash and USPM this album leans more clearly towards thrash with Its a Secret as the straightest example.ADX  Excution. Holy fuck. This album is like a piece of clothing that fits like a second skin the first time you try it on or a person you feel an immediate click with after talking for barely two minutes. From the first riff you hear you know youre listening to excellence. The riffing the harmonies the songwriting the production everything fits like a glove on this album. This is some Maidenlevel shit. If you dont believe me listen to Prire de Satan and Desse du Crime and be convinced.In the more brutal corner we have a darkside thrash classicDestruction  Release from Agony. Hell yeah. After their amazing EP Sentence of Death Destruction made Infernal Overkill and Eternal Devastation neither of which really did anything for me... but then they made this! The most striking thing about Release from Agony when compared to the magna opera of those other two great Teutonic thrash bands Persecution Mania resp. Endless Pain is how technical and adventurous it is.  The riff on Incriminated the opening chords on Unconscious Ruins and those brighttoned shredding solos and harmonies all over the place... If Endless Pains strongest selling point is aggression and Persecution Manias is atmosphere Release from Agony has originality. Sign of Fear in particular reminds me of Despair a smaller German thrash band with a more explicitly technical style.In the last WHYBLT thread I complained about Darkness Descends that it lacked an Angel of Death an Agent Orange a Flag of Hate  one of those sweeping iconic thrash pieces that grab you by the throat from the start. Well Release from Agony has that the title track. It will get me! It will choke me! Screaming in my bed in agony! The fact that its preceded by one of the few instrumental album intros that are actually engaging in their own right is a bonus. All in all Release from Agony is an album I wont soon forget.Oh and I just cant stop staring at that cover art Very visually pleasing.Further into the brutal corner I found a gem of blackthrashDesaster  Hellfires Dominion. This is a good example of what makes blackthrash awesome the combination of black metals atmosphere and melodic riffing with the speed and energy of thrash. The result is  minutes of sheer unadulterated fun  the most fun Ive had with a newly discovered album in a long time. For several days after first hearing Hellfires Dominion I couldnt stop listening to it. My personal favourites are probably Teutonic Steel and Castleland but really every track is awesome.

5706366,0,t3_3ta80q,Revenge  Behold.Total.Rejection Couldnt pass up listening to the new Revenge although after a few spins Im still not sure how I rank it among their other efforts. Reads drumming is still out of this world and Vermins vocal performance is still vicious as ever but I still dont feel as strong attachment to this compared to Scum.Collapse.Eradication. Ill need to listen a few more times to make up my mind although I still feel the album is very solid.Nokturnal Mortum  Voice of Steel Probably their most recognized effort and arguably my favourite next to Lunar Poetry. Here NM expand their influences to incorporate some more blues folk and even the odd touch of prog rock to create some genuinely epic songs that invoke vast landscapes. I especially love the solos on this one. Favourite songs     Aosoth  An Arrow in Heart Aosoth never really caught my attention the way Antaeus did but I decided to give them another go since Ill be seeing them live in a couple of weeks. Aosoths approach radically differs from that of Antaeus who were more fastpaced visceral and raw. Instead Aosoth opt for slower tempos more guitar melodies and delivering a very haunting atmosphere. There were already hints of this in Blood Libels but its really fleshed out here. Overall really liking this effort and it makes me want to listen to the newest one.ampnbspGrimes  Art Angels Taking a break from NBBMN I decided to check out the new Grimes album. I really enjoy Visions back in  as I thought it was a decent and catchy dreampop effort. Here Grimes kinda goes full blown pop with the odd experimentation thrown in to mixed effect.

By that I mean the people who were very surface level in the early s but wanted to delve in a little deeper the surface level actual fans if you will would go classics gt power metal. Youd find them at Hammerfall and Dragonforce shows. Now however I think that crowd growing up goes classics gt Core. If we leave out our distinctions of what is and isnt metal and talk about Metalheads just as fans of heavy music I think its fair to say thats the popular route now for  year old Metalheads. When I was growing up however I saw through my sisters group that Power Metal played that role then. Blabbering on aside I just listened to a fuck tonne of Black and Im pretty stuck in that.

6141270,0,t1_cynoh2d,It actually is kind of an artist by artistsong by song basis. Some black is too lo fi for me some of it seems like a wall of noise from start to finish. For example a lot of bands just way overuse blast beats in my opinion. Blast beats in my opinion are better used as an accent. If upwards of  percent of the song has frantic sounding drums it feels a little like the song lacks perspective or a foothold to me. I also dont get the guitars a lot of times. Its often open tremolo picking from start to finish. Again I feel that has its place but is more appropriately one tool of many. As far as death metal its even harder for me to generalize about it because I know less about it and it seems pretty diverse. For example I love Opeth who doesnt?. Opeth is a good example of a band using all of its tools in my opinion. I can take a weird death metal segment when it is juxtaposed against something that sounds really traditional. It doesnt feel like Im listening to an hour of nonsense back to back. This is one of the most meandering posts I have ever written but long story short it kind of depends on the band. If it seems like it breaks all the rules for the sake of breaking all the rules I generally cant get into it. ,Metal,cynp571,1,t5_2qhud

I assume hes the guy who created them or something?It might just be because Ive never seen them live or any other video of them but they dont seem that offensive to me. Music wise Necronomidol may not be doing anything new or different but musically whats the difference between them and any of the many other bands doing s trad or OSDM worship. A lot of them arent doing anything new musically either but theyre well loved because theyre just redoing the old stuff that is well loved though like I said this is the only song Ive heard by them. Is it even normal for them to sound like this or did you choose one of their best songs or something? The way you describe them is starting to make me wonder do they actually have a backing band like babymetal because I dont think I saw one in the video or even a hint of any instruments. Usually even with good camera work trying to hide it part of an instrument or two still shows up.The more I read about why you dont like them the more I want to know about them. Do you know their history at all? What about their fans? How about their interaction with the local scene? Theres not too much information about them in english. My thoughts on these types of bands like babymetal or even metalcore bands is that its best to treat them like a sacrifice or a filter. They attract new potential fans but at the same time theyre there to soak up all the attention mainstream and pander to the nonmetalheads who will have no interest in metal. They keep the scene underground and protected from the mainstream but at the same time they keep a constant flow of new metalheads coming so the scene doesnt just die out but at a slow enough pace that it isnt completely changed by a bunch of new fans that have yet to learn anything about it. Theyre annoying but theyre a necessary evil thought having them actually play with underground bands could be a bit of an issue.,Metal,d00tv5p,2,t5_2qhud

No band is going to maintain that kind of creativity indefinitely. ,Metal,d0sqtrd,8,t5_2qhud
6853705,0,t3_49j9gf,Nachtmystium. Their early raw BM epsalbums were pretty awful derivative bland raw lofi stuff weve all heard too much by now. Around the Eulogy IV EP suddenly melody and actual songwriting start creeping in and then Instinct Decay comes along with clear nonmetal influences. By Addicts its almost industrialpostpunkrock mixed with black metal. Probably hated by the elitists but its one of their best albums IMO but Im a sucker for catchy songs.,Metal,d0t6c4d,1,t5_2qhud
6857487,0,t1_d0tgfq4,Yeah that was a huge change for the better but Im not a huge fan of A Life Once Lost primarily because of the vocalist. I like the music but when his voice gets thrown in? Ugh.,Metal,d0tlsc8,1,t5_2qhud
6861588,0,t3_49nr10,The couple weeks since the last thread have been hugely bountiful with a whopping  albums Im excited about talking about. Ill have to narrow it down a bit or Ill be here all day.Vhl  Deeper Than the Sky  This feels like the distilled essence of everything that Darkthrone has ever done well almost everything excepting their death metal debut seamlessly mixing black metal crust punk and traditional metal. I can think of no other supergroup which so thoroughly lives up to the promise of its membership. Outstanding performances on every instrument and fantastically enjoyable music that is simultaneously orthodox and cleverly inventive.Seven Sisters of Sleep  Ezekiels Hags  SSoS has two very solid albums behind them but I was not at all expecting anything of this quality. Its not as bleak bestial and misanthropic as say Primitive Man or Indian but theyre crossing more and more into that territory and theyre doing it brilliantly.Teramaze  Her Halo  Prog! I love prog metal but I dont come across a wealth of it that is especially good. More and more bands seem to be going in the direction of BtBaMstyle ideacollage and while I think that thats a perfectly valid way of approaching music it doesnt do anything for me. Stylistically Id say this is mainly in the vein of Threshold but far better. Excellent riffs but it rarely goes into fullon wank mode. The vocalist is masterful.Chtheilist  Le Dernier Crpuscule  Currently in my  slot and I think a very likely AOTY for me. Their prior EP and the comparisons to Demilich and Timeghoul in no way prepared me for something simultaneously so bizarre and enjoyable. Sound design? Riffs? Melodies? Vocals? Immaculate across the board each aspect displaying an incredibly broad range of ideas all of them extremely effective and many of them completely unlike anything I have ever heard. More surprising still is how fucking funky the album is largely due to the extensive use of slap bass. Other stuff Im really enjoying right now Jess and the Ancient Ones  Second Psychedelic Coming full on psyche rock rather than the heavy psyche of their selftitled debut not enjoying it quite as much but its still killer Obscura  Akrasis The rare awesome tech death album. Overcompressed as usual but not irredeemably so and the mix is excellent and the music exceptional Votum  Ktonik Polish prog metal one of the first few bands Ive heard that uses Tool influence in an effective and nonobvious way Kylesa  Exhausting Fire Yet another killer addition to their discography and this is the best one so far as far as making good use of having two drummers Destryer   Wildfire Not my favorite in their discography but still excellent and consistently enjoyable all the way through Omnium Gatherum  Grey Heavens Very much what youd expect from OG they dont seem to be pushing forward as much as they have on the last two albums. Still very good but Im wondering if theyre going to settle into a rut after this one Rotting Christ  Rituals So apparently this is their thing now. It still works for me because Im down with very repetitious music which this definitely is. I dig the atmosphere and energy of it but it does feel more like a collection of preludes than of proper songs and I wonder what would happen if they intermixed this style with their old melodic black metal approach.,Metal,d0u2jwh,7,t5_2qhud

6869282,0,t3_49t7gh,Finals week next week! For the first quarter in a while Im not at all worried going into them. My Dynamics class is structured so that its out of  with three exams two midterms and the final being worth thirty points each and the homework being worth ten points and the whole thing is scaled with  being a C  being a B and  being an A. The professor writes the exams to be hard enough that the class average comes out to a . That being said I got just over a  on both midterms  and  respectively which with my homework puts me right around autopassing the class even without taking the final into account. My other two classes are a GE that I currently have a  in overall and a thermo class that I have somewhere between a high B in and an A and which I understand more than well enough to not be concerned.Its really nice and kind of weird not stressing about finals and Im really happy about it.,Metal,d0uy00a,2,t5_2qhud

6946906,0,t1_d13ql11,A recent comment of yours  gtThere is a history of prominent metal bands letting their racism slip through their lyrics...and the still thriving neoNaziwhite power metal scene a big example being BurzumVarg Vikernes.  If you listened to Burzum youd know that Varg actually sees his political beliefs and the musical vision of Burzum as separate. None of his politics except some of his antiChristian ones come through in his lyrics.  Varg also hates metal and does not consider himself a part of the scene anymore white power or otherwise.  This isnt meant as a defense of Vargs politics. In fact the vast majority of fans who listen to Burzum dont like his views.

6982888,0,t3_4bcdni,The hardcore spinny kickers sometimes bleed over into metal shows.  That whole trend of roundhouse kicks and flailing your arms around started with the scenesters listening to metalcore and a lot of those kids just go see heavy music no idea whos playing and do their perverted hardcore dance because they like to.  It really takes just one breakdown in a metal bands discography to attract the first batch of swoopyhaired karate masters.As an aside I think the hardcore dancing is actually probably more dangerous than moshing.  The mosh pits Ive been in were generally just a group of dudes wanting to roughhouse not fight so they push and shove never actively try to punch or kick somebody.  When hardcore strut walk out there throwing their fists and feet in all directions recklessly the rest of us onlookers could get hurt.

7331913,0,t1_d2bjeql,gt My friends tried to track down some fruit and veg to buy themselves. Here is where I start to seriously doubt. Simply from US TV and movies supermarkets still stock fruit and veg surely. They told me that not only was it hard to find somewhere which sold fresh produce bit when they did it was either A overpriced or B prepackaged. They told me one time they just wanted some fruit found a packet of presliced apples. After finishing them they found a tub of caramel at the bottom they were suppose to have used. Disgusting.This sounds like a big city or tourist issue.  If the former its totally real but confined to certain areas generally poorer or very dense neighborhoods.  Food deserts are a thing and even if you can get to a grocery store you might find that the fresh produce amp dairy are super expensive while the cheap stuff is highly processed and nutritionally vapid.Plus for whatever reason maybe the midth Century trend in household goods and cooking? Americans tend to have a relationship of fear towards fruit and vegetables.  The way to make it less scary fat and sugar.  Cheese on broccoli sour cream on potatoes caramel on apples sugar on grapefruit ranch dressing on salads ....  gt They said that the bread in the states is sweetened to the point it basically tastes like cotton candy. Also certain regional cuisines Im thinking in particular of southern and Hawaiian lean more heavily toward the sweet and salty.  Sweet rolls are for real I find them too sweet most of the time but theyre a part of those cuisines.  FWIW Ive been told that the reason souther food is so rich and caloriedense is its history as food for working on the farmplantation.  Dont know if thats true but if so it would explain why the classic midwestern fare is also so rich.gt It came up when my friends had a photo taken together at Disneyland and behind them were two overweight people on motorized scooters. I laughed and said very American but each of those people were about as fat as anyone I had ever seen in Australia. I was told that whilst it wasnt the norm it wasnt unusual either.This varies by region with sad predictability.  Southern California is in general a fairly fit  skinny place.  When I lived there visiting my home in the midwest was always a shock suddenly all the people around me got fatter.  But even in the big coastal cities poorer areas have higher rates of obesity.  And in general the U.S. has a serious obesity problem as well as associated issues like earlyonset diabetes.  ,Metal,d2bl6tu,5,t5_2qhud

Southern. Southern food tends to have more fat and sugar with less vegetable and salad. You would get a different perspective from other parts of the country. If you do visit the US I strongly suggest that you prioritize the National Parks you will visit over the cities you will visit. A day in the Everglades is better than one at Disney World.

7391524,1,t1_d2i3ywg,Its probably because most people like popular things thats rather the definition of popular things but whenever people post their appreciation of said popular groups in rMetal you can guarantee that a few rmetal regulars will pop out of the woodwork to tell them that their tastes suck this band sucks and they suck.  I spend a lot of time on the various music subs on this site and rmetal is by far the whiniest the most negative and least welcoming out of all them.  Hell rindieheads has less than half the subscribers and a far more active userbase and while each sub has their own internal dramas over what isandisnt okay to like J.Cole is a regular drama magnet over at rhiphopheads way too popular for a lot of people to stand only rmetal lurches from one angsty existentialist crisis to the next at the thought that those people might be showing up.You get the sense that the overriding concern at rmetal isnt about spreading and developing appreciation of an art form so much as maintaining some peculiar version of social purity.  Sure you guys are nice if someone is asking about what you like and what your views are but if someone posts a Gojira or Children of Bodom or  heaven forbid  a Nightwish thread somebody is going to go out of their way to be a dick to them.  The regulars dont want a forum they want a fiefdom  a place where only a certain narrow band of tastes namely theirs dominate. Id suggest that the solution is to stop being dicks but I get the sense that a lot of people are so invested in being dicks and policing the boundaries of their supersecret club that its a lost cause to even suggest we tone down of the toxicity.  Still I can at least suggest that people be honest about the choice theyre making  either you want to spread the good word of metal to as many people as possible or you want to keep being a dick to ensure that those people never disrupt the purity of your secret club even if those people might have otherwise developed an elevated appreciation of the genre.,Metal,d2id735,-1,t5_2qhud

Its heavier parts definitely had a lot of power even if they were a bit simpler and flashier Heir Apparent or cheesy and Gothic Porcelain Heart. It also isnt ProTooled to hell and back like Ghost Reveries or Deliverance so it sounds like its actual people playing instead of individual notes dragdropped at the perfect time points. The prog parts were quite inspired and the expanded instrumentation mostly worked.Not my  Opeth album by any stretch but it deserves a place in my heart at least.

7982990,0,t3_4ofh9e,Metal and punk have always been intertwined. HellhammerCeltic Frost are a prime case of this as they were a mixture of Angelwitch Venom and Discharge. The amount of punks I know that worship that early Celtic Frost is quite large.The death metal scene in Sweden in the late s was influenced by both metal and punk quite a lot. Swedish punk was pretty huge at this time with bands like AntiCimex leading the pack. Bands like Entombed Carnage and Dismember have stated they were just as influenced by Autopsy as they were by the punk scene at the time.Napalm Death however is probably the best example of how closely related the genres are. Napalm Death formed as an anarchopunk band taking huge influence from bands like Discharge and even Crass initially. However the metal influences started creeping in soon and when you listen to Scum you can really hear how they took the blueprint of what Siege did and added a bunch of Celtic Frost style riffs to it. By the end of the s Napalm Death was instrumental in the death metal scene due to their active tape trading and subsequent musical shift seen on Harmony Corruption. If thats not enough of a give away just look at the artists they chose to cover over the years Husker Du AntiCimex Slaughter DRI Repulsion Kreator... quite an array of stuff! If you watch the interviews on the Live Corruption video they talk about the diverse amount of music theyre into including Swans and even the Cardiacs. Back in America I think Deceased is a great example of crossing the genres. Initially forming as a thrash band under the influence of NWOBHM bands they were not shy about being as ferocious as a punk band which helped them push themselves in to the death metal realm of extremity. Much like Napalm Death theyve covered a mass amount of songs by punk bands heavy metal bands and thrash bands. ,Metal,d4dd3hg,2,t5_2qhud

Build quality in general has improved in low end stuff in the past  years so they may be alright so I think you made a good decision for the price point.Amp looks interesting though I have never played that or anything similar.As others already pointed out I disagree with the Marshall only sentiment. Blackstar Orange   Peavy  EVH and tons of others are used by metal bands.  Most of the traditional guys use Marshalls to be fair and I use a Marshall speaker cabinet but there are options depending on what you like and can afford.Im a tube amp sucker well I play an Orange Tiny Terror which uses valves and solid state together because they are extremely fun to play. As you point out there are objectively problems with them but playing on a tube amp feels different. The volume control is different etc. and its just fun to tinker with Because of the inherent problems.  Definitely wouldnt recommend dropping the cash on tubes for a beginner though that money is better spent elsewhere.If you are playing daily and stick to a routine you are going to be shocked at how fast you learn and how much better you sound regardless of gear.

I can understand if you dont want to read metalsucks so Ill try to summarize their shoddy journalism. According to them K.K. Warslut said something mocking Danish men descended from vikings. That pissed off the crowd and one guy tried to fight him. Then K.K. saw an antifamask which Im not sure what theys supposed to mean but it pissed him off enough that he wanted the guy thrown out and tried to fight him. The roadies calmed him down someone threw a beer at him and pissed him off again. He responded by calling them pussies and at the end of the set said he hated the crowd before saying he was just kidding and loved them.,Metal,d585p8g,4,t5_2qhud

One day while riding to the airport I decided to look up Amon Amarth after hearing they were similar. They are not. Amon Amarth was my first introduction to death metal and they quickly grew on me and Dethklok was my second. Honestly Dethklok holds the trophy of my favorite death metal sound but Ive come to realize and have also been told that theyre extremely unique in their sound which is why its so hard to find similar groups.I just now pulled up Galaktikon on Spotify and my first thought  holy shit this sounds like Dethklok but with a manlier version of the singer of Symphony X instead of Nathan Explosion. Like this sounds so much like Dethklok at parts that if you were to play me an instrumental clip Id think it was Dethklok.

8799083,0,t3_50m6hj,A short story here about Metal computers games and nostalgia and bonus awesome soundtrack at the end and a game you should try at least once in your lifeI was a s kid from a third world country living in a small rural town so Metal wasnt really much of a thing here.When I was young I was a kind of whatever listener but I did grow up surrounded by great music in my family which I didnt fully realize until I was much older. My dad was the owner of a bar and a nightclub and he had boxes full of CDs full of rock like Van Halen Guns n Roses Pink Floyd Led Zeppelin Genesis Beatles etc yes they played that at the club and I missed that beautiful time in history.... We also had a couple vinyls the sound quality of those things amazes me even to this day.I did have one hobby since I was little gaming I got into computers since I was very young I started playing video games when I was  and by  I could handle a PC well enough and even better than some adults I started after Windows  so I got lucky there I didnt have to learn MSDoS. From that day I loved computers and now I almost have a degree in programming and computer science.Out of all the people my grandfather got me into gaming my uncle traveled a lot and was into tech and games as well so he got him a couple games for his new pc amongst them Warcraft and Doom and he fucking loved them!. My grandfather played those game a million times each he beat them on every single level of difficulty. A habit I got from him myself although I dont play the same game for more than a month since there are so many more to try.So Doom was the first game I ever played it was awesome and got me hooked into gaming for life. But many more games came by and I quickly stopped playing it. I grew up by  I got into Rock started playing guitar and then I got into Metal and thats when I said this is the music I was looking for my whole life!.Then one day years later I played Doom again I found a mod that was very popular called Brutal Doom it made the game faster and made it GORY AS HELL! and it featured as its soundtrack the many heavy metal fan covers of the original tracks. And then I realized how familiar some of the tracks were so I went looking and found out that the original game soundtrack was heavily inspired by metal bands Here some examples and I had that big Holy Shit! epiphany moment when I saw I listened to almost ALL those bands and those were some of my favorite tracks!.I dont believe in destiny and all that bullshit but man that was something else.If you like gaming and dont mind the outdated graphics try Brutal Doom with the metal soundtrack if you havent you wont regret it.Also here is a recent complete remake of Doom  OST by a very talented musician its SO METAL!,Metal,d75j2zh,3,t5_2qhud

8877730,0,t3_51txx4,gtMetal bands are much more homogenous and much less likely to have a unique voice? No less likely than any other genre man. Try to avoid statements like this.gt metal is also more prone to infighting and genre elitism.Metal isnt a single scene which is why youre seeing it that way. Its a loose grouping of connecting scenes with overlap ranging from heavy to almost nonexistent the same group of people jerking off say Amon Amarth and Sabaton are unlikely to be attending festivals such as Nidrosian Black Mass or Maryland Deathfest. The fact that theyre all associated leads to more contact than theyd have without the shared history of being metal and that leads to some of what youre seeing as infighting. Trying to group it all together the same way as a larger more homogeneous scene is ignorant.gttraditional NWOBHMNWOBHM isnt a genre its a movement describing metal bands formed in the United Kingdom during a certain sometimesdisputed time period I like to use  personally. That means that bands like Motorhead  who you should totally hit theyre the perfect melding of heavy metal and punk IMO and Judas Priest are not NWOBHM as they predate the movement. Venom Iron Maiden and Witchfinder General are all NWOBHM despite coming from different heavy metal genres. gtThrashAlong with the subgenre section of the rmetalwiki try Nuclear Assault and Holy Terror for some stuff with a lot of punk influence thats not actually crossover. Punk influence seems key to getting you into stuff.gtcrust punkTry out Sacrilege UK their demos and first album were pretty influential on a notable British death metal band Bolt Thrower and the first album is a killer bridge between thrash and crust. Its actually the backpatch on my vest.gtGrindcoreSince you like some bands that are a bit more death metal leaning in particular Napalm Death and Brutal Truth try out Terrorizer first album only Repulsion Impetigo and the first two Carcass albums. gtNWOAHMNot a thing. Avoid using the tag please. If youre just adverse to calling stuff like Killswitch Engage metalcore use melodic metalcore which is what that type of band is.gtMelodic death metal I have listened to and mildly enjoyed Slaughter of the Soul and Heartwork.Try earlier At The Gates Eucharists first album Arghoslent and early In Flames.gtdeath metalrdeathmetalwikiessentialsYoud particularly like Master Slaughter Ca DismemberCarnage mostly the same band and early Grave I think only Master is on that Wiki page.gtBlack MetalTry early Bathory and the two Darkthrone records before the one you hit. gtWas this read even mildly enjoyable or should I just stop here while Im ahead?Like other people have said you come across as a dick.

9019645,0,t3_53sgz9,Ive just been listening to Ghouls entire discography constantly this is the state of my recently listened right now theyre quickly climbing the ladder on my top bands!Ghoul  We Came for the Dead!!!  Official Album StreamI usually dont enjoy any sort of grind save for Napalm Death but this album is fucking killer Im not great at describing things technically but its just so heavy and when I enjoy something from a genre I dont usually enjoy I know its great.Ghoul  Maniaxe  Official Album StreamI hold the same opinion of this album as We Came for the Dead!!! almost more of the same but I definitely enjoy it more possibly because here is where the story starts to take off with the bands nemesis coming into play. Musically its more of the same drifting towards the thrashier territory.Ghoul  Splatterthrash  Official Album StreamThis is where I start really fucking loving the band as this is straight thrash metal with some surf sounding riffs here and there. Im definitely a fan of their newer material possibly because its a lot more accessible possibly because I just love this style of music regardless its just fantastic. Again storywise Im in love with it the rise of a cult dedicated to the nemisis The Ghoul Hunter as referenced in the last album to stealing a crystalline skull and toreconstructing a killbot with Walt Disneys brain whos sole purpose is to defeat Ghoul.Ghoul  Transmission Zero  Official Album StreamTheres nothing I dont love about this album just more straight gruesome thrash about cannibals whats not to love? Musically its similar to Splatterthrash and Dungeon Bastards although theres some exceptions in Morning of the Mezmetron it gets really fucking doomy another genre I dont listen to often but they kill it. Again the story is getting even more ridiculous as the cult has defeated Ghoul and brought fourth capitalism turning Creepsylvania into a christofaccist state however in the end our valiant heroes prevail!Ghoul  Dungeon Bastards  Unofficial Album StreamThis is the first album of theirs I heard saw a link here on Shreddit to a full album stream having no exposure to the band I decided to give the first song a listen end up listing to the entire album. Seriously how can you not get right into this For the next couple days after I had it on nonstop but didnt really pay attention to much of the lyrics nor the rest of their material like  months later I decided to give the rest a listen as I was on a thrash kick and now were here! Musically its as thrashy as it gets theres not much to say what I especially love about this album as well as the rest but most prevalent here are the different vocal styles used in each of the songs to represent different characters it keeps the album very fresh. Finally the story leads us the rise a tyrant from the ashes of the defeated cult from Transmission Zero the previous leader of the secret police Commandant Dobrunkum. Eventually this leads to a nuke being dropped on to the village and a dimensional rift releasing some sort of alien monster.I am getting just so into this band the music is fucking awesome the riffs are catchy as fuck the lyrics are downright gruesome at times and at others just hilarious and the story across all the albums are great. I love bands that have a overlying story and reoccurring characters I especially love it when I discover a new band and just get hooked for the last  days Ive listened to nothing but Ghoul save for when I saw Blind Guardian and Grave Digger on Monday.Seriously if you like thrash and the story of  cannibalistic mutants living through and directly affecting the transformation of their Romanian town Creepsylvania from traditional European village to christofaccist state to uninhabitable wasteland youll love Ghoul.Blind Guardian  Imaginations from the Other SideBeyond Ghoul Ive been listening to a good bit of Blind Guardian in preparation and after the show they played in London ON in which along with a good bit of the rest of their discography they played all of IFtOS. Whats there left to say about this? Its Blind Guardian just badass power metal about elves rings and shit. Seriosuly though it was an amazing show. this is the second time Ive seen them and theyre just so great live such a fun stage presence and an intense set I cant wait until they come back again!

9188892,0,t3_55ywbu,Ahab  This wellregarded Funeral Doom band is a new favourite for me.  All of their albums are concept albums involving the ocean and they use a combination of excellent lyrics and the music itself to build an immersive experience thats highly memorable.   The Call Of The Wretched Sea is a thing of beauty and terror much like the ocean itself.  In keeping with its Moby Dick theme it is delightfully ominous and it doesnt let up for a minute.  The vocals growl at you like some ancient beast slumbering in the depths while the heaviness of the instrumentation brings a feeling of claustrophobia and crushing hopelessness.  In spite of this the grim determination of Captain Ahab rings loud and clear.  I really love this album.   The Divinity Of Oceans is a different beast in a good way.  Where The Wretched Sea seeks to crush you under its weight Oceans has a more open sound which brings to mind the vastness of the sea.  It is a precise album very measured and deliberate.  The intermittent use of clean vocals and quieter passages works to create a feeling of desolation and helplessness invoking a sense of awe at the power of the ocean.  My fellow history nerds should note that this album was based on the wreck of the whaleship Essex  I thought it did a good job of capturing the desperation of the crew as they faced their ultimate fate.  Panopticon  An atmospheric black metal band with a lot of creativity using spoken word passages folkbluegrass influences and disharmony to create a unique sound.  One of the interesting things about Panopticon is the way they structure their albums.  They seem to enjoy following up a more gentle track or passage with a loud wall of sound.  Its as though theyre trying to lull you into a false sense of security just in time to blow your expectations and ear drums right out of the water.  This is most obvious on their album Kentucky which intermingles bluegrass tracks with fullon atmospheric black metal.  I wish I could be enthusiastic about these guys.  Theres a lot to like about them but something isnt working for me.  Its like being presented with your favourite sandwich only to realise that somebody forgot to add the mustard.  Its still good but you sure do notice that the mustard isnt there.   ...Speaking...  Man this song.  The buildup is slow pretty shimmering like still water.  The shimmering soon gives way to a more intense and distorted sound as the drums race like a heart beating out of control.  It feels like an anxiety attack.   And heres the banjo version  This is an excellent example of Panopticons creativity and skill with both songwriting and musicianship.  It sounds like a completely different song downplaying the intensity and anxiety of the original without losing any depth or complexity.  Makes me wish I liked their albums better.The Gentle Storm  The Diary is a twodisc album with an interesting concept The same songs worked two ways folk rock for the Gentle version and metal of course for Storm.  The Storm version combines elements of progessive folk and symphonic metal to craft an epic story about lovers separated by the sea.  Powerful female vocals strong drums and expressive strings work together to give the story drama and emotion without falling into melodrama.  This fairytale of an album is the kind that gets better and better with every listen.  The Gentle version is also worth listening to offering a less intense sound while remaining dynamic and engaging.  The best way to describe the contrast between the two versions is that Storm sounds triumphant as though the lovers expect to overcome all obstacles while Gentle is thoughtful with hope but no expectations.,Metal,d8grcn1,1,t5_2qhud

Just get any stereo receiver that has a button for PHONO which means that it has a preamp and will probably be much better than any built in one. I got a pretty decent Onkyo receiver for really cheap used at a flea market that works really well not to mention that I also use the receiver for my TV and main living room audio setup.

I still remember to this day how absolutely awful Origin was.  I have seen a lot of shitty bands but listening to them actually physically hurt and made me want to go home.  nonstop blast beats that were boring as fuck you couldnt make out anything the guitarbass was doing other than just generating noise and the singer...oh man the singer...he had two modes retarded sounding super deep vocals that you couldnt understand and sounded like what somebody trying to make fun of death metal vocals would sound like and then suddenly you would get a high pitched steppedonacatstail screech that would make the entire PA system feedback and go nuts and destroy everybodys ears.  More than any other band I have ever seen that I didnt enjoy Origin stands head and shoulders above them all.Nile and Arch Enemy sounded great and put on a great show.  Hate Eternal is really boring to me.  I WANTED to like them soooo much because of the ties to Morbid Angel who was my favorite band at the time...but I honestly never could get into them it just felt like boring generic death metal with no hooks or any new ideas.,Metal,d8t8nt0,2,t5_2qhud

Being in Canada a . album in euros or USD is closer to  for me so I have to be picky with what I get and order in. For example the new Saor is gonna run me  after conversion from . pounds the new krypts is gonna run me  from  USD. The conversion starts to pile up very quickly. On top of all that Im  a university student that needs to save money so if I can get into a hyped up band for free instead of  Im gonna go for it. Dont be so quick judge how people want to spend their money.A final point Ill make is that if i get into them for free now Ill probably support them financially in the future.  Cannabis Corpse did the same thing last year and I downloaded all their stuff for free and got super into them.

9342051,0,t3_58gdd0,Ive been trying so hard to keep up with new metal releases this year but not had the time to do so with other genres. What are your top  nonmetal releases of the year so far? Can be any nonmetal genre.Been watching Westworld  oh my giddy aunt is it great or what. For those not in the loop its about a technologically advanced theme park populated by hosts creepily lifelike androids. Visitors to the park are known as newcomers and can do  quite literally  as they please. Being a HBO series its usually something sexy rapey or stabby. Often a combo. That said it doesnt feel as deliberately titillating as say Game Of Thrones or True Blood. The violence towards the hosts is mostly portrayed in a brutally detached manner. Its often unsettling.The first episode blew me away with its world building and visuals. The concept of having the hosts run scripted narratives imagine NPCs in a RPG is fascinating especially when things go off script. Theres a nifty scene with a serial killer host that goes off piste and its gross. I also particularly enjoyed Anthony Hopkinss character  basically a dungeon master who is a little too attached or detached? to his creations.The whole series so far feels satisfyingly fleshed out. Theres a ton of things they can and probably will do and I cant wait.,Metal,d9067ij,3,t5_2qhud

Alright I understand that this may not be the scariest of costume albums but think of this as the guy that never really thought of coming as a skeleton rather just made a big tin foil box robot that looks sort of cool and has actual working lights and shit. Yeah alright. This is cool. Sacred Blade is interesting because this was really their first and last full length and to pull out the stops they also took on nicknames which included Jeff The Pilot Ulmer Paul Pol Davis James Zed Channing and Will Nascar Rascan. gtGoddammit Will we are going for a theme you cant be Nascar. gtI want to be Nascar Paul is Pol and that sure as shit isnt trying at least Nascar is cool. They probably have futuristic flying race cars in space. Have you been to the future Zed? Do you know? gtPol sounds futuristic you are just fucking with us. gtIts an anagram of my last name. How about that Pilot? gtFine whatever you can be Nascar. You are going to listen to this album because it is top notch heavy metal with stellar drumming and killer bass that is covered in tin foil that has whirling lights and shit.

Sweeping astral soundscapes blasting black metal walls of sound Gregorian chanting an acoustic closer with some desert flair. Urfaust just keeps getting better and better this is my pick for AOTY so far.Coke Bust  Confined   Just saw these guys at The Fest  in Gainesville and it was a trip. They sounded great live with some ripping guitar tones and interesting jazzy moments laced in with punishing noise and hardcore riffs and chugs. The production suffers a bit on the LP but hopefully they get better in the studio with time.Sepultura  Roots   Man it feels weird that somebody beat Numetal before it even hit its hayday. Like I feel like Numetal should have just ended with this album because of how good it is and how everything after looks like trash by comparison except for bands that evolved out like Deftones. The percussion is so topnotch digging into Samba tribal and other Mesoamerican styles the themes are riveting and feel deeply personal. The passion really comes through on this album.

9799595,0,t1_dakxm1u,Oh gotcha. Dystopia was a lot of fun. My hype levels were pretty high upon hearing each of the singles and while the full album didnt completely meet those levels each song except one Post American World was a very solid slab of heavythrash metal that made me think of a stylistic cross between Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. I thought Dave and the new crew had a good mix between the good new sound on records like Endgame and callbacks to classic material. I wrote a full review on the archives if you want to read more.As for Hardwired... well I havent formulated all my thoughts on it yet but Id say its split between  songs ranging from solid to killer along with  more songs that fall flat. However the strength of those seven good songs combined with my shameless Metallica fanboyness lands them a spot albeit near the bottom. I can forgive them the filler that almost completely comprised disc  in the face of great cuts like Hardwired Atlas Rise! and Spit Out the Bone.

The video featured the songs words pulsing to the music presented along with abstract geometric shapes an effect created by Bill Konersman.In  George Michael released Praying For Time as a lyric video. He had refused to make a traditional music video so his label released a simple clip that displayed the songs lyrics on a black screen.As for the ones you are talking about It can not be older than Youtube so  is a good place to start.

It is the first part of Portnoys TwelveStepSuite a collection of five songs written for five different albums about his recovery from alcohol addiction. Musically it was written after they saw Pantera and Megadeth IIRC and it shows. That fucking riff makes me want to bang my head harder than anything else Dream Theater have ever written.

10481992,0,t3_5q2o11,Overkill  The Years of DecayIve liked thrash for a while but Ive never really gone too in depth with it past the Big Four Sepultura Artillery Sodom and a few other bands.  I really enjoyed this album and I am going have to listen to some more of Overkill.  My favorite song from the album was probably Elimination pretty catchy gave off the best energy to me and felt the most thrash if that makes sesne.  Playing with SpiderSkullcrusher was impressive with its slower yet powerful tempo.  The riffs were a bit more complex than most of the thrash I have heard and provided a good different dimension.  Excited to hear more from them.    Sacramentum  Far Away from the SunFound this album through Dissection and it felt like a slightly more atmospheric version of Somberlain and Storm of the Lights Bane.  I mean that in the best way possible as I really enjoy both of those albums.  The lyricism may have been the best part of the album for me especially on Fogs Kiss and Darkness Falls for Me because they really helped create the menacing atmosphere.  The album art by Necrolord captures the evil perfectly. Iron Maiden  DiscographyI listen to a good bit of Iron Maiden every day but ever since the tour was announced and I got my tickets Ive almost been exclusively listening to them.  Im sure most people here have listened through all of their works so not too sure what can be said that hasnt been.  Ive been enjoying the Paul albums after never having been super into them.  Seventh Son and Powerslave are probably my two favorite albums still but they are just all amazing.  Iced earth  Night of the Stormrider Im not entirely new to Iced Earth having heard Burnt Offerings and Horror Show.  Night of the Stormrider was good although I think I preferred Burnt Offerings a bit more mainly because of Dantes Inferno.  A good concept album is always great to hear though especially one that is almost like a novel.  I thought some of the best parts of the album were actually some of the more melodic parts in the intro for Angels Holocaust and Desert Rain.  The transition from the somber melody of Desert Rain into Pure Evils intensity was awesome and made Pure Evil hit that much harder.  The riffing on the first few songs is powerful yet controlled and doesnt take over the whole song.  The solos were good but I felt like some of them like in Stormrider could have been a bit longer.  Ending in epics is something else Iced Earth does well again on Night of the Stormrider like on Burnt Offerings with Travel in Stygian as the rider makes his final choice for his fate.    ,Metal,dcw8q2z,5,t5_2qhud

In terms of Kreator Im a massive fan of these albums Enemy of God Violent Revolution and Phantom Antichrist. Gods of Violence feels like a great continuation of the sound of those albums. Totalitarian Terror and Side by Side are my top favourites right now but that may change after listening to the album again several times.I agree with a previous comment with Kreator having a melodeath side of them. As a fan of that genre I feel elements of it in Gods of Violence and I love that mix which makes them memorable to me.Looking forward to seeing them again later in Feb woth Soilwork.

Well what do you know The Ra Al Dee Experience is Mors Al Ra NCs mastermind on acoustic guitar and Ben Al Dee on udu The songs are alike the Gates on NCs albums beautiful compositions with that middle eastern inspiration ranging from soothing to very intense sometimes in the same song. Their only album so far Diatessaron was released last year by Vn and its based on a  demo available on bandcamp So beautiful while not exactly complex its riffs and chords are full of interesting little twists and turns. Ive been listening to these non stop while playing Starbound.DuofelOn the subject of acoustic guitars if youre a fan of the sound you should be listening to Duofel one of Brazils best kept secrets. Instrument mastery that builds up on latin jazz and mixes it to brazilian folk and Hermeto Pascoal worship to great effect. Completing  years on the road this year.Atlas ReactorThe other game Ive been playing its Atlas Reactor a TBS which is kinda like Final Fantasy Tactics vs XCom with a PvP setting. Trion has been trying to push it to the competitive moba market and while I dont care about none of that its still an interesting and quite addictive almost chesslike game.

Do you think its a good idea getting something like this? Or stick with getting an individual bass and an individual amp? How experienced are you with a bass? What was the first song you learned?

11504297,0,t1_dfzezd7,I should say its my favorite song since then. Of course those are classic songs and maybe its just that I got tired of MoP faster than kill em all. Im a huge fan of damage inc battery and thing that shouldnt be but I never bump anything other than the first and third album and I honestly like spit out the bone slightly just slightly more than the MoP tracks I like but maybe its just because its similar to my old favorites speed wise but is fresh. MoP was like my first metal album  years ago so I probably just got burned out on it haha. In justice for all is okay but I prefer upbeat songs and that album just oozes gloom which is a good thing artistically can really feel the mourning of Cliff just not something I listen to as regularly as the first three. Opinions are opinions after all lol. The older I get the more I like the simple but fast thrash songs like toxic waltz and troops of doom and of course as I mentioned metal militia. I can absolutely see why someone would love and justice though. The first four albums are absolute masterpieces but theres a difference between respecting the artistic integrity of something and enjoying it. I respect the witcher  but I couldnt get into it myself. I loved the frantic combat in bloodborne though for a gaming comparison. The older you get the easier it is to see a sort of universal opinion on things and understand why others like it but also have your own opinion without dissonance and shit.
