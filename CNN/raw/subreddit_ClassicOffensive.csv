10147476,0,t1_dbu7lav,its the first way to stop cheaters i never said that this is the final solution. serverside job is filter greefing players.yes it will be verified human based. Future aspect its my idea atm not final as well when u have improvements or want help let me know  when my plugins thinks we caught a hacker we will make a find a hacker game. so u can connect to the server where maybe the hacker is playing. after a time u have to choose from the playerslist  people who u think cheat. not only one will do that. there will also be a collection of mass data. when x people then choose the same person i think we can but him.,ClassicOffensive,dbu7w0g,1,t5_3g719
