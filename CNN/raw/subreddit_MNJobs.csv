9295574,0,t1_d8o1b9f,I get contacted by recruiters also all the time the market is extremely competitive for junior level people.  You can get a job if youre senior level but you are vastly underestimating how many people are applying as opposed to positions.  Theres demand in software lots of demand.  Then theres like.. x times the supply of that demand and that supply consists of mostly people with qualifications that dont match with the position.  Because theres soo many applicants theyre free to pick and choose instead of making exceptions.  Such as someone who has  years of experience?  They can reject him and look for someone with .  Because theres so many applicants.For every software developer that gets hired s..literally hundreds got rejected.  Dont believe me?  This is something you can confirm for yourself.  Theres lots of jobs but it is so easy to find something overseas remotely for cheaper or more experienced.  I remember seeing someone with  years java experience get hired at a junior position lmao.  Unless youre better than other developers its all luck based.  And you can not be better than other developers unless you actively work a job for years.,MNJobs,d8ua45d,1,t5_2suol
