I suppose it has just been very difficult to really get things together or to find proper and adequate help.I find that with health issues and especially mentally health is that many professions even are still very biased and sort of uninformed. Its sort of an issue for me I think to wonder or worry if I really have brain damage sometimes.For example I have been experiencing some mild memory issues that dont effect my functioning too much but ability carry out tasks at work which really scares me. Im just all fucked up beyond belief.
