His life began shortly over two decades prior to the mishap that led to his landing on the strange Forerunner planet. The KigYar was about  tall average for a Jackal as humans called his species. He had little armor only what was necessary. His head sported a tactical laser sight like most KigYar marksmen. This amplified his sight in one eye allowing him to shoot with precision. His head was nearly bald though he did have five or six quills which reached back from his head each ending in a light purple color.During his life Flur had learned many things by hunting through the jungles of his homeworld. His accuracy with a Covenant Carbine or Beam Rifle was unmatched by most around him. Also his thievery and agility were very good assets. There were many times where his family relied on his talents to obtain their meals. Besides his family and close friends he rarely spoke unless he was making a deal with straggling nomads of many different species across space. To Flur life was about getting some nice coin to bring home to his family. This led him to many colonies in search of work or treasure. He had made many acquaintances in areas such as the Rubble the site of one of the many battles between humans and the Covenant. Now he was on this strange Forerunner planet.Ill continue this in a bio post!,HaloRP,cuxaqvt,2,t5_35r2l

9464404,0,t3_5adp3r,We do but both DMs got busy and since they were the central push I personally found it hard to push it forward.  Although we the mods do know the end goal so thats laziness on my part.  I think t was the advent of school and work for most people its hard to juggle it all then have energy to put in here. BUT this has happened before in the last storyline before the endgame started.  We were running around with our heads cutoff but came together and came out strong and went in even stronger to the next storyline.  I think it will be worthwhile to remember these times for when we plan the next storyline or revamp this one if it gets that bad as it seems we need to give more freedom to the general users instead of limiting the power to DMs and the few active mods.  So to try tie this all together we will push forward people have more free time as the holidays creep up and hopefully we can come back strong.
