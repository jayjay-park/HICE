I believe this will work because a he will know signs to look out for b you will become closer and have better communication c you wont feel so alone as he will know everything.Unless he knows it all and just how bad it is he will feel helpless so he needs to know it all to understand and therefore get a better idea of how best to help you and support you.

1232703,0,t3_27wv7m,Sometimes some eating disorder behaviors actually precede the condition and last long into recovery. For example before I developed AN I still spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about food  it was fascinating to me to see what kinds of food people kept in their houses all the different types of food in grocery stores etc. So I guess Ive always been a little obsessive about it. I now consider myself fully recovered after four years but I still find comfort in looking at food in grocery stores looking up images of food etc. It might not be normal but I am otherwise healthy and recovered.Recovery is a long and complicated process. It might also be that you are more tuned in to problem behaviors at this point in your recovery.Anyway I am an ED mentor and I think that if youre finding the relationship positive and helpful then you should continue.

It WILL resolve itself without treatment it will get better as her electrolytes come into balance again and that takes weeks or longer.The body is a very delicate system and if we dont nourish it things get out of balance.The body can only absorb so much at once. This is why someone with say anemia doesnt recover overnight. The person has to take iron supplements for weeks or months to recover because the body can only take in so much at once. It is the same with all sorts of micronutrients.

1814499,0,t3_2fbi27,The most common advice given here are validation techniques. You should check those out. Basically when they start expressing their feelings and thoughts about food validation techniques are just repeating what they say in different words. Gives a sense of security in my opinion because it feels like someone is actually listening instead of people giving me a type of advice like you should eat because then for me itd feel like they arent really listening or they just dont understand. If shes expressing things like I skipped my dinner you should definitely not react in terms of telling her to eat or anything like that it usually has a reverse effect. I think you help her best by being a listening ear and using those validation techniques. Anything else such as actually recovering should be handled by a professional.   If after  years she finally starts contemplating recovery thats already a huge step. Just be there for her even when she relapses cause that is definitely something that can happen. ,EatingDisorders,ck7tu4q,2,t5_2qpcj

I was there for a dual diagnosis with substance abuse so thats why TK was the best choice for me.  At least when I was there though there was a LOT of frustration with the administration and general lack of organization sometimes but I suspect that may have something to do with your particular lodge rather than TK as a whole.

2076794,0,t3_2imlly,If you are looking for peace of mind here is a reply I made earlier to someone with depression. Hope it helpsI dealt with difficult depression for many years. What helped me was to recognize that when my body got tired my mind went negative and depressed. It took a lot of cognitive therapy on myself to change the thought patterns. Dialectical Behavior therapy could work too. I did this on myself with selfhelp books and journaling and a lot of meditation. Its not an easy path but I did uproot depression.It may be hard to see that a tired body may be connected with depression. It may not be the case with you but see if it is. Know that you dont have to believe every thought that comes up. Depression just likes to be depressed. It doesnt want to initiate change. See if you can separate the negative thoughts from your intentions for how you want your mind to be. It isnt ignoring or denying the thought patterns its just saying they are not the course you want to take. I probably learned to start to think this way through Transactional Analysis again on my own but a therapist can help too. Heres the Wikipedia article on it but its rather complicated so below is a summaryBasically consider three inner voices that of child playful or rebellious parent nurturing or authoritarian and adult balanced and centered.  The childs voice is like this I want to ride my bike I dont want to work and I want to do it now. The parents voice is often like this I should do my work I shouldnt play around. The adults voice is the balancing one I can go biking for  minutes then get to work. Or Ill work for an hour now then go biking. First its helpful to identify the voices and all are valid. Valid does not mean they have to be listened to. Sometimes I listen to the childs voice sometimes the parents and most often the balancing adults voice. There are many techniques for rewiring the mind in a healthy way and its really worthwhile. Here is another similar approach an article on understanding inner scripts and changing themIts not easy overcoming depression but it is some of the most important work Ive done in this lifetime. It is possible. One last thought. The media makes us think we have to do or be to have selfworth and that if life isnt always exciting its just depressing or something. Life can be simple and easy it doesnt have to be a thrill a minute nor does it have to be filled with lots of doing. Consider what really matters to you whats really important what do you value in others such as kindness generositiy honesty and consider making those the foundation of a life well lived.,EatingDisorders,cl3t0l6,1,t5_2qpcj

My parents vouched for me that Id been a vegetarian since long before the ED started and that forcing me to eat meat would be detrimental to my recovery.

Ive never received a single message or comment from ANYONE judging me. Most people think Im super brave for being so open. Not saying you need to be this open at all but just trying to put it into perspective that just the act of going to therapy isnt going to ruin your social life. Promise. Shitty responses to your parents abuse? Im sorry about that. My sister is abusive and when I bring it up people always raise an eyebrow. Heres the thing about abuse no one elses experience matters but your own. Your parents have deeply and repeatedly hurt you and its causing you depression. That is totally acceptable! If people cant see that or dont want to hear about it then their loss. Your therapist will be ready and willing to talk about that kind of thing with you without any judgement. The other thing is that you dont have to share any of this with anyone except a therapist. Thats what I love about therapy.

I believe that eating disorders should only be diagnosed by a professional but these are all very unhealthy signs and disordered behaviors. Restrictive behaviors and a severe fear of weight gain leading to stress and sadness about body image can be a lot more dangerous than poor selfesteem.I understand not wanting to talk to your mother but her having her own struggles might make this a more comforting conversation as she may understand. She is just going to want you to be healthy.If you do not feel comfortable talking with her I strongly suggest calling your doctor and going for your own visit and discussing what your patternsbehaviors are and your fears of weight gain.

I know how tempting that can feel and the push and pull you might feel. Im going to try to trust my counselor and stick with the recovery process and thats probably what Id encourage you to do. Dieting will likely lead to bingeing and probably gaining more weight.

7165195,0,t3_4dmpg5,I dont know of any studies but the defining difference between the two is this body dysmorphic disorder revolves around the physical reality of the body not lining up with the bodyowners perception of said body and anorexia nervosa revolves around controlling food intake.  Note revolves around the victims and yes I do consider people stricken with these illnesses to be victims of them ultimate compulsions are what clarify the condition.Keep in mind there is no psychiatry law that says the two conditions cant be comorbid as the most depressing porqu no los dos? comorbidity between body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders is quite high.  The typical treatment for the two conditions is a little different but they arent incompatible by a long shot.At the end of the day though condition names are there to make it easier to explain whats going on in one to two words rather than thousands they are by their nature reductive.  When it comes to a real live person whos having difficulties with their bodies and food quibbling over what name or names to give those problems doesnt change the fact the person has difficulties.

A few years of being a bit overweight whether that means actually overweight or a higher weight than you are used to  comfortable with wont kill you  but your eating disorder will. Try to focus instead on qualities and interests beyond your physical appearance. Are you a great artist? poet? Do you have a passion for helping animals or kids? lean in to those and use them to bolster your selfworth.

The criteria are helpful in terms of identifying what type of eating disorder someone has to help with treatment etc but in terms of thinking about whether you need help or not a looser definition is better because while you might not have an eating disorder you might need help with self esteem around body image food etc. Im really sorry youre going through this. By the loose definition I just gave I would say you might not have an eating disorder you should see a counsellor about self esteem body image etc. Look for online or phone counselling services if money is tight or try to see an irl counsellor if you can get subsidised visits or can afford it.Hope youre ok OP. ,EatingDisorders,d87x8q6,5,t5_2qpcj

Thats at the high end but every study Ive seen has found comorbidity to be very high. I have met many people with eating disorders I had one and my daughter had one. I have never met someone with an eating disorder who did not also deal with one or the other to some extent.To say one is the cause of the other oversimplifies things. They reinforce each other. In  a famous psychological was run at the University of Minnesota to study the effects of semistarvation on healthy volunteers in order to assess the effect of expected food shortages in postwar Europe. Even these previously healthy volunteers developed depression at a high rate. Combine this with the fact that eating disorders typically begin when the sufferer attempts to deal with emotional pain with eating behaviors  you have a very dangerous mix.We put this really good paper in the sidebar that gives suggestions on what you can do to help a loved one. Its a good start. In youre friends case I worry about one other thing and Im a little hesitant to bring it up but its something we all need to talk about.
