I havent thought about that whether or not he is a Marxist for a long time. I havent really read as much of Marx as I should have done. Ive read quite a bit but not that much. And I think Marxs transition of history and the analysis of how you go from feudalism to capitalism and move on to a different stage is fascinating. So we all owe something to him. Probably inside you even you do.gt gt He was essentially a fascinating figure who observed a great deal and from whom we can learn a great deal.gt gt Im not talking about the Labour Party being a revolutionary party. It certainly isnt. What were doing here is putting forward a view that the Labour Party has to offer a credible alternative that is true to the roots of the Labour Party. The roots of the Labour Party are essentially democratic essentially socialist essentially community. What we were offering for the past   years has been essentially austerity lite essentially cuts.Corbyn seems to have read Marx understands the influence and importance of his writing both upon himself and the world but clearly isnt willing to align himself with that specific doctrine. So if you want a oneword answer I think it is no.As for why he didnt say he wasnt a Marxist perhaps he overestimated the intelligence of some viewers who seem to want to pigeonhole his politics via simple yesno answers.I like Corbyn a lot but he needs to learn that nuanced replies dont work when the rightwing press or certain Redditors just want to point and screech A MARXIST! HES A MARXIST! I cant speak for Corbyn and nor can anyone here so I dont really know why youre pursuing this tedious line of questioning but from his answers I inferred that his politics are less Marxist than democratic socialist. He was fairly clear about that but maybe not clear enough for the likes of you.But hey instead of nagging random Redditors for answers why dont you reach out on Twitter or email and ask Corbyn himself?Disclosure Ive read the Communist Manifesto. I thought it was fascinating. I think Marx was a revolutionary thinker. He was certainly influential. Do those things make me a Marxist? No.,LabourUK,ctho7ly,2,t5_30c1v

5013323,0,t1_cuqaemj,gt Whose handwaving the economics? Modern Monetary Theory has its critics that doesnt automatically make it a cripplingly idiotic idea like pretty much every economic theory some economists support it and some dont those who do support it arent idiots just because you disagree with them. Your appeal to authority proves nothing.Theres an immense economic consensus against MMT Monetarists and NeoKeynesians have been slamming it for ages now. I know you might not think the appeal to authority is valid but then again you probably think Marxism and planned economies are valid so rejecting economic theory is beneficial but you doing the reverse and saying some economists agree with me therefore its not stupid! isnt any better. MMT would cause immense inflation and foregoes some of the most basic foundations of economics weve known for centuries.gt Its appealing to the left because its another way for the government to use its power to help people rather than sitting back and letting them suffer. Ah yes of course unless you want to just print money out of nowhere and cause massive inflation thatll hurt everyone you want to sit back and let people suffer. Is hyperbole the only type of argument the Corbynites have or? gt Lets say problems in China or the Eurozone tip us back into recession combined with deflation. What are we going to do then to help the economy? We cant lower interest rates any lower because they are already as low as they can go which should signal to you that our supposedly recovered economy is operating far from normally as it is.We engage in economic stimulus via borrowing and lowering interest rates which would cause some inflation but small amounts of inflation is positive if theres another recession this is what Gordon Brown did and this is not what Corbyn is proposing. Corbyn is proposing literally just printing off the debt which would cause rapid inflation and probably propel us well into the double digits over the course of a few months whichll hurt the economy even more and end up killing growth. Good job once again assuming that unless you believe everything Corbyn advocates youre an evil poorhating elitist Thatcherite though.gt Traditional QE doesnt help ordinary peopleTbh I dont think any of you people even knew wtf QE was until Corbyn started talking about it. The reason QE works like it does is because private banks have a market interest in lending responsibly whichll mean a return on their investment which wont mean bad inflation. The state or state forcedlending doesnt generate the same effect because the state doesnt bare the same risks on investment returns. Check out the German stateowned Landesbanken that constantly default on loans given out solely for political reasons. Economics hurts I know.gt and borrowing is politically unacceptable and causes us to rack up interest paymentsAh the paradox of Corbynism we know that borrowing more and paying huge amounts of interest doesnt work maybe this is why Labour has not been campaigning against austerity because we understand this.... politically or economically so what will we do? Just print money and pretend thatll work because reality hurts too much.gt Why not use peoples QE in such circumstances to stimulate the economy? Because of worries about inflation when its already zeronegative?Peoples QE is a pretty shitty propagandistic term anyway itll hurt people more than anything. You have to understand that the inflation generated by low interest is singledigit inflation which is generally not too bad although right now I will credit the Conservatives on helping people with their savings problem is not many normal people have any if Ed had won then our predistributionary platform would be helping fix that. What Corbyn is proposing printing and printing and printing well into the billions would cause massive inflation like were talking into the doubledigits. Do you know a country thats doing what Corbyn is proposing? Venezuela.

It needs to be in every PMQs in every interview  the NHS is not safe it is being dismantled etc etc. They need to talk about this and NOTHING else. Any members in his own party that dont fall in line need to be drowned out by people outside his clique. If he can get moderates to hammer the NHS point and silence people like Woodcock in the process then Labour can start turning things round.Ignore Trident security etc  these are all things that theyve already failed on they need to change whats being discussed and reverse the apparent decline in the polls.

Those guys are clearly nicer than the twats we have in Westminster Id choose Brussels over Westminster any dayThe people in Westminster will change as will the people in Brussels... Surely the solution is to make sure that we have the ability to follow through on our commitments to the electorate not hope that the EU might be a little to the left of whoever happens to be in Westminster. Because at some point they wont be especially as things are going.I suppose Im eurosceptic because Im sceptical of the notion that a quasi democracy of  million people is actually going to operate in my interests.. Its bad enough at the moment with a Tory government but at least we can fight that and any failures are to some extent our own. Applying that to the EU turned it into adifferent scenario altogether even with subsidiarity the direction of travel is unsettling.Id rather see the UK improve its democratic institutions and convince UK voters of what kind of government they want than hope that the EU might mitigate the worst of what happens here and know that there is no chance that we can effect change at that level.

The Lib Dems said at the time theygt agreed with quite a lot of the governments proposals but more attention needed to be given to getting the balance right.Also the principle of a minimum wage can easily be argued from a liberal perspective since it hands power from the market to the individual in economic terms. Its not an exclusively Labour idea and Im pretty sure the LDs voted for it in .All Im pointing out is the places where the Lib Dems and Blair would have agreed. I think he has more in common with them than people in his own party like Corbyn for example.In another universe where there was PR and Blairs New Labour Corbyns Old Labour and Ashdowns LD were competing in  Im sure Blair would have preferred a coalition with Ashdown to Corbyn.I think this is an interesting thought experiment and Im not trying to offend which I feel like I did with my first post.One thing to consider however is that the Lib Dems and Labour might be worth forming one party in the future if both parties do badly in .

7825122,0,t1_d3v05o5,My analysis and feeling is that just after Labour lost you had people like Mandelson and others giving off the feeling that  was lost anyway... and that the  front runners were not even going to be leader by . It was just picking a leader for the time being or as someone to take the fall as it were.Now if you give the impression that something is lost before it happens then people surely go well might as well pick what we really feel with our heart rather than our head. If you are told that you need to vote Burnham to win but the entire mood before Corbyn was that Burnham couldnt win anyway then it just feels like a lie.I think that if Labour had started the contest in a more confident manner focusing on a few things they could do rather than the many they felt they couldnt UKIP Scotland England... impossible to win all  then I think Corbyn wouldnt have won. ,LabourUK,d3vlza0,1,t5_30c1v

If you object to the ultimate destination of the EU surely it is best to disentangle yourself from it as soon as possible?

The slow tide of ever closer union marches on Id say the development of our economy over the past  away from a mixed industry towards oversized and volatile financial services in the South East is a sign of what is to come  that is to us the British isles being a mere periphery of a wider European state with no need for economic diversity.

The shadow cabinet had arranged to meet to discuss it. Before they met Corbyn sent them all a letter saying he was never going to back the military action on matter what. I appreciate obviously he has his own views as any other MP or leader has but there was literally no discussion. He didnt know if the shadow cabinets opinion on it he just wrote to them in advance and basically ruled out supporting the military action. You may or may not agree with the stance but that is no way to run a cabinet.So then he is forced and it was forced into a free vote. They tried to put a three line whip in place and the shadow cabinet made clear they could not force them to vote against military action against ISIS. The vote happened and actually a majority of MPs voted with Corbyn but a lot still voted to take action in Syria.How did Corbyn follow up this free vote? By trying to sack Hilary Benn and actually sacking other MPs that voted in favour of the action. So his free vote was not only forced but also not free. So n not only did he refuse to discuss the issue with them when he told them one thing he then went and did another.Now if we look at the post the other day on this sub which the entire mod team verified as from a trusted source hes walking into shadow cabinet meetings reading out prepared statements ignoring everything thats said and then closing the meeting. This is NOT a man you can work with and it also shows being on the shadow cabinet means nothing he doesnt respect the shadow cabinet or the concept of cabinet decision making. To say Ah well they resigned instead of working in the cabinet with him they tried the only way they could have tried harder is if they literally threw their political conscience out of the window and just did everything Corbyn said and I thought Corbyn got so much support because he exactly refused to do that. Of course Corbyn didnt quit what could have been a fruitful coalition hes the sodding leader! Show me once where Corbyn decided to work with Blair in a fruitful coalition and Ill believe you this is about the PLP and not Corbyn.

Ad hominem only applies if Im bringing up an irrelevant fact like You cant trust him Scottish people lie. The fact hes Scottish has no relevance the fact hes proven to have a bad track record at these things is.

Its almost as if they want to be defined not according to any real criteria but according to political expediency! Now the terrain has shifted a little to the left theyve got to claw back some leftwing credentials  not through god forbid left policies but by trying to move the definitions.In my view agreeing with core planks of the Tories programme on for example austerity and welfare does indeed make you a bit a like the Tories and of course giving over to the foundations of Thatcherism was the raison dtre of Blairism. How much so? Thats a reasonable dispute.

He also didnt renationalise the railways and made the PLP entirely unrepresentative of the membership with parachuting in Oxbridge PPE graduates that stuck to the line and had limited political ability which has helped screw us since  see Cooper Kendall and Burham as the choices to lead the party last year. He left our party rather fucked economically and beholden more so to big business. He broke the UN charter got into bed with a rightwing Republican and lied to parliament normalised it as a process. Id also add the target culture that tries to run the NHS and schools as a business when theyre not. Without a value for them as he tried to put a number on everything such is the mantra of Thatcherism. I could honestly go on. Not to mention he opened Pandoras box over academies and tuition fees and the Tories now have a chance to say Labour did it now we can go further. We know what the Tory party represents and Blair has given them every chance to fuck with education in that regard.Blair may be better than Major and not personally as Major was a lovely man and Blairs current reputation speaks for itself Cameron and Thatcher.

Its my view that the broader electorate arent always right and we need an opposition that wont bend to popular demand on any given issue.gt For instance Brexit shows us that the average Briton wants closed borders and hates immigrants. It was obvious from the outset that this wrong and a bad idea but despite warnings they voted for it anyway. They seem still to cling to thins even if it bankrupts the country.gt Labour needs a Leader who wont just say anything to make the right headlines or to appeal to the lowest common denominator.gt I dont believe that Owen Smith would be willing to stick to his guns and push for policy that offends readers of the Sun and the Daily Mail.I think the overriding principle here is that anything Labour offers must go beyond slogans.  Richard Murphy an economist Corbyn respects and has quoted before was pretty damning of JCs leadership on this basis.That is the danger of populism.  It uses phrases like antiausterity but dont have the plans to back them up. It says Big Pharma companies shouldnt do research and then its pointed out that there simply arent the resources in the public sector to take over and the policy becomes immediately discredited.  It says nuclear weapons are bad we must scrap Trident and then doesnt say how we would get other countries to get rid of their nuclear weapons.Of course this doesnt mean any of these populist policies are bad or against Labour values.

8444999,0,t1_d5x1n25,You cant be antiausterity when you have a  budget deficit as was the case in . Saying that even Corbyn isnt antiausterity even if he calls himself that. McDonnell supports balancing current spending which is currently in deficit by around  of GDP and by next year will be in deficit by around . To cut that deficit requires budget cuts or tax increases i.e austerity. So they can keep waxing on about being antiausterity but theyre about as antiausterity as Osborne the builder was proinfrastructure spending i.e. not at all. So if they mean what they say theyre not antiausterity. But do they? This is a big problem for Labour at the moment  economic competence. Owens last speech had NHS spending increases of  pa in real terms at a cost of  billion pa by  if introduced in this parliament public sector pay freeze removal and all he had to pay for this was a wealth tax that isnt a wealth tax and will only according to him raise  billion plus an increase of the top rate to  which we know will also only raise a billion or perhaps even less. He wants to reverse corp tax cuts which will save . billion by . Change in inheritance tax will save  billion. Cant find anything much about capital gains in the summer budget only change will save  milion. No doubt he also wants to remove changes to welfare spending that will cost billions too. How is he paying for this? Seemingly hes not which means the deficit will balloon. I agree with their basic principle i.e. balance current spending and borrow to invest. The  billion infrastructure investment scheme makes sense. But they need to balance current spending which means cutting the budget that or large broad tax increases basic rate VAT. This isnt antiausterity and being so is an impossibility while current budget deficits are so large. Trying to suggest otherwise is just being dishonest with the public and theyll see through it. ,LabourUK,d5x5vht,3,t5_30c1v

8462753,0,t1_d5yi2vj,I think thats a very easy and nullifying way of looking at it. Calling it a cult does nothing but hand wave away any further explaination of why Corbyn is so popular with Labour membership and shut down any genuine discussion of what is a complex phenomenon.Essentially Its a cult thats it theyre all deluded no further explaination required. Look at the silly idiots getting passionate about the wrong kind of politics haha Quite patronising really not to mention naively simplistic. I voted for Corbyn in the last leadership election and Im undecided on the next one. To me at least Corbyn isnt charismatic hes not flash  or even the best of orators. The reason I voted for him is because of what he stands for a real alternative to Tory austerity or Centrist austerity Lite. Whether you agree with his politics or not he represents a significant change from the status quo perhaps  even the only significant politician to offer that change in any real degree. Perhaps this is part of the backlash against the status quo along with Brexit. His strain of politics is very different from the centrecentreright politics weve had for the last few decades and whether you agree with it or not that change from the status quo is very attractive for a lot of people especially those that have been failed for years by stagnant wages reduced prospects and extortionate house prices. Sure theres going to be some supporters who think he can do no wrong and follow whatever he says like the word of God but Id suspect the majority of people who side with him just want a change from the stale politics of the last  years and see him as the only option to do that reliably within a major party.Perhaps a lot of them even see it as a trade off between a mediocreflawed leader that will offer real change or a spit polished media friendly one that wont.  It seems for many theyre willing to accept Corbyns flaws in order to get that change. Far from a blind cultish worship that its convenient for opponents to label it as. For me Im undecided as to whether Corbyns flaws are starting to outweigh his promise of change or whether Smiths promise of change is good or legitimate enough to make him the better option. ,LabourUK,d5zdpf5,3,t5_30c1v

Blair put a smiley face on neoliberalism but kept its core principles intact slash corporation tax engage in corporate lobbying dont renationalise and instead begin privatising new areas fight trade union rights court the rightwing press etc. All that carried over from Thatcher and in some cases expanded under Blair. Its no coincidence she saw Blairs New Labour as the Conservative Partys biggest success. The commitment to a neoliberal economic model led to a rise in inequality. Poverty among some core demographic groups didnt get better and sometimes got worse. But Blair did things like increase net public spending when you dont take social security into account introduce the national minimum wage etc. So as I say it put a pretty face on neoliberalism. As for the Section  repeal  thats a liberal move but not essentially left or right. ,LabourUK,d6213ds,1,t5_30c1v
8486206,0,t1_d62ba3d,No I get your argument but you must not get mine!I agree that Blair was better than the Tories. What Im saying is that no one really supports Blair because of Iraq. Not because they all blindly hate him although obviously distaste for them an plays a party but also because Blair toxified his own achievements through Iraq. The finding of Chilcot cemented criticism of the Iraq war as legitimate and mainstream not just baseless criticism.gtOnce the left of Labour started demonising the Blair and Brown regimes it was inevitable.I am saying this isnt true. What made it over was the invasion of Iraq. More than anything else that damaged Labours reputation. It wasnt just the far left moaning the far left moans all the time and no one listens. The mainstream media much of the establishment all MPs who didnt support the war a lot of MPs who did support the war etc. Nearly everyone thinks the war was completely wrong except Blair.The left of Labour are always going to have disliked Blair as you say. The only reason that dislike goes beyond the left of the party to the centre and then beyond the party is because of the invasion of Iraq. Most of the other things people criticise him about are either a bad criticism b good criticism but the kind of argument that is irrelevant for the average voter.gtThe issue with Blair in a holistic sense is that the left abhors him for more than Iraq. He was also viewed as a traitor not for being promarket but for making it work. When somebody in Labour is making Britain a better place by way of probusiness policies its a huge slap in the face to the hard left  because they didnt leave the poor behind in the same way the Tories might.This is pretty much irrelevant though. Even if the far left adored him they wouldnt have had much impact. Blair ruined his own legacy. The far left would have you said still criticsed him without Iraq but no one would care just like when the far left moans normally. It was Blair invading Iraq that caused the dislike of him to be beyond the fringe.gtAnyway at this point Blairs reputation cannot be saved because his own party has destroyed it. Not that Corbyn would as he obviously carries a deep antipathy towards Blair. Blair destroyed it through his own actions. If Blair hadnt invaded Iraq he would be remembered by most as a good PM although the far left would still hate him. The reason it went beyond the far left is because of Iraq. Therefore it isnt reasonable to say it was down to the left or anyone but Blair doing something so misjudged it overshadowed his positive achievements. One of the only things Corbyn did that most people praised him for and polled really really well was apologising for the war. It is like you want to live in a world where Blair would be remembered as a good PM or be viewed in a nuanced way. Well the average person is rarely nuanaced when judging political leaders. And to be remembered as a good PM Blair should not have invaded Iraq. You could wave a wand and make the far left dissapear from Britain in  and Blairs own actions would have seen him equally disliked and his positive traits forgotten. You are creating a boogeyman to blame. In reality even if everyone in Labour defended Blair it would have just been seen as defence of Iraq and we would be crucified for it by far more people than we annoyed by apologising.,LabourUK,d62blhc,6,t5_30c1v

Then there was the bomb in Manchester. The fact nobody died in that is astonishing.One of my relatives was meant to be at work in London on the Saturday the London City bomb went off. He would have fallen more than a dozen stories to his death if he had been in instead of at his sisters wedding he worked for a major bank in the City. The emotional breakdown he suffered meant his family was destroyed not long after and perhaps quite independently he now lives as a woman.Just because you didnt see this shit up close doesnt mean nobody did and none of us were affected by it. Manchester had an active IRA cell up until the late s. It arguably still has an inactive cell  Ive been handed a bucket for the volunteers in the last  years.

NEC says no someone sues and the judge says yes. THEN the NEC using party money appeals and gets a yes from a trio of judges one of whom Philip Sales appears to have links to Blair and the Labour right.It looks as if the vote is being rigged. It may not be but it LOOKS that way. Do you think Murdoch and Dacre wont use this against Smith if he wins? It looks corrupt. Or it will when the GE starts up and the editorials start.Does this REALLY look like a credible political opposition? Does it look like an election winning party? Does it look like a group of people Britain should trust with its future?From my PoV it looks similar to the US Democrat presidental primaries like the political establishment stitching up the voice of the people.

You agree that it wont as Ive seen from your other posts and its unclear why you think you can see this but the NEC cant. Lets evilly slightly reduce the majority Corbyn will get this time! just isnt a good enough motivation for anyone to do anything.Because antiCorbyn groups have constantly asserted that he only won because of entryists  members and new members. It isnt true but theyve said it enough that I assume they believe it.gtSecondly the NEC has a narrow proCorbyn majority even without Corbyn himself. Corbyn supporters and sympathisers on the NEC must have voted for this cutoff point presumably because they recognised as you and I both do that it wont hurt his chances.Just because they voted to keep him on the ballot doesnt mean there is a proCorbyn majority. Also it was widely covered at the time that this vote was taken when some proCorbyn votes were out of the room.All of which is rather immaterial.

Even if you count Press TV Comment  the show he does as promoting democracy taking money from the Iranian state is still massively hypocritical.Also Id add this clip. To Corbyns lunacy that is in it Corbyn questions this man on his assertion that the US is trying to solve the problem but fails to challenge this mans labelling of Israelisor Zionists as a disease. If he was just letting him make his point and moving on thats one thing but he failed to challenge the disgusting view he put across. And its not the first time hes done it either less extreme an example but on his appearance on The Last Leg they were discussing Noel Edmonds claim that negative attitudes caused cancer. Russell Crowe backed this up with an anecdote about some bloke he knew and Corbyn sat there in silence as Hills and Co were too intimidated to challenge him on it. Im not saying it shows malice but it shows at the very least ignorance and the total opposite of what you look for in a leader.So you admit Adams is a relic with a shady background but not a nutter?

Unless you want to lose singlemarket access that will be quite hard.

No. But it was a calculated risk when it came to my decision to vote Leave but there were several other factors to.   Britain also is now free to economical chose its own direction rather than being forced into the straitjacket of EU diktats and economic ideology. Could that mean Less Workers rights?

8796828,0,t3_50mptt,Socialism doesnt necessarily mean state ownership of all companies. Its a complicated subject.Marx and other rival socialist philosophers and contrary to popular belief Marxs was neither the first nor only competing theory of socialism all describe a hypothetical utopia as different from capitalism as capitalism is from feudalism. They are however all slightly hazy and in disagreement about what that actually means.Communists to massively over simplify are people who believe that the route from capitalism to socialism is via state ownership. However they dont from a philosophical standpoint believe that state ownership is the endgame they think its a transitional state that will be passed through to get to that utopia.Other competing styles of socialism exist. Anarchism is a good example of a philosophy that has a radically different opinion about how you transition to a socialist utopia via dismantling the state in their instance. Mutualism covering cooperativism syndicalism georgism and a bunch of other related ideologies is another different example again. The only thing that all these ideologies really share in common is the idea that capitalism will give way to a new type of society.Democratic Socialist is a term that more or less exists exclusively to distinguish people from Revolutionary Socialists that is to distinguish those who believe in democracy as being part of the journey from those who dont. It doesnt necessarily tell you much about the individual ideologies of the person concerned. In the Labour context the term covers everything from old school state ownership types the cooperative movement trade union syndicalism and even some liberal progressives whose only real unifying factor is their belief that were working towards a better system.Although the phrase has many different meanings depending on circumstances Social Democrat in the modern Labour Party sense is a nice way of describing someone who doesnt think were working towards a postcapitalist utopia but instead thinks were working towards making the current system work better. Social Democrats and Democratic Socialists in the Labour Party might have exactly the same policies as each other with the only difference being what they think the endgame is.

We basically devalued the Degree massively so its no longer the guarantee of a decent life that it once was. Whats the aim? Everyone gets ten As sorry ten s and straight As at A Level and a First? Then what? We have the most well qualified street sweepers in the world?Young people from poor backgrounds dont all want to be lawyers if only they had the chance. Most want a stable easy to get into decently paid job. We had those by the bucket full in manufacturing but they aint coming back. You know the thing that stood out most to me when I started teaching in disadvantaged schools? Student dreams. Middle class well achieving kids have dreams like visit Thailand or be a lawyer whereas more often than not disadvantaged kids have dreams of get a house or own a car. At first its easy to be patronising and say they need to AimHigher but thats not giving people enough credit for spotting their own problems. These things arent a guarantee for them basic Maslows says they cant worry about self actualisation until theyve met shelter and transport. They are aware that their biggest issue wont be doing a job they love itll be basic survival. You dont make poor people better off purely by education you have to do it by improving standards at the bottom of work and lowering cost of living. Frankly theres only so much you can do with education anyway as so much of it is a reflection of social situation. Boris Johnson does well not because hes bright but because he has the right social capital. He speaks the right way knows the right people knows how to act in certain environments and has the buffer of money to help with his mistakes. Sticking Tyrone from Wood End into Eton will help Tyrone a bit but Boris would still come out on top at the end. Finally what about all those who have been through the system already?

It may ultimately be largely fruitless as natural gas is a finite resource so all that leg work for district heating may be for nothing when we run out of gas to fire the district heating.We really need to focus on decarbonising the national electricity grid which will unfortunately require the financial clout of the big six to get behind it but it will take the government to force their hand cos realistically theyre not going to put too much effort in any time soon!,LabourUK,d7lhm9x,5,t5_30c1v

Normally Smart Cities refer to cities with intelligent infrastructure Internet of things intelligent waste management etc. leading to decreased resource consumption. In the context of this video it is vague as to what this policy would mean would the government fund this completely or provide grants for local authorities to do ICT upgrades? Unclear.Energy CooperativesNice idea and I like Coops. Not quite sure here again how this would work through. I imagine to effectively manage wholesale prices these coops would need to trade in aggregate. Seems a little vague again.Grid as a safety net for local producersAgain this seems to fit in with the vague theme of local distributed generation good large scale bad. The grid already is a support network but if he is saying that they are there to facilitate local producers no matter the infrastructure cost then that is a bit short sighted.Copy the best financial mechanismsAnd they are...?OverallA bit wishywashy for my liking specifics are really needed to tell if all this is pie in the sky or an actionable plan. Would have liked to see a credible package of energyenvironment policies. Was nice to see an emphasis on home insulation energy efficiency as Britain lags woefully behind on this.The fact of the matter is that a bit of rooftop solar in a community scheme here and there wont cut it to be honest and as a country we need tens of billions of investment in large scale energy infrastructure.

It has to be in mod mail? I dont really understand this tbh. I know a lot of people are downright horrible to the mods here and theres a consensus with a large chunk of the sub that the mods are somehow unfair on said chunk but I dont think this will solve it tbh. Ive had my disagreements you you before Kitch and you explaining your reasoning in the thread even though I disagreed with it showed a good level of transparency. With this it means someone cant say sorry publicly for their choice of words no mod can be held accountable publicly either. I get that a lot of people on here behave terribly to you guys but I can only see this serving to create greater animosity. Now for me I post a lot less than I used to on this sub the debate has reached toxic and more importantly exhaustive levels. Im not going to pretend to be conciliatory here because I cant from how I see it Corbyn supporters are eating themselves ideologically speaking. Every Corbyn supporter Ive spoke to will tell you Hes made mistakes but wont be able to name any of them if you ask them everyone becomes the enemy if they go against the grain. I used to support Corbyn but my support fell away when I started asking questions about his attitude and leadership style and was met with answers simply telling me I was wrong and none of what I said mattered. This is the fundamental problem for me with this sub and its nothing thats not been said before. Corbyn supporters in the majority want this sub to be a Corbynfan club. Nothing sums this up more than when we reached our lowest point in the polls a couple of months ago what was at the top of this sub that day? An endorsement from Daniel Radcliffe from a year ago. Just the other day in the thread about Corbyn saying he wouldnt change I saw a few Dont let them change you Jeremy! comments as if the man himself is sat here in his pants at half  in the morning on a Saturday night like the rest of us...If this sub is to become less toxic the Corbyn supporters need to stop behaving like teenage one direction fans. I admit a lot of people on the opposite side can be just as bad I feel jaded as fuck for having everything Ive voted for lose in the past  years so I cant imagine how some older members feel. I dont feel like this is the party I joined the day after the election in . I still remember a bloke coming to my door to welcome me to the party I caant imagine that happening now  especially since the area I live now CLP was suspended and the police called for bullying and intimidating behaviour. Im sure many people will vehemently disagree with this analysis of mine and I have seen some Corbyn supportersrather smugly mind you attempt to take conciliatory tones. I just dont see the point myself I really do think the party needs to look at itself and ask can we and more importantly should we keep this coalition together? Well I seem to have veered wildly off course there but I think this rule change ties into this its a bit of a halfmeasure imo sweeps the problem under the rug. As to why one section of supporters can suddenly decide there has been an agreement on what we can and cant say and downvote the mod who clarifies no such agreement exists into oblivion. I can see why this rule change is appealing it stops the kind of mob mentality that exists far too often on this sub but this will only serve to increase the Corbynsupporters victim complexes.

9108196,1,t3_550zwp,I believe something along those lines... i We should be more inclusive about the perpetrators so that we can never let it happen again. If we reduce the lesson of the Holocaust to be about Nazi boogeymen and their antisemitism it means we dont identify with them  they become comic book supervillains. The necessary lesson must be that humans slaughtered humans  genocide is a human trait in all of us and that our own local and personal prejudices will become the victims.ii We should avoid cultures of victimhood. They are a necessary part of the pathology of multigenerational conflict. I cant see a way to close wounds in those conflicts without new generations distancing themselves from the pain of their elders along the lines of it happened to someoneelse not me. It doesnt mean forgetting or disrespecting the actual victims and causes but to take on the wound personally means you become poisoned by those crimes and so we get the cycle of violence the abused become the abusers etc.Of course its only a slight twist on those views that turns inclusivity into whitewashing.

9162161,0,t1_d8dcuwn,Absolutely. But Hamas rose to prominence largely because Fatah  which also arent exactly the most peaceful bunch  werent perceived as getting enough progress while Hamas were acting tough while building schools and hospitals. That is what you get when youre the school yard bully When things feel desperate enough people hit back. When that doesnt work they start hitting harder. And every generation that grows up with this has more to revenge and more reason to hate.You cant end a conflict like that by waiting for the weaker side to surrender because there will always be enough with dead family members to revenge to reignite the conflict. Hence the most successful ends to conflicts like this have all involved scaling back responses gradually stepping up ceasefires to slowly build trust and negotiating without looking to apportion blame. But before anyone is willing to do that it needs to be politically uncomfortable to continue the fight. The way it stands now on the contrary it is politically expedient for both Israel and Hamas to keep things burning. Want to get rid of Hamas? Give Fatah and other more moderate organisations political wins. Want to stop the Israeli hardliners? Stop the West particularly the US from pumping money in to support Israeli military operations so it starts hurting more and start politically isolating Israel to the point where the cost outweighs the perceived gains. Yet while trying to isolate Hamas is politically easy opposition to Israeli policies are political suicide in many countries still. As long as that is still considered acceptable the conflict is unlikely to be resolved. Apartheid first fell when we stopped treating the ANC as terrorists  even though they undeniably had carried out terror operations the military wing was under the leadership of Mandela no less  and the South African elite was isolated to the extent that the balance was at least somewhat evened out.,LabourUK,d8ddd8o,2,t5_30c1v

The upper end not only receive the most benefits from immigration they are also completely isolated from any negatives through higher social status less reliance on public services better housing etc. There is less community cohesion and interdependence for support at the top because it is not so necessary  whereas at the bottom community is a huge deal. The erosion of that community is in their faces every single day.

9862223,0,t1_dat27pv,Regarding the ease of getting drugs vs alcohol this is only really an argument who works on old people or middle class prides who never actually grew up somewhere and drank underage. My friends had literally no problem getting hold of alcohol whatsoever to say getting drugs is easier is just plain wrong I never did any type of drugs myself Ive never even smoked but I would say my friends who drank underage and got drugs were able to do so in equal measure. In fact Id say the drinking was easier to do to excess as buying a load of cheap cider was easy but buying a lot of weed was more expensive. On top of that its missing the social acceptance factor. One friend had a mum who would buy us booze so we could go camping and drink. Her logic was we would get hold of it anyway so best she buy us relatively sensible amounts then us buy shit tons of cheap stuff and risk getting in trouble doing it. This is because drinking is seen as socially acceptable. As its something you can do when youre older a lot of parents see that introducing kids young and educating them is the best way to curb excess curb not stop. If you go around someones house and you dont drink and they open up a bottle of wine and say Dont mind if I drink do you? most people would say no if you went to someones house and they sat there with a bag of cocaine and said dont mind if I do a quick line do you? I suspect most would feel uncomfortable. While drugs can be acquired and there are a lot of downsides when drugs are bought off the black market they remain a social taboo and while their usage among teens is relatively high it tends to drop off after the teenage rebellion phase. If drugs are legal their usage goes up as seen where drugs are decriminalised or legalised. The US is the only true example of full legalisation of cannabis maybe it will be a win win without any harmful side effects as many would have me believe but Im not willing for us to put ourselves above the parapet and take that risk when others have done it first. People have shown with alcohol and cigarettes that given a quick release like that they will do it to excess. Im no angel Ive done my share of binge drinking looking back at it though why was I drinking? Social acceptance mostly a bit of Dutch courage and of course the easiest way in the UK to try and meet someone to date. As a society surely there are better ways to deal with these? Look at it this way one in three  British adults has tried an illegal drug at least once whereas about one in five  says they binge drink at least once a week. I couldnt see or remember any stats about how many tried alcohol at least once but I bet its at least double those that have tried drugs. Alcohol is a poor example of a drug being well controlled frankly why would any of the currently illegal drugs be controlled any better? Regarding using drugs for medicinal purposes one of my favourite quotes is Do you know what they call alternative medicine that works? Medicine. I have no moral issues with drugs my views are one of pragmatism especially when used professionally even to help deal with addiction as long as its being administered by a medical professional for a medical reason with the goal of treating something as far as Im concerned its medicine. ,LabourUK,dat2jza,1,t5_30c1v

9927343,0,t1_db1iafo,gt  thats different from only teaching Islam in state schools.And that is exactly what is donegt After Syrian President Bashar alAssad assumed the presidency in  the school curricula and textbooks were revised. However the new editions of the Islamic religious education texts continued to present Islam as a monolithic religion disregarding the different Sunni schools of thought as well as the beliefs and rituals of other Muslim sectsparticularly the Alawites and the Shia. Muslim schoolchildren were not taught to accept diversity among Islamic sects since the texts presented only one true strand mainstream Sunni Islam.gt The textbooks for example glorified the lives and achievements of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad such as Abu Bakr and Umar ibn alKhattab. But these companions are highly controversial within the Shia community which accuses them of robbing the Prophets cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib of his legitimate right to succeed the Prophet in political leadership khilafa.gt The Prophets wife Aisha daughter of Abu Bakr is another contested figure. She is described in the ninthgrade textbook as the Mother of Believers Umm alMumineen and as a role model for Muslims particularly women. According to the textbook Aisha was very knowledgeable pious generous and a leader in defending womens rights. Shia Muslims mostly deny her these attributes and accuse her of fomenting sedition among Muslims by leading armed men in the Battle of the Camel against Ali ibn Abi Talib an event that is not mentioned in the Syrian textbooks.gt Such texts obviously do not help minority students develop a profound understanding of their own faith. And by erasing nonSunni versions of Islam the school system has failed to foster acceptance and mutual understanding between Syrias religious faiths.Plus the regime spends public money on building Sunni mosques  not churches or synagogues  all over the place.

10337748,0,t3_5o1b3s,Full text ComRes have a poll in the IndependentSunday Mirror tonight. The finding that has got the most attention is a question asking who people think would do a better job at managing the NHS this winter.  of people picked Jeremy Corbyn and Labour  of people picked Theresa May and the Conservatives.This is a very unusual result. The NHS is essentially Labours issue of last resort. Whatever happens however bad things look the public will almost always say they trust Labour more on the NHS. Over on Ipsos MORIs website they have data on the question going back to  and you have to go back to  to find the Tories ahead. If you go back to the time of the Brown government when the Conservatives were on a high there were a couple of polls from other companies when the Tories scraped a lead on the NHS but it is extremely rare. A twelve point Tory lead on the NHS would be unheard of.The reason for this strange result is probably the wording. YouGov ask best party on issues regularly and still consistently find Labour ahead. Just this month they found  trusted Labour most on the NHS compared to  for the Tories. The difference with the ComRes question is that they did not ask just which party people trusted on the NHS the choice was between Theresa May amp the Conservatives or Jeremy Corbyn amp Labour to manage the NHS. The introduction of the two leaders into the question probably explains why May amp the Conservatives were ahead.While this probably explains the difference it should be scant comfort for Labour. If the mention of Jeremy Corbyn in a question is enough to make respondents doubt whether theyd trust Labour with the NHS  normally a banker for them  then imagine what he would do to people pondering whether they would trust Labour on the economy security or whatever.The other questions on the NHS were far more typical. While  agreed that the NHS provides a high standard of care by  to  people did think the Red Cross were right to say the NHS was in crisis. That MayConservative lead on the NHS should not be taken as an endorsement of their management either only  of people agreed that Jeremy Hunt was doing well as Health secretary and  of people agreed with a statement that NHS care is worse than ten years ago.Another question asked about high pay and is more encouraging for Jeremy Corbyn. A YouGov poll in the week asked about a pretty tough policy on high pay a maximum earnings limit of m a year and got a negative response only  thought it a good idea  a bad idea. ComRes asked about a much subtler policy giving tax benefits or government contracts to companies with a maximum ratio of  to  between top and average salaries and this got a much better reception  thought they should  thought the government should not interfere.Opinium also have a new poll out tonight for the Observer  details here. They have topline voting intention figures of CON nc LAB  LDEM  UKIP . The eight point lead is lower than most other polls show but this seems to be a consistent pattern from Opinium  presumably for methodological reasons  rather than a drop since their previous poll.,LabourUK,dcfubl2,5,t5_30c1v

While there are some things I find very appealing about Jenkins particularly his commitment to social liberalism and internationalism I wasnt particularly  impressed by the fairly meager efforts to form a centrist party  while the Social Democrats fit my ideology quite snugly they jumped the gun by not campaigning for electoral reform first. There couldve been something potent if the SocDem guys and the Gaitskellites couldve formed a coalition of some kind but I guess that fell apart when they lost the leadership.There were also a few things which reminded me uncomfortably of myself particularly the worry about alienating people by coming across as a bit posh or incredibly posh in his case....

10451744,0,t1_dcss60m,The article implicitly attacks Clinton for being the face of supposed identity politics. It is not an analytical piece worthy of the name because much like you it makes no attempt to define the thing its complaining about nor to link it with the phenomena it supposedly brought about. This makes it shitty evidence. The idea that Washington preaches Latino Nationalism whatever that is is completely ridiculous as is the idea that Washington somehow preaches more than one kind of nationalism ampndash nationalisms are obviously mutually exclusive when practised in the same country unless he thinks Barack Obama advocated separatist movements for blacks and Latinos and maybe eventually Arab Americans which would presumably by this insane line of argument have eventually robbed white Americans of their land. Even if the compounded idiocy of suggesting something with no explanation that is both false several times over and literally impossible were not stupid enough it also implies that white nationalism and black nationalism are directly equivalent presumaby out of some naive etymological literalism that eschews all attempts to understand the historical origins and the actual recorded methods and aims of those movements. This brings me back to the cardinal sin of the article which is that it never explains what the fuck it is talking about or makes the slightest attempt to suggest what it means by identity politics or what this actually had to do with Trumps victory. Its only value is as documentary evidence of the kind of gibberish that the American right has somehow twisted itself into believing.I really dont give a fuck if Kushner signed it off or not.

10509294,0,t3_5qdj7v,The party is broken Corbyn is just a symptom. Corbyn hasnt gotten worse  hes still the same wishywashy mediocre backbencher he was  years ago what changed is the enormity of the tasks before him and the party he is supposed to be leading as well as the weight of the consequences of his successes and failures. What changed is that the party rankandfile elevated him to a position he is clearly incapable of handling. However getting rid of Corbyn wouldnt solve the partys deepseated problems although keeping him in place will keep the party in a state of permanent and escalating crisis.Here are what I see as the major fault lines in the party that need to be addressed if the Labour Party is to become great again. Brexit  One of the big reasons why Corbyn shouldve been campaigning  hours a day against Brexit was to avoid being forced to choose between irreconcilable paths and dilemmas that the party now faces over this issue whether or not to vote for Article  how to position the party as a proper opposition to a Toryled Brexit government how to keep Labours urban Remain and nonurban Brexit voters together within Labours political coalition in the event of Brexit. It may be that Labour cant recover politically and electorally until the torturous process of Brexit is over and done with because it cant find a way to resolve the aforementioned contradictions. If anyone has ideas about how to do that Id be interested in hearing them. In my view Labour shouldnt vote for things it doesnt fundamentally believe in like Brexit that Labour should stick to its guns Remain that being a Remain party is really the only solid foundation on which to act as a proper opposition to a Toryled Brexit government. The alternative  voting for article  supporting nonsensical ideas like soft Brexit or worse Lexit  would definitely be worse for the country the working class and Labour. The country the economy and working people esp. immigrants are going to suffer as Brexit occurs and in the long run Labour will be able to say we tried to warn you if it sticks to its guns on this issue even though in the short run electorally it might not pay off.. Immigration  A significant chunk of Labours traditional voters voted for Brexit as a means of ending EUs freedom of movement. As immigration levels rose in the s people turned against it Labour response? To tag those who expressed concerns with immigration levels as racists bigots or morons who didnt understand their own best interests even though a lot of people with those concerns were immigrants themselves remember Gordon Brown and the little old lady hot mic gaffe?. So long as this attitude persists workingclass voters are not going to trust Labour to handle the issue of immigration properly. Labour needs to figure out how to make immigration policy work for working people. Saying immigrants benefit the economy and backing that up with absolutely undeniable statistics isnt going to cut it slapping the vacuous slogans like Controls on Immigration on a mug isnt going to work either. Freedom of movement was a great deal for people who moved from lower wage countries to Britain to find work but was it such a great deal for working people immigrants and Britishborn already in Britain? What concretely did they get out of freedom of movement? How many of them moved in the opposite direction out of Britain to work at higher paying jobs other country? I would imagine not many. So in the context of declining living standards in Britain outofcontrol housing costs and other social ills that made daily life harder for working people I think popular tolerance of growing levels of immigration pretty much evaporated hence the appeal of Britain first UKIP and the like. . Scotland. Labour in Scotland has been wiped out by the rise of the SNP. So to win a majority of seats in parliament Labour is going to have to either  regain ground in Scotland or  win a surprisingly large number of traditionally Tory seats in England. I think option  is a lot easier and more plausible than option . How to do that in Scotland I dont know Im a Yank but the first step is to solving a problem is acknowledging that there is one and then try to figure out what it is and how to solve it. I havent seen a lot of discussion in during Corbyns reign about how to revive Labours fortunes in Scotland which to my mind could be a makeorbreak issue in terms of winning a majority in parliament again.Fixing the party has got to be a issuesdriven not personalitybased bottomup driven process especially since the PLP is politically and ideologically bankrupt. But that process is going to take time and it isnt going to be quick or easy especially with Corbyn creating new party crises every  hours.

10678505,0,t3_5srpex,The problem with Corbyn leaving is that it leaves Labour in a worse state going forward.Brexit starts in  May is almost certainly going to win  regardless and so the next plausible chance at government for Labour is .If Corbyn stays until after the  election then both the Brexit fallout and the  loss can go with him. Someone else can have five clear years at building up support without being seen to have been involved in either.If Corbyn goes just now then someone else has to lead Labour for  years get pumped in  and then either carry Brexit with them to  not great or they also go not great and it looks like musical chairs not great.Regardless of what you think of Corbyns chances in  hes the best person to have as leader at that point.

10733142,0,t1_ddn0gp6,Thats a fair comment the coup itself was illtimed and much more complicated than its been made out to be. The man who most likely did most of the organising for it once it had got going was at a silent disco at Glastonbury when it first began. The soft left i.e. Owen Smith Lisa Nandy  the Milibandites of the shadow cabinet only joined the rebels after McDonnell told them he would see the party split to see Corbyn remain leader. All this has been forgotten as well as Corbyns outright lying during the campaign and his refusal to tell his supporters to stop abusing Owen Smith stained his record of integrity to everyone who wasnt a supporter of his already. Its easy to say without X Corbyn would be winning or even doing better but you can say that about any politician and it doesnt change reality. The reality is from day one the old right of the party and the few remaining Blairites refused to work with Corbyn or accept his leadership of the party. This was not an insurmountable obstacle. Ed Miliband had the same people wobble on him a few times during his leadership and he was able to placate them. Corbyn didnt attempt to meet them in the middle he launched his nd leadership campaign by saying he was extending an olive branch but also talked up bringing in mandatory reselection at the same press conference. The only reason Corbyn is in the job right now is because the unions have been on his side that will not last even if McCluskey wins reelection. Its not in their interests to see a Labour party at its furthest from power in almost a hundred years. We can admire the Tories for their quick and clean coups but Labours was not all that different the only difference was the Tory party actually has a mechanism in place for removing leaders. Labour had no mechanism in place for an incumbent leader not getting enough nominations to make it onto the ballot most likely because no one couldve foreseen wed have a leader who was so belligerent hed try to retain the leadership despite losing the support of  of the partys MPs.,LabourUK,ddn1kg9,14,t5_30c1v

After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave who again implores him to name anyone else.Pope Francis his boss replies. Sure! says Dave. Ive known the Pope for years. So off they fly to Rome. Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vaticans St. Peters Square when Dave says This will never work. I cant catch the Popes eye among all these people. Tell you what I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and Ill come out on the balcony with the Pope. He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.Sure enough half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony but by the time Dave returns he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics. Making his way to his boss side Dave asks him What happened? His boss looks up and says It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said Who on earth is that on the balcony with Dave?,LabourUK,dfjv390,11,t5_30c1v

11378337,0,t1_dfllguc,To be fair in the valuing side I do think the EU has often not demonstrated how much it values the UK in a way that is visible to the British public. Anyone with an actual insight or who has studied it knows that actually the UK acts as an important champion of free trade and often ends up as the broker when French and German interests are St loggerheads. We were also the champions of expanding the EU a move that has economically been extremely successful. But all these things are known to the few not the many. I think what history will decide is there never should have been a referendum and the EU leaders should have given Cameron more in the negotiations beforehand.

Second my former local Labour party old fogies sat around at meetings voting and telling everyone in the room how wrong they were. Many of them had done that since the s and had concerned themselves with internal battles not elections. They sound a bit like you actually.Third your reading list is hilarious to a politics graduate. Its both pithy and reading only the literature of one side is unhealthy. Try reading Wealth of Nations and see how perfect capitalism is would be an equally as dumb statement.Fourth had George Galloway been leader we still wouldve won useless unprovable statement. Five you still havent defined exactly how this mythical core vote wins elections. All youve done is said ITS THERE I KNOW IT IS GUVNA in multiple paragraphs and blamed New Labour for losing it. No one is denying New Labour lost voters but if your argument is that  terms of Labour government helping millions was wrong because it lost a few union members? Oh dear. Ill be sure to remember that next time i laugh at the performance of TUSC every single electionSix its always relied on the Scottish vote wrong. So so wrong.  Without Scotland Labour would still have won in  with a majority of  down from  in   down from  and in   down from . What those who say that Labour cannot win without.Seven youre utterly delusional if you think Corbyn winning  elections in a safe seat and  leadership elections among a tiny selectorate means hes going to win as PM if we just get behind him. But then it doesnt surprise me that youre delusional. Most of your camp are completely delusional  the worst part being how much you go in circles making the same arguments and are consistently blaming every single other person except yourselves. It might surprise you but having read Das Kapital most of Dickens work and lets say for the modern socialist circlejerk purpose Pikettys Capital Im not a raving socialist. Know why? Because i read them and then made up my own damn mind on what the solutions were rather than blindly believing whatever it was the current leader of the leftist faction says.For gods sake why am i still arguing with you people? Its nothing but talking to a brick wall. Youre never wrong Jezza is God the hard left have never caused near irreperable damage to the Labour Party if youre not a Jezza cult member you must be an unthinking Blairite defending the New Labour years only proved that and makes you as bad as the Tories. Boring boring boring. Meanwhile you lose local elections  its everyone elses fault. You lose Welsh assembly its everyone elses fault. You lose parliamentary byelections its everyone elses fault. You make no headway in Scotland its everyone elses fault. When you eventually go on to lose  you still wont release your toxic grip on the party because itll be everyone elses fault. Well thanks to people like you Ill be glad to accept some of the blame for helping to ensure there is no Labour Government under Jeremy Corbyn in .

11612416,0,t1_dgc9c5b,gtYoure brushing off of our future very lightly here. If our economy goes tits up because we just lost our largest trading partner that means a wave of unemployment stagnent wages and general loss of quality of life for millions of people. Labour is meant to be against those things but clearly weve given up.Try to minimise the worst of the damage in government is better than being on the sidelines ineffectually saying This is really bad guys!. If your arguing there is some higher responsibility to help protect the public from a poor economy and poverty while it will probably be bad if we are in government and looking for a hard Brexit it will definitely be bad if the Tories are in government and looking for hard Brexit. gtYou might annectdotally not fancy staying in the single market but lots do.You may anecdotally want to stay in but  of Britons want to leave according to polling if that is what is required to regain full sovereignty. Far less people polled said that we should remain a single market member no matter what.So in summary you may anecdotally want to stay in but lots dont.gtWhat sort of choice is that? We could rally around economic responsibility and a stable future. The laws youre so against are regulations to make trade easier ones that we will inevitably follow because so much of our countries wealth depends on it.You dont have to offer the electorate a choice dude. The Tories legalised gay marriage does that mean we must oppose it? Are we failing in our duties by not providing an option for people who hate gays? Of course not.We are under no obligation to ensure all views are represented and we will not win if we proposed a form of Brexit where we still have EU law we still have EU immigrants we still pay into the EU but we have no say over EU law and regulations.While I agree that EU regulation isnt a bad thing for EU members and it makes trade easier without an ability to influence it we are forced to the whims and political machinations of the EU. For example a financial transaction tax would massively hurt London and basically do nothing to the other EU economies. We essentially vetod that policy but without a say in the laws they could have just enforced it on us. At which point theres a very real possibility of Brexit MK II when we leave the single market in response to EU regulation damaging our economy. gtLets not chose to be poorer as well.The public already chose to be poorer with Brexit noones mind is changing and probably wont change until its too late to do anything about it. We can either continue to meekly protest and lose elections while we watch a Tory government do whatever the fuck they want without fear or losing an election or we can bite the bullet and offer policies that actually stand a chance of getting us elected.,LabourUK,dgc9zr2,2,t5_30c1v
