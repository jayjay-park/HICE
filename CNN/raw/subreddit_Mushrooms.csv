286766,0,t3_1u7vqs,This is a legitimate hallucinogenic mushroom with desirable effects but its not analogous to psilocybin species. Its effects are more anticolingeric think Benadryl rather than entheogenic LSD mescaline etc. It has been proposed to be the soma of Indian scripts. However its not particularly euphoric.Its poisonous in sufficient amounts but most things are. The reason why its considered poisonous is that certain subspecies of the mushrooms are and botanists have traditionally classified them as toxic because of their psychoactive effects. They are sometimes part of Eastern European cuisine.So basically yes theyre psychoactive but theyre not all that awesome. Go ahead and eat them. Check Erowid for doses.,Mushrooms,cfahk28,2,t5_2qook

6610772,0,t3_466yyb,Was utterly unimpressed with that episode..  Whether or not it was actually psilocybin a single capsule of dry tampenesis wouldnt affect even  a small person as much as it appeared to affect Mulder.   .  Those two new agents were worse than just crappy knockoffs of Mulder and Scully they were as empty as the gelatin capsules were before someone put niacin in them..  The entire mystery trumpet intrigue went nowhere   disappeared in fact.   Never to be mentioned again..  Played on already existing prejudice against Muslims..  Too godcentric.   I know my post really belongs in a Xfiles fanboy forum or at a panel at Comicon but damn it I hate when a good series for its time is so clumsily rebooted as to make you question your initial loyalty and excitement.    Color me disappointed.,Mushrooms,d033yeo,2,t5_2qook

Just seeing horrific stuff or what?I have a sister that did LSD over two decades ago and she says that she sees everything with a translucent honeycomb over it a very light one but there nonetheless.Based on what Ive read if youre a teenager or in your s psychoactive drug effects tend to persist.
