3194150,0,t1_cot29ot,I honestly cant think of a single place in  where its completely random if you live or die especially if its not your first playthrough. There are many people who regularly speedrun the game and their main gripe with the game seems to be the randomness in the bosses and the inability to manipulate them e.g. killing Galaxy Man can be super fast or it can take almost forever  and everything in between  based on nothing but randomness. Obviously not very desirable when youre trying to go as fast as possible. But there are definitely places where youll most likely die at least once as part of the learning process.

Most people would just go straight to Sigma once they get all the upgrades and wouldnt bother replaying the Armor Armadillo stage five times much less making sure to get the health powerup at the end.  The only situation I can think of that coming up is if someones filling up their subtanks before doing the Sigma stages and Armor Armadillo is their favorite stage so they just keep replaying it getting all the health they can find.  But in that case their tanks would be full way before they play through the stage  times and even so they would probably just find somewhere to keep killing bats over and over to grind up health rather than replaying a stage over and over.,Megaman,cqv47nw,1,t5_2rq0l

6083080,0,t3_3yu8pi,I feel like weve discussed these technicalities in another thread before and if I didnt say it there I think that Geo having named his partner Mega doesnt quite justify him having a Mega Buster. Like for example its almost universally agreed upon that X is a Mega Man especially considering him also being fathered by Rocks creator. Id go as far to say that hes the paramount Mega Man considering that while Rock was reinvented into Mega Man out of necessity because of Wilys army. However X was created from the ground up as a peacekeeper and a leader equipped with Mega Mans abilities and then some but as last resorts should the world need both a peacekeeper and a warrior all in one.So now lets look at X he doesnt have a Mega Buster he has the X Buster. Later Zero who most fans dont consider a Mega Man despite his Mega Man title in his spinoff gets the Z Buster and abilities from bosses. Neither of them have a gunarm called the Mega Buster but X is still a Mega Man right? Hes a Dr. Light creation made to continue and build on Rocks design. However by the logic that Geo is a fullfledged Mega Man due to him having a Buster and Copy Cards so is Zero for having those abilities of Rocks.,Megaman,cygz1pc,2,t5_2rq0l

The first one was the most difficult for me but the series remained pretty challenging. The gameplay and story really stood out. This extends further into the ZX series which is pretty similar and expands on both story and gameplay a bit. Id suggest you give that a shot too after you finish the Zero series.

7020366,0,t1_d1c2n7q,Me and uGoldenJoe have been discussing almost exactly that on the YouTube comments. The Doc Robot stages were significant improvements over the standard Boss Rush sections andbarring Classic and X as you said a Stage Rush would be interesting since its a platformer first and foremost. You make some great points there.,Megaman,d1c3xa0,1,t5_2rq0l
7044525,0,t1_d1dx5xe,Well I meant like beat a boss get a point then put it somewhere to power up. If you have a crap load of bosses getting all of their weapons would be hell trying to sort through and the inevitable this sucky power would happen far more often. An upgrade system allows you to not have to worry about programming specific boss attacks or even different weakness just have  different types of attacks  base  of two and  of three and have the bosses take however much more damage from the weapon types as necessary. I mean its more of a similar system to Golden Suns class system rather than just bar filling say you put in  bosses thats  points to distribute between three different weapon types have the cap be something like  points and every two points equals another tier with the other point being an attack effect. For example lets say you have the ability to shoot fire lightning and ice and put in a point into fire your shots would then be small fireballs. Put another point in and they simply do more damage. Put a third one in and now they become set of three small ones. Then start mixing things by putting in one point into ice average it out and you get  points into water which shoots out a bubble that hovers in the air for a bit. Put another point into ice to get an average of  into water that turns your shots into bouncing bubbles. If you put one point into all of them you get a thin little ray gun shot one into fire and lightning shoots stars and one into ice and lightning shoots a scatter shot. It gives you a basis to work with doesnt overwhelm players and can change up the play style making it more interesting because regardless of the boss they pick first theyll always get just a random point to upgrade into a different style of play. Maybe they liked the fire power moreso and decide to max it out ASAP on one run and then switch over to lightning the next or do a mix.  Having boss powers with more than the typical amount found in mega man games might seem a bit daunting especially for you because you have to make an attack look something like what the player would have which might be easy at first but once you hit higher numbers youre going to run into balance problems. That and because the powers would be static its not like thered be much a player would do on repeated runs theyd almost always go after the more useful or powerful attacks first or just go buster only if they dont have a particular favorite. Every playthrough is the same with static powers. An upgrade system with as many bosses as youre planning though allows for more dynamic styles and combinations. You can also use it for more statbased upgrades as well like health or whatever else you plan on using maybe have different skills cost a certain number of points and make it all swappable lets say double jump isnt helping so you can unequip it spend the points in something else and go from there. Its all a matter of how you use the system that determines its efficiency.You also have to remember that because its a boss rush you have to compensate for the lack of levels. Yes a boss rush mega man game involving the previous bosses would be fun but the core games are still pick a level run and jump and beat the boss. As far as the number of attacks are concerned again lack of levels means you have that much more space to work with and that much less to worry about giving you more time to work on bosses. I mean break down the boss rush stages in each of the mega man games even going in to each fight buster only the amount of time you spend is like  minutes tops. Even if you doubled the number of bosses were looking at  minutes tops to go through an entire game. You want a boss rush only game youre gonna need to put in a good amount of bosses and make them complex enough to last awhile.,Megaman,d1eurwj,1,t5_2rq0l

Tone doesnt always translate across well over text so I probably inferred something that wasnt there.gt Windows  and . has never forced users to install updates and still lets to control when it does so. Yes I know. The problem is that Microsoft is not making it clear which updates contain Windows  and in some cases users are doing system updates walking away and when they come back Windows  is installed.Not doing updates doesnt seem like a good option. I previously started only doing security updates to avoid it but then the Windows  package started coming in security updates. So my choice is to leave my system vulnerable from a security standpoint or to update and chance a Windows  update when Im not looking which could happen as a full OS install only takes about  minutes on my system given the specs and SSD. Id prefer to let my updates run automatically at least on my home systems and not worry about whether MS is going to update my entire OS without my permission or prompting.Honestly this isnt my only problem with Windows though its just the last straw. Windows  is supported until  and Win until . Im already nearly fully migrated to Linux at home and only gaming has stopped a full permanent transition. I expect as Vulkan matures over the next few years even gaming wont be an issue on Linux. Going forward I can always run Windows inside a virtual machine if I absolutely need it.

8085125,0,t1_d4ok5gh,MMs design is completely simple and is exactly the same as the sprite. The people behind Captain N are morons and should be ignored. Inafune drew what he was told to draw by the team. Do you really think that they would have accepted any major deviation from what Kitamura intended MM to look like? And its very likely that Kitamura and others created rough sketches of what MM should look like. You can note differences in designs through time. The original game MM does a very Sentai like pose. Kitamura cites Toku series as an inspiration. This kind of pose never shows up later in the series. And MM originally has normal looking feet. Later games feature Mega Man with his huge robot feet that he has. This seems to be what Inafune added to the design. Inafunes style became the series style. But all of that is post MM. Compare the differences between the original cover art and the rereleaseCreating pixel art first is pretty standard for Famicom characters. Would you say that the guy who did the refined design for Mario or any other character is in fact the cocreator since Mario started as Pixel art first? These characters are simple and lack huge amounts of detail. Marios sprite is pretty close to the promo illustrations. Inafune was just an artist and his contribution to MM  was incredibly minor. The only reason were talking about him is because he became a series producer and face for the series and then a big shot at Capcom. Or put this another way. Kitamura slips in the shower in  and dies. MM does not exist. Capcom makes other platformers that are radiaclly different. Maybe they suceed maybe they dont. Inafune slips in the shower in . MM would be exactly the same. Another guy would have done animations and illustrations. Elec Man would have looked a little different. Being generous Inafune is just trying to save face when people call him the creator of MM. Oh yeah yeah right. Im cocreator.. He doesnt want to contradict people. Being cynical hes taking credit for other peoples work. ,Megaman,d4oubk8,2,t5_2rq0l

Leaf shield is all but useless his dair has a tiny hitbox and he has very few kill moves. Hes very good at zoning since his jab is lemons and you have to respect Metal Blade and Crash Bomber can be excellent for forcing an opponent to shield if you stick them with it.Anyhow I wouldnt say hes any harder to learn than most of the cast but Rock definitely isnt rated highly on the tier lists since he doesnt see much high level play... For most matchups there are better characters to use and with the aforementioned issues he gets predictable. Watch the last three rounds of the grand finals and see how many times Kame tries to catch Ally with bair after  and how well he is able to avoid the kill shots from it since he knows its MMs most reliable kill move.,Megaman,d5f9qf1,12,t5_2rq0l

9840657,0,t1_dapnpvj,I liked MM a lot but it definitely suffered in level design due to Mega Mans sprite being so huge. Splitting the bosses into two groups of four was a big misstep as well. Mega Man is an unusual franchise in that it got its formula down right from the start. In terms of level design challenge progression no significant changes were made after MM. You cant really evolve it without it becoming a fundamentally different game which we eventually saw with the X Zero and ZX. I dont think its right to think of MM as moving backward. They simply dropped elements which didnt add real value shop charge shot etc. I do think that there is room for improvement in the classic series but NES style games are a better foundation for those changes than the SNESPS style games. ,Megaman,daq9ec0,1,t5_2rq0l

10206268,0,t1_dc0wnff,Yeah it would have been great to have a Pacifist route as an OPTION in the games but Capcom couldnt think that far out of the box. No instead its welp here I go killing again! for  games and then X losing his mind in the end from all the suffering. NICE WORK BREAKING IT. That said I really like the idea of a pacifist vs killing mechanic and Zero is definitely skilled enough to target his blows more precisely if he wanted to. I also definitely like the idea of different dialogue trees based on the players behavior toward the smaller boss creatures like the more you try and stealth around themignore them it ticks off some kinda hidden meter. It could also make Xs halfassed attempt at making the Maverick Virus mean something if you potentially get overloaded by background virus and start losing control of the character... so he starts taking violent actions like in X when the lil bug guys override X and bounce him around killing things which would muck up your pacifist meter. Theres a lot that COULD be done. these are fun ideas.,Megaman,dc0xrhn,1,t5_2rq0l

10397439,0,t1_dclu2qo,The cyber elves are pretty much cheats not upgrades. Yeah it goes against the design of regular Mega Man but MMZ isnt about that to begin with. Thats also why it just has three elemental chips instead of boss weapons to help beat other bosses Youre not getting stronger throughout the game youre getting better. And it makes sense too since neither X nor Zero have storywise gotten any stronger after X. Theyve just gotten better with experience.The entire design of MMZ is based on consistently getting better at the game itself. The short stages the incredibly tight controls and everything inbetween exist because of that. Upgrades go directly against that design decision since they give you an easy way out when you cant beat something. Cant beat Sigma? Fill up your subtanks. Cant beat Copy X? Get better at the game.The cyber elves exist so you can adjust your difficulty curve if you really cant get better but of course because it goes against the games design it discourages their use through the ranking system. In general the elves are only there so you can get through the game. Like an Easy mode.,Megaman,dcmm6po,2,t5_2rq0l

Hypothesizing X could battle robots infected by viruses he gave X the perfect virus countermeasure. Meanwhile Dr. Light developed a great number of armors but this presented the possibility of X becoming a threat to mankind. To confirm the safety of Xs cognition program Dr. Light sealed away X in an analysis capsule.XX years ago The birth of ZeroZero was produced by Dr. Wily who schemed at taking over the world. But he contained a flaw in his cognitive program that made him violent and unwilling to obey instructions so Dr. Wily himself sealed Zero in a capsule.XX years ago X is discoveredX is discovered by Dr. Cain having been buried underground for  years.XX years ago The birth of ReploidsDr. Cain carried out his research of X and using this created highly advanced robots called Reploids.XX years ago The Sigma Virus outbreakA subspecies of the terrible computer virus from long ago is generated and begins driving robots mad locally. The human leadership acknowledges these infected robots as Mavericks and orders them to be disposed of. The source was found to be an unknown computer virus that had prevailed over  years ago emerging from the capsule Zero slumbered in. Later this virus was named the Sigma Virus after the Reploid Sigma who led a revolt against the human leadership.XX years ago Formation of the Maverick HuntersFollowing through with the disposal of Mavericks the human leadership decides to have Mavericks exterminated by Reploids and forms the Maverick Hunters. Ironically the leader of the first generation of Maverick Hunters is Sigma.XX years ago Zero awakensReceiving information of Zero awakening from his capsule and causing violence the Maverick Hunter Sigma finds and intercepts him. during this incident Sigma is infected by the unknown computer virus leaking out from Zeros capsule but at the same time Zero having his armor damaged in the battle with Sigma also becomes infected with the virus. Due to this Zeros personality completely changed and he would turn to working as a Maverick Hunter.XX years ago The Maverick Wars beginInfected by the unknown computer virus Sigma defects to the side of the Mavericks and leads a revolt against human leadership. The wars between the Mavericks and the Maverick Hunters for the future of humanity begins.XX years ago Fall of the colony EurasiaUnder Sigmas orders the Reploid mercenary Dynamo causes an obsolete space colony Eurasia to crash into Earth. Along with recognizing the threat of the Mavericks anew the human leadership professes its aim of eradicating all Mavericks. The site that became a contamination zone is dubbed Area Zero and for the next  years would be barred from entry.XX years ago The Nightmare IncidentThe Nightmare Incident occurs an event where a subspecies of the Sigma Virus that attracts attention as the Nightmare Virus spreads throughout the world. The fact was proven that Zero was it source as he was a carrier of the Sigma Virus and was contagious to his surroundings as he worked across the world as a Hunter. In finding this the human leadership decides for Zero to be sealed away but due to the influence of scientists studying the Sigma Virus his cognitive program was removed from his body so the two could be researched separately.XX years ago The birth of the Mother ElfA Reploid researcher of this time Dr. Ciels greatgrandmother studies Zeros cognitive program and discovers an antibody to the Sigma Virus. She completes the Mother Elf a program lifeform that can rewrite and erase the Sigma Virus. Afterwards the scientists in the field of researching the Sigma Virus make researching Cyber Elves their focus.XX years ago The Elf Wars rise from the Maverick WarsThere are many historians who define the end of the Maverick Wars as the period when the number of Mavericks dropped significantly due to Xs using the Mother Elf. In actuality there is no enduring the conflict and afterwards the latter period of the Maverick Wars came to be known as the Elf Wars.XX years ago The proposal of Project ElpizoA member of the humans researching Cyber Elves proposes Project Elpizo an operation to create a Reploid thats a perfect ruler using the Mother Elfs program rewriting ability. X opposed this operation but out of fear of a longlasting war support begins for complete control of Reploids.

That said  After the combined chaos of X and X something like  of all Hunters plus an equally huge number of invisible humans and civvie Reploids were killed. The Hunters are reduced to more or less just who you see on screen in X. X removing himself at that point is effectively chopping them in half since only he and Zero are strong enough to withstand most Mavericks. So of course Zero is pissed off at start of X hes still stinging from the Nightmare zero bullshit and then X goes and forces him to do ALL the work. In a better written series X would have left but consider that hes made a lot of Maverick enemies over his personal runtime and perhaps it was thought that he needed to stay around for his own protection?
