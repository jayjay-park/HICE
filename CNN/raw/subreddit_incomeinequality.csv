If theres one clear lesson from the  crisis and its aftermath that should be it. From last years post Another Tale from the Oligarch Recovery  How a  Sofa Costs  When Youre PoorThe Pew Research Center recently released a fascinating study which showed what many of us already suspected that the U.S. middle class has declined in  of metropolitan areas from  or in  of  areas studied.The details are just as interesting as the headline some of which will provide ammunition for those looking to spin the historic st century status quo plunder into something an resembling economic recovery. Specifically Pew notes thatNationwide share of adults in lowerincome households increased from  to  and the share in upperincome households rose from  to  during the period.Some people will read this and say so whats the big deal were making some people richer and others poorer as the middle class shrinks? I think it is a big deal for two primary reasons.First the study only goes up until  and when you look at details it becomes obvious that a lot of the increase into the upperincome demographic related to the oil boom which has since gone completely bust. So how many of those people have been since booted into a lower income segment? We simply dont know for sure but we know its likely material.Nevertheless thats not the biggest issue I have with the trend. Even if the higher paying oil and gas jobs could be considered permanent the shift to a binary economy in which you either become wealthy or poor results in greater income inequality which ultimately leads to social unrest and the emergence of authoritarian demagogic political figures i.e. Trump.Its what I like to call the Hunger Games economy. Youre thrown into the woods with a diminishing capacity to work hard and earn a middle income and if you fail to enter the upper echelons youll be reduced to poverty. The result is insecurity stress and ultimately resentment which before too long bubbles to the surface in all sorts of unwelcome ways. A strong and vibrant middle class has always provided a buffer to truly nasty civil unrest and revolution in these United States. As it goes extinct the probability of those things rises exponentially.With that out of the way here are a few excerpts from the Pew studyThe American middle class is losing ground in metropolitan areas across the country affecting communities from Boston to Seattle and from Dallas to Milwaukee.
