11218237,0,t3_60550d,Hi all Im Andy  years old and from the UK. I started on th Jan and something about this time has clicked in my head I have the info on LoseIt and MFP to thank for that I think! The last time I remember myself at a healthy weight was probably when I was  years old... I literally have no idea how I look at a healthy weight but Ill find out soon SW lbsCW lbsChallenge GW lbsUGW lbsI want to get into running at some point soon but I think starting at lbs will destroy my knees so Ill have to wait for a bit. Ill be keeping those steps up for the challenge though!Feel free to add me on MFP  or Fitbit  Im pretty damn sedentary most of the time,Team_Sprout,df3knh9,8,t5_3jkg5

11322266,0,t3_60550d,Hey everyone!Im Annette  F    SW  CW Challenge GW  Ultimate GW This is my first challenge and Im very excited to be taking part! Ive tried weight loss before and only managed to lose a bit never managed to keep it off because I keep going back to old habits. Ive never been very big but on my small frame every pound is noticeable. Im also very pear shaped and would love to balance out my thighs with my upper body a bit more.  Im sick of starting over so this time I will make it stick! Ive made a new years resolution to lose kg a month this year and Im on track with this goal up to now  despite getting lazy and gaining some weight in February Im following a keto diet and Ive started going to the gymswimming and fitness classes  days per week. Hopefully this routine will work for me this time! Not gonna let the team down!,Team_Sprout,dffcyhu,1,t5_3jkg5
