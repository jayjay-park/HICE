34460,0,t1_ceenkzr,Hello Zorpix!To take owner ship of a Skylander just place the figure on the PoP. You can check which characters you have through the Pause menugtCollection.  The picture of the unlocked Skylander should be in there. As for your accolades  you say all the old figures dont work? What was the last figured that did work? Did you finish the game? Did you do any of the Adventure Pack missions? Are you gaining any Portal Master levels or is it just character levels? Sorry to bombard you with questions but I want to get as much info as possible. If theres anything that you feel you can add that would help Id appreciate it. ATVIAssistZJ,skylanders,ceics3y,2,t5_2ssor

88140,0,t1_ceofbzn,Its its own self contained game so theres no transfer of progress between it and the console games or anything but it does tell a bit of a story about the Lost Islands. You can also use the web codes that come with the figures to unlock those characters to use.While a time management or farming game at its one of the best of the genre. Theres a lot of resource management in it and most of the time it gets weekly updates adding new content companions timed quests etc. If youre not completely opposed to that style of game its worth trying.,skylanders,ceogpaa,1,t5_2ssor

134011,0,t3_1vmehs,Hello and welcome to the insanity that is Skylanders!Definitely get the XBOX One version as the DS version is...scaled down considerably. You can play with just those  figures as long as youre playing Giants or SWAP Force Chill amp Pop Fizz are not available in Spyros Adventure. Buying either of those starter packs would be a great start and even give you another  figures to play with.The Skylanders games can either be described as Gauntletesque or Diablolite depending on how old you are. Each figure you buy becomes a fully fleshed out character in the game whose appearance skills and stats can be customized in a limited fashion. When a character dies during they are unavailable for the rest of that level so you need to restart or switch to a different character. The best advice I can give anyone is that if this something that you want to get into you should set some expectations for yourself in regards to how crazy you want to go. You can definitely have fun with just a few characters but its very easy to go crazy and buy every single figure thats released and suddenly you have a room dedicated to your collection. Not that I know anything about that. ,skylanders,cetoz6j,2,t5_2ssor

Typically I try to beat the games prior to him playing so stuff is unlocked and everything. Well suddenly I realized I needed all  elements  then it started. Then I found ssa dirt cheap at a Kmart going out of business and it got worse. I have all  games and just broke the  mark on characters. I think my nephew bought .

We have a great collection and seldom pay retail watch the sale ads and you can get some bargains.  Usually toys r us has the best sales  sale price for the little ones is not unusual three packs can be got for around  for the older series.

You should show him the app and show him all the features including the wish list and leave it at that. See if he fills it up himself. The Skylanders website also has a wish list but thats harder to be subtle aboutJust make sure that whatever he adds to the wish list can be played in the version of the game he has. You can Google that if youre unsure or ask us here.And if you want to go the extra mile try to find a rare version of whatever character he chooses.

Koas traps even when I wasnt collecting I had seen them plenty in the wild.  As far as other problems people complain about trap team  trap of each color was all you needed and that was pretty simple to get. Trap masters well yeah every game had that Giants were Giants Swap force had swap zones this time they dumped that mechanic and just pushed for traps and trap masters.  Now were back to the swap force developers I am willing to bet that it will be just like swap zones for the new content.The hunt for me was the fun part I enjoy the collecting and the hunt.

Paid attention to the ever growing credits full of people who enjoy having a paycheck? The figure prices are covering alot more than that of a toy. Though that being said even at the toy level theres some pretty advanced shit going on at the manufacturing level.Lets also look at a real world example of someone asking a realistic amount of money to make a full game with a much smaller team If all you are going to do is bitch about the same things constantly then maybe Skylanders is not the game for you.,skylanders,cxr3424,0,t5_2ssor

6420422,0,t3_43kvfh,I cant really talk about Trap Team as I dont own it but as a Wii U player of SuperChargers I can say it runs acceptably at least from a technical stand point. I havent seen frame rate issues myself. I recently got it to Skylanders myself.. Ive come from the Amiibo side which you may know that Both the DK and Browser Skylander figures also function as Amiibo. DK and Browser will only work on Nintendo Consoles.The Wii versions of the Skylander games while cheap have some Frame rate issues during many Cut scene sequences. Also Super Chargers Racing on the Wii is a pure racing game.Anyway Ive read that Trap teams portal is probably the best portal to buy as every game works with it. I think it get a little tight with two Giants and a car on it. Personally Ive used the Wii Us Super Chargers portal on the Wii versions for the first  games as well as Wii U Super Chargers.Some things about Super Chargers every level has at least  Car driving Sequence which is often a required sequence. Most these are not much harder than the onfoot sequences. Outside one quest there is no requirement to race. Online is optional.I strongly suggest getting at least Two Skylanders one for each player and if youre buying Superchargers and not getting the Starter Pack at least Car. Getting a Giant Skylander for Giants and later will help out as there are many doors that Giants make easy. ,skylanders,czjepep,1,t5_2ssor

6696774,0,t3_47clld,i have played them all to  and beat them all on nightmare. the series definitely peaked with swap force. my son and i disliked trap team so much that we sold our entire collection and we were done with skylanders. superchargers came along so we picked it up on sale and before you know it we are back with triple the figures weve ever had.   even though hes getting a little older now  we love to play superchargers. although after we got  completion we just pretend like the air and sea areas and the racing hub dont exist. i agree they arent just fun. some of the land stuff in the levels is fun but the racing and the challenges for air and sea are zero fun. we have  vehicles total. wanted to just have  each for landairsea but tomb buggy is just too cool.  these are the reasons i hope the next game in the series lacks any new gimmicks and just goes back to being a traditional game with the   elemental gates that any skylander of that element can access those areas. and make whats inside those gates fun.,skylanders,d0c0601,2,t5_2ssor

I read about mobile games that trick kids into spending tons of their parents money on inapp purchases this is almost as bad. I agree with Rydralain. Activision needs to hear your crying child and all the other crying children. Parents please take this public. Maybe this can shame and embarrass them into fixing this for the children or at least scare the bejeezus out of them that if they dont fix it other parents will pass on Imaginators this holiday shopping season because they just cant afford anywhere up to  of these crystals on top of the figures themselves.,skylanders,d947yxd,1,t5_2ssor

10127028,0,t3_5kygow,The level skill upgrades money and even hats are stored on the figure itself so you can use it one whichever system you want. The only reason to get a WiiU over a PS version is off TV play if that interests you and a biggie for some people the ability to use Donkey Kong and Bowser. If you dont care about those things then PS is definitely a better choice in my opinion.,skylanders,dbrk39s,6,t5_2ssor
10127130,0,t3_5kygow,I dont mean to be a total fanboy over it but I think the Wii U versions of the game are far superior. They usually offer offtv play which can be great if you want to chill out on the couch or bed while playing or whatever but most of the games feature an extra feature the goals for the level. With a quick glance down you can see the level objectives how many bonus stuff there is to find and what the goals are including a timer for the speed run. Imaginators is one that has it I think the only one that didnt was Trap Team. I hated that one it had a really garbage low quality model of the villain that was trapped on the bottom screen.I suppose the PS version probably has better graphics though.,skylanders,dbrkkgo,2,t5_2ssor
