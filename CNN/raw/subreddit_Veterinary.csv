76312,0,t3_1uyl02,Well at some point you just have to realize that no matter what you do you might not be able to stop certain things from happening but you can do your best to keep them healthy. Good food exercise vaccinations and stuff like that will go a long way. But in the end biology is biology. You cant prevent everything.Case in point I have  dogs right now both Great Danes. The youngest one is Gus who is large even by Dane standards and he just turned . My older female is  . If I spent every day worrying about all the possible conditions that could affect both of them Id never leave the house. Heck with both of them Ive accepted that if something does go wrong theyre both so old that there may not be many real treatment options. But each day theyre still here is a good one and I try and focus on that.,Veterinary,cen47mw,3,t5_2rcd1

1532662,0,t3_2bq0mr, Those technical skills will be taught to you by the staff in the manner that they want you to do them. Every place has their way of doing things. But there is way more to being a good assistant than having technical skills.One of the best things you can do is simply listen. Listen way more than you talk!  Pay attention to what the client says and the questions that the veterinarian is asking. After awhile you will be able to anticipate what the vet needs before she even asks you. Try to stay one step ahead. You can sometimes start getting supplies ready because you know the vet is going to suggest a treatment based on the questions they are asking the client.Sometimes the vet might need help remembering something. For example if early on in the appointment the client mentions that they need flea meds for their other dog that is at home. If the appointment is involved the vet and the owner could forget about the other dogs flea meds. Rather than simply saying dont forget the flea meds in front of the client a good assistant will figure out a way to prompt the vet to remember the meds without the client knowing. This will make the vet look good and it will make you more valuable as an assistant.Sometimes the vet just needs a minute to think. Clients can be a pain in the ass if they are too intense or talking too much. If you notice the vet is getting distracted with a clients yammering on about the dogs awesome bloodline you can insert yourself in the conversation. Have them start talking to you instead of the vet. You can also do this at the end of the appointment when the vet is trying to get the hell out of the room. This can make you an awesome assistant.P.S. if someone comes in with a puppy you are almost required to take it around the clinic so that all the staff can hold it for a moment. Passing the puppy puts everyone in a good mood.,Veterinary,cj8e98q,2,t5_2rcd1
1751636,0,t3_2eixn2,Hi I definitely recommend Dyce Textbook of Veterinary Anatomy th ed. The best there is if you like colorized drawings but it also has a fair amount of photos.  If you prefer studying from photos I guess there is Knig Veterinary Anatomy of Domestic Mammals Textbook and Colour Atlas Sixth Edition. It is really expensive. The only other advantage besides the huge amount of photos is that the text includes the latin names of all structures. ,Veterinary,cjzya0a,6,t5_2rcd1
1972065,0,t3_2ha96t,Not an oncologist but I am a veterinary oncology nurse. So I can at least give you my perspective and my veterinarian and I generally share it. I adore my specialty. It is absolutely my place in the veterinary world. Whenever another nurse finds out my specialty I always hear about how depressing they think it is and how they could never do it and I honestly believe they are just flat wrong. All veterinary medicine has its depressing moments but I dont really feel like Oncology has more than any other specialty. I absolutely love the followthrough and relationship that we develop with our clients. We get to know them very very well. We see them almost every week during therapy and we the whole oncology team are their shoulder to lean on. Sometimes yes it gets tough walking them through the tough days or counseling an owner on when it is time but I dont think that changes from other specialties. Youre going to have those talks no matter what specialty you choose.I love the owners dedication to their pets. These clients are all in to give their pets a little more quality time on earth. I struggled greatly when I did emergency medicine. I couldnt stand watching young cats put to sleep because they were blocked and the owners couldnt afford to unblock them or were unwilling to do so or young puppies sent home with medications and hope because they had parvo and the owners had no money. That wore me down so quickly. But Ive found that its different with oncology. Yes there are clients with money struggles but by and large the clients who come to see us are all in. They will do whatever they can! I love the dedication.As for the death aspect that goes hand in hand with Oncology in all honesty we rarely euthanize our patients. Most of our patients choose to euthanize at their referring veterinarians office. I would estimate that my Oncologist only participates in  out of every  euthanasias of our patients. That said its always very hard to euthanize one of our longterm patients. We try not to get attached but when you see a patient every week for  weeks then through  relapses sometimes you get very attached and its hard to stay detached. All in all I think its very worth it. I love my job and know my Oncologist loves her job as well.,Veterinary,ckqu1qd,7,t5_2rcd1

3025546,0,t3_2urru6,Just a couple things to think about while youre considering a career change.Being a veterinary technician is far more physically demanding than being a dental hygienist. It can be pretty darn hard on your body especially your knees and back. Theres a reason vet techs in their s are incredibly rare hell even ones in their s are a pretty small minority.Are you aware how large the difference in compensation between DHs and VTs is?

3233903,0,t1_cowwtmr,No need to apologize thanks for teaching me something! P There are quite a few colleges in the UK that offers  year long vet nursing courses heres two Scotland has cheaper tution than England at least for Europeans. There is also one more course in Norway It became a bachelor this year and this particular course also gives you the opportunity to continue to become a Veterinarian in Slovakia or something for  extra years. The one in Oslo is moving to another university area s about an hour outside of Oslo in  I think new fresh space and buildings way more suitable than before! So if youre interested and decide to learn Norwegian or whatever that could be a nice thing the knowexperience.

7761192,0,t3_4litep,Hi Im sorry to hear about your cats. I work as a vet tech and we had a similar situation with our two hospital cats. It got to the point where we just let the cats roam in separate parts of the hospital so that they wouldnt interact. But I have heard of owners trying to give treats to their cats when they are in the same room so that they associate a treat with the other cats company. With cats it could take a longer period of time to get them to be normal around each other again. I have also heard of a owner alternating days for her cats one stays in the room secluded and the other roams and then she switches the next day. You could also try a type of calming agent that you could get through the veterinarian there are a few out there but for example at our hospital we have zylkene. It helps calm animals when they are stressed. I hope this helps!,Veterinary,d3odybq,1,t5_2rcd1

8009957,0,t3_4jew70,Good lord. Anyone  ANYONE who says its not worth it because of debt to income ratio is in the field for the wrong GD reasons. Theres a post herebadassvettech.blogspot.com that discusses the arguments from OTJ assistants in regards to credentials. Read it. Let me break it down for you. Medicine is a science. One in which the lives of actual living breathing feeling dependent creatures is on the line. Daily. Life is intricate. Life is precious. In human medicine those who are allowed to work in medicine are required to have a thorough understanding of life bodies how they work and falter medication side effects and pharmacokinetics etc. youre required to go to school and learn all sorts of things to make you worthy of working on living breathing feeling dependent creatures humans. And if you dont go to school and get some education thats uniformly standard across the globe youre just the human medicine equivalent of a candy striper masquerading as a Registered Nurse who was taught by some random Doctor that picks and chooses what parts of the standards of care that she deems comfortable. NOT the actual standard of care. Some will be good teachers most will be lax. And youd never know because you wouldnt have been taught the global standards of care and that does a disservice to every patient you encounter. This isnt some project that just anyone should be able to fall into and go through the motions and pretend they know what theyre doing after a few years. OTJ assistants dont know what they dont know and that makes them dangerous. If you think working in medicine  animal medicine or human  isnt worth the money of going to school your priorities are SO off. Dont be in the field. Because letting some kid off the street taught on the job by someone who may or may not do whats ethically and medically proper poke your pet is so irresponsible when you could have an actually trained professional in global medical standards with a thorough understanding of the potential ramifications of said poke taking care of your pet instead. We do this for the animals. We do this for the science and medicine. We do this because its whats right.  You get out of education what you put in so give it your all. Ive been a licensed tech for  years I work emergency and critical care and its my passion. Im damn good at what I do and my license opens doors for me that OTJ assistants will never see and doors that are closing for OTJ assistants. Keep in mind that vet Med is slowly becoming thankfully a more regulated field. OTJ assistants can no longer take the national exam in the USA. Most states ban the term technician for OTJ assistants. And many states have laws safeguarding the practice of licensed techs by forbidding unlicensed assistants from doing procedures like venipuncture anesthesia cystocentesis etc. Put your best foot forward in the best interest of the patient. Go to school. ,Veterinary,d4ge78s,1,t5_2rcd1

10497431,0,t3_5qav6i,I like my Littman I have a Cardiology III and I have had since I graduated .  I find a significant difference between the single tube I used as a student and the double tube cardiology ones but I held off buying the Cardiology III until I had graduated and was employed.  Although the head of your Classic II is large its not too large for what you need to do in clinics......until youre good enough at auscultation to be able to really localize the sounds I dont think size is that big a deal unless you are working on really tiny critters like neonates rodents small reptiles etc.  Even though my stethoscope is double headed I rarely have to use the pediatric size.  My recommendation would be to buy a double tube Cardiology stethoscope either now or after you graduate once employed since theyre about  more than a Classic model.Another option and reason to hold off a bit on the purchase is to try on other nonLittmann models.  If you can go to a trade show at a conference or a medical equipment supplier where you live you might want to consider some others I know people who chose Welch Allyn or Ultrascope and are very happy.  But if you are happy with the fit and quality of your current Littmann you may not want to change.  ,Veterinary,dcxzt2b,1,t5_2rcd1
