154609,0,t3_1vu6a7,Comedy and circus cabaret in Ireland. I was in Ireland on work Im a circus teacher by day and my bosses left halfway through the show. I was bullied into going up by a friend who knew I performed comedy. I think it was the nerves of knowing that a lot of the audience were professional contacts and the knowledge that others were a bit too young to really be present for some of the material I was doing at that point in time.I went up with the intention of a clean act. Sadly this act was by no means ready and I fluffed it. I panicked my brain shutdown my mouth went into auto pilot and I just launched into a fairly inappropriate set I know back to front. After realising what I was doing I then started censoring myself for damage control it was too late to start over so I just tried to clean it up. It was awful truly horribly awful.Lessons learned dont go in blind and dont let the judging eyes of your peers get to you. Ive grown since then because of that night it served as good motivation to fully write and form a clean set. So its not all bad.,Standup,cew1i2s,3,t5_2r18f

566027,0,t1_cg4lxhp,No offense man but your personal taste is shit. That was harsh I apologize Louis CK is a god and Burr is decent.  Pryor and Carlin are considered among the if not the greatest comedians to have ever performed not only that but Louis CK is heavily influenced by Carlin in particular. What aspects of ADHD do you see in Louis CKs standup? I ask because when I watch him I see morbid reality juxtaposed against uncomfortable topics and general malaise but I dont see him jumping around from topic to topic. In fact I would say that ADHD would be detrimental to a standup comedian I mean segways are a big part of the artform and just jumping around randomly is a good way to lose an audience. The only conceivable way your premise could be correct in my opinion would be with comedians in the style of Stephen Wright Stewart Francis or Jimmy Carr but their delivery is so dry especially Wright that youd need a couple of grams of cocaine to boost them up to the ADDlevel nevermind the ADHD. ,Standup,cg4m2i6,6,t5_2r18f

1342058,0,t3_29fo3m,I personally did not find it funny because of the fact that I kept digging for laughs none of my laughs came naturallyand i think it has to do with her delivery which I dont like. She just yells and bends down and widens her eyes to try and make people laugh. She reminds me of a female version of Carlos Mencia. Also her humor is very low brow and not very funny in general she pretty much just says that women do all of these things for men like shaving their pussy and taking cumshots so that they will love them? Idk i just thought its very cheap humor not very insightful and doesnt leave anything after watching it. ,Standup,cikli9w,8,t5_2r18f

1966231,0,t3_2h4z6u,I actually really liked a lot of your jokes. Just my  cents I like the character youre playing onstage. The short shorts and the matter of fact goofiness of it is pretty unique. If I had to guess I would say its just an exaggerated version of you. I do think you need to warm up the crowd to your character a bit with a some beats at the beginning. Not an actual bit or anything. Just stand up there for a second and say hi in your voice and stand with your characters body language and and let people take you in for a sec before you begin telling jokes right away. Look at how someone like Steven Wright gets up onstage and handles the mic when he takes it off the stand when he says hi how he rubs his hair or whatever he does. He does a lot to tell you what youre about to see and it keeps people from reeling a bit during his first couple jokes. It makes his build stronger and it makes his set stronger. ,Standup,ckq4rll,1,t5_2r18f

Oklahoma doesnt wanna hear a lot of thought provoking standup is a ridiculous statement honestly. Tulsa is an urban metropolitan area not the backwoods. People are educated and can devour stand up just as much as anyone else. Seeing Dave ripped was kinda weird but more power to him for getting his health in check.

A good example too is John Mulaney he does bits on Home Alone  by making it universal the joke being lost in a city with a grid system not about anything specific in the movie your audience can relate to feeling lost they cant relate to you saying when so and so fell down the stairs or his bits on Law amp Order amp SVU he explains it in enough depth that you get his angle even if you havent watched them.  ,Standup,cnvvrd5,1,t5_2r18f

The few people before me were doing poorly so I did a safe set that I was confident would do well. It did but Im not sure I gained anything from it.I did about  minutes at a brewery on Saturday night. Two other comics were going to do  each at like  pm after bands had been playing since  pm. I was drunk and knew the guys that set it up so I just asked if I could hop on and do a few minutes. They put me on first obviously which ended up being preferable. Id say out of the  people there about  were paying attention. It was outside people were playing cornhole talking to their friends buying beer. It wasnt the right set up or time for stand up but the people that were paying attention gave me a positive response. I did feel guilty because the two guys who were scheduled to perform they worked at the brewery and were also working the event did poorly and almost no one paid attention to them. Afterwards I went up to thank them for letting me on and I was surprised to see how upset they were over it not going well. Going into it I knew it wouldnt be the best crowd and I couldnt believe they thought theyd be able to win over a group of people that had been drinking outside for  hours especially when they were hardly paying attention to the bands. Im not sure if I expected too little or they expected too much. Overall good experiences. Probably wont go up tonight but Ive got a few new things for my favorite open mic tomorrow. ,Standup,cpo2wxg,1,t5_2r18f

3719189,0,t3_32zkla,Its kinda tricky actually. You seem to understand that standup is its own thing and its pretty tough so you may not want to expose your audience to your standup when youre new and probably not all that good. But at the same time you have the ability to bring people out to shows which is what gets a new comic booked before theyre any good.So maybe its a short term reward to utilize your audience to get spots but a long term loss to risk turning them off from your standup? I dont know what you do that cultivated that audience in the first place so its probably up to you to decide ultimately.

Most of them can eventually make a decent lowermiddle class to upper middle class living and expect to have a small but enthusiastic fanbase.

3732930,0,t3_3356ww,He also appeared in HulkBut doing this routine had a lovely knockon effect. When the DVD was shown on cable in the middle of the night in  a comicbook artist called Gary Frank saw it and subsequently drew me into the background of two frames of a fight between Doc Sampson and the SheHulk in Hulk . He even sent me the original artwork for free. In his selfserving egomaniacal and delightful blog the comedian Richard Herring portrays his life as a continual succession of moments so superb that the young Richard Herring would not have believed they could ever have happened. Until fairly recently my life was a succession of moments of which the young me would have been deeply ashamed or infuriated. But being in a Hulk comic would have been beyond my wildest dreams.In the same month as I appeared in Hulk  I was asked to go on the radio show of Jonathan Ross another split personality whose dark side leads him into destructive situations which destroy the lives of all around him. I did it gladly as it was always a great show. Ross is a highprofile comics nerd who once ran his own comics shop and has made some great documentaries about comics creators where he lets the endearing enthusiast in him come to the fore. I took along Hulk  to show him. Thanks for that Ross said having perused it and then put it into a sports bag beneath his desk full of promo DVDs games books CDs and other stuff given to him that day by people plugging things or just bribing him. But that was my only copy of Hulk  the issue with me in it and I had tried to get spares already but it was sold out. How could I tell Jonathan Ross that when I offered it to him it wasnt for him it was just to look at without highlighting the embarrassing fact that a man of his status now just naturally assumes that anything put into his hands is for him to keep? He could have used some of his million salary to buy his own Hulk . Its . or something. I bit my lip and let it go and subsequently the comics nerd and writer Ben Moor gave me his Hulk  in compensation. For me this Ross incident is worse than Sachsgate.,Standup,cqhs0tu,4,t5_2r18f

Its hard to get people invested emotionally into poptartshot pockets which is why Seinfeld and Gaffigan became such hot commodities getting people into heavy topics is a lot easier.Also a lot of people have opinions about those topics which are socially taboo and comedy is the only place where they feel their opinions being corroborated. ,Standup,cwngbab,1,t5_2r18f

Its literally descriptor of ridiculously named sex position wait for audience to laugh repeat a few times.  Occasionally provide humorous commentary.  Thats the laziest thing Patrice ever did which is why its not on any of his officially released material and motherfuckers are acting like she lifted something as creative as his Harassment Day bit.

Yes you can be funny while being politically correct and you can be funny while being politically incorrect. I dont think ones any better or worse. Theres a lot of different tastes. And I think being politically incorrect can be cathartic and can actually help bring people together by talking and laughing about our differences. Because we are all different racially culturally. And yeah sure sometimes people might joke about something that is a sensitive topic for you. But honestly thats just life. Its not anyones right to go through life and not be offended. People can be so afraid of their feelings.       Sometimes sensitive areas need to be poked. It can help not only the person whos sensitive by making them emotionally engage themselves and possibly grow as a person but also the person who does the offending. Maybe theyre offended by the same thing and using the joke as a way to cope or they didnt realize it would be so offensive but after telling the joke they do.      Sorry this got long. But my point is it should be okay to be offended and its okay to offend. If youre offended move on. No ones gonna blame you for it.

6523288,0,t1_czu0j0o, Its not because if you pull out to allow the comic to wave their arms stand at any angle than straight up or move you allow more ceiling or backsofheads to appear. Its dumb and allows negative space in the frame just as much as a portraitstyle aspect ratio will.Furthermore this just assumes that negative space is a bad thing. Most shots in film and tv dont utilize the entire frame with the action. In fact that would be chaotic. There would be no understanding of space context action or flow if the director always locked in on only what was moving or the focus of the shot.  So....youre acquiescing to the needs of people who are watching Netflix on phones a fraction of total Netflix users who wont tilt their phone on its side while viewing an even smaller fraction especially considering all Netflix content requires tilting the phone and most people arent so psychotic to refuse to tilt their phone. Its a niche need and barely even counts as need so much as convenience under rare and specific circumstances.gt I mean its called Standup comedy and not lay down comedy right?How does this at all prove your point?

6833333,0,t3_48wr9v,Thanks for all the comments really interesting. What seems to be apparent with almost everyones process is. Information usually comes first which is followed by jokes when... Our creative mind finds the funny  almost accidentallysome people do this on stage under the pressure some people need to sit and ponder it. Over time ideas go through a creative maturing process where the subconscious mind needs time to mull it over. Every time we come back to it it improves and takes more shape. Its good to see that when you boil it down most people have a similar approach and that there is a fairly standard method for what is a fairly mysterious process. Its like where obsession meets patience. Which I guess is true for all art. ,Standup,d0quy5j,1,t5_2r18f

From hosting to going first to near last of a  open mic and everything in between. Im learning how to deal all of it. To frame my sets differently for all sorts of situations making my funny more effective. My funny is a tool that I can apply in many different ways I just need to master it. I think it takes being obsessed to become great at stand up or most things. But stand up is brutal. Progress is slow and if you take too long a break god help you.

Id suggest fidgeting less with the cord and being more confident with your stance not pacing but if you feel more comfortable doing those tics it doesnt distract from your jokes too much. Trust your jokes and have them memorized with no note cards or as best you can! The jokes are good and the more confidently you tell them with less sos and uhs the better the crowd will respond.

9799612,0,t3_5fi4ei,Before I got into stand up I wrote for different mediums. I had a couple comic books and short stories published. It took me a while doing stand up to see how that influenced my comedy writing. The biggest thing is that my sets move in a linear fashion. I do this by not focusing on the set as a whole but by focusing on chunks. I get to do  on the regular now and at this point those sets are broken into three sections. Im broke momchildhood Im married. Now in those  sections I have multiple jokes that I can plug and play but because I have this arc in those chunks theres a through line that pulls everything together and the bitsjokes kind of fade and it becomes more of a cohesive story. Personally I think this keeps the audience more engaged and sets just kind of fly by. Hopefully not just for me but for the audience as well. So yeah if you already have bits stack them into chunks and really focus on how you move from one to the next. Inside of those transitions is a story. I bet if you really look at your jokes and honestly think why did I write this joke? Youll start to find a theme. Its probably already there. ,Standup,dal0i3g,4,t5_2r18f

I dont remember exactly what I said but I opened with something like Gosh I was all ready to serve up some hot dead baby jokes but I think that last guy really had the final word on the matter...

11077697,0,t3_5y61gl,gtHave you ever done sets that kill in darkly lit rooms with low ceilings but then get nothing at mics where the ceiling is high and everyone is spread out and the crowd has lights on them?Yes. gtIve heard stage time is stage time but whats the point of working bad rooms?Stage time is stage time. What else are you going to do with that evening? If youve got something better to do do that. gtIsnt it just demoralizingIt can be demoralizing but it sometimes turns out to be really cool. Sometimes you meet someone you wouldnt have otherwise met like after the show. Its kind of like rolling the dice. Maybe something cool or awesome will happen. gtand a waste of gas?Im a cyclist and I only attend mics within my small city. So for me at least I got some exercise. But Id say even if youre driving a car you can say at least you got out of the house. Again though what else were you going to do? Are you a super social person who would have driven somewhere like a party anyways? Being on reddit tells me that might not be the case. ,Standup,dennapm,3,t5_2r18f
