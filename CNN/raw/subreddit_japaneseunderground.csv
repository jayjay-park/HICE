6906112,0,t3_4abts3,Why the agressively editorialized post title OP? If you dont like the bands and what they are doing why post about them at all?  For the benefit of others  this is not a bad article about Boris amp Merzbow and certainly not an attack piece.   I thought this was an interesting quote  gtWhat I think of as blues music is probably native to those other countries Atsuo says. For our generation noise is music thats indigenous to Japan. So I like to think of noise music as the equivalent to the blues for Japanese people.,japaneseunderground,d0z4lbl,2,t5_30b8o
