1665364,0,t1_cjp2n8b,Going to school for CS tells those who live and breath this field  the ones making  figures that the person did not know this field at the start of college and  years is not going to fix that learning from a bad system.   The things they teach you in college about networking are about  accurate and still not applicable for how things actually work. Good example would be teaching people to Subnet or VLSM using a stair step method  they focus on that for weeks  nobody is doing that in the real world. You do not need to go to college to learn the OSI model  you do not need to go to college to have a CCNA which is really only applicable in a Cisco shop.School will land you a help desk job nothing more  those who think they learned alot in school during a CS degree do not know what they do not know.  Learning to program in Python  Perl  C on your own would be very helpful  and I have said this a million times but learning Linux will get you further than anything.

I just think many of those areas can be particularly deep and I respect those who have depth in certain areas like pcap analysis where they can recognize nearly all encryptionencoding techniques reverse protocols deobfuscate anything and can troubleshoot advanced networking issues or misconfigurations that may come off as suspicious and tip off the network admins to fix their junk. ,netsecstudents,cs1cezv,1,t5_2xqnu

Having education at the top makes it abundantly clear youre coming straight out of college and a good way to look more experienced is to put Education down lower. A good order might be Experience Skills Education Certs.Maybe see if you can fill out the related skills sections bit more especially with relation to any programming experience or languages your comfortable in. Especially for penetration testers a wide variety of skills look very good and if you have any personal projects or research this is the place to out those. Good job on including nontechnical skills as well many people dont realize those are necessary professional skills.Uhhh the arrows are a little weird as well mentioned earlier and dont worry too much about the resume feeling a bit bare thats normal and expected for new grads.Other than those not bad.Important note advice based on personal experience over the years your mileage may vary.,netsecstudents,cz61xno,6,t5_2xqnu

7168701,0,t1_d1rzf9v,What is the impact of the vulnerability based on the CVSS score. You should probably include a risk assessmentrisk score of what mission critical machines this vulnerability impacts. CVSS scores can be misleading... For example if a vulnerability has a high score but generally only affects some application found pretty much exclusively on desktop computers then it may not be super high priority and can be handled as a case by case basis. But if a low CVSS score vulnerability hits your front facing servers for which you use to service customers and causes even a slight disruption that could be a HUGE issue this would be a higher risk score.   What does the rule deliver? Can the alerts be useful if the False Positives are filtered out?False Positives are part of the job honestly I have very few rules that clearly identify a threat you need a trained eye and lots of due diligence when going through real time alerts or logs. Attackers do not want to be caught and therefore most use tricky methods to blend in with normal network traffic. Keep in mind some of these rules may need to be adjusted on the fly to compensate for APT and new various threats that get spammed to your industry. A lot of this seems to be hand cuffing your SOC analyst to a certain way of thinking. A rule set  years ago may not make sense today. You want to promote creative thinking which means giving your guys in the SOC the freedom to make choices and try things out. If I worked at a place with this kind of structure I would be polishing up my resume ASAP.Also if the CERT team isnt looking at the rules alarms logs daily why should they have any say? I am assuming the CERT team is not part of the SOC. Its almost like the Hardware team creating policies for the SysAdmins doesnt make sense right?,netsecstudents,d1t0idl,1,t5_2xqnu

If a doctor cannot access digitized data such as xrays there may be lives in danger not to mention regulation and compliance needs. So theyre likely to pay up quickly especially as they may not be able to afford the time needed to possibly perform incident response to recover their systems. Additionally as with many large scale businesses there are a large number of people unaware or susceptible to simple email malware campaigns making for a simple attack vector.

Im not there yet but so far the best thing I have found are mbit UMTS connections.... I could decide not to share and get my own personal one. Was your connection also a mobile one?

It is no secret that a CS degree is more difficult and therefore you are often times more competent  especially in regards to technical skills and technology in general. Of course a CS degree does not speak at all to business acumen but it is much easier to pick up a business concept than it is to pick up a computer science concept.And in general business courses will not be seen as more useful in network security or software engineering worlds theyre barely relevant for the most part. Technical and programming skills will be seen more useful not business. I know that kinds stinks to hear because its harder to do but a CS degree will open many more doors for you and will likely make you much more money. That all being said if you dont think youre cut out for the CS track then CIS is a good choice  and theres nothing wrong with knowing yourself.
