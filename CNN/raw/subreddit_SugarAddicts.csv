I suggest reading the I Quit Sugar book. it has some great ideas and her week program is not too harsh and eases you into quitting most sugars.Find someone you can talk to about your relationship with food. Someone who will support your journey.Carry around a journal or make notes on your phone. When I look back on how certain foods affects my body after I eat it i look at that food item as disgusting and not good for me. it sets a new habit of thinking.Its a slow fucking process but  ... youll get there. just be patient with yourself.,SugarAddicts,d7jv623,1,t5_2wx7d
9451626,0,t3_525l0m,I saw a dietician it was thankfully covered through my health insurance and it helped a lot.  She identified all my problems well diet related ones    and gave me meal plans told me what supplements to take and even told me I should be eating more at certain times of the day so I dont binge later.  I like having something to hold me accountable I see her every  weeks and if I do go off the rails she can help support me.I dont think you need medications it will be rough the first couple weeks but it doesnt last forever.  Your body GETS IT you start feeling better and not wanting so much crappy food once it gets a taste of real food.,SugarAddicts,d9e26gd,1,t5_2wx7d
