10061269,0,t1_dbizuad,gr bullets are a pretty safe bet in just about every twist rate in . with the exception of  which may give you stability issues in dense air aka cold weather in low altitudes.Also being that these are pretty good quality bullets you should be able to find a load that works well for your rifle in short order. Id buy them if I were looking for a bullet to start out with. Just keep in mind that theyre about twice as expensive as what most people normally buy for plinking bullets but your results should be superior. IMHO of course.,reloadingsales,dbj0aac,1,t5_3b0ww
