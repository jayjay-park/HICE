18144,0,t3_1ubv9w,The Army has a disadvantage when it comes to contracting services called Congress.Theres something called An approved vendor which is mostly something related to either a campaign contribution some form of quid pro quo bringing jobs to someones district some lawsuit or whatever else that is based on decisions to getting someone reelected. A congressmans job is not to serve you or to make sure that your tax money is being spent logically. Its to convince people paying them for their legislation that they have made a wise investment and for you to be scared that the guy running against him would do an even shittier job than he does.  Also there is a lot of money in being a lawmaker as in a lot of them even donate their paychecks to charity because their paychecks are not the prize here.A set of minimum criteria is met by the lowest bidder who also happens to be an approved vendor and there you have the governments contract approval process.Also the people approving these large scale projects rarely believe that they will be the ones to see it through to completion because they just put on their resume that they were the head of online project X that is being executed by the company theyre submitting their resumes too.If it worked properly the first time then the company who made it couldnt keep charging the tax payers for additional technical support and upgrades now could it?Sorry for the rant.,army,ceghyz1,17,t5_2qtr8

The schooling may last somewhere from  to eight months. Cant remember. They learn a lot of different things. My brothers roommate had one of those jobs when he went National Guard. They got into an arguement. The roommate moved out. Lived across the street. He somehow managed to disable my brothers internet from across the street. Scared my brother. I had a good laugh.As for being a soldier.... grow a pair. If you plan on going active you may one day have to fill the shoes of someone outside the wire. You may say  well I didnt train for this. The Army doesnt care. You will do what they say. And yes they do that. If they need a position filled... youll be one. You wont be infantry.

I think F gives one the best opportunities for advancement in the intelligence community after active duty but I am not sure if banking on an IC career after the military is smart right now. There are plenty of intelligence folks with lots of combat experience competing for scarcer jobs. Once Afghanistan is closed down for good it will be even tougher. As for the CIA I wouldnt count on that. They like to hire top GPAs out of select ivy league schools. Their culture is totally different from DoD. And the agency is infested with politicians. I hold the CIA in low regard so perhaps this is not a fair assessment. As far as being in the army goes L is a great job. Youre less likely to get stuck at what we call the tactical level. You might spend more time doing your job than burning time until  every day surrounded by combat arms folks who dont understand you and want to abuse you.

If you have family with you when you travel you should be able to get a weekend pass for that weekend reporting back by  on Sunday. Youll be assigned to either Bravo or Delta  Im not sure if either are in the nicer barracks yet or not but hopefully will be by the time you get there.First week will be inprocessing. Youll go sit in a big meeting hall from  to  most days that week do dental and medical update a bunch of paperwork all that fun stuff you do everytime you go somewhere new. First month youll be a phase IV meaning youll be in ACUs or PTs the whole time. Any time you arent inprocessing youll be doing cleaning details. Second week you may get into a class if not more details. By the third week you should be in class. Youll either be mids or days.Days schedule is or at least was first formation at   PT from  to . Then chow personal hygiene clean the barracks dont get caught sleeping until . Be formed up ready to catch the bus to the school house. Youll get to the school house form up by class do your report whos missing soldiers creed army song signal corps march then be marched in. Vincent Hall is a windowless prison. Youll understand later. Around  or so youll go outside to catch a bus to chow come back around  form up for accountability go back inside class until  or so clean your room and whatever else youre supposed to clean catch a bus back to the barracks. Close out formation mail call dinner then either details or whatever.Mids I was not a mid so I may be a bit off Wake up at  or so dress hygiene and all that. Marched to midnight chow catch buses to school house go to school. Get a mid day break at like  where you sit in the break rooms at the school house and try not to get caught sleeping more class clean up that stuff. Stand outside a little before  for flag then get on the bus back to barracks and breakfast.  form up for PT until ish. Free timedetails until time for final formation and bed check.First four months of school are common core youll learn about electricity electronics routers and switches and some of the systems we supposedly use. There will be written tests along with practicals for all tests you take and they will be timed. Second half youll be divided up into your skill modifier of either Tactical or Strategic. Tac focuses on transportable terminals like youd find on a FOB youll spend your time learning these things pretty thoroughly between classroom and hands on work with the equipment in the backyard. Strat deals with permanent to semI permanent rigs your big  foot dishes and the likes. Pretty much the same stuff but bigger and more powerful a bit more of the baseband side too. Youll mostly be working indoors so theres that. The class is a couple weeks shorter than Tacs. If youre Tac youll go to another two week class on WINT equipment after the school house. Gives some info on the equipment the army is beginning to phase in. Pretty important class.After your edumacation is all good and learned youll go on a four day FTX where you do different combat lanes land nav soldier type tasks. You may go to a range maybe just the simulator. Last day is a ceremony for induction into signal corps. Youll outprocess graduate and all that afterwards. You should find out your duty station the last couple weeks of common core. If its OCONUS youll go to a special briefing where theyll tell you more about what extra stuff you need to do to clear shots lots of shots.Because its an extended AIT you may be able to have your family if you have one move to the area and you live with them. First duty station. All I know is Tac find a fat body Sierra and ask them for strat. Monday is vehicle pmcs look busy and take care of your truck its yours after all kinda. Tuesday is signal maintenance turn your equipment on and test it. Wednesday details connex cleaning paperwork clean the motor pool or office study for the board just look busy. Thursday is sergeants time training different stuff every week maybe job related maybe army related. Friday is clean the motor pool make sure your vehicles are online clean and end of week formation.Field exercises sit around bored for  hour shifts fuel your generators make sure your equipment is good call in reports power balance and more sitting around bored.

Conscripts dont get promoted arent motivated and are generally not your topnotch soldiers.So the choice is obvious right?  Just sign up!Nope.  They wait until the military calls them up end up losing whatever civilian job they have and generally get screwed for the next two years.

911801,0,t3_242jv1,I had PRK in . I would do it again in a heartbeat. I just posted my account of the surgery here My Laser Eye Surgery Part II The PRK OperationTheres links there to other posts Ive written about what you have to ask before choosing a clinic. One of the many variables in the specific equipment used by the clinic is the true treatment zone exclusive of the taper zone or transition zone etc. This is key for nightvision. If the true treatment zone which is the only zone that has your corrected vision is smaller than your pupil at max width then youre going to get halos in certain scenarios.In practice the true treatment zone will often be smaller than the max width of your pupil. In such a case bright pinpoint lights will have halos. Halos are the simple result of having some of the light come through corrected so pinpoint but other light coming through your pupil through the uncorrected zone so blurry these overlap so you get faint halos around bright objects.When you think about it though and in my experience where my true treatment zone was as wide as available on the market your pupil only grows to its absolute full width when there are no bright lights around. In these cases there will be no objects bright enough to cause a halo as only a small portion of light goes through the uncorrected area.For example in very dark conditions say at night I can see stars with better than  vision zero haloing at all. However if say theres an LED light on something thats very bright in an otherwise pitchdark scene then its bright enough to cause a halo.Heres the thing though in only fairly dark conditions my pupil is contracted to below the halo threshold so I get no halos no matter what. This is the case when driving at night walking around in the city etc.Basically if your true treatment zone is close enough to your maxdilated pupil then the only times there will be potential halos will be when there are no bright enough objects to cause a halo.In practice I almost never have halos. The only time I notice it is in my windowless bathroom at night. Ive got a green LED on the walls safety outlet. It halos in pitch darkness. If I turn my phones lockscreen on holding it away from my face the brightness in the room goes up and I can see the halo shrink to nothing as my pupils contract. Its interesting!I have also written at length about why Lasik is not something Id touch with a foot pole. Dont do it. Its a dodgy quickfix and in my opinion far far inferior to PRK and other nocorneaflap surgeries. Stay away from the cornea flap!TLDR There are a staggering number of variables in Laser Eye Surgery even among the same flavour like PRK or Lasik or Lasek. Do lots of research before you decide!,army,ch7xeqe,1,t5_2qtr8

Being passive about it will just perpetuate the existence of stolen valor cases.  What happens next he is waiting on his Bronze Star wV and Special Forces tab?On a side note here is a short story from my deployment.  We had just gotten home from a deployment to Iraq in .  We were at our demobilization site in Fort McCoy WI.  We have literally been in the US for approximately  hours.  We had dozens of briefings and death by powerpoint.  We had plenty of time to go to the PX and enjoy ourselves while awaiting to go home.  One of the guys in my Platoon all of the sudden started wearing a Combat Action Badge that we all knew he hadnt earned.  Lets face it like  CABs were awarded in the whole company during the deployment.  They werent being handed out freely as they shouldnt.  This dude had the audacity to buy one in the PX and put it on.  We have literally just spent the last year with him know every mission he has been on and been buy his side through it all.  How does he think he could get away with it?  So about  of us  have noticed this and call him out on it one day.  He drops this line of oh I earned it on that one mission to redacted.  NO YOU DIDNT DUDE we were with you then.  No one earned it then.  Ya I did I have the paperwork!  NO YOU DONT GUY!  I wrote up all the paperwork for the entire platoon during the deployment on every award before it went to S there is no way you got this award.  Ya I sent it home to my wife already she has the paperwork and Ill have her email it to me.  Ya right guy keep on living the lie in your head.

Its probably a prerequisite for Warrior Leader Course almost sure it is actually and thatll help you in the way of promotion points. This is also probably a requirement for Soldier of the Month  Quarter boards in your AO. If youre serious about advancing quickly in the Army go to every school you can and go to every board you can. You will skyrocket through the ranks especially if you can win the higher level boards like Brigade and Division. These are also great discriminators later on in your career things that set you apart from your peers. . If you like the Army is your MOS the job you want to do until you retire? As a young Soldier with not much time in the Army theres plenty of options available for you to become an Officer although the field in which you operate may be hard to determine. If you dont like the idea of being a paper pusher you can always apply to become a Warrant Officer. That means you can be a technician all work no bullshit or a pilot. Also there are plenty of other jobs for enlisted Soldiers in the Army that you might not have known about when you signed up. Check the INOUT call to find out if theres something that is available to you that tickles your fancy bits enough to convince you to reclassify. You can find the INOUT call here Shoot me a PM if you want some more advice or have questions. I enjoy helping new Soldiers.,army,ck1pyq5,3,t5_2qtr8

1802857,0,t3_2f6g0z,I did SMP for my senior year when I converted to a GRFD scholarship. I was put in a BN HHC company and told to shadow a preBOLC LT who was triple slotted. I did so little during drill it was painful. I was literally the shadow to a guy who was a shadow to a guy who already had not much to do. I never went to AT with them because I had BOLC and in the end I only did something like  home station drills with them. So it wasnt for very long.Looking back on it I kind of wish I had just gone to a different unit because I had friends who were in solid units with actual jobs. Like everything in the Army it depends on the unit. Hindsight if I couldve gone to the unit I eventually ended up in as an officer Im positive it wouldve been a great learning experience.Oh and definitely keep in touch with your readiness NCO. If you dont they wont track you down and youll fall through cracks and no one will come looking for you.

Im talking about skinnyfat troopers who sham through PT have a gut hanging over their shorts and do . Im talking about that SSG who is so indispensable that he lets himself go because everything in his section goes through him and now Soldiers think that you just need power to do what you want. Im talking about my peers fellow Officers who fat up and then look Soldiers dead in the eye while they flag them for  over.So a measurable goal is to take SSG Snuffys BF Worksheet and type SSG Snuffy you will lose one inch from your waistline every month for six months. Exceeding that goal at the end of ninety days will result in a lifting of the Bar. If you have not lost six out of the forty inches or whatever would make him not look like a tubbaguts in your waist you will be separated for Failure to Overcome a Bar. SimpleIve had my struggles with weight in the Army and have even failed PT tests. But I set goals worked hard and overcame that and now I am the example that I would like to have if I were a Soldier a tough but fair leader who doesnt let anything slide if its not good for the unit.The Army is not looking for a troop who is stud in every category.

You really will have to ask the ROTC recruiter as they will be able to help you with the specifics since everything is changing. As for competitiveness its not so bad. I went to camp came back and got a contract the first few weeks of school as well as a year scholarship. I had a . Undergrad GPA and was president of some organizations and had a job for  years if that helps give you an idea of what they are looking for. As a grad student you will be seen as more mature so that can be helpful as they will take you more serious.

I wasnt the most disciplined cadet that year to say the least. Sometime at the beginning of the semester I snuck a mini fridge into our barracks. It wasnt a tiny fridge it had its own freezer. It was taller than my desk. I hid that bitch using my poncho liner and my ruck and other shit to make look like a giant gear pile. I also had a microwave a dual burner hot plate and a whole set of pots and other cooking materials hidden in my room. Well several months pass and someone in my company didnt like it. he later got booted for an alcohol related incident. He told on me and they searched my room finding I ran fully functional kitchen out of my tiny room. I got called into his office and he looked like he wanted to choke slam me.

You get your medical shit done go to briefings. Typically you show up at  and are done by . Pretty easy.Weeks  are Tactics weeks. No PT still so you have to work out on your own.In week  you usually get on a bus at  go to the tactics place and get a refresher on all the basic stuff you should have learned in your commissioning source like small unit tactics land nav convoy stuff etc. Usually the bus shows up at . The Friday of week  is the land nav test. Its done in pairs and the course isnt particularly challengingits just flat and the maps are kind of old. You need  points to pass. It starts early as shit like  early so you get some night land nav in there too.Week  is range week. You show up at  to draw weapons do some shooting go home around  every day. I had fun with it. You qualify at some point and its one of the newest qualifying ranges in the army so its super easy. Weapon is going to be MAs with iron sights. Week  is the FTX. For you at least. We had two weeks of tactics then we went to the classroom for a couple months then had the FTX. Supposedly its week  now so theres that. Its basically just a whole lot of fuck fuck games. You get one or two graded positions and those can be anything from vehicle commander to platoon leader so theres no real uniformity of experience. Lots of wasted time. If youre smart you can get through it without firing any blanks and work on getting the crew served cleaned faster at the end.Overall a continual theme of tactics is loads of wasted time. Bring a book.After that its really TAC dependent. You start organized PT which goes from  to  and you usually start class at  or . The classes kind of all blend together and depending on your TAC you can expect to end the day anywhere from  to  with about an hour and a half for lunch every day. Early on you have an APFT which will probably be shitty after three weeks of tactics if you dont work out on your own. A week or so before graduation you have something called FIX MIX which is similar to tactics except for the fact it seemed more relevant and useful. It gives you an idea of the maintenance workflow in a maintenance company.more to follow Im posting this from a Dennys where my wife and I stopped for dinner en route to Army Navy After fix mix its just graduation which is no big deal and then youre off to your unit.If youre waiting for a follow on school you then go to blackbirding which is pretty chill.

Before he passed he was scheduled to see a doctor at the VA and he needed to write down three of his most harrowing experiences there.  Without telling me what it was he gave me a sheet of paper hed hand written that he wanted me to type up so he could send it to the doctor.  Two sentences in I knew what I was reading and just kept saying holy shit holy SHIT over and over to myself as I wrote it.  It was like something out of UpCountry by Nelson Demille which makes sense bc he was there too.I still didnt ask him about it though.  I figured if he was feeling chatty hed talk.  Anyways he passed and then I found his medals and the letters explaining them.  Two Bronze Stars with Valor and one with Valor and an oak leaf cluster I cant tell the color two Purple Hearts and a shit ton of others.  I hadnt truly understood the significance of the stories Id typed up at that point.  He didnt write them because he was proud or because he was bragging.  He wrote them because that was when he was most terrified.  And for that very reason I agree if he doesnt want to talk leave it alone.

He found an open door to a room that wasnt his went into their bathroom layed down finished shitting and puked everywhere. Had to call the emts because he wouldnt wake up.

Ive had one great commander and a shitty impersonal one.Unfortunately my awesome CO and my fantastic PSG are both now at West Point.  My first team leader who was fucking awesome etsd this time last year my other awesome team leader is now at ranger school.The common point between these four men who shine like brilliant diamonds among the mediocre?  They cared.  My CO made a point as busy as he was to converse with us as people.  He remembered life events family details.  When we had a field problem and we didnt perform the way he expected he examined himself and his officers direction and planning first and worked with his SG and PSGs to make sure he was better the next time.  When people fucked up he made them toe the line but he made sure once their punishment was over they were back in the fold.  Anf this was during a time he had to initiate over  separations.My awesome PSG kept us organized kept us busy with useful things.  And when there was nothing useful needing done or training or anything he would tell us all to pop smoke stay on post and keep our phones on.  Didnt happen much but was awesome and a nice break when it did.  Again when people fucked up he brought it to attention.  He made us work and play as a platoon.  In the field he demanded the best from us.  And when we were done it was time to relax.

3132468,0,t1_comnzut,Ive heard that as well. The only problem with that they either dont see or cant afford is when you force out the people interested in schools and college youre more likely contributing to brain drain. An oft overlooked reason why the Roman Empire fell to its enemies is because of brain drain from civil service and the military. As the tax burden increased on local elites more and more people who would have been the most educated found themselves in monasteries or in secluded prefeudal estates. This left more and more mouth breathers to lead Romes army against Germanic hordes. Whereas in the Republic and early Empire the best men gravitated towards civil service and the military.  Now that is a little bit of an extreme historical example youd expect to find on some nutjob political website but what is important to take away is that brain drain has serious consequences over the course of decades and if were going to become a leaner force we should expand opportunity for those who remain so we can recruit retain and develop the best soldiers. ,army,comofh8,3,t5_2qtr8

3202192,0,t3_2wryne,First GO I met in person was the Major General taking over at Campbell while I was there. He was a super cool guy very nice and personable. Hed just taken over the st right before this story. He was coming in to the hospital for a CT scan and of course since they do them by appointment we knew about it several days of time. My NCOIC made sure to educate us on purpose customs and courtesy and generally not embarrass him in front of the post commander. Well MG HIPAA comes in and starts saying hi before we even get the chance to jump up and call attention. It was just me as a student one permanent party tech and two civilians there at the time. He shakes everyones hand and chats for a little bit. He asked me why I was wearing the square Army logo unit patch instead of the USA MEDDAC patch. We get done chatting and I do the exam which involves giving him an IV. He thanked me for getting the needle in on the first try and that was that.  The crazy part is that I graduate AIT get here to JBLM and one day Im in the operating room talking to one of the nurses or techs up there and it turns out that he knew this officer personally from before he was CG at Campbell. ,army,cotwnhl,1,t5_2qtr8
3202544,0,t3_2wpv43,I agree largely but I think part of the general gripe is that occasional disproportionate attention paid to PT score. In some cases soldiers are getting AAMs and COAs and Commanders Coins for getting a  on their PT tests and getting accolades and promotions simply by virtue of that fact. The APFT is treated as though its actually a seriously holistic scientific and indisputable measurement of an individuals physical fitness and how their fitness measures up against their peers.This ignores the fact that the test is easily gamed by practicing only the  events on a daily basis. Its one thing to train to standard but training to a test promotes test results not fitness. Its the same issue that many academics take with state standardized tests in elementary schools. It results in the focus of the education system being achievement of good test results not necessarily academic achievement,army,cotxys8,1,t5_2qtr8

3610655,0,t3_31owx2,All right rArmy Ive got OPI tomorrow and want a good nights sleep but your wellbeing is more important than my career. Or maybe Im just a nightowl. Either way Im gonna give you the stonenuts way to buy a car from a dealership gleaned from my time as an honesttogod car salesman at an American luxury car dealership. Find the car you like on the Internet. Research. Go to the dealership after hours or late late in the afternoon and look at it. Flee the salesmen. Like get in your car and escape and whatever you do dont give them your real phone number. Think of them like dependas because like a dependa they want your money for something you could moreorless do for yourself. Call the number in the phone bookinternet. If its a sole dealership they just sell Chevy etc ask for the Sales Managers name. If its an AutoMall multiple makes are sold ask for the Isuzu Sales Managers name or whoever. Be creative I was talking to the Honda Sales Manager last night at the Applebees while I was flirting with the waitress who is divorced with three kids what was his name again? You dont want to talk to him on the phone you just want his name. Go see your bank. USAA will preapprove you for a loan use it. Figure out how much the bank will lend a PV you will be surprised at how much it is. Once you have a rate and a dollar amount match it to your car. If they wont lend you enough to buy the F TurboDiesel SmallPecker Compensator you need to aim lower. Pick a car within the budget that your bank gives you. If it matches and by matches I mean the MSRP is no more than  greater than the amount the bank gave you you are set. Walk into dealership and tell the first person who approaches you Im here to see Joe Biden we spoke the other day and he told me to come down. The reason you are going directly to the sales manager is simple Joe Biden isnt paid by commission he is paid by volume. He wont dicker about the price because he doesnt care how much over the XO XO is a term that denotes the minimum amount of money the dealership is prepared to make on a car. Anything over the XO is gravy and the salesman gets a taste of that overage the car goes for he just wants tick marks on his whiteboard for units moved. If Joe tries to kick you down to a salesman unlikely tell him you want to make a deal right now and you dont want to talk to anyone else. Appeal to his vanity. Tell Joe that you want the particular car that you picked out at the price the bank gave you. Dont be afraid to lowball the loan amount if the bank said theyll give you  tell Joe that youll do . You can always meet at . If Joe says ahhhh man cant do it then walk the fuck out. You should have been smart enough to have looked to see the Kelly Blue Book value of the car anyway so use that as a guide. If Joe wont move on the price try to get him to throw in taxtagtitle or free gas for a year or a couple of tix to the Avalanche game or whatever. Everything is negotiable. Use words like today or now prodigiously. It may seem silly to say Joe how are you today? I was looking at a car today and Im really interesting in making a deal today what kind of deal can you make me today so I can go home in a new ride today? but thats exactly what salesmen are trained to do to you. You want to make him think that you will walk out with a set of keys... today... but its his deal to lose. Dont be afraid to talk to their finance guys and see if their rate is competitive with your banks. Dealership finance guys also highball the interest rate that banks give you because if the bank says  and they close at  the Fi Guys get to split the  overage with the bank. Oh yeah. Everybody in a dealership is getting a piece of your ass so negotiate erry goddamn thang those cool aftermarket rims youre adding on? The salesman has highballed the price because he gets  of overage on parts. If the Fi Guy says  come back with  undercut your banks offer to see if he can compete. And who gives a fuck that the Fi Guy was in the Army really? He was probably an NCO who fucked over a Joe or two in his time so dont let his war stories confuse you.TLDR Cut out the salesman do your research walk when it gets hinky and create a sense of urgency negotiate erry goddamn thing.EDIT So I edited.

3779212,0,t1_cqmqji1,As a former contractor and a contracting officer while active duty most contractors get paid very good money.  The reason for that is that most contracts have a huge and I mean LARGE profit buffer in the bid.  For example I was paid around  for one contract.  Because of US laws you are allowed to request the original contract.  The contract for my position was paid over .  That is a lot of overhead  for  employee and what the company puts monetarily towards that employee i.e. medical retired have tricare so no costs dental stocks life insurance and k.Overseas positions especially in hardship areas are paid even more a lot more.While a company may lose a contract due to being outbid the employee usually will retain the position with the new company and either keep the same pay rate or usually get a slight kick in pay to encourage that experienced employee to jump ship and go on a new one.Negotiation is the key that is why you should become well versed with contractors before you seek a job and squeeze them for a round figure on what you can expect to receive in compensation for a position.Going the GS route gives you better job security but you are stuck inside the biggest friend zonepecking order for promotions.  You must do your time before they even think about considering you for a higher grade.  You usually dont get promoted unless someone dies and you fit that position or you suck a lot of field grade dick.  That is up to the individual.,army,cqn22s7,2,t5_2qtr8

4263070,0,t3_39rxmv,Ive shared this before but here goes.  I call it In Which a Recruiter LiesSo no shit there I am a fresh faced year old needing to do something with my life.  A short stint in the military sounds like just the ticket  gets me out of my crappy hometown puts money in my pocket and food in my belly and in  or  years Ill get out go to school with my GI bill and have a happy live.  The local strip mall had a slew of recruiting offices all right next to each other.I go in a recruiters wet dream.  I scored remarkably high on my ASVAB which I only took to get out of class for  hours so I could pick pretty much any job I wanted.  But did I do that?  Shit no I walked in thumped my chest and said Im ready to go today whats your best offer?The Army guy asks what Im interested in and I tell him that I really dont care just something relatively safe this was pre but I knew that Soldiers had a chance of getting shot at and something that would give me a marketable skill.  Like medical  everyone always needs medical folks.He asks about my hobbies  mountain biking snowboarding rock climbing typical adrenaline filled activitiesHe types some stuff in his computer and comes back with How about a combat medic with the th Ranger Regiment?  You know Airborne Rangers like Nic Cage n Con Air?Well whats that get me long term?Well youll be at least a paramedic so you can get a job just about anywhere.  Youll be part of the Special Operations community so youll avoid most of the big army bullshit and youll be part of the Rangers so youll do highspeed stuff like jump out of airplanes and fly around in helicopters.OK I think this isnt such a bad deal.  I agree but not before carefully asking how this will play out  I dont want to end up as just a grunt.This is what he says near as verbatim as I can remember almost  years later Well the Rangers are part of SOCOM a type of Special Forces.  So every soldier needs to have a bare basic level of ability to fight just in case the shit hits the fan.  So everyone and I mean everyone goes through Infantry basic training to get that bare level of skill.  Then everyone goes to airborne school to learn how to jump out of planes. Then youll go to whatever job school.  You will got to San Antonio to go to medic school.  The artillery goes go to artillery school the parachute riggers go to rigger school etc.  Then everyone shows back up at Fort Benning to join the regiment.In my year old mind this makes sense and I am impressed with the forethought the Army has put into this.  Of course medics might end up in the thick of it so why wouldnt they want to know how to fight? I agree we go to MEPS my contract gets drawn up as X.  Now I know from looking at the posters on the wall that  series is infantry but it only lists B C H and M so I figure the X is for the guys like me that are just going through infantry basic and then off to another job.Fast forward  months and Im cruising along through basic solid in my knowledge that as a medic I will probably never need half of this shit so Im happy to just play the game.  The day comes when the Drill Sergeants break us down into our respective MOSs so we can go to any required extra training like the Cs who have to go learn how to shoot mortars.  Bs in that corner Cs over there Hs up here by me and Ms over there by Drill Sergeant Whateverhisnamewas.  Now!I PVT xixoxixa am the lone asshole standing in the bay by himself.Drill Sergeant where do you want the medics to go? I ask.Goddamn it Private!  This isnt rocket surgery  there aint no fucking medics here!  Get where you belong!Ah!  I see his mistake  he doesnt know that Im an X not one of these other dumbasses destined to be a grunt.  Briefly I find it odd that this E with many many years in the Army can be so obtuse and in need of correctionbut maybe hes not familiar with this program. So I tell him such  Drill Sergeant I see where your mistake is.  Im supposed to be a medic Im just doing Infantry Basic.Through his clenched teeth and skyrocketing blood pressure he tells me Private bring me your. GOD! DAMNED! PAPERWORK!!I happily dig out my contract and go wait at a textbook perfect Parade Rest outside his office.  He calls me in sits me down and leafs through my shit.  As hes flipping through he directs me to tell him exactly what my recruiter told me.  I do in exquisite detail happy to know that the student has become the teacher.He looks at me like this  and then calmly says Private I know we talk a lot of shit about recruiters but you  you got fucked.He then proceeded to tell me how the Army really works and explains to me that the X I was so proud of means I will complete basic go to airborne school then show up at the th to be whatever kind of Infantryman the Rangers need me to be.I spent the rest of basic poring over that contract in extenuating detail trying to find a loophole but alas despite my best effort my first MOS in the army was as an airborne infantryman.,army,cs65zt2,23,t5_2qtr8

4630494,0,t3_3bn9zz,Two years ago I tried to enlist but got myself into a weird situation. When I was younger no older than  I had been given an inhaler for asthma by my doctor. I do not believe I was ever officially diagnosed with asthma. I had told my recruiter about this and when I got my medical documents there was nothing there about asthma or an inhaler. My recruiter told me to not worry about it. Then I filled out a medical pre screen the same one they have you do at MEPS. When filling out the pre screen at MEPS I had marked yes for inhaler use. The doctor brought up that my two pre screens didnt match up. I told him the MEPS pre screen was correct but we didnt have the records to prove it. This was a long time ago but I faintly remember someone maybe the doctor saying that if I had switched health care providers at some point the records that they have may not be with the ones I have now. I dont know if thats true and I didnt know this at the time.In short the doctor gave me a sheet of paper that he had written onMTR Asthama  Inhaler useIts a copy of a USMEPCOM Form RE if that helps at all.MEPS had me call the recruiter in charge at my towns station and explain what was going on. A different recruiter I had never met from the same station came to get me from MEPS. I could tell the word got around because he was not exactly happy with me. We got back to the station and the recruiter doing all my processing seemed ok with it all and told me he couldnt do much at the moment. So I went home for the day. I determined that it was not the right time for me to be enlisting so I called my recruiter and let him know that I needed time to think about this. I made a huge mess of it all by not researching my options and thinking it was simple I went in and said I want an x opt.. I went to MEPS with a D and basically handed the reigns over to anyone but myself. I should have DEPd but didnt I should have looked for help here and elsewhere but didnt. I really want to start over. I would like to know if there are any steps that I can take right now before I go back to the recruiter? How slim have I cut my chances with this asthma thing? Should I collect all of my records from all my past health care providers?Or should I just call up my recruiter and explain whats going on with me now?,army,cte8t5b,1,t5_2qtr8

They were decked out we were rolling in soft top humvees and the mortar platoon was preparing to receive roughly  rounds of mms mortars. Ammo guys show up and drop the ammo near the top of the hill. Marines call in an air burst casing flies right at us about  feet above the ammo dump. It skips off the ground snaps a tree in half winding up in a civilians yard. They ask one of our NCOs should we check fire? Our NCO gets on their comms and screams check fire. Marine FOs scramble to the treeline before range control comes and inspects the mark left by the casing and find it  meters outside of post. Marine FOs feign ignorance until our SFC yells that they couldve blown up the entire hill. Also in MEPS had two guys trying to get into the Corps making fun of everyone not with the USMC sticker for being pussies. One scored a  the other a  or something on the ASVAB.

It became quite the bit of hubbub.  Everyone was upset that someone would dare ask a CSM a question like that.  Like he had broken some unspoken rule of not asking serious questions.

Kiss your computer monitor because this is a monumentous occasion in your rarmy life and you will never see its equal.A regulation through which you might like to dig is  AR  Management Acquisition and Use of Motor Vehicles. I mentioned some sections in it before in this comment. In fact this very topic as a whole came up before in the thread I commented in earlier  Im surprised you havent been banned for not following Guideline . Read through my comment read through that regulation read through everything to which I just linked you right now.  Bottom line up front No. You dont rate government transportation and yes you do have to spend your own money on getting yourself to work. Like uxsaicoticx and so many others have said in this thread your salary is your recompense for any expenses you incur. The Army gives you money. Some of that is designated for food. Some is designated for housing. Some is taken away automatically. You still have some left. Spend it on gasoline. Its  whole miles. I live off post  miles from my place of work. I am not allowed to live in the barracks. I get BAH but the Army doesnt give me or anybody else extra money for gas and car expenses. Youre not a special flower. At least you have a bicycle and can ride to work. You can take the advice in this thread or discard it. Your choice.

These dudes complaining about needing to bring back wall to wall counseling are the same ones complaining they cant find management jobs even though I was a SLPSG for x amount of years!  They have no true management leader skills and relied on a mix of aggression intimidation and rank to get dudes to get work done.  That shit doesnt fly in the real world.  Look at the responses that private got when asked what should he do because his TL pushed him to the ground.  Try that in the civilian world there wouldnt be a JAGof all people telling him to suck it up because you might ruin this NCOs career.  The police wouldve been called and this dude fired.  Yes there are some fields that this kind of behavior would be slipped under the rug oil rigs construction etc. But the majority would not tolerate it.  ,army,cv4dwsa,7,t5_2qtr8

We would save no lives. It would be unjustified murder with zero gain. Even with unconditional surrender whatever the fuck that means in a conflict like this the ideologies that give certain groups such recruiting potential would not vanish. Theyve been around for over a thousand years. Hitler wasnt successful at eliminating Judaism thank god and there is not a half a sliver of a chance that wed be successful at eliminating the general hate of the West that has encapsulated enough Muslims in the Middle East to be a threat. Who would that even save? What would it accomplish? Wed be murdering the very people that ISIS wants dead along with them and giving any potential survivors every fucking right to want all of us who stood by and let that happen dead. Ive heard this sentiment before and I think it is the most ass backwards thing a person could possibly come up with to solve the situation over there. Wed be a x better off by doing literally nothing at all than doing that. I cannot think of a more stupid response than this.Human rights arent optional.

5407567,0,t1_cw2r6vg,Basically you apply for VA benefits if you have all of the injuries and treatmenthow it disables you from having a normal life recorded in your medical records or with a civilian doctor. Apply for your VA benefits NOW! If you get approved and get  and cannot work in the civilian world because of it they will also fast track a disability claim with Social Security for you. I get about  a month from my  VA and Social Security. Also you need to know that there is not any applying for a med board. You are referred by a Commander an MMRB Medical MOS Retention Board or by a military doctor. In order for you to get this issue addressed you have to try to get your commander to initiate a MEB or get seen by an military doctor who should initiate based on how you have described your conditions. Try to ask through command channels for referral to a military doctor. They may be resistant usually due to a lack of knowledge on their part or not wanting to pay for TDY or travel. Ask verbally but follow up in writing. You want everything on paper. Honestly though Ive never heard of anyone getting Medically retired from the Reserves or National Guard. Even if you get VA disability and Social Security you can go to drills. You may want to ask about reclassing if you cant perform your MOS or get a P profile from a military doctor and become nondeployable for the rest of your enlistment in the Reserves. Youd basically stay on rear D if your unit deployedwent to annual training. Im not  certain but I dont think that they will MEB you out of the Reserves since theres always some role that you could fill. Shit ask to reclass to a chaplains assistant position or some staff job or something. Hope this has helped some.Apply online for your VA disability like yesterday. I can help you if you need help withe process.,army,cw2vl2x,1,t5_2qtr8

Like I said one could fight an enemy with the aim of neutralizing them as a threat but without the intention of killing them. That is acceptable. But willing their demise and then purposefully killing them isnt morally licit. Im allowed to shoot the enemy who is shooting back at me in the chest to stop him from shooting me.

If theyre going to fire you they have to give a more specific reason than performance issuesedit Yes I realize that employment atwill states can fire you without cause. THIS DOESNT APPLY WHEN YOURE IN THE RESERVESNATIONAL GUARD. IF you are and they try to fire you they have to give a specific reason as a defense against wrongful termination. edit  Guys I get it. The military does an excellent job of making you think you have no rights. I used to think that too before I got out and learned a little bit. Almost all employers know about the USERRA if they pretend not to or try to intimidate you KNOW YOUR RIGHTS. If a civilian employer is going to fire you because you work in an at will state and technically they dont have to give a reason for firing you when you are in the National Guard and your firing isnt for some kind of gross misconduct then you have a case for wrongful termination and the employer will have to prove a specific reason for firing you if they get sued. edit  Since everyone seems to want to sharpshoot me yes the servicemember has the initial burden to prove discrimination but that burden shifts to the employer to offer a defense once you offer enough evidence to have a plausible case. Thats why I think its worth it to get a lawyer unless you really did deserve to be fired. ,army,cx95wej,20,t5_2qtr8

My guess is if you are working with an Active recruiter that they are working real hard to try and get you X and when they fail all your paperwork will be done and they will try and get you to sign for Reserves.That is a discouraging prospect. They said that if the waiver doesnt go through I could go reserves remake E and attempt to get to SFAS and go active then.

But if you dont educate yourself as much as possible before talking to one how will you know if you have a good one or a bad one? Ill provide some sources for you down below to get some of your questions answered. Reddit is cool and all but there are better sources for figuring your path out. I am a Former Recruiter a few years out of the loop and by no means an expert on SFalthough I did put  selectees in. You can go through selection multiple times as a nonselectee as long as you dont show shitbag tendencies. It is unlikely that your second chance will be right away. I think they understand that people grow but growth takes time so they would probably send you to Big Army to grow up for a year or so before you could try again. If you quit I think its very difficult to get a second shot. No  year contracts  is the minimum I believe might even be . The whole process of earning the tab takes  years or more. The Army is not going to spend that amount of time and money for you to get your green hat and then get out right away. If you are a successful college student the ASVAB should be an absolute breeze. Lots of free study materials online. Brush up on math if it has been awhile. If you have a BSBA before shipping to basic you will ship as an E. In a different post I mentioned Chosen Soldier by Dick Couch. If you continue thinking about this career path without reading that book I would question your intelligence.

Since then Ive met and heard him speak at least a dozen times I wont even try to quantify how many times Ive read his stuff in the last  years.Id consider him a contemporary of Clancy.  Some of his books were excellent some less so.  Red Army is great and good companion to Harry Coyles TEAM YANKEE BTW Coyle was also at Ft. Hood at the same time.Yea he was a little butt hurt about not getting a battalion command.  Unfortunately those things happen to lots of great officers when the Army downsizes.  Just look around today.Is he an ass at time who speaks his mind...absolutely.  Go read some of his editorials and articles in service publications back in the late s.  Hes a guy who wasnt concerned about calling BS when required.  Speaking truth to power is not a problem.Sure he didnt deploy so didnt most officers of his generation midlate s to late s didnt either including multiple GOs who have given excellent service in the current conflict.  If you are in the service all you can do is go to work everyday and do what your country asks.  We dont get to choose the missions the nation gives us. That being said Im not going to defend him for calling the President what he did.  I didnt appreciate it when folks on the left had policy disagreements with the previous POTUS and called him all types of at times vile things I shouldnt appreciate degrading the dignity of the office when I disagree with what those policies are.

Which means Trump is included and shes making a direct statement to him  which is obviously meant to be inflammatory towards him lets not feign ignorance.DOD Directive .SUBJECT  Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces  ... A member of the Armed Forces on active duty shall not                ....  Participate in any radio television or other program or group discussion as an advocate for or against a partisan political party candidate or cause.               ...  Subject to any other restrictions in law a member of the Armed Forces not on active duty may take the actions or participate in the activities permitted in subparagraph ... and may take the actions and participate in the activities prohibited in subparagraph .. provided the member is not in uniform and does not otherwise act in a manner that could reasonably give rise to the inference or appearance of official sponsorship approval or endorsement.             ...  Activities not expressly prohibited may be contrary to the spirit and intent of this Directive.  Any activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associating the Department of Defense or the Department of Homeland Security in the case of the Coast Guard or any component of these Departments with a partisan political activity or is otherwise contrary to the spirit and intention of this Directive shall be avoided. Do we know shes Enlisted and not an Officer?...  Commissioned officers shall not use contemptuous words as prohibited by section  of Reference b or participate in activities proscribed by DoD Directives . and . References g and h respectively. Link to an Army.MIL article that talked about this during the  election season and references a social media guidelines that was put out.Highlights from that includeIf the social media page or posts identifies the person as an activeduty service member then the page or post should clearly and prominently state that the views expressed do not represent the DOD or their branch of service.Activeduty members may not engage in any partisan political activity even on social media sites. Posting of any direct links to political parties partisan candidates campaigns groups or causes is the equivalent of distributing campaign literature on behalf of the individual or party which is prohibited.Activeduty members may not post or comment on pages or send tweets to political parties or partisan candidates as such activity is engaging in partisan political activity through a medium sponsored or controlled by political entities.Activeduty members should not engage in activities that suggest others like friend or follow the political party partisan political candidate group or cause or forward an invitation or solicitation from those political causes.Active military service members may be subject to additional restrictions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice governing the use of government resources and communication systems such as email and the Internet. To learn more see the Public Affairs Guidance for Political Campaigns and Elections document.EDIT  Sorry  The formatting copy over was hard to clean up.  I will keep trying.SECOND EDITI understand we have no idea if she herself posted it.  If she did she is identifying herself as a member of the Armed Forces I assuming Active or Activated or any form of actively working for NG or Reserves since she is wearing a uniform otherwise shes wrong.  Shes definitely in uniform and not putting a disclaimer that it doesnt represent DODthe Army.

Bottom line is if you are not taking the ASVAB in high school but you are taking it for a recruiter the recruiter has to use one of his limited testing slots. No recruiter is going to waste a slot or the time to transport you to MEPSMET site if you have no interest in joining or are not qualified. No station commander is going to have an issue with that. In fact testing uncommitedunqualified applicants is against SOP and will earn the recruiter who does it an asschewing.,army,cyfmp91,2,t5_2qtr8
6074333,0,t3_3yqs23,Judging by how your post is written and formatted youre already writing well beyond the level of the average Army officer. Theyll skim your essay at best. You have the grades. If you have the PT score you should be fine. There are better ways into federal law enforcement than through the military particularly as an officer. They typically want analytical and investigative experience. Youd do better to get a job with some kind of local law enforcement and get a graduate degree in a relevant field accounting finance computer science. Really the only thing the Army will do for you is get you veterans preference and even then youd better be a point disabled veteran. I fluffed the fuck out every  an Army investigation I ever did when I put together my series resume. Its tough for a point veteran to compete though. I wound up getting beaten out after interviews with the Social Security Administration but I got offers from the DEA amp dont laugh Amtrak. I declined those offers in favor of my current boondoggle of an Army assignment. Now I realize that Id never be happy with the money that GS employees make anyway so I wont be applying anymore.,army,cyfty0n,1,t5_2qtr8

They were all basically foot soldiers the chemical stuff was basically there side job. They inventoried and ordered new stuff if needed and held training once in awhile. I would assume as an officer you would be assigned to an actual chem unit where you would have your own platoon of chem soldiers. If youre not in a chem unit I would assume you would be assigned to S basically doing desk work type stuff and probably be responsible for chem training and supplies. ,army,cz3nnl3,2,t5_2qtr8

Youll be at about ft elevation at Huachuca and the average time drop for people in my cycle for their mile run was  seconds. Other than that read and write to sharpen those skills as you will be doing a lot of it during AIT. Also if youre an introvert be prepared to get out of that shell. If youre an extrovert be prepared to shut up and listen.AIT is a bit stricter than DLI. You will have to march everywhere during the week have to earn phase privileges etc. At DLI youre treated more like permanent party postIET. You will have time to study in the first half mostly because a good portion is unclassified work. In the second half youll be able to participate in study halls held in the academic facilities in the evenings.PT was  MondayFriday with remedial PT test failures being held at  on Saturday. Weinstein Gym is right across from the battalion HQ and youll be able to go from  MondayFriday and any time during regular hours on the weekends. The PT run course is just a straight shoot road which is great if you wanna go on a weekend morning run. LanguageHonestly if your state doesnt support operations in that country think carefully about going to DLI for that language. These languages are perishable skills. I work with several MLPs who arent in languagecoded positions and have pretty much lost all fluency. I had an instructor in AIT that took Mandarin and the only time he ever used it was to help translate for a Marine that got stopped by customs at a Chinese airport. If you can develop a plan to maintain fluency by all means grab a Cat IIIIV language. If not I would play it safe with a III thats still desirable but is spoken by a good amount of people you will be around.,army,czeiihg,2,t5_2qtr8

6444216,0,t3_43xzts,Im no lawyer but Im pretty sure it takes some huge rank to not allow you to fulfill your contract especially if youre not the one trying to break it. Tell your platoon sergeant that you want to talk to someone a little higher up like SG or the commander. Ask if you can get some sort of proof as well as an explanation in writing. Then if that fails and theyre still trying to not allow you to get what you signed up for go talk to someone in legal.

Honestly I know some people have gone through a program that allowed them to stay in the military and get their PhD in science but that is something you would have to talk to someone on base about.  All of the A and B I know including myself did their PhD first in the sciences u do get a shitty stipend to live off of but the education is free  and then direct commissioned.  For  AOC its through the med service corps.  Straight out of your PhD program you get commissioned as a captain and if you do post doc fellowships receive career credit so some people come in as an O with  years till they are up for promotion.  I have not met or heard of anyone with less then a PhD being accepted at least as a Microbiologist or BiochemistPhysiologist  if CBRNE type research is your thing then that seems to be the minimum requirement.  It also helps being smart in picking the lab and type of research you do in grad school.

6810674,0,t1_d0n6uz0,Bro you make me hurt hearing this. I was in your spot and was so conflicted about what to do. Except I was a SPC one day and because of some good fortune  months later I was a SSG.  years after that I pin . So I went up very quickly and I didnt lose all of my brains in the process. I remembered how bad my leadership fucked us over even during  month deployments. I remember getting off a plane after invading ok it was the tail end of the invasion but we got shot at by uniformed Iraqis and holding a country to have a fucking slick sleeve MSG yell at us about how he was our new SG and and we need to be keeping his billicks guy couldnt say billets in shape. Thats what that fuck head had to say to a group of guys who had been gone for  months. First words getting off the bus. Then he yelled at me for having my PC on while indoors because I was carrying two duffles and a ruck. He was the shittiest Senior NCO I ever met. He went on to be a CSM. I never forgot that. Or the formation in the rain where he droned on. On Valentines Day  while my wife waited in car and we missed our dinner reservations. It would have been our first Valentines day together since we had been married  years prior.  Or my dickless commander who just let it go onI never forgot a different SG pencil whipping a fat SSGs PT test so she could go to SLC. Or the commander who just let it go. I didnt forget the time my commander got confused and almost got me and my men killed and my buddy risked his life without hesitation to save mine and  other guys lives. When I put him in for a BSM w V my commander threatened to relieve me because that award acknowledged his incompetence. So these and many other events stayed with me as I went up. And then a funny thing happened. I realized that I was helpless as a SFC to mitigate this faggotry. Maybe I could expend a ton of energy to shield a platoon from it but why use so much energy to do the right thing and despised by superiors? But I tried anyway and went home bitter and stayed late to get chewed on. But my guys usually got home by . Eventually it broke me. So I said fuck it and became a warrant. My peers are cherry ass support LTs and CPTs who see a grizzled old man  year old man who does his work and at promptly  daily gets up and goes to his car and drives home to my wife and kids. They stay around and do....things. I have a CAC reader at home of shit is serious. Call me and Ill do it in my underwear while watching Kung Fu panda and drinking cheap whiskey.

Of course it doesnt have to be that way but getting all soft and lovey with soldiers is why the military is so laughable right now.Having to check in with CQSD every few hours is notwill not be the standard across all situations. If you dont have a phone I would personally require you to be within earshot of a battle buddy or the common areas during dutyrequired hours of course. I believe that I can safely comment on both scenarios via first hand experience. I was in an infantry BN that loved fuck fuck games. Before deployment I lived on base and after I lived far the fuck away At least far in Hawaii terms. When I was released and knew some stupid shit was happening unless I was directly told to keep my phone on me I turned that fucker off. Guess what... the world didnt end my company didnt burn to the ground and no one died. In any case this has wandered from the topic that the OP originally presented. I agree that if you have the means to have a cell phone it would probably be in yours and everyone elses best interest that you have one.

7115243,0,t3_4czw43,Ok. ujeebustchrist hereinafter The Jeebus makes solid points. What you are talking about is fraud. If your sole intent is that sweet BAH and getting your ass out of the Bs its fraud. Should the government in the form of your chain of command or some random Reddit user choose to the government can press charges. This could be NJP or go to court martial. Depends on circumstances and a bunch of other shit.That said fraud is really difficult to prove. As others have said though Joe typically provides more than enough rope to hang himself.Your pros are simple you get out of barracks your friend whos cool with me gets somewhere to live. I am assuming your friend is a civilian based on kinda no place to stay.Cons. Outside of the fraud thing the largest is that you will be married. Not sure if you realize this but signing a marriage certificate does not make you married. The Army will not accept your signed certificate and simply believe you. You have to actually get married. Not the ceremony shit your marriage cert has to be registered with the state typically through the county you are in. Now you are legally married. Your friend has a claim to part of your BAH. You have an obligation to support her. The Army can and will enforce this obligation. You do not get to fuck other people or at least get caught doing so. She can fuck who ever she wants UCMJ does not apply to nonmilitary spouses. Big Army cares about your dick not her pussy. You do not get to choose to not get her an ID card. She is entitled to one and all of the ancillary benefits associated with the ID card. She can go on post get hammered at the bowling alley blow some dude in the latrine there and its all your responsibility. And fault. Decide its not working and you want out? Divorce is easy  if its uncontested. If she decides that the sweet dependapotomus benes are too good to let go of she can get her own lawyer which you will end up paying for most likely. Civilian courts determine spousal support not the military. Big Army has zero say in what the civilian court will decide. The court can award her half your pay in spousal support if it wants to. Hell it can award her all of your pay if it wants but that is not likely. The court can award her medical benefits that you will have to pay for since she got used to Tricare and whatnot. But once divorced she is not entitled to that so the court can simply make you pay for it out of pocket. And if there is a legal court order the Army will enforce that the Army will not be on your side.Marriage is a legal contract. The state and the Army do not give two shits about you being in love or not. They dont care whether youre fucking like bunnies or not. The state cares that you have paid the appropriate fees. The Army wants to see the statestamped marriage cert. And to both that contract puts constraints mostly on you.gt Should I do this?No. No you fucking should not.,army,d1mwuxo,2,t5_2qtr8

7155760,0,t1_d1ri72g,gtIm not a competitive applicant for OCS right now so my only option is enlisting. Enlisting can give you the resources to improve your GPA physical fitness or other attributes that a board might consider but simply being enlisted isnt going to suddenly make you competitive. Its a pretty common story that a recruiter will say Hey you arent competitive for OCS why not enlist and do it later?gtDoes it happen often or is it pretty much unheard ofThere are quite a few priorenlisted officers. It isnt an uncommon path but it isnt as simple as enlist with a degree and then go to OCS. If thats your plan just skip enlisting and try to make yourself a better candidate for OCS right now. Many priorenlisted officers joined the military without a year degree and used the militarys resources to startfinish their degree and commission.As an aside if your end goal is to commission after enlisting then X might not be an ideal MOS to give you the time and resources to do that.,army,d1rjg07,3,t5_2qtr8

7408055,0,t1_d2joda9,Sure one exceptional example that comes into mind is the Imjin War. A war that was started by the Japanese  Shogun Hideyoshi in .After years of conflict in Japan Hideyoshi united all the major lords in Japan however he had bigger ambition and wanted to conquer China to do so he first had to go throughconquer Korea for logistics purposes.Long story short Japanese land forces devastated I mean DEVASTATEDHUMILIATED the Korean army and their civilian population. And there are several reasons why the Japanese were successful but one major reason was the Korean military leadership was literally filled with groomed officers.See centuries of relative peace and stability made the Korean military inactive except for its navy they had to deal with heavily armed pirates. There was a less emphasis in promotion from the bottom or through meritocracy because military positions were now given as hereditary titles political favors political maneuvering bribes etc.Most of these officers studied outdated tacticsmanuals that didnt reflect its contemporary environment and any effort for reform was ignored any officerssoldier who asked for reform were exiled to the northern frontier. Plus there were lots of redundancies within the leadership because positions were created not out of necessities but goods to be soldtradedgiven among the upper elite yangbans. So when the Japanese invaded Korea guess what happened? Because of so many redundancies within the army the soldiers didnt know what to do because there were contradictory orders given all around which basically led to the Korean forces being surrounded and decapitated by the Japanese forces. Luckily there were survivors of the initial attack and when they regrouped with the main army that was sent to counter the Japanese invasion the survivors mostly lower officers grunts because the high officers were decapitated by the Japanese and put on a stake to send a message informed them of the Japanese tactics Japanese attacked with matchlocks first then moved in but the higher brass wouldnt hear any of it. They stuck to their outdated shit remember most of them never trained in the frontier where they could have at least some action against raids from tribesnomads or had any combat experience they were more academicspoliticians than real officers and their ego..which led them to lose their heads like literally. It wasnt until officers who actually led in combat competently and strategize started to appear from the bloodshed that Korea started to properly fight back against the Japanese on land and also because of mother fucking Korean Admiral Yi Sunshin who single handily whooped the Japanese navy and starve the Japanese ground forces to a halt.

That is kinda bad because ur speed will increase due to the hole on the backside of the mc. Its ok tho simply toggle. Its easy and do not require much strength at all. In our scenario u would toggle  degrees sot that the wind is now blowing into the front of ur face. If u spit ur saliva will come right back onto ur face. And thats the key. THE WIND SHOULD BLOW INTO UR FACEFRONTSIDE. Adjust as necessary during ur descent. If the wind is really low u can try braking by pulling both toggles down to ur waist level. Wouldnt recommend it tho if u think u will fuck it up. If high wind dont brake. If u do what ur supposed to do as i mentioned above u should be doing a rear plf in most cases. Biggest  screw up is probably people wanting to toggle so they can try to get closer to gather point and they dont give themselves enough time to slow down.

Allowed to drink and a very soft curfew of . Last I heard they were even separating the platoons so that the MOSTIETofficers didnt interact with each other as much which is fuckin retarded.Also they have changed RNDs in order to give some sort of certification at the end I cant remember exactly which one. They were discussing this as I was leaving but all the instructors said the class work was harder than it was before grain of salt since its almost impossible to academically fail out of RNDs dont know if hard just means that you might be able to fail. Still dont know if this was actually implemented though.Also just want to add on that the career field is very stagnant.

8141867,0,t3_4qr8os,Lots of good advice in here already. I joined when I was High School in the DEP as well. I knew the military is what I wanted to do my whole life. First I would look at what all the branches do and jobs they may offer. You may find out two years into the Army that the Navy had this job you knew you would have loved. So first I would look into all of them. I told myself in High School the Army would be the last I would join and look how that turned out. Then study hard for the ASVAB and see what MOS you qualify for. I saw that awesome Apache on the front of the brochure and knew I wanted to fly one. I asked to be an Apache Mechanic and he said I cant do that but I can be a U Chinook mechanic and that I could ride on one doing that. I agreed that it would be awesome and signed. Those were some of the best years of my life. Plus if you would like to become a Pilot it puts you in close with lots of Pilots who will write you Letters of Recommendations which is what I did. Like some of the other guys said look at what can transfer to the outside world as well. Yeah I could possibly get out as a Boeing Mechanic but they dont make good money. Now if you join the Army as an Air Traffic Controller and get out after your  years and can be making six figure income than thats awesome. Or like others said do you just want to do fun Army things you cant do anywhere else? So theres plenty of factors to look at and thats just a few.Look at what each Branch offers and which you think you would enjoy the most.What MOS in itself you would like?What would transfer and make you money when you get out of the Army?,army,d4va1jx,1,t5_2qtr8

8412104,0,t1_d5t1ogw,Army officers are subdivided into year groups. This determines when you go to promotion boards. The OSBs targeted specific year groups. For example the most recent one was only for Year Group  Captains speaking competitive category not medical folks. That bottom  that were selected for separation will be out of the Army before that year group goes before the Major promotion board. Therefore the selection percentage will be higher for those captains then Year Groups that didnt go through a separation board.Understand something else. Its not just officers with blemishes that need to be separated. There are a lot of mediocre officers out there. Just showing up isnt enough you need to grow and be competitive. The constant deployments and growing of the Army during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars allowed mediocrity throughout the Officer Corps. These guys might have understood they werent the best of the best and they might not have understood that. However they were weakening the officer corps and the Army. Now that we are downsizing we can identify those folks and escort them stage left. Its no different then a civilian company cutting the excess waste from its ranks.edited added context,army,d5t228p,3,t5_2qtr8

Have some fun sure but save your money learn from the mistakes of others suck up the barracks life for a couple years and if you want to stay in and get serious about the Army then you can also get serious about your love life. If youre in your second enlistment after a first enlistment of casual stuff or loneliness whichever works youll have the finances to back up your game you can be more able to be selective youll have more control of your career to an extent and in general youll be a wiser dude. Getting married right off the bat in the Army is... I mean Ive seen it work but generally its a huge trap. If you get deployed in your first enlistment and youre a newly wedded soldier with an early twenties spouse... I mean... odds are significantly higher that Jody is going to come knocking and youre going to have bad time.  Basically invest in your career first wisen yourself up then settle down if you want.

Ive requested counseling several times to know my role and be able to document my progression. But I figured that was a whole other issue. Hours have increased as personnel action processing takes much longer with this NCOIC. They do not abide by the phrase generally free from error any misspelling or misplaced period comma or spacing will resulting in a kicked back memorandum or award.And this is my opinion for the last part. No S can function with complete adherence to every step of every actions process there are steps this NCOIC has implemented which while technically to standard cause us to be a less productive team when it comes to our true job. That is helping Soldiers and resolving their administrative issues as efficiently as possible.

I had persistent shin splintsstress fracture before I joined and was worried about it I tried all kinds of shitslowing down cutting mileage changing running form taking weeks off. Finally what I had to do was completely stop running and stay off my feet for a few months. Im talking at least  maybe  or more. Sounds drastic and your case may not be as extreme. But it worked. When you get back into running do a walkrun program like couch to k or s. It may seem ridiculously easy and like youre not pushing yourself enough but stick to the program exactly repeat easy days if anything hurts.Also I highly recommend seeing a physical therapist to learn better running form if problems persist. For me I practiced isometrics to strengthen hips and practiced landing on the entire foot right below me like running in place but leaning forward forefoot running was too much of a stretch for me despite being popular advice. This is easier. But everyone is different so have an expert look at your biomechanics.Ive never had even the faintest whisper of shin splints since basic. They ease you into the running gently there too and its a good program. I lost  minutes off my runtime went from barely passing to maxing.tldr dont worry about it dont push yourself too hard now take total rest followed by walkrun.,army,d6vdkyp,1,t5_2qtr8

Its very frustrating to see  soldiers from your company just get out of basic training and start the chapter process. As well as most of my time in the rear is taking soldiers to appointments because their not adults and can not be trusted. Then you have the soldiers that are actually amazing people and want to better themselves as soldiers but get the shaft on sergeants time because Im at the TMC escorting some douche nozzle whos getting chartered due to PTSD from basic training. Dont even get me started on hazing but any kind of corrective action is now hazing.  The simple scuffing up of Joe is now constituted to putting a target on anyones back due to the armys policy.  Once soldiers hear about NCOs being punished or investigated for scuffing up soldiers its like all hell broke loose with investigations and IG follow ups.  Allegations can ruin someones career. Anything that really goes wrong nowadays you can held on some serious accusations and are guilty until proven innocent. Our training at the battalion levelcompany level is insane. Its so fucking scripted its hard to see what someone would do outside of a LFXSTX event. Theyre so fucking afraid of soldier not being properly trained to handle weapons that we cant even use a support by fire properly.

In garrison you do physical security arms room inspections key control etc. or personnel security SSO type work maintaining security clearances for your unit inprocessing JPAS.  Deployed is when you actually do intel type work unless youre lucky enough to get a joint assignment.  Down range I worked my ass off. I was personnel security manager lead targeting analyst insider threat and anything in between.  Id go to a FORSCOM unit first.  I was attached to a line company and learned everything there.

Yes even BS CQ shifts after I had worked a full duty day.My wife once had to go to the emergency room. She tried calling me so I could come home and care for our then  year old. I was on a  mile ruck march at the time. I couldnt answer so she called my unit. What did my unit do? They waited however many hours for me to finish to let me know.

Only problem is I had a diseased eye but had surgery for it. Im still physical active I run  times a week. My question is since I wear contacts and with a torn meniscus will I have a problem getting through meps? If I join I want to do MP counter intelligence or maybe even warrant officer.

As an engineer one tool that I found helpful was a utilization chart with all the teams and equipment listed down.  I could assign the resource to the project track how the project was suppose to take to ensure that teams werent doubled tapped or being skipped over and had the right equipment for the job.  Real time flow is great but you want your NCOs focused on the task at hand rather than updating a little app to let you know that theyre    complete if its a one day or half day job totally understandable for a multiweek length project.  ,army,d97atuc,1,t5_2qtr8

These individuals are trained to plan and control close air support. They support both the conventional and SOF communities. In fact there are more supporting the conventional side than the SOF side. Many CCT or combat controllers are also JTAC certified but not necessarily.TACP is a Tactical Air Control Party. A TACP is generally a twoairman team working in an Army ground unit and directing close air support firepower toward enemy targets on the ground. TACP is technically what they do not who they are though the term has taken on that use confusing the discussion.. TACPs generally consist of ALOs Air Liasion Officer JTACs and ROMADs Radio Operator Maintainer and Driver. At certain levels Division and higher there can be support guys in the TACP.The primary difference between JTACs and ROMADs is a JTAC is certified to say CLEARED HOT directing aircraft to use munitions on a target. ROMADs do talk aircraft into position and then hand control to a JTAC who may be miles away essentially relying on the ROMAD to do his job. The JTAC clears the aircraft hot and then goes back to the task at hand often directing CAS where hes at which may be the TOC.CCTs Combat Control Team are basically combat air traffic controllers. They have the skills to run a control tower and the aircraft flowing into and out of newly seized airfields. Over the last decade they have been pressed into providing CAS.When necessary troops on the ground often request direct and release CAS when JTACS TACPs or CTTs are not present.,army,d9eg1vd,3,t5_2qtr8

Make sure your Soldiers understand this shit for the future. Its not about just one more day.That being said...yeah if youre willing go to bat for him walk in for the CO the approval authority or the SG.  Have an explanation but you also better be able to say how youre going to mitigate him being absent for whatever is going on postHBL.  Whether its how he and you will make up trainingtasks or how his absence will be mitigated by your direct additional effort.Going in there and expecting sympathy and help when the policy should be known he knew the dates did his leave improperly and wanted to take more than HBL meaning he definitely should have squared that shit way in advance.  You should have a mitigation plan  offer in place to take the hit and offer a solution to take care of the Soldier and correct the mistake  consider doing a neutralevent orientated counseling so he understands the issues at play.,army,daaf7th,5,t5_2qtr8

I want to serve on the front lines and I want to be able to be one of the guys. But Im worried if I become an officer Ill be stuck doing paperwork and I also dont wanna turn into a stuck up asshole that everyone hates like those cadets. I love people and love being dependable. But I also like to lead and feel a sense of pride when I am a main member of a successful team. So Im really not sure what I should do. Hopefully you guys can give me your opinions.

When I called my command they insisted that I dont call  and that they will send someone up to see whats going on and help me. My CMDR and SG came to my barracks room and began to lay into me. They called my PA from the TMC to come up to my barracks room he was also the BDE Surgeon. He began to relay all of my medical information to my CMDR and how this was impossible because the Xrays didnt show anything. Once I got an MRI done later that day  I disobeyed an unlawful order and called  because I had a medical emergency and they had literally flipped me out of my bunk we were able to confirm that I needed emergency surgery or this would become permanent. I spent roughly . years on temporary profiles before being given a permanent one during the MEB process.,army,dbeigbg,2,t5_2qtr8

10050181,0,t1_dbhjcu1,If you meet the minimum standard they are not going to kick you out but most people will probably label you as a dirtbag and either treat you like shit or talk about you behind your back and even to your face in some cases. You probably will end up on remedial because you were so close to failing that your chain of command will be worried and want to prevent you from possibly failing the next one not to mention that your score is probably going to lower the overall company average quite a bit depending on the size of your company. They may keep you from going to the board because they feel like you are not showing enough potential. Even if they do decide to send you to the board the SGM will probably hound you for your low score and might even wonder why you were recommended in the first place. Based on your answer he might kick you out of the board. If you somehow magically because I definitely would not recommend you go to the board and pass it your APFT score will provide you with barely any promotion points hurting your chances at an actual promotion. The only way I could see someone possibly considering a  as alright in my opinion is if it was right after you came off a long term profile for some major surgery amputation maybe? Wtf? maybe cancer or possibly after pregnancy  which to me is still pretty sad in that case as most post pregnancy Soldiers can still do better than a  on a diagnostic APFT while still on profile even if they dont pass everything. Eh maybe it was triplets???.  My point is getting a  is a horrible decision. Maybe there is an underlying medical reason but most people should strive to do their best in my opinion. ,army,dbhkbgp,2,t5_2qtr8

10387231,0,t1_dckxsjr,gt What Chelsea Manning did was the equivalent to setting off a bomb in a crowded public area. This is not lol it was kinda bad like a terrorist attack hyperbole. She attacked innocent civilians service members and allies alike with her reckless and malicious actions.thats a nice opinion to have but thats not what anyone legally determined   gt ..  that no instances were ever found of any individual killed by enemy forces as a result of having been named in the releases.gt Brigadier general Robert Carr a senior counterintelligence officer who headed the Information Review Task Force that investigated the impact of WikiLeaks disclosures on behalf of the Defense Department told a court at Fort Meade Maryland that they had uncovered no specific examples of anyone who had lost his or her life in reprisals that followed the publication of the disclosures on the internet. I dont have a specific example he said.gt It has been one of the main criticisms of the WikiLeaks publications that they put lives at risk particularly in Iran and Afghanistan. The admission by the Pentagons chief investigator into the fallout from WikiLeaks that no such casualties were identified marks a significant undermining of such arguments.       gt Nancy Hollander and Vince Ward Mannings appellate counselors said in a joint statement that Manning disclosed information that served the public interest and never caused harm.   The only officials coming out and saying she put peoples lives at risk are political figures like McCain and Paul Ryan. And thats no surprise because this is a very easy political field goal to criticize the outgoing administration.   While there IS evidence that Bergdahls desertion led to troops dying there is not any proof that a video of a reporter being killed somehow inspired more insurgents to attack Americans. I mean by that point in the war everyone in the world was aware there were civilian casualties. I absolutely do not believe that one journalist killed because his camera looked like a gun would have thrown any wouldbe insurgent over the edge.   Again its is shitty that she leaked all this information against her oath she took. But the conviction is NOT to drop them off the gallows or sentence them for life. The truth is these leaks were not that bad they were just very high profile.    gt White House spokesman Josh Earnest tells CNN that the amount of time Manning has served is consistent with the sentence imposed on others who committed similar crimes but who received less attention.   I totally get how information is a weapon I am super up to date with Russias war of information for example. But the leaks Manning dripped all over the internet simply were not so explosive. Frankly it was nothing no one didnt already know about the war. Except taking the UNSGs DNA that was weird. ,army,dclgh6u,1,t5_2qtr8

I feel like I have life all figured out and that ive set myself up well to have a good career. However I am totally unexcited about it. I dont really like my major and I dont really like the career that I have gotten myself into. I am dreading the thought of spending the next thirty years doing work for a job that I am not truly passionate about.I would really like to get into Med school and become a physicians assistant however I do not have the money to do that and I was wondering if I could somehow pursue this dream with the help of the army. My plan has been to enlist as a combat medic and pursue the medical field that way and then apply for one of the military scholarships to pursue postgraduate education. With all this being said I would not pursue the army solely for the  benefits. I have always wanted to join the military. I want to be challenged like I never have I want to be worked like I never have I want gain the experience and skills of being in the army and I want to be a part of something great. Ive always viewed people in the military with such respect and it is something that I really want to experience myself. Because I have been on winter break I have been researching all of the possibilities that the army has to offer but I am unsure of what steps to take what is really available to me in terms of positions and if the army is actually the right choice for me. I have some specific questions and Ill list them below but if you have any advice that you could give me regarding your experience as a college graduate and whether the army has fulfilled your expectations that would be really helpful.Is it possible for me to become an officer right out of college and if I am an officer can I pursue a medical track within the army? After reading some of the posts in this subreddit it seems that not all of the MOS positions are available will I have problems trying to pursue the combat medic track or any of the other medical tracks?How difficult is it to attain Health Professions Scholarship?What is the best way to prepare for the ASVAB exam?thanks!,army,dcnm3pd,2,t5_2qtr8

10540223,1,t1_dd240nw,Ill take a shot at it as a Trump supporter though I know Im going to take a lot of hate.Honestly I dont know if this is a good move or not by removing those two positions as automatic attendees.  What I do think is going on is that Trump is removing what he sees as excess political entities from the daytoday operations of the country.  Having seen Mr. Clapper during some meetings and his testimony in front of Congress I can say that he was most certainly playing political games.  Now I cant say the same thing about the CJCS.  However you dont end up with stars on your shoulder without playing some serious politics.Knowing how Mr. Clapper acted I can see the reasoning of keeping these two positions off of the NSC.  I can see how it could help streamline things and keep the political games and wasted time down to a minimum.  If those two positions are known for playing political games then best leave them out until they are needed.What I do end up expecting to happen in the end is that President Trump will quickly find out how often he needs to talk to either the DNI or CJSC and will put them back on to the council.  Remember before running for President he was almost not involved with politics at all.  He is approaching this as he would from a CEOs perspective and will probably be tweaking things like this for at least the next six months as he finds out exactly what he does and does not need.Now for Mr. Bannon...  Im just going to leave that one alone.  I dont know enough about the guy to draw any solid conclusions but I definitely have a wary feeling about him.,army,dd2unpy,0,t5_2qtr8

Prior service RA infantry got out as an E commissioned through the green to gold program.Im interested resigning my commission to reenlist in the RA. Ive combed through the appropriate ARs on resignation grade determination and the current prior service business rules however Im still left a bit confused and my local recruiter hasnt gotten back to me understandable. Im left with a couple questions after my own research to see if Im even eligible  I received an ROTC scholarship in that scholarship contract it states that if I didnt commission Id be left with a  year service obligation as an enlisted member. However it says nothing about a resignation after being an officer for a year. What are the rules here?  Grade determination I have read through the AR discussing a statutory entitlement to reenlist with ones former rank. Even as a former E can I still apply for the grade E or higher and what is the likelihood that it would be approved based on a couple years active duty a deployment some team leader time  years ROTC and a commission? If an E grade is approved can I fill an X vacancy? If so as an infantry OSUT graduate how would this work for me? report straight to preSFAS? Lastly and importantly given the high likelihood of not making it through the SF pipeline could I negotiate in the contract to be placed back into my former MOS of B if I fail selection or the Q ?Any information any of you have out there would be greatly appreciated as Im just trying to weigh options and determine my eligibility and not trying to bug the local recruiter here with so many hypotheticals.vr LT,army,dd6s3x5,1,t5_2qtr8
10576796,0,t1_dd4vakv,My experience as of SEP  The DSs at th cant smoke you at all anymore. The worst they can do is make you stand instead of sit pretty much but the DSs dont run your barracks or anything some E will be running the night shift at the barracks dont piss himher off or youll lose sleep. You will run a  mile assessment which you need to run in  or  iirc. I think they did a pull up assessment as well and thats it. At some point a group of DSs will come and teach you the PRT recovery and preparation drills. When they take you to the shoppette feel free to grab things you might not think of like Chapstick at the cashiers line. Theyll run you through the aisles and give you a minimum of stuff to grab but keep an eye out for. If youre going to OSUT it takes a week and a half instead of the  days you were promised. Learn the soldiers creed and general orders first followed by the army song.

You should look up the court judgment that was rendered out of Boston District of Mass. i think which more or less upheld it.

I did that for about  years and change or so.On the  I was home at least half of that was TDY for training organizational briefingsmeetings and deploymentrelated activities.When I wasnt away from home station I work schedule that went PT Work HomeUnless we were supporting a deployed mission in which case I would do shiftedhours or overnights.It was some of the most fulfilling excellent work Ive ever done I loved it the work and time spent in the organizations I was in...basically set me up for life.Suffice to say my family relationships suffered.  The biggest reason I chose to slow down and started cutting down on deployments was spending time with my son.  I dont really feel like I missed out but I definitely went  in on making up for the time.  I havent missed a school field trip or book fair since and I volunteer at a lot of school events.  Enough that my son told me I shouldnt always be coming because I need to share spots with the other parents and let them have a turn so they can spend time with their kids too.Multiple deployments I did not have access to unclassified internet or phone.  That makes it rough.  But I think the longest I went without being able to send any sort of email or make a phone call was only  weeks.  Plenty of people have had it worse.  It also helps if then your SO gets a job working for the same Agency and can have high side access and can communicate a little more regularly.  Sometimes thats not great if she gets to read the OPORDs and AARs from what youre doing.However on that cycle my time was My Time.  I had times where my unit that administratively controlled me would try to fuck my shit up and make me play fuck fuck games and my organizational leadership would bury them.  When I slowed down again my time was for me.  Unconventional military organizations I have found are excellent at preserving what time you do get and treat it with far more reverence then the regular Army.  They expect  effort and professionalism out of you and they understand what theyre asking.Ive also had a conventional MICO leadership that fucking dogged us all the time had us doing  PT and we were lucky to be off by  because were waiting on PLs to finish meeting to talk to PSGs to talk to the NCOs to talk to the Soldiers and always had nonsense weekend shit training setup.

10860780,0,t1_de05uxd,Maybe I was misunderstanding something. I dunno. I got the impression that he was saying that the fact that the historians were probably liberal meant their historical analyses are somehow invalid. And maybe they are we dont know because all of the scores have no context to back them.Bill Clinton though like yeah he should be farther down and some of the guys at the bottom seem a little too low. I dont dislike Obama I actually respect him a lot but for the metrics they graded on his scores mostly made sense though I personally think he did better with international relations he was very well respected all over the world. I dont have a personal issue with the official position of how they supposedly deported people but I dont know enough about the actual deportations occurring to judge too much. Proanti deportation doesnt make sense its all about how its done at least in my book. Obama said he was focusing on criminals and not families as well as discouraging more immigrants okay that makes sense on paper. Did it happen? Maybe maybe not. I dont really know to be honest. Then you get a new president whose campaign definitely didnt make any firm delineation beyond illegals and talk about a wall and yeah thats going to personally make me a bit more opposed to it. Im not against border security and getting rid of aliencriminals but I also dont want to see good people in need of some America getting turned away due to bureaucratic shit and billions blown on a wall that could be better spent on better means of border control and also education. Id also say that it was a good decision to stay in Afghanistan that way the ANA wouldnt fall apart like the Iraqis did... even though the Taliban made a comeback and the ANA is still... yeah. Obamas worst mistake was probably pulling out of Iraq which  but I think us pulling out of Iraq justifies the downsizing even if we shouldve saw it through. And with Iraq there were major diplomatic issues like them wanting the right to prosecute us for defending their shit so fuck that. Nouri AlMaliki is a fuck and we sort of installed him. Not only was he on the CIAs shortlist... he was also on Qasem Suleimanis short list hes the leader of the Quds Force which are like a bunch of black ops Iranian dudes who have been fucking shit up behind the scenes in Syria and around the ME. Like I am familiar with Iraq and while I definitely dont know everything and question everybody who thinks theyve got to the bottom of that rabbithole the more I learn the more it seems like the entire thing looks like a mismanaged mess and Im not really sure we learned anything from it and its really hard to ascertain how much of it President Obama is responsible for and how much he inherited and also how much is the fault of the Iraqis Iran and our own guys. Iraq is a hot mess. In a perfect world we wouldve rolled into Iraq with a better long term plan and left it when the job was actually done. And part of the problem is also Syria but I have no idea what couldve been done about that. I could go on for days about all that though. That was a tangent. Bottom line ranking presidents is kind of dumb because history is complicated and if there are biases the polls obfuscate it and I dont think thats the historians fault the poll itself is just kind of a stupid concept and we shouldnt look too much into it. Edit And Im not saying I dont respect the CIA and their role in Iraq just that I dont understand what happened and that it was a fucked up situation. They know better than I do I definitely am not informed enough to judge too much and hindsight is definitely . I was just reading an article that mentioned the Memorial Wall in Langley the families left behind and it felt important to come back and say that I definitely have respect for their work even with mistakes made. They do their job to the best of their ability but its ultimately somebody higher who has to hold the responsibility for their triumphs failures flaws and immense capabilities. Same is true for the rest of the IC and DoD in general. We are the big stick were not the arm carrying it though. ,army,de07o6y,2,t5_2qtr8

I was diagnosed with chemical contact eczema if I remember it correctly basically the chemical equivalent of the poison ivy diagnosis after a farm accident where I was sprayed with a mixture of pesticides and other chemicals. Developed rashes and blisters on both of my forearms. It went away with OTC treatment and time. This was years ago.Six months ago however a rash has appeared on my right forearm about halfway between my elbow and my hand unlike regular adult eczema which to my understanding is usually in the fold of the elbowknees or hands. It is a collection of red raised dots about .x with a few dots scattered around outside that but still close. Its a little dry but doesnt really itch. However nothing I have tried has made it go away.As I said I do not have a diagnosis of eczema because I have not seen a doctor about it. I have really shitty health insurance and cannot afford to go to the doctor outside of emergencies...plus I want to keep my medical records as clean as possible.I have nothing else associated with eczema..no other rashes. No asthma. No food allergies though doing a day elimination diet to test for sensitivities. Its ugly but doesnt hinder me in any way.My fear is that if I get to MEPS and it is still there Ill be DQed. I know that every case is different and that every MEPS is different but just wondering if anybody has seen eczema get waivered before.

Europes involvement in China is what led to Japan modernizing rapidly in the th century so that it could avoid being exploited like the Chinese did but thats a story for a different time. The point is China was all but manipulated and controlled by the West up until post World War II. The Communists succeeded in conquering the country post World War II leading to the China we have today. Although we trade with them a lot we The United States are their greatest competitors in the Pacific China continues to find ways to break the Pacific Island Chain defense that we set up to curtail their influence. The United States has set up both soft and hard power in the Pacific. We have our island chain of air fields and bases in Japan South Korea Guam and various other islands that can be used to project hard power if needed in a ChineseAmerican War. We also have economic soft power in South Korea Japan and southeast Asia that could in theory be used to effect China economically. All of these are just tools of international diplomacy IE influencing countries to do what you want or meeting half way that benefits both countries.

Your confidence goes through the roof upon graduation and everything gets easier. That being said theres almost no responsibility or thinking involved just accomplishing tasks in basic. If you dont accomplish a task then life gets harder for you and everyone around you. If hes refusing to train I can imagine everyone around him hates him for making their life miserable. The easiest way to get through it is to simply do it. Thats all there is to it. If he doesnt like the yelling and stupid bs then he needs to get over himself. Basic is a game and you should have that mindset going into it. Those guys arent always dicks and outside of training theyre usually pretty cool. I hate to say it but if he cant get through  weeks of hardship that a  year old found enjoyable then wtf is he gonna do in life. How is he gonna handle problems? How is he going to refrain from quitting? Its not my business but either he needs to think about sucking it up and fulfilling his commitment and fucking oath or you need to think about what he can provide you in the real world.

Retirement was coming but it was gonna be a few months before it worked its way all the way through The Big Army in the Sky aka HRC.So I got to thinking or overthinking more likely and I decided that if I had a van then no matter what came about after the Army Id never be sleeping on a bench regardless.I dont mean to sound all dramaticit was less about me being worried that would actually happen and more about totally precluding even a remote possibility of a bad thing I dont want. Thats how I roll when I can do it anyway.So I found this E cargo van two bucket seats up front and bare steel all the way back. No side windows. It was current model year but it was used with  miles on it. Spotless showroom. Someone had paid almost  for it months before and there is was for k and there I was still drawing OE pay. Hell yeah I went in there gave them not one penny down and financed almost what it had gone for new because it was current model year so the bank didnt care if it was new or used.

11383562,0,t3_62el09,Ive done a few things. Got into investing basics when I made CPL. Started into CDs and then IRAs for me and my wife as soon as we got married. Split between four different USAA mutual funds. Probably more in bonds then we should have had.Never ever bought a brand new car. Newest was last years model. Did special duty for that sweet special duty pay and unlike all my idiot battle buddies I invested that money instead of buying a pickup truck to impress privates.Spent the majority of my career overseas getting COLA or when deployed the family SEPhazard stuff.  total overseas tours of  months or longer. Overseas tours is where I really started building my investments. Deployment RFI also saves a fortune in uniforms.When stateside bought a house with a mortgage well below my BAH one deployment is usually enough for a good down payment. Fixed it up now its a rental with over k in equity and makes me  a month in Cash.Used all the TA. BS degrees made me slightly more articulate and helped promote me to upper middle management. All the college work kept me too busy to spend too much. A Friday night writing a paper saved me money. The number one factor though has to be relationship choice. One wife over  years that is also a saver. I highly recommend going foreign over domestic. The amount of money soldiers lose to a Lexus driving Louis Vuitton spouse is incredibly costly god help you when she leaves you.After about  years of investing my money makes me  a month on average this is more than I made as a PFC so long ago Ive got peers that pay that in child support.I could have been more frugal with some things.

Before you sign for anything have the current hand reciept holderHave your supply print out the COEIBII listing for every single piece of property on that hand reciept. Generate a  for each single piece of gear and all of its parts. Do a  layout and inventory of every single piece of gear. Have whoever you will subhand reciept property to complete the inventory with you. Ensure that shortage annexes are completed for any COEI or BII that is missing that the equipment is ordered through supply or SAMSE if vehicle related and that there is a disposition if there is any durable or nonexpendable property missing. i.e. a FLIPL or statement of chargesIt sucks but the Commander is the Commander. He can have anybody he wants to sign for property based on command supply discipline. I am currently going through some change of command property inventory shenanigans because I made the mistake of signing for property while I was in Battle Staff and was unable to see anything.

I personally feel that youve put your time in and if you are as speed as you sound like you were you left the Army a better place.But you left before you should have. Ill explainWhen I was a wee shitbird LT I couldnt believe how the lazy POS SSGs and SFCs got over and drew paychecks for being SFCs. Well once I got a little bit of rank and a little stroke I hooked the pieces of shit up with promote with peers in the event of national emergency and appoint as Assistant PortAJohn NCOIC. I dont know if youve ever seen the light go out of someones eyes someone who thought they were serving the Army by telling old deployment stories and sitting in an office doing a makework job when you tell them that theyre a piece of shit that is a drag on the unit and a poor example but it really made me feel like Id done my duty to god and countryand to the Soldiers who silently applauded the broken shambling figure that left my office come NCOER time. My only regret is that I didnt get to stick around for Bar to Continued Service.And you could have done that for those shitbird CPTs if youd just stuck around. You could have either led them to greatness or been the decisive factor in their separation if you were the leader you make yourself out to beno shade Im not denying your selfassessment. I just find it hard to believe that you quit the Army because you couldnt bear to see people not get what they deserve for refusing to promote themselves something as you say you figured out quickly. I reckon my attitude is colored by my longterm love of the Armywarts and allso forgive me if I sound shitty.,army,dgf78b3,17,t5_2qtr8

The things that I mentioned are also played into it. You keep trying to make it sound like Im saying theyre irrelevant to global economics but thats not what Im saying. Im saying that there are two schools of thought to determine global economic superpowers. School  the thought your going with that GDP is the only thing that matters the thought process I brought up that encompasses many different areas to determine where countries fall. This also includes stability of their currency. This typically breaks countries down until power st world emerging nd world  failingnonexistentlow level rd world.

So we dont talk to SBIL unless everyone goes home for the holidays.  FIL SBIL is now filling a position that is actually meant for someone a rank higher than his so even though he is rank x he will be getting paid as x!    SMIL Stated very proudlyWell SBIL is just bored with the regular Army officer stuff so he is going to go SF instead. After months of hearing about how he would be going to SF selection soon it stopped and it was never brought up again. SMIL SBIL was headed to CCC well they want to go to Germany so we are planning a trip to go visit them since we wont get to see them for a couple years when they move to Germany. Husband tries to explain that its getting harder to go to Germany and it might not be an option. They rolled their eyes at him it was not an option they went to Hood.
