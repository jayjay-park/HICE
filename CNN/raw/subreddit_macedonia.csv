2020185,0,t1_ckwlhwc,Well of course Im not used to the idea. Nobody should ever be used to that particular idea. Everything containing a word Macedonian suddenly gets a prefix. Simply not gonna happen. A name of a country can be changed has happened before and its nothing new. A change of identity on the other hand is far more serious issue thats currently and maybe ever unsolvable. Also fun fact The North Koreans view themselves as Koreans and their language as Korean. North Korea official name is Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. Its offensive for them to be called North Koreans. They view the South Korea as their southern part currently occupied.,macedonia,ckwmn79,1,t5_2r6hq

2996341,0,t1_co7hs3g,Are you from the US? If so I think I would disagree with you because you at least have people like John Oliver Jon Stewart Bill Maher etc. who are slightly supportive of one option and critical of the other but I wouldnt say they follow the parties policy strictly. Ive seen Jon Stewart criticize Obama and the Democrats on more than one occasion and laugh at stupid stuff some Democrats do. You cannot I want to stress this again  cannot ever hear media here criticize the party they support. Its really ridiculous to read their articles. They make one party members seem like angels from above and the others like the Devil himself. Its fuckin retarded,macedonia,co8kgzc,2,t5_2r6hq

6636288,0,t3_46iv8c,Its a complete fabrication and there are a few factors that make this possible. First off the article you mentioned comes from Republika  one of the foremost outlets of the governments propaganda machine. I just opened the site and the news are all insignificant rosy things while completely omitting the protests that are happening in front of the government in which a thousands participate. In Macedonia you basically have pro government and opposition media. Theres maybe one somewhat neutral TV station and even they complain about pressures. I used to intern at one government agency in the Marketing and Communications department. It was a joke. Some company would open one production lane and hire ish people in the entire facility and the agency would spin it into Factory opens  s of people to be employed. They buy ads in the Economist with their little checklists about all the great things about doing business in Macedonia. In reality the public administration system there is so dysfunctional the average person would try to find someone they know to help them get through something as simple as an ID card. There are quotas on employing minorities which completely backfires as they even end up hiring people that barely speak the language. Of course all of them simply have to be members of the ruling party. To make matters worse the size of the public administration has been estimated at . employees excluding public enterprises employees which comprises  percent of the total active labor market and uses  percent of the budget Analytica . This is how they reduce unemployment. In some offices they do not even have chairs to for everyone to sit so the employees come up with rotation schedules  I work Monday and Tuesday you come in on the other days.There was even a time when it was self proclaimed as the first wireless country in the world. Its no such thing even today  years latter. They just make up things and the foreign media picks them up in good faith If you live there all you hear about are all the foreign investments that Macedonia is getting! In fact the biggest inflow of money into the country is from remittances. It is very hard to do business there or even get a job especially if you do not have any connections. This is why hundreds of thousands citizens have left. The governments reaction? They have prevented every attempt for a census since . Thats right  we have no idea how many people have left. No numbers no problem.Sorry for the rant let me know if you need an answer to anything specific.            ,macedonia,d05qz0c,5,t5_2r6hq

7176609,0,t3_4dp7ff,Dont offer to reciprocate a favor as they will assume that their good deed is being done for a return!  I was helped with a Visa problem a couple years by a gentleman who graciously worked during his lunch hour and I unknowlingly offerred to buy him lunch and he he politley declined.  My host kindly informed me that I might have offended him as the You rub my back and I will rub yours is kinda looked down upon.  He helped me out of his good will and didnt expect anything in return.  That was my expirience.,macedonia,d1twxzt,2,t5_2r6hq
7265878,0,t3_4eang2,It is clear that you want to stay objective on the matter but the way you emphasis words in the sentences makes it sound like you have a certain stance on the subject.Also this is a very delicate matter which however careful you are always stepping on someones toes.In my point of view you are portraying that greece has the sole right to the name macedonia denying the fact that it is a human right to have the right to self determination. Implying that greece existed as a country in ancient times is just ridiculous.As already stated be careful not to step on peoples toes especially when bringing up other more delicate matters as this dispute does only upset greeks and no one else because as you stated almost all nations have recognised Macedonia under its preferred name UN and NATO put aside due to the deal greece made macedonia sign to revoke the economical embargo imposed on the country.,macedonia,d242ve4,5,t5_2r6hq

8200103,0,t3_4relzk,gtThe Macedonian government  which took power through rigged electionsWhere do you people find these bullshit articles?Theres literally nothing of worth or true fact written... On another note I will forever remember  when Vlado Buchkoski was defended by the special forces because he wouldnt have made it alive out of Struga. That was a real protest with a real motive with a real cause! Molotovs were thrown instead of paint! And they like to call this revolution? Its a joke. At this moment Im not gonna vote for VMRO but I will certainly not be voting for SDSM at least until all of the leeching bastards are still leaders. ,macedonia,d52keqa,4,t5_2r6hq
