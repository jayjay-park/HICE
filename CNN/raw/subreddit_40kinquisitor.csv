10728313,0,t3_5temsf,Hmm...I was hoping for something more flexible than classes though the specification between those classes worries me a bit. If youre locked down to X class of Y spec seems like options for advancement are very narrow though it would be good for mixing up teams in coop. Unless that spec is just your starting equipment.  But the system does look great. Very easy to add more content to it would appear.,40kinquisitor,ddmjn6f,1,t5_3fz7k
