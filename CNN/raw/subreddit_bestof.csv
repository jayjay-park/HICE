13211,0,t1_cefx6uz,gtStop. Right there. Its not even clinical anyomre. Both the U.S Govt and the medical establishment are eliminating that word from use. They recognize the derogatory nature of the word why cant you?Government also cut the earned retirement benefits of veterans and sold out real health care reform to the insurance industry.  Government also calls dead children in drone bombings collateral damage.  Some medical establishments also performed lobotomies even after it was in disrepute.  If the basis of your entire argument is that the United States Government has caved to special interests and eliminated their own use of the word and that some medical establishments in this country have followed suit then youre on shaky ground.  At any rate Im not the only one that holds my viewpoint either   Im sure if you google around youll see that theres some debate over the continual shifting of societys acceptance of terminology when it comes to the retarded.  As for the rest of what youve got to say Im not going to argue with you any further.  Its not that youve won the argument its that you havent really made one and in the absence of that youre pretty boring.  I get it you think the term retarded is offensive.  Some other people think the term retarded is offensive.  Because you agree with them and they agree with you you have deemed yourself correct and all other people wrong.  Wait not just wrong.  Bad too.  Very bad.  Disagreeing with you means youre not a DECENT FUCKING HUMAN BEING.  If you are NOT A DECENT FUCKING HUMAN BEING it is not because you are a bigot or kick puppies or club baby seals or promote genocide or steal or pick your nose.  No you are not a decent human being because you disagree.  Because believing that words should have meanings and shouldnt be arbitrarily deemed offensive or acceptable due to the fickle sensibilities of the political correctness thought police is BAD.  VERY BAD.  LIKE WHERE IS YOUR HUMANITY BAD.  GOD DAMN.  LITERALLY HITLER BAD.P.S.  Yes coopting the struggle of a race you are not a part of is actually pretty racist.  Dont believe me?

14865,0,t1_cefjx75,Oh certainly.  There is delusion that deviates from the social center.  Im not talking about saying Im happy because I think Im gods greatest gift to mankind.  One believing that is the definition of delusion.  Two its also incredibly shallow to justify happiness against either an external or an internal form of validation.  In fact happiness has nothing to do with validation or even self worth.  It is purely a mindset that one chooses to be in regardless of external or internal systems of worth.I will give an example from my life.  I used to work in a freezer processing ice cream.  This is heavy manual labor that damages the body over time done in a relatively harsh environment in the F to F range.  Its an environment where you can get frost bite sweat your ass off and suffer from dehydration all at the same time.  Its an environment that forces workers to lift weights outside of work in order to not hurt themselves at work.  Its a frozen hell if youre of the wrong mindset or a pretty fun place to have fun and let off steam if youre in the right mindset.  During the busy season this was  days a week  hours a day for several months on end work.  Once in a while you got a Sunday off.  There was a time during my stint there where I was in zombie mode.  Days would go by work would get done and life was a perpetual blur.  Nothing really mattered and I despised every second I was there every second...of every day.  It was selftorment justifying that self damage by my environment.Then one day I decided all of this was pointless.  The reality is Im stuck wherever I am doing whatever I have to do to simply exist in this world.  I can work towards a better tomorrow but Im always stuck in a less than ideal existence.  At this point one can decide to hate that they are stuck in said existence or simply accept the fact that you have to be here anyways so you might as well have a little fun and enjoy it.  This decision is the basis of happiness.  It is the choice you make as a response to your current existence.  You choose to loath your situation or you choose to accept it and try to make the best of it.  Happiness is the ability to accept what is set it aside as an irrelevant factor and then deciding how you want to feel and move forward in life.  Rationally a person will come to the conclusion that self mutilation is bad.  It is arguably pointless to cause your own pain if you have the choice not to.  The inverse is happiness.  This is where you exist in the same less than ideal world but instead choose to enjoy it any way you can.  You make fun of life enjoy the little things and take the pitfalls of life very lightly.  At the end of it all you end up happy.  It isnt because you are ecstatic about your less than ideal existence.  It is because you pushed away the negative mindset in favor of the positive one.  Singlemarried hungryfull coldwarm familyalone workingleisure all of this doesnt really matter.  At the end of the day your existence is simply what it is.  You act towards better but thats enough and you accept that you are striving for better yet are also perfectly content with the right now situation in life.  So its contentment?  Well not exactly.  You are content but you are also happy in part because you are content.  The other half is the choice to not self mutilate because you rationally find it pointless.  Its the ability to look at the bright side of life regardless of what life currently is right now.Its this approach that turned life in that cold hell of a job into something much more fun entertaining and fulfilling.  I found the games in the work the family in my coworkers and fulfillment in my duties and prowess of those duties.  The environment never changed.  It was only my mindset.  Its a simple choice a mindset and is really like flipping a switch between darkness and light.,bestof,ceg4khz,2,t5_2qh3v

You are forgetting that while this approach demands slightly more complex and bigger modules but it also allows us to make the launch vehicle far less complex and less heavy thus allowing us to increase useful payload to orbit to more than compensate for it.gtSo I stand by my point that ISS as it exists today wouldnt have been possible without the orbiters specific design as not just a launch vehicle but also a constructionutility one.That is almost certain but we would merely have a different station not necessarily a worse one.,bestof,cege5k0,0,t5_2qh3v

No one in power actually wants to go after these people because they know if they did the value they hold would evaporate. Some very liberal forecasting says that they could support the country for about  years. Practically speaking maybe half that because theyd take their money somewhere its respected and half because the assets they own would lose all their value.

19403,0,t1_cegjxan,If you truly believe the Bible is a holy book as dictated by God then no you cant pick and choose. You cant tell a judge I follow all laws except seatbelt laws because I disagree with them You will get your ass handed to you. Same logic applies for the guy above. Its really silly to think people will tell God I was a good christian but I dont follow your laws because theyre odd to megt a large portion of the bibles teachings and commands were written for a different time and are hence no longer relevant.In order to believe this youd have to believe God lacked the foresight and didnt take that into consideration. I mean weve been around for K years the bible was written K years ago and majority of the book is suddenly irrelevant in modern times? Did He not take into consideration the world would be wildly different place in a small amount of time?So to me you should follow all commands from the Bible or youre just not following it all. The stuff you dont agree with is written in the same pages as the stuff you do agree with. Its the same source.That would be like me telling you to stop stealing food because its wrong  while Im taking cash out of the registers.

Makes me wonder how many white knights are on the internet.You cant just say that the OP doesnt want casual sex because hes a  year old virgin. What if he does and is just being too much of a nice guy and that turns girls off? At some point you want a philosophy that will allow you to be deliberate to get what you want. Perhaps being nice for  years hasnt gotten him what he wanted. Can he really just sit there and be content being nice everyday? What if he thinks hes being nice but hes not?And stop using The Game and negging and disrespecting women to label the seduction community. Its about getting laid on the surface but most posters there would agree that at the core its about selfimprovement... or what they call inner game. First stop reading all the shitposts about how do I get laid or what opener should I use or even the field reports about how a bro went out with his other bros did some stupid shit got confident and then started pulling girls. Look for the principles before discrediting the whole thing.

Thats not right.    That being said trying to be a good person doesnt work. Being yourself doesnt work. Exercising developing skills and experiencing things around you doesnt work. All of these things are true when youre unattractive.   So I do understand why someone would want a strategy to get people to like you. I just wish there was something out there that wasnt immoral.

99630,0,t1_cepoe6z,Knowing that religious texts are often allegorical I look to what science is saying about how the world works and see if it can help make sense of the allegory. We know that many times when the bible says day it means age or nonspecific long length of time. Take the Big Bang. Sudden expansion as a result of some great commotion. I imagine this is what is meant when the voice of a god is the catalyst for creation.The notion of k year old earth comes from some guy adding up the lineage of Adam but that doesnt really seem like a firm basis for a guess. The bible also mentions the earth existing before god shaped it at all. So I can take it that there is no information in the bible that should allow someone to extrapolate the age of the earth.

Small groups of  people. No more than  probably. Enough that everyone knows everyone. They would gain a group identity and stick together for mutual benefit and protection. They would be wary of or openly hostile to other groups.What you see in DayZ is what would happen if all the survivors happened to be sociopaths. Functionally this is what you are in the game because the game forms a barrier preventing you from experiencing real empathy with another human. That plus the severe lack of consequence and no nightly period of being comatose where you really really want someone around to keep watch the freely available guns and food so no actual work needs to be put into surviving. Real work like chopping down trees planting crops fishing hunting food preparation etc no maintenance of tools and all the other things you need to do to survive. The lack of all of that means there is almost zero incentive to work together for mutual benefit beyond having more firepower around.This is all fine and good.

If the business owner chooses to overpay for work then that is the business owners decision.  Doing it because he is racist is no more or less valid than doing it because certain employees are better at their job than others.Wage agreements are voluntary.  If all you bring to the table is the fact that you showed up with an application then you rightfully dont have any bargaining power and you are going to struggle to gain bargaining power even if you join collectively.Im not sure how any of what you are saying makes the market irrational.,bestof,cf10xt5,1,t5_2qh3v

It is not recreational it is not sold it is traditionally not done alone and it is most definitely not an outlawoutlier substance there and is not even considered a high. Every drug every substance you mention however is. This is different. The idea that someone on ayahuasca wouldnt take care of their kids is pretty laughable.I dont care about defending the term or calling it therapy.

Parity was at an alltime low in the late s when the league was most popular and at near an alltime high in the s when it suffered a huge loss in popularity.  You have to remember that the league added  teams between  so wins at the top of the league were inflated in that period.IMO the popularity of the league throughout the s and s was due to an unsustainable marketing bubble first with MagicBird and then with MJ.  Take any of those three guys away and it would have crumbled.  It was a hard transition but the idea that the alphadogs of the league need be demigods is over thank god.IMO the league has never been in a better place despite not being as popular as it once was.  It is a more beautiful game due in part to rule changes less isoball less heroball more active offense and defense etc. Player development is improving and imo better than ever with the decreased emphasis on college ball as well as smarter incentive driven contracts for young players..  There is more talent in the league than ever before due also in part to the rise of international players and again imo a greater work ethic amongst todays stars.,bestof,cf4huve,68,t5_2qh3v

405293,0,t1_cfmqr5u,TCP is essentially a superset of UDP. You could reimplement the functionality of TCP entirely with UDP.UDP is very basic. Its sending a text message. You tell the system where you want your message to go and it tries to send it there. If that phone number doesnt exist no one tells you. If that phone number is a landline that cant receive texts no one tells you. If that persons phone is off no one tells you. If the entire phone network fucks up and the message just gets dropped halfway there no one tells you. Its a besteffort delivery. Usually pretty reliable but theres no guarantee.TCP is meant to make an inherently unreliable system of communication reliable. When you want to talk to someone you send them a text that says Hello are you there?. They reply with Yes Im here. and you respond Ok great..Now you know that youve got a line of communication opened with someone. So you start sending your messages. But you number them all starting at . You send out three messages marked   and .The guy at the other end gets message  then message . He sends back Received . Received . You go Oh crap he lost number . So you send text number  again. He receives it.So now he has texts   and . He uses the numbers to put them back into the proper order.And now even in the face of an unreliable system youve managed to reliably transmit a message and have it recreated as it was sent on the other end.So why doesnt everyone use TCP for everything?For one its slower. Every time you send a message a response is required from the receiving party. If you have a second three part message to send you have to wait for the other guy to receive all of your texts then wait for all of his replies to come back then you can send. Versus UDP where you can just send all six and it doesnt matter.And two this is usually the main consideration as bbqroast mentions  sometimes you just dont care if you lose some data. In the case of a VoIP session if one packet out of the hundreds youre sending gets lost you dont really care. It will still sound fine. More importantly by the time the other party realized that it hasnt been received and resends it... The data in it is out of date and useless anyway.Or think of a first person shooter If I quickly send Player  is at  then Player  is at  then Player  is at  all in under a second... What real loss is there to losing the middle message? The end result is accurate it just appears as if the player moved from  directly to . Better yet once you receive their location at ... What use is the knowledge that they were at  anyway?,bestof,cfmrwjv,38,t5_2qh3v

Given that being born with perfect pitch seemed incredibly outlandish. I also know from personal experience that there is some confusion as to what perfect pitch actually is so I also took that into consideration.The original commenter may very well have perfect pitch. However I stand by my idea that even if heshe has the most perfect pitch ever using that fact as a basis to claim authority over this particular argument is very disingenuous.

Meets some DPS along the way who help carry him through. Keeps trying to romance one of his companions he picks up but cant even heal the tank during boss fight. Loses and ragequits. Decides to level at GSF but the enemy is a bunch of PUG losers.EMPIRE STRIKES BACK  Welp now that hes onto the next planet and has to solo hes pretty much screwed. Gets killed by some random elite unit and is lucky that he was able to CC it with mez. Gets picked up by his guildie. After a losing warzone he hightails it to some planet that sounded cool and meets a ltFOUNDERgt character who shows him how to notsuck. Even his teacher is concerned hell end up rerolling as a sorcerer. Good news is that the operativegirl is doing really well and might be able to lead some HM instances soon. He joins up with the rest of his guildies to do some world event on cloudcity. Shows up late his gunslinger gets disconnected thanks to carbonate. Some power tech kicks his whole partys ass and then he loses to a juggernaut who tells him to reroll so that they can do the  HEROIC RULE GALAXY AS FATHER AND SON. Luke leaves the instance and buys some prosthetic gear with Cartel coins.RETURN OF THE JEDI  Okay so Luke bought some sweet cartel gear and knows his way around tattooine. He finds Jabbas palace and doesnt mind earning a few dark side points since he heard that Hutts dont fuck around. Unfortunately he makes the wrong choice in conversation and loses a ton of Hutt Cartel reputation. He manages to get captured then thrown into a rancor pit but he finally learned how to use his bubbleability and is able to keep himself alive long enough for him to figure out that he can skip the fight if he throws a rock at a computer terminal. After godknowshowlong he and his friends manage to break the carbonate CC on the smuggler. They earn TONS of dark side points for blowing up a skiff loaded with wealthy peopleslaves and only manage to survive because the power tech used his knockback effect on himself and ended up in the sarlaac essentially a REALLY crappy arena mechanic. They all leave together but luke needs to go weekly events on dagobah for exp. His mentor there tells him that hes quitting probably because all of the fucking FPers and warns him that Empire storyline is boring. Luke leaves the planet and joins up with a raidgroup who want to take down the shield generator on Endor. Once theyre on the ground he takes off like a jerk so that he can go do a classquest on the deathstar. But he has to complete it before the server shuts down. He is greeted by that highrating juggernaut who wants to v him in frot of his guildleader. They end up dueling and luke gets his ass kicked until his opponents gear breaks and hes vulnerable. Sorcc tells him that he can join the guild if he agrees to reroll but Luke doesnt want to because his guildmates agree to put up with him. The jugg is pissed off and forcepushes his guild master into a reactor which kills him  and causes him to delete his character. Jugg also realizes that his class is broken and tells Luke he should just stick with consular since everybody else is either a commando or a really shitty sniper who doesnt invest in  aim.oh and they all wear the same gear anyway.

I am not sure we will ever get to a point where interstellar travel is possible or practical but that doesnt mean we shouldnt do research on it.I dont think the opportunity cost argument really applies because I dont think its in the same category as medical research.  Its more knowing whats out there for the sake of knowing.  Therefore you could argue that public money shouldnt be used on something like that but as you said there are tons of other programs I would cut first.

Theres nothing stopping someone from starting their own barring the typical requirements of having contacts you can do business with or things that you have to gasp work hard and get for yourself. Hard work does pay off but its never hard work for someone else that pays off.That being said your pessimistic view that everything is under a multinational like the first post is also a load of bull.

Therefore them using the death of one of their brothers or fathers to foster more hate and killing is mute. Like they werent doing that on their own?  These people indoctrinate their own children regardless for a multitude of ridiculous reasons if head daddy got shot trying to blow up a bus of school children and now his children are seeking revenge against the shooter or his countrymen its just the same displaced anger they would have had regardless. Basically I am saying it does not matter what their anger is pointed at it does not foster MORE terrorists. Revenge is relative if it were not revenge it would be some slight against their god or some woman being allowed to smile in public it does not matter and the reason doesnt matter.This is like any religion most kids from religious families are religious those who break free of it I like in the west do it in a calm nice life setting with readily available resources with different opinions and influences.

466517,0,t1_cft3skd,gt Portraying women as dominant and powerful and leading men is just not something that can happen in a film today.Well thats not really true. Its just not something thats easily made popular. Female leads are generally unpopular with men and not all women like headstrong women. Its a trait that men seem to socially be able to get away with that women cant. Its harder to write which translates to it being written less often.Consider the Erin Brockovich movie was immensely popular when it came out. It worked because she was being powerful and headstrong but at the behest of others. Most men and women dislike headstrong females because they seem selfish I dont know why that is but women are much more swiftly accused by both genders of being selfish. The fact that she was working for the sake of the wronged completely eliminated that instinct.It also tied in her motherly duties in a very heartbreaking way. It covered all the political bases which is why the character was so immensely likable by everyone. Progressive women liked the powerful female lead while conservative women saw someone devoted to charity. It united the often disunited female audience but better still men saw an underdog stickin it to the man who was sexy to boot.Its very doable the trick simply is to ensure the audience cant call the woman selfish. She has to be entirely selfsacrificing. For now  Hollywood I hope youre listening  thats the loophole.,bestof,cftam3e,18,t5_2qh3v

E.g. by telling the RA she thought someone was breaking in to the dorm ruining Melons keycard and never owning up to it.  Its therefore not hard to imagine that shes also lying in her story. Honestly I wouldnt be surprised if she stretched the truth to make the roommate look worse than she really was. Look at the bit about the hamster for instance. Hamster feces do not harbor disease. Its a fabricated problem. Also if she really had been confronting Melon about the rulebreaking then you can bet Melon would have suspected she was the one who reported her all those times. Instead Melon has no idea.

AT THE POINT AT WHICH AN OBJECT OBSTRUCTS A BEAM OF LIGHT THE LIGHT BEAM IS CUT OFF FROM THAT POINT ALL THE WAY TO WHERE THE SHADOW IS CAST. IN THE SAME WAY AS ONE CANNOT SEE A BEAM OF LIGHT UNTIL IT STRIKES AN OBJECT AND IS REFLECTED BACK INTO ONES EYES ONE CANNOT SEE THE BEAM THAT COMPRISES A SHADOW EXCEPT FOR THE ABSENCE OF THE BEAM ON THE SURFACE UPON WHICH THE SHADOW IS CAST. BUT THE BEAM OF LIGHT IS THREEDIMENSIONAL AND THE SHADOW IS A THREEDIMENSIONAL ABSENCE OF A BEAM OF LIGHT.ITS EASY TO SEE THAT THIS IS TRUE. IF YOU CREATE A SHADOW AND PUT YOUR HAND INBETWEEN THE OBJECT CASTING THE SHADOW AND THE SHADOW BEING CAST A SECTION OF THE SHADOW CONE WILL BE CAST UPON YOUR HAND. YOUR HAND WOULD BE INTERSECTING THE THREEDIMENSIONAL SHADOW.A FOURDIMENSIONAL OBJECT WOULD CAST A FOURDIMENSIONAL SHADOW. BUT FIRST WE MUST IMAGINE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE IN ANOTHER DIMENSION. LETS IMAGINE A TWODIMENSIONAL PLANE OF EXISTENCE AS A PIECE OF PAPER. UPON THIS PAPER ARE THREE OBJECTS A TWODIMENSIONAL WALL A TWODIMENSIONAL BEING AND A TWODIMENSIONAL LAMP. THE LAMP IS CASTING A BEAM OF LIGHT TOWARD THE BEING AND THE BEING OBSTRUCTS THIS LIGHT CASTING A SHADOW ON THE WALL BEHIND IT. TO ANOTHER TWODIMENSIONAL OBSERVER THEY WOULD OBSERVE THE SHADOW BEING ONEDIMENSIONAL AS A LINEAR DARKENING OF THE WALL. BUT TO A THREEDIMENSIONAL OBSERVER LOOKING FROM ABOVE THE SHADOW MAY APPEAR AS A TWODIMENSIONAL PROJECTION COMING FROM THE POINT AT WHICH THE BEING OBSTRUCTS THE LIGHT.NOW LETS IMAGINE HOW THAT WOULD APPEAR IN THE THIRD DIMENSION. A SHADOW IN THE THIRD DIMENSION AS WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN IS A THREEDIMENSIONAL OBJECT EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARS TO A THREEDIMENSIONAL OBSERVER AS BEING TWODIMENSIONAL. A FOURDIMENSIONAL OBSERVER LOOKING FROM WHAT WE SHALL CALL THE EXTERIOR MAY SEE THE SHADOW AS A THREEDIMENSIONAL PROJECTION PERHAPS AS A SORT OF CONE. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT THE FOURDIMENSIONAL OBSERVER MAY SEE THE ENTIRETY OF THE SHADOW NOT JUST THE POINT AT WHICH A WALL OR OTHER SURFACE INTERSECTS IT AND BECOMES DARKENED.HOW WOULD A FOURDIMENSIONAL SHADOW LOOK? LETS GO BACK TO THE TWODIMENSIONAL PLANE. REMEMBER AGAIN THAT YOU CANNOT SEE A BEAM OF LIGHT UNTIL ITS OBSTRUCTED AND YOU CANNOT SEE A SHADOW UNTIL THERE IS A SURFACE FOR IT TO BE CAST ONTO. IN THE NORMAL EVERYDAY WORLD THIS IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE. BOTH THE SOURCES OF LIGHT AND THE OBJECTS WHICH THEY ILLUMINATE ARE THREEDIMENSIONAL. THEY HAVE NO TRICKY PROPERTIES AND WE CAN OBSERVE THEM BOTH WITHOUT EFFORT. BUT WHEN WE WORK WITH MULTIPLE DIMENSIONAL PLANES INTERSECTING THINGS GET A BIT CONFUSING. WHEN YOU SHINE A BEAM OF LIGHT ONTO THE TWODIMENSIONAL PLANE THE OBSERVERS EXISTING INSIDE THAT PLANE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO NOTICE THAT THE BEAM OF LIGHT WAS EVEN THERE UNTIL SOMETHING INTERSECTS IT. WHEN AN OBJECT INTERSECTS IT IT WOULD APPEAR TO THE TWODIMENSIONAL OBSERVER THAT THEY ARE BEING SPONTANEOUSLY ILLUMINATED. THERE IS NO SOURCE OF LIGHT THAT THEY CAN PERCEIVE FROM THEIR LIMITED VIEW. IF THEY WERE TO CUT THE OBJECT OPEN THEY WOULD FIND THAT ITS INTERIOR IS JUST AS ILLUMINATED AS ITS EXTERIOR. ONCE THE OBJECT IS REMOVED FROM THE SPOT IN WHICH THE FLASHLIGHT WAS BEING SHONE IT WOULD CEASE TO BE ILLUMINATED.HOW WOULD A SHADOW LOOK TO THE TWODIMENSIONAL OBSERVER? WELL A SHADOW IS JUST THE ABSENCE OF THE LIGHT BEAM. IF ALL WERE DEALING WITH IS A FLASHLIGHT THEN A SHADOW IS JUST THE ABSENCE OF A FLASHLIGHT. SINCE THERE WAS NO FLASHLIGHT BEFOREHAND THE SHADOW WOULD JUST SEEM TO BE A FACET OF THE SHAPE OF THE LIGHT BEAM AND NOT ANYTHING OF INTEREST. FOR THE SHADOW TO BECOME TRULY INTERESTING WE WOULD NEED A LARGER AMOUNT OF ILLUMINATION.LETS IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A LARGE CLOUD OF TWODIMENSIONAL FOG IN THE TWODIMENSIONAL PLANE. LETS ALSO IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE ILLUMINATED THE ENTIRE CLOUD FROM THE THIRD DIMENSION WITH A LAMP OF SOME SORT. NOW WE HAVE A GLOWING TWODIMENSIONAL CLOUD. IF WE PLACE A BALL INBETWEEN THE LAMP AND THE TWODIMENSIONAL PLANE IT WOULD CAST A CIRCULAR SHADOW ON THE CLOUD. BUT TO THE TWODIMENSIONAL OBSERVER THAT SHADOW WOULD NOT BE BEING CAST BY ANYTHING VISIBLE TO IT. IT WOULD BE A FLOATING SHADOW CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GLOWING CLOUD. THE OBSERVER COULD WALK AROUND IT AND SEE THAT IT IS PERFECTLY CIRCULAR AND FLOATING IN THE AIR COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM ANY OBJECT TO CAST IT. IT WOULD BE TO THEM A TWODIMENSIONAL SHADOW WHICH IS SOMETHING THE TWODIMENSIONAL OBSERVER WOULD NOT BE ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING SEEN ONLY ONEDIMENSIONAL SHADOWS. BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A THREEDIMENSIONAL SHADOW BEING OBSTRUCTED BY THE TWODIMENSIONAL CLOUD OF FOG.NOW WERE READY TO IMAGINE A FOURDIMENSIONAL SHADOW. WELL HAVE THE FOURDIMENSIONAL BEING ILLUMINATE A THREEDIMENSIONAL CLOUD OF FOG. SO NOW WE HAVE A GLOWING CLOUD IN THE THIRD DIMENSION ILLUMINATED BY A FOURDIMENSIONAL LAMP EXISTING IN THE EXTERIOR OUTSIDE OF OUR PLANE OF EXISTENCE. WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THE CLOUD FILLS A ROOM AND WE CAN WALK THROUGH IT AND IT WOULD GLOW SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD. NOW WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THE FOURDIMENSIONAL OBSERVER HOLDS UP A FOURDIMENSIONAL BALL OR A HYPERSPHERE IN FRONT OF THE FOURDIMENSIONAL LAMP CASTING A FOURDIMENSIONAL SHADOW ONTO THE THREEDIMENSIONAL CLOUD OF FOG. TO THE THREEDIMENSIONAL OBSERVER IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THERES A THREEDIMENSIONAL SPHERICAL SHADOW FLOATING IN THE FOG. IT WOULD BE HANGING IN THE AIR COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THE OBJECT WHICH IS CASTING IT. IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY CIRCULAR APPEARING AS A CIRCLE FROM EVERY ANGLE YOU COULD VIEW IT.THATS A BIT BORING THOUGH. LETS IMAGINE INSTEAD THAT THE FOURDIMENSIONAL BEING HELD A FOURDIMENSIONAL CUBE OR A HYPERCUBE IN FRONT OF THE FOURDIMENSIONAL LAMP. IT WOULD CAST A SHADOW ONTO THE FOG IN THE SHAPE OF A THREEDIMENSIONAL CUBE. TO THE THREEDIMENSIONAL OBSERVER IT WOULD APPEAR AS A SHADOW CUBE FLOATING IN THE FOG. AS YOU TURNED AROUND IT TO VIEW IT AT DIFFERENT ANGLES IT WOULD NOT APPEAR AS A CIRCLE EVERY TIME BUT AS IF YOU WERE VIEWING A BOX FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES. AS YOU TURNED IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT SHAPE EACH TIME. BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT AN OBJECT JUST A SHADOW IT WOULD HAVE NO GRADIENTS OR REFLECTIONS.

531691,0,t1_cg0oefa,These are fine sounding words and you make your case eloquently but ultimately there is a higher principle at stake here that outranks anything else that we might say on this issue.As a Christian who believes in the loving message of Christ I cannot and will not do anything that hurts others least of all vulnerable people from minority groups. In particular I will not and cannot support anything that harms children.It is obvious if you study the reality of homosexuality and the lives of gay people that what is said in the Bible on this subject arises from human ignorance and not from divine wisdom.A loving God would not want me to join in the bullying and tormenting of a vulnerable minority group especially when many of the victims are just kids. Its as simple as that.There is aboslutely no logical reason why homosexuality should be a sin. And that is underlined by the fact that Jesus never mentioned it and it is not mentioned in the  commandments.It doesnt meet any of the normal criteria of sins.God didnt just give us His son and the Bible he also gave us our brains and our consciences. And my conscience which was developed in a Christian upbringing will not allow me to hurt vulnerable people.It is impossible that God would want me to say things and take actions that lead to young lives being destroyed.Never forget there will come a day when we all have to account for our actions. The question you have to ask yourself is what will you say when you are asked why you did nothing to help youngsters who were suffering. Why did you close your eyes so you wouldnt see the torment and misery they were experiencing. Why did you cover your ears so you wouldnt hear their cries for help.Why did you cross to the other side of the street when they needed your help the most.Why did you make no effort to understand what they were going through or try to reach out in a practical way to help ease their suffering.I hope you have a good answer.,bestof,cg0pktk,4,t5_2qh3v

You have some countries like Norway where the government owned enterprises are used smartly investing profits into funds that will survive and provide long term for the citizenry. And then you have countries like Venezuela where state control over the economy has destroyed productivity. And then you have a third category where state enterprise are used as an extension of the government like Gazprom in Russia used as a tool for economic warfare and the military in Egypt essentially controlling both the government and populace through ownership of private industry.There has to be a balance between productivity and spending otherwise youre left taxing until there is nothing left to tax.

This would stem from many cultures giving an implied value to temperance of individuals and their will to be sexually reserved  removing themselves from this will and freely giving up their sex resonates this thought that their sexuality isnt that important after all and implicitly the sexuality of others isnt as important either. This is a highly Kantian theory in that women who shame other women do so because theyre no longer valuing the dignity of themselves as females and infact then only treating others as a means to their own sexual desires and consequently using themselves also as a means to this fulfillment thus no longer respecting themselves or their sexual partners as an end to which dignity and human spirit should exist.  ,bestof,cg67ifw,2,t5_2qh3v

Nothing lets you get around the fact that you have to make up the depreciation if it turns out that the asset didnt really lose value that fast.  That is if you later sell it for more than the tables say to book it at thats new taxable income.Remember anything you can label as an expense is effectively a superaccelerated depreciation in that you can deduct  immediately.  Cases where the tax code allow accelerated depreciation are generally just a recognition that some purchases like prospecting equipment are more expenselike.

637261,0,t1_cgcltav,No... For one thing its not all about ethics maybe that is what is causing your confusion. Second the ethics are related to the value of humanity and the humans within. The ethics involve the question of what one can do to perpetuate and improve upon humanity in any number of ways. It might be literally improving quality of life or maybe its just contributing some piece of art or thought process or whatever with the focus on the fact that a human is doing it and they are doing it for humans.gt Youre applying a meaningless definition of humanism then where there is no such thing as humanist ethics at all. This is a non sequitur. It does not logically follow anything I have said. Nothing I have said precludes humanist ethics. I have only said that their description and application may differ from one humanist to another.gt If thats your definition then your idea of humanism is a hollow shell of a philosophy with nothing to say about anything. It is not my definition it is the definition of humanism. You can look it up... I urge you to do that. Theres not much point in me trying to explain the same thing to you over and over again. Here Ill show you some partial definitionsGooglegt an outlook or system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. Humanist beliefs stress the potential value and goodness of human beings emphasize common human needs and seek solely rational ways of solving human problems.Wikipediagt Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings individually and collectively and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence rationalism empiricism over established doctrine or faith fideism.rhumanismgt Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives.dictionary.comgt any system or mode of thought or action in which human interests values and dignity predominate. merriamwebster.comgt  a doctrine attitude or way of life centered on human interests or values especially   a philosophy that usually rejects supernaturalism and stresses an individuals dignity and worth and capacity for selfrealization through reason thefreedictionary.comgt . A system of thought that rejects religious beliefs and centers on humans and their values capacities and worth.gt . Concern with the interests needs and welfare of humansAmericanhumanist.org this website has links that describe it further and outline the different flavors etc.gt Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that without theism and other supernatural beliefs affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity.Hopefully that is enough to get the point across. I guess what you seem to be struggling with is the idea that a humanist must be nice if they are supposed to be ethical towards humans then why not ethical in general in terms of treatment of other organisms. I see where that comes from and like I said I dont disagree with those principles. My only point is that they are not a part of the core set of humanist beliefs. It doesnt seem to me that the opposite are either that is that humans are of the utmost importance at the expense of all else. The core principles are a level above that humans have value they have agency. They can act consciously and intelligently it does not imply that nothing else can although it is self evident that nothing can match us. And when humans do things it should be for humans. That could be derived from obvious biological programming or some appeal to our intelligencesentience as a measure of importance. But in the end it comes down to the idea that we are all in this together and we are the only ones looking out for our survival.,bestof,cgcpgtq,1,t5_2qh3v

744160,0,t3_22nopc,gtSafety gtDimethylmercury MeHg is extremely toxic and dangerous to handle. Absorption of doses as low as . mL has proven fatal. The risks are enhanced because of the high vapor pressure of the liquid. gtDimethylmercury passes through latex PVC butyl and neoprene rapidly within seconds and is absorbed through the skin. Therefore most laboratory gloves do not provide adequate protection from it and the only safe precaution is to handle dimethylmercury while wearing highly resistant laminated gloves underneath longcuffed neoprene or other heavyduty gloves. A long face shield and work under a fume hood are also indicated.gtDimethylmercury crosses the bloodbrain barrier easily probably owing to formation of a complex with cysteine.  It is eliminated from the organism slowly and therefore has a tendency to bioaccumulate. The symptoms of poisoning may be delayed by months possibly too late for effective treatment. gtThe toxicity of dimethylmercury was highlighted with the death of the inorganic chemist Karen Wetterhahn of Dartmouth College in  months after spilling no more than a few drops of this compound on her latexgloved hand.,bestof,cgov8ck,13,t5_2qh3v

Neither of us can say yes or no with any certainty.As far as the WTC buildings as a special case they very well mightve been. In  WTC  was truck bombed with the explicit intention of bringing it down into WTC  this is stated in the FBI report and news articles thatre easily googled To me at least it would be a logical step to consider an action plan against the buildings being toppled.But like I told everyone else my theory is outside of the the u.s. crashed the planes on purpose conspiracy.

They thrive on knowing more about specifics than you do. But you can show some of them that they are wasting their life awayMay be true. Im very well versed in the standard protestant bible. Most protestants which are populous in the U.S. cant throw verses at me without being crushed by me knowing their holy book better than they do. I cant speak to mormonism in general. However its clear here that Kens reasoning is based belief and a will to believe rather than facts. He knows it and you know it. So present your case.He may deny it. He may stay an outward Mormon for the rest of his life. He says it himself. He doesnt have it in himself to be an atheist which to be frank is a tacit admission that he buys into his religions for comfort because atheism is admittedly uncomfortable. Let me parse that last line hes already too smart to really be mormon but not brave enough to really be atheist to anyone who disagrees and is pondering an IM allow me to reiterate that I dont care and dont waste your time.All of this said Is mornomism shitty?Obviously.But people who have read this far know that and Mormons who will be convinced would know this before they ever got this far.,bestof,ch0m4ry,0,t5_2qh3v

My one nephew doesnt have high enough linguistic function to explain what has happened to him and it scares the hell out of our family that someone could be hurting him and we wouldnt know. Sure we look for any signs at all of abuse but what if we miss something?My other nephew is like you... Higher passing rate and able to know that hes not neurotypical. He also has a few problems beyond the autism problem.What would you have wanted from your family? What can I do to be the best relative theyve got?

897280,0,t3_24cv7j,Im ugly. I have one friend. I have never been the type of person that can handle more than one good friend at a time. I am in a situation currently where I couldnt make friends even if I wanted to. I am a nice person that has a lot of compassion for others though. I like myself and enjoy the time I get to spend alone. I am a good mother and I know that my kids love and need me. I hate having my picture taken because I get so disappointed at how unphotogenic I am. I have seen other photos of people that I wouldnt consider good looking but somehow they manage to not look like ogres in pictures. That depresses me. I have had to accept myself as is though. I dont have a defined chin but I have a thick neck. But a chin implant doesnt sound like something I am willing to go through even if I could afford it. Whatever type of chin I have I keep it up though! I mean sometimes I do feel down but life goes on. I might even come across as vain because I spend  minutes applying makeup every morning to try to make myself presentable. I think I am pulling it off. I am not having a pity party but I am being honest about myself. Do I have a good personality because I am ugly or do I just have the common decency to treat others as I would like to be treated? Im not social and it might be because I am afraid rejection. So its safe to not seek out company of other people. So its best to play it safe and be comfortable as a loner. That way I dont become upset if I feel that I am being ignored by anyone. I wasnt seeking their company or attention in the first place. Easy peasy. ,bestof,ch69x6k,2,t5_2qh3v

898923,0,t1_ch63uwv,Wow this is great. Id like to add my thoughts on being yourself though. I think that weird people or just mostly regular people that dont have great social skills often hit their teenage years and all the social stigmas that come with it and they really start to try to conform to be as likable and broadly...generic or appeal to the widest audience to be accepted. They become a nice guy or nice person. Then after a while they realize all the friends theyre making arent really their friends theyre not developing real relationships because theres no depth there in the first place its just a facade.  They become depressed and disillusioned and then hear all this shit about be yourself and turn back and realize that door is closed now after years of neglect and forgetting who you really are. And they become even more confused because they dont know what be yourself is anymore its not instinctual like it was in childhood and before all these social barriers were put up. This is just my pet theory on the nice guy phenomenon. Being a nice person just means being pleasant and generic and theres nothing interesting there thats not really you. Think of how you talk to your friends. You fuck around you insult each other in fact you would probably be weirded the fuck out if your best friend started talking like that to you like an acquaintance.  This is just how it was for me and it took me a long time to uncover what I really enjoyed and be the kind of person that I truly wanted to be. Im still working on it though.,bestof,ch6gnod,1,t5_2qh3v

966882,0,t3_2552w4,This guy did way too much for a few thousand off MSRP.I will try to condense the steps as much as possible.  Get your preapproval done first before you go car shopping it will give you a leg up and take care of  of the headache you go through at the dealership. I recommend a local credit union or small bank as they offer traditionally lower rates.  Once that is done go ahead and do some car research on the vehicle you are interested in and look for the one you are most interested in and visit www.nada.com I recommend them always as this is what the dealerships use for car valuations as well as financial institutions. You want to get as close as you can to the invoicetradein value as that would be  LTV loan to value and is very important in terms of being upside down on your loan. kbb truecar and  blackbook are not useful to dealerships and they do not use that when factoring in price.   Head on over to the dealership that has your car whether it be new or used and take it for a test drive if thats the one you want call your loan officer and give them the Vin Mileage and options of the car to confirm its current value. It should match the same price you got in step . If so go ahead and start negotiating with the dealership letting them know that your financing is taken care of and you only want to discuss and agree on a price point for the car to drive off the lot today. I try to stick to whole numbers and always use an out the door figure I would lowball below invoicetrade in by maybe  or . Do not take any additional products and services they offer like GAP or extended your warranty. If you have a good credit union they should offer you the service cheaper. Also the dealer fee is bogus and I would try to get them to lower that as it is always  or  Dollars. Let the sales agent take it to the finance manager and he should come back in about  or  minutes with some BS excuse about how they would be losing money on the deal and they cant do that price.  Be prepared to walk away tell them that you have checked the NADA value of the car and at the current price they have it at you would be upside down on the car and that is not a good deal for you. Tell them you can get them a check today and drive it off the lot but only for a right price be polite and courteous but firm. Tell them a counter offer at maybe  below LTV and have him take it to the finance manager once he comes back if the price if where you are comfortable with it go ahead and take it. Draw up the paperwork and go to the bank pick up your check and take it back to the dealership Its a done deal. Sidenote I try to not give them any down payment upfront or trade in upfront once you agree on the price then tell them that you have a down payment or trade in you want to factor in. It is a little sneaky but it does work. ,bestof,che6zwf,11,t5_2qh3v

988874,0,t1_chgaf6v,When you buy a painting from an artist theres an unspoken agreement that your intention is to preserve it in its original state.  Legally of course the jus abutendi applies and you can set it on fire for all the law cares.  Similarly its perfectly legal to tip your waitress with a fake dollar that has a Bible verse printed on the other side to take all your meals for free at a homeless shelter despite being gainfully employed to go into the break room and eat all the slices of the birthday cake and so forth.In many situations though you get a discount thats built on the assumption that youll obey these rules.  If nobody tipped restaurants would be forced to simply include the equivalent of a  tip in the prices of their meals  taking away everyones ability to tip less for poor service.  If everyone started eating all the food meant for the less fortunate taxes would have to be increased in order to keep the shelters in operation.  If everyone violated basic office protocol theyd put a lock on the refrigerator and youd have to ask your boss to fetch the key every time you wanted to put your lunch in or take it out.Suppose that you hire an artist to make a painting for you.  Lets say he gets  from you for the painting and an additional  of utility from knowing that his painting is out there somewhere on display.  Now suppose he learns that many of his customers are destroying his paintings.  Suddenly hes lost a lot of utility.  In the future hell simply have to charge everyone  for a painting.  Thats a pretty bad outcome for everyone who didnt want to destroy the paintings...

1004166,0,t1_chib90l,gt  So cite a pattern where our ancestors were worse off than their modern day versions or admit the truth  people as a whole and in general are better off today than at any point in history.Well theres always the declining purchasing power of the US dollar over the past  years and the growth of the consumer price index  That ones just for the US but the trend is relatively the same globally.Increasing health conditions resulting from less nutritious food  Note in particular the declining mineral content in produce over the past  years page .  The general upward trend of nearly all types of cancers.  While people live longer thanks to technological advances in medicine now they survive the measles at  but die of lymphoma at ...We can just call this one even.Oak Ridges global fossilfuel carbon emissions continue to reflect ongoing atmospheric pollution our ancestors didnt see. as well as rising ocean level trends reflecting warming due to human activity.  and increasing atmospheric temperature trends which have direct impacts on weather patterns with negative affects on crop yields animal migration important food sources for many still general health etc.Declining savings trends  Savings for retirement wouldnt have been an issue for our ancestors since they wouldve been cared for by family instead of locked up in retirement homes or simply wouldnt have made it to retirement.  This is also negatively impacted by low interest rates as savings stagnate.  As well despite people thinking that low interest rates are good for loans remember the subprime mortgage fiasco that fucked millions of people?  Add to that the negative impact low interest rates have pension funds coupled with higher CPI values and retirees are doubly fucked.  Dwindling US government bond yields coupled with the highest levels of US government debt means the US is operating on borrowed time economically.  Guess what?  Not only are we worse off than our parents but our KIDS get to inherit the worsening situation too!The exorbitant cost of home ownership  This puts the potential for home ownership out of reach of most.  Couple that with increased debt and buying a home will be a fucking pipe dream for your children.  But dont worry property management companies with deep pockets will be able to buy these homes and rent them out leaving people with even less liquidity than they have now.  Even our parents could own their homes outright.  Better hope you dont get cut out of the will or more importantly that your parents have wills or else probates getting the house.Have there been beneficial advances over the centuries?  Sure.  The Industrial Revolution replaced workers with machinery so they could spend more time with family and other community and cultural affairs.  Whoops.  No it didnt.  The Technological Revolution of the th century did that by automating processes and making the human worker obsolete so they could enjoy more relaxation time.  Whoops.  No that didnt happen either.  And while work hours are down for most workers across the board and productivity is up supposedly levels of crippling debt are at all time highs...At least our ancestors knew how to live within their means.  I suppose this isnt a concern either since you wont have to pay that crippling debt...you get to pass that on to your kids too. ,bestof,chifjnq,0,t5_2qh3v

You or your lawyer will state on this petition which debts are dischargable which debts are not and whether any assets are secured by debt like a car loan or a mortgage.    It will also state which property is exempt from collection and which is not. The process is that you get to keep your exempt property and all your nonexempt property is subject to being sold to pay off your debts.  Once you complete the process the Courts order will say all your debts are discharged except for any that you keep or cannot be discharged. The combination of assets and debts is referred to as the bankruptcy estate. Within the bankruptcy court theres a position called a trustee.   This is the person he describes who represents the creditors.   The trustees job is to recover as much money from your estate as he can.  He is paid in part by a percentage of the money he can recover otherwise he recieves a small flat fee per case.  However trustees are also very practical.  Experienced ones have a good understanding of what they can get for any property and whether its worth their time and worth the money to have it seized or sold.   Most trustees dont bother with ticky little bits of property like clothes but they also have a good sense for when people are trying to hide assets from the court. Sometimes secured creditors hire their own lawyers but in individual chapter s those lawyers act in a very proforma manner as well.  They will present a simple choice.  Take a car loan for example. You can choose to reaffirm your car loan taking it out of bankruptcy keep making payments and keep your car.  Or you can surrender the vehicle and any debt left over will be part of the estate. For a simple chapter  bankruptcy like OP described you have one hearing.  The court will hear your petition the trustee will talk to you and the judge will talk to you and the trustee will state whether he wants you to surrender any property.   Any debts that are being reaffirmed will be discussed.   Assuming everythings in order the COurt will rule on the specifics of your petition and eventually issue an order stating what was decided at the hearing.  ,bestof,chnp6gs,31,t5_2qh3v

1072572,0,t3_26dz3q,Alan Shifman attorney for Peter Rodger assistant director of The Hunger Games series said the family has been told their son is dead after killing six people late Friday night. Shifman says that the family has not yet seen his body.Shifman said family members called authorities several weeks ago after being alarmed by YouTube videos regarding suicide and the killing of people.Police interviewed Elliot Rodger and found him to be a perfectly polite kind and wonderful human Shifman said. Shifman said police did not find a history of guns but did say the yearold had trouble making friends. Authorities have not yet confirmed the identity of the shooter.edit NEW INFORMATION the kid stabbed his three male roomates to death before starting the rampage he obviously had more issues than just virgin angst Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said that it would appear as if Elliot Rodger  the suspect in a deadly rampage near the University of California Santa Barbara  took his own life after he was wounded by officers. Rodger was found obviously dead in a crashed car after he allegedly killed six people and injured  others.   After leaving his residence Friday Rodger apparently fatally shot two female students from the University of California Santa Barbara while a third person suffered multiple gunshot wounds Brown told reporters. The suspect then went into a delicatessen where he shot and killed another USCB student Christopher MichaelMartinez according to Brown.   In addition to the six victims and the dead suspect  people were injured during this melee Brown said. Eight of those suffered gunshot wounds four were hit by the suspects vehicle and one has a minor injury of unknown origin.   The suspect had over  remaining rounds of ammunition when he was found obviously dead in his crashed car. Brown said that more people could have been killed if not for the actions of law enforcement. All the weapons used in Fridays rampage were legally purchased and registered to the suspect Brown told reporters.   Rodger appears to have fatally stabbed three males within his residence before embarking on the rampage Brown said.   Brown said that authorities had three contacts with Rodger. In one of those Rodger called the sheriffs department and accused one of his roommates of stealing candles. The third was a welfare check initiated by a family member Brown said. The deputies cleared the call the sheriff said.   Brown on Saturday confirmed that Elliot Rodger  is the suspect.,bestof,chq7exb,222,t5_2qh3v

Forensic psychiatry that is obtaining and analyzing information post hoc is even more difficult. A highly trained specialist is required to apply rigid methodology to analyzing writings behavior and medical records. See unless you use rigid and evidence based methodology the outcome can wildly vary. Even two similarly trained psychiatrists can disagree about diagnosis even when applying the same methodology.  But unless you have extensive training in this field any conclusion reached is as reliable as a electrician trying to interpret an EEG. This is EXACTLY why we in neuroscience absolutely discourage untrained people from reading the DSM and trying to come to a self diagnosis or differential because there is volumes of information and procedure behind the text and years of CLINICAL experience required to reliably and accurately come to the most clinically appropriate conclusion. ,bestof,chr5gmj,112,t5_2qh3v

1081091,0,t1_chr4y3t,gt I also disagree with the notion that this kid necessarily always had an inflated image of himself. It does not matter in the long run.  What matters is how he processed interpreted and responded to things.  The brain for all intents and purposes is a super computer that operates by a general and universal set of rules.  For example we have defined Therefore If i have  apples and Mary gives me  more apples I have  apples.    can NEVER    There are circuits in the brain whose operations for lack of better terminology are to process information and return a result.  Simply put one ensemble of neurons performs the operation .  The next ensemble of neurons fully expects its input to conform to known rules and bounds that have been previously fed into it.  When there is a disagreement or paradox between circuitsregions it results in what we call the blue screen of death.  The brain abhors a paradox and therefore tends to resolve the paradox by the simplest methods  filling in confabulation and denial.   Disconnect between episodic memory and emotional input from the amygdyla tends to result in Capgrass syndrome   Damage to the tempoparietal junction tends to result in anosognosia or denial of an illnessproblem despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary   Confabulation or filling in of missing information is extremely typical in Wernickes encephalopathy or damage to the higher Papez circuit.  In this kids case a strong argument can be made that in certain situations HIS  does in fact in HIS brain   You and I cannot comprehend this because the way we react to social interaction facial expression and body language we see .  We interpret his reactions thoughts and words in the context of our .  We in effect perform a transformation from his operation to ours and wrongly impose our own lexicon in place of his own.   Hence in my previous post unless you have some serious training in the right techniques interview skills and clinical diagnostic ability it is useless and counter productive to form a diagnosis.  In the absence of evidence based methodology and a lack of understanding of the entire clinical picture including a general impression of how his thought processes were carried out no conclusion will be correct.  TLDR He likely processed interpreted and responded to social interaction body language and other interpersonal cues completely different than you and I.  Without PRECISE methodology all is speculation and highly highly trained clinicians are needed to form the best most reliable conclusion. ,bestof,chr68h4,61,t5_2qh3v

SADLY THIS KIND OF REVEAL HAS BECOME COMPLETELY PAR FOR THIS SERIES.That... doesnt sound like things paying off that sounds like an author doing a Lost.gt FOR INSTANCE IN THE LAST HALF OFDRAGONS MARTIN SUDDENLY START OFFERING UP ALL THE PSEUDOCONCLUSIONS TO THE STORIES LAID OUT INCROWS. WHICH YOU KNOW COMPLETELY ROBS THEM OF ANY NARRATIVE WEIGHT SINCE THEY ARRIVEAFTERTHE SENSE OF TENSION BEEN LIFTED OUT OF THEIR STORIES. REMEMBER HOW THAT BOOK CAME OUTFIVE FUCKING YEARS AGO?It is really weird having some guy literally saying everything I predicted about the show is actually true. Im not a wizard though this story is just shallow enough for anyone looking to see all the machinery behind the curtain working.gt STOP TRYING TO DEFY EXPECTATIONS ALL THE TIME... KNOW WHAT MAKES DEFYING EXPECTATIONS SO GOOD? THAT IT UNEXPECTED. SO WHEN IT HAPPEN IN EVERY PLOTLINE IT THEN BECOME YOU KNOWEXPECTED. WHICH BASICALLY MEAN YOU TAKE PROVERBIAL DUMP ON THE CONCEPT OF DRAMA BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THINGS ARE LIKELY GOING TO GO TO SHIT AT ANY POSSIBLE SECOND.gt BUT INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT HOW TO INJECT DRAMA YOU WORRY ABOUT FINDING NEW WAYS TO DEFYEXPECTATIONS WITH CHEAP MANEUVERS. LIKE IN THIS BOOK WE SUDDENLY INTRODUCED TO A NEW TARGARYEN OFFSPRING. HE DEALT WITH ECONOMICALLY AND HULK GUESS IN SOMEWHAT INTERESTING WAY TO BE INTRODUCED SORT OF BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN HE THE ONE WREAKING HAVOC IN WESTEROS WITH SOME OTHER GUY new CALLED THE GRIFFIN. EXPECTATIONDEFYING? SURE. BUT ITSONEW AND NOT BUILT ON ANY SORT OF DRAMATIC FOUNDATION THAT IT HAVE NO REAL MEANING TO US IT JUST SORT OF THIS THING THAT HAPPENING.gt SOME MAY ARGUE HULK BEING PUNYMINDED AND NOT SEEING THE BIGGER PICTURE OF HOW INGENIOUS MARTIN IS AT TELLING HIS STORY. THAT HE PLAYING HULK PERFECTLY AND HULK TOO CAUGHT UP IN CONVENTIONAL DRAMA AESTHETICS. THAT MAYBE HULK CAN JUST NO TAKE IT WHEN AUTHOR NO DO SOMETHING HULK NO LIKE.I couldnt begin to guess how that might feel...gt BULLSHIT. THESE BOOKS CONSTRUCT THE DRAMABEYONDPOORLY. END OF STORY.You can assume he speaks for me here as well. Every time you respond here with how the shoddy plot isnt really shoddy because it pays off two books later with a reveal that is supposedly incredible I just have to roll my eyes.If you need six books of a thousand pages each to get across whatever Martin thought he was getting across in book one then you have failed.But if you enjoy being played like that then fair enough.

Aggression in dogs is usually a dominanceterritorial thing.  If they think you are an actual threat and youre not in their home then they will choose to run away rather than to fight and even when they fight its just to get you to run away out of their home.

FUCKING UP BOOT PATHS IS ANOTHER THING.You quote outliers to the common experience and try to establish it as the norm. Its intellectually dishonest.

Yes you deal with people that overlook simple problems because they dont think about the computer the same way you or I do.  They are worried about their budget presentation or getting designs back from the graphic department to meet their deadline.  My job is to fix their computer so if thats cleaning a virus or just unchecking a box what difference does it make if its a stupid problem. of people that are nasty are a lot nicer when you fix the problem so ignore it.

And while I cant say that age absolves them of any crime she never made any effort to contact the kids all she did was confront the mother and put up a sign.  Now obviously the kids shouldnt have taken anything but without knowing the context of their lives its hard to truly understand the situation. If the mother had taken actual steps to stop her kids stealing well then maybe this is the best way to teach them a lesson but for all we know the mother told her kids it was okay to pick the plants.

There are three countries within GB England Wales and Scotland. These are not independent countries but like Northern Ireland all part of the UK. However they are distinct in some ways specifically in football where they each have their own team. So at the UEFA or World Cup you can have a match like England vs. Scotland provided they both qualify even though they are both part of the United Kingdom.The United Kingdom is also as a whole part of the European Union EU.Because the UK has developed mostly out of the Kingdom of England and has been dominated by England for most of its history the country as a whole is sometimes called England or Great Britain or just Britain. The latter two are usually considered acceptable and GB is actually often used even in official contexts. Calling the UK England however is usually seen as ignorant.,bestof,cikp9y9,9,t5_2qh3v

Look at Europe for the past few centuries.And so it is in the Middle East the Sunnis say we own all this the Shias say we own all this and they will murder each other until they are sick of it.

1598034,0,t1_cjgjhtk,I would very much disagree. The only way its about faith is that if all you have is faith to base your belief on then ideally you wouldnt claim to know for certain. It doesnt matter how you came to your belief be it faith or evidence or logic all it matters is for theismatheism whether or not you believe and for gnosticismagnosticism whether you claim to know. Faith is irrelevant unless we want to talk about where the belief originally comes from.And yes agnostic theists definitely do exist. Dont tell me there arent things you believe but dont claim to be  certain about. And again as I said atheists dont say they are confident or certain that there is no god. All it takes to be an atheist is to lack belief in a god. And agnostics are not on the fence they are simply making a claim about their belief or lack of belief. They can believe or not believe they just dont claim to know.I think its maybe a mixup of definitions of know because in this sense agnosticismgnosticism use know to mean is  certain. Its basically how strong your belief is. You can believe or not believe theistatheist and you can do that strongly or weakly gnosticagnostic.There are lots of distinctions there and maybe theyre not really that important but the most important part of my previous reply was to clear up the misconception that atheism is claiming to be able to prove scientifically to anyone that there is no possibility that god exists which is like saying fishing is diving to the bottom of a lake and setting off a crate of TNT. The rest of it is just extra information about how defining atheism and agnostic is done in philosophical and religious discussions.,bestof,cjglnip,1,t5_2qh3v

1697679,0,t3_2dtn8j,New Yorker here. Heres my take on pizza styles. New York style is typically large  slices to a pie slices of thin crust should be chewy yet crispy reheats are best IMO sauce and whole milk mozzarella. You can a better than average slice in the  range or a cheaper dollar slice. Sicilian slices which are square usually thick slices that can come backed in a pan and come in grandma style which is a homemade sauce with chunks of sweet ripe tomatoes fresh mozzarella and basil. Sometimes upside down which is cheese then sauce LampB is my fav example. American neopolitan. Wood fired typically family owned second or third gen restaurant thats been using a family style recipe from italian immigrants to nyc that came in early s. Think Patsys tottonnos lombardis grimaldis. Not so authentic italian but tweaked for American taste a bit. Italian style. Wood fired hand tossed irregular shaped crust crispy and thin. Typically with  toppings or a Quattro formaggio high end imported and flavorful cheese or basil sausage prosciutto etc. I like eataly in flatiron. Roman style. Long rectangular pizzas with assorted toppings that are stored at room temps and trimmed off in squares to order. Faranella or Sullivan street are two I know of. Pizza by the foot. Nawleans style. Two boots pizza. One boot for Italy one for Louisiana. Crawfish shrimp those type of toppings. Chain pizza. Dominoes. Papa johns. Meh. Deep dish. UNOs pizzeria. Casseroles called pizza. Sorry for spelling. Just my two cents on New York pizza. Feel free to correct me if Im off on any of this. I frequent Gotham pizza cos I love the crispy crust and its across the street from my apartment. Between  you can two slices and a coke for . Otherwise I kinda cringe everytime I pay . a slice but I still go there once or twice a week anyways. Pro tip reheats are better than fresh slices. More crisp. Also its all about the water. Thats why youll never have crust as good as we have it in nyc. ,bestof,cjt5m8c,16,t5_2qh3v

Obviously normal being a single word is the least clunky but its not the preferred term so we try to respect that. Normal implies the abnormal other category. Ablebodied implies the disabledbodied other category. It may all seem the same which I can empathize with but thats where the community presently stands.Of course each person is an individual with their own preferences so it is always best to ask if you are unsure which term a person with disabilities prefers.,bestof,cju2vz1,0,t5_2qh3v

Literally doctrine. Also you must care that your country contributes to NATO in dollars and supports the US in these endeavors with intel logistics strategic access etc. Youll care about American forces when a Norwegian gets stabbedshot and an American or French or Greek or Spanish or any other NATO doc is there to save his life. Its not as black and white as Americans fucking the world up. Europe its leaders and armed forces have actively given money manpower time and effort into these problems. ,bestof,cjwlan6,1,t5_2qh3v

There are a lot of neighborhoods around the world with exceptionally high densities and buildings of only  stories or so.This is a very important point that isnt immediately obvious IMO.  I live and work near Seaside Florida which is one of the first examples of a town planned using the philosophy of New Urbanism.  This philosophy encourages public space vs. private ten houses can share a pocket park rather than each having its own huge denliving roomyard thoughtful transportation design limited car parking but generous footpaths bike paths and bike and golf cart parking and other featuresrestrictions that allow lots of people to live and work comfortably in a relatively small space.  Your last paragraph touches on what is IMO the biggest limitation to widespread adoption of this type of community design a shockingly high cost of living.  Very high real estate prices contribute to high rent retail pricing and all the other associated industries.

Essentially its like a large friend circle mines about  guys that acts as an official organization. As such were actually held to a higher standard than just any group of friends. E.g. Your friends can host a house party with underage drinking and have a good time but if we do it we get put on probation for a year. Unlike friend groups though we have codified rituals and ceremonies as well as a national network. The pledging process is a probationary period where its determined if you are a good fit into the chapter. Id argue that at least at my university we do a lot more good than harm. Greek chapters contribute literally  of the service hours on my campus and compromise over  of the student government. Each chapter usually donates over  a year and thousands of volunteer hours to charity over the course of the school year. This is all overshadowed and forgotten of course when one small thing goes wrong.Additionally most people in fraternities defy the stereotypes. A large group of people in mine are really into League of Legends. We have gay members as well as members who are racial minorities.

If you agree with the premises that A some people have better lives than others and B the differences in the quality of their lives are related in some meaningful and not entirely arbitrary way to  states of the world and states of the human brain then values boil down to facts about human wellbeing. So anything that maximizes human wellbeing is the most moral choice. There may be mutually exclusive and equally moral ways to achieve reach a peak of human flourishing but there are many more ways to fail at it.

The implication is that unethical writers are bloggers.  But there are bloggers who would say No no no.  Dont lump those fools in with us.  Bloggers are insert their definition.  What the writers for HuffPo are doing is ClickBaiting.  They are clickbaiters.  It just struck me as something to mention that as jackdawscrows was trying to defend journalism by saying dont lump those unethical writers in with real journalists he or she then lumped those unethical writers in with bloggers.

2035789,0,t1_ckyl4ts,From what I understand and I am not an animal care specialist vet nor am I handsome or well hung enough to play one in a porno but the traditional theory is that kneading alone is simply the cats way of expressing comfort and safety as the only practical use of kneading was to knead the mothers breastsglands so as to give milk more easily. However sucking is a remnant of distinct baby behavior getting milk directly as opposed to kneading which could be considered a secondary behavior which may not always be required to get milk from the breast which is not commonly seen later in life which leads some experts to believe it may have something to do with a cat being improperly weaned or discarded by its mother. My cat and most others Ive encountered knead often but rarely suck if ever.Its not BAD unless you are a breeder and all of the kittens your cats have given birth to suck and knead even after they are weaned and grown past  year.  year a cat is commonly considered an adult but personally I think between year  and year  its more teenage behavior. Think of the sucking like a human teenager who still sucks his thumb or a  something who still needs a security blanket. Again none of this is based on scientific fact or professional opinion but simply my observations from volunteering owning and reading articles about cats and baby animalshumans.,bestof,ckyldtb,9,t5_2qh3v

2157495,0,t1_cldoezv,Hello OP here. Im going to tell you what I told another poster who asked why my mom would get pregnant in that situation. Sorry for copying it over but my hands are killing me.Its a valid question so Ill give you a serious answer.Do you remember what it was like to be sixteen? Even a teen who didnt grow up being abused has a strong desire to be loved and taken care of so imagine how much stronger that feeling is when youve been abused? Now add the fact that youre flooded with hormones urging you to have sex and that youre incredibly confused about your body and sexuality due to the abuse and that you have virtually no sexual education because your parents are very religious and never spoke of dirty things.So you meet this guy and fall in love and hes pressuring you to have sex and saying youd do it if you loved him. Youre scared and confused and horny and lonely and just want someone to love you so bad. And yeah you might get pregnant and thats scary but if you had a baby maybe it would love you the way no one else did maybe youd finally have something of your own that no one could take away. And besides dont you owe your boyfriend sex? If you say no he might get it from someone else. So you give in to the hormones and the peer pressure because youre sixteen and your brain hasnt finished developing so you dont even have a good understanding of longterm consequences. Congratulations youre a parent!,bestof,cle2f7o,4,t5_2qh3v

2276396,0,t1_clsp0ro,In  Ted is telling his two kids the story of how he met their mother.  The shows quirky humor and mystery is set up in the pilot when Ted tells his kids the story of how he met and went on a first date with this beautiful womanwho is revealed at the end of the episode to be their Aunt Robin not their mother.The early seasons of the show focused very heavily on the mystery and excitementWho is the mother?  How will Ted meet her?  The writers loved to drop clues and set up conditions for who the mother might be.  Early in the first season we were told Robin would play a critical role in helping Ted meet the mother.  Later we learned Ted met the mother because of some incident involving a yellow umbrella.  By season  Ted explicitly explained to his kids that his story was the story of how paraphrasing he became the man he needed to be in order to meet their mother.In later seasons the writers pretty much told us exactly when and where Ted would meet the mother.  By seasons  almost no mystery remained other than who the mother actually was we knew where and when he would meet her.  So about that time the show shifted focus.  All throughout the show Ted had a crush on Robin.  They had the classic Ross and Rachel onandoff dynamic.  They dated in season  hooked up a couple of times in later seasons etc.  Unlike Ross and Rachel who had one serious fight about Ross cheating the show made it clear that Ted and Robin were fundamentally incompatible with each other.  As such after about season  the show became about Ted getting over Robin.  In fact the show repeatedly mentioned that in order to meet the mother Ted had to get over Robin.  In the meantime Robin fell in love with Barney and the last season focused entirely on Robin and Barneys wedding.In the actual finale Ted finally meets the mother.  All the clues we had learned were mostly true.  He met the mother at Robins wedding so Robin played a vital role as we were told she would.  He met the mother underneath her yellow umbrella.  Etc.  But essentially as soon as we see Ted and the mothers wedding scene were told the mother died and Teds kids basically say Dad you clearly have the hots for aunt Robin!  You should go pursue her!The problem is that all of the mystery and excitement of the show turned out the be meaningless.  All of the clues of who the mother was and all of the huge events in Teds life that propelled him toward the mother were meaningless.  The show ultimately wasnt about Ted meeting the mother.  It was all about Ted never getting over Robin.  In fact the mother was completely unnecessary.  Ted couldve literally never met her waited until he was  and then tried to get back with Robin.  Despite what the show told us Ted never really had to get over Robin at alland certainly not to meet the mother.  The whole love story between Robin and Barneywhich had been building for  seasonswas literally discarded within  minutes of show time after they got married.  Basically the writers threw away  seasons of character and plot development to bring us back to season  when Ted and Robin dated for the first time.,bestof,clt2xjx,8,t5_2qh3v

Its sad theyre not big enough to make amends about it but we still have a functional relationship. My father is waaay less abusive now than when I was a kid and my mom is still OK so I tolerate them. Im still mad and upset at them about this but I dont blame them anymore for their groupthink. If you lived in Oklahoma youd probably understand better. Even Jesus when he was being nailed to the cross yelled Forgive them father for they know not what they do. If I have one legitimate takeaway from the  years of being forced to go to church it is that you shouldnt hold peoples ignorance against them because they didnt choose to be ignorant. It was foisted on them. I pity them more than anything. I see my parents as sad people caught in a sad little world that they dont even realize. Theyre not terrible people theyre just horribly misguided. Im trying to be the bigger person by forgiving them for being dicks in the past. Youve got to let things go you know? I dont know if its worth it but they did actually try their best to raise me despite what it may look like. Theyre just idiots.Its a pretty strained relationship I wont lie.

Its a generic name and plenty of people will be using it long after Im gone.  To make my family happy? That is literally one of the worst reasons to do anything...Especially something so permanent as creating another human.  To feel complete? Well that might be what does it for some people but I am not one of them.   I feel more fulfillment from a good meal and a good shit the next morning.

2419019,0,t1_cmanw0b,Yeah and the OP also glanced over a very important part of the story    The naming trend popularized in late searly s started with naming children actual African names. Its not that hard to go to a library and find out the names of prominent Africans and popular names throughout history and thats exactly what parents did. A lot of people born back then have names that are actually used in Africa many of them Middle Easterninfluenced due to the Islamic conquest. Shaquille and Jamal are examples.    But as time went on people got rather sloppy with this convention. They wanted to give their kid a unique African name but didnt want to do their homework to find a real one that hadnt been used much. So they started making up new names or slightly changing popular ones to make them kind of sound like they were still ethnically African.    White Americans have been doing this quite a bit lately too. Consider all the completely new lee lyn leigh etc. names for girls. This is the result of parents dressing up popular names to be unique but still sound vaguely English.,bestof,cmap78j,143,t5_2qh3v

It means you can defend yourself with deadly force if someones trying to kick your ass and take your gun away from you without having to go to jail. However youre not allowed to express your happiness with this good news because everyone is looking for a reason to crawl up your ass and call you a racist. A certain amount of stoicism is required. You have to think of a response that changes the subject to something that people arent going to give you shit about. So you change the subject to officers that are killed in the line of duty. Because if Mike Brown had been able to take the gun away from the cop that killed him theres a good chance that cop would have been shot by Mike Brown. If another cop dies thats bad news. They feel bad because they know it could be them its a reminder that there is some level of danger in what they do. Also maybe they knew the guy and it makes them sad they dont get to hang out any more. You can grieve but you still have to go to work the next time youre scheduled.

2467965,0,t3_2ntddq,Does not get off to a very good start since the first point is blatantly false. He is using a gotcha type stat pushed by right wingers. The costs of Social Security exceed noninterest income taxes. However taxes are not the only income for the fund. When you include interest which in  was over b the fund is still growing.With no changes the Social Security fund will continue to grow until . The simplest way to extend that date is to raise the cap on the tax. Another factor that the post ignores and that the title here insinuates is that there are actually fewer illegal immigrants now than there were before the GFC. There is no overflow of illegal immigration. Since the GFC illegal immigration has been going backwards. In  the estimate was . million illegal immigrants by  it dropped to . million and has hung around that mark ever since. To say that undocumented workers are taking jobs is misleading as often the reason that job exists is because an undocumented worker is doing it. Without the undocumented worker the job simply couldnt exist. States that cracked down on undocumented workers found out about this the hard way. To put it simply the only reason Jeff is getting his deck built is because he can hire some undocumented workers to do it cheaply. That is not to say that there are some jobs undocumented workers take that would otherwise go to documented workers. The impact though is minimal compared to the amount of noise made by the right wing. Of course there is another aspect of jobs that immigration whiners ignore. Illegal immigrants spend money in fact they spend most of their money just to get by. We should all know what that means jobs. Just because they are undocumented does not mean they are not part of the economy. Since the economy scales with the size of the population it doesnt really matter if illegal immigrants have jobs. Their jobs leads to spending which leads to more jobs. This is why a country with  million people can have  unemployment at the same time as a country with  million people. Put basically the economy doesnt give a fuck if a worker is undocumented or not it still works exactly the same. Increasing the working population also increases the number of jobs available. It can lower wages though but I have written enough for today and that is an entirely different issue. ,bestof,cmgqnow,0,t5_2qh3v

A better analogy would be youre trying to convince your orange loving friend not to buy an orange car because insurance is higher for orange cars.Likewise lack of government regulation results in worse roads due to lack of truck limits heavier trucks destroy roads more and haphazard building. This does not in any way contradict with the second part of the argument. His second point is that having the owner impose restrictions also results in worse roads. You said that the owner could impose restrictions like limits on weight which is a positive restriction but a hypothetical is missing the point. In a real world example the owner only imposed restrictions that benefited him gates resulting in a worse road system.Hes complaining about no GOVERNMENT restrictions and having PRIVATE restrictions both resulting in a worse road which is a valid argument...,bestof,cmqeim5,0,t5_2qh3v

2557082,0,t1_cmsbazy,Nike is not a developing nation and China is not lacking in resources. They just choose increased profits over working conditions. The sweatshops in Malaysia are not state owned its not the government making money off of this so they can reinvest it in increasing quality of life.And companies and governments absolutely are saying pay workers crap what do you think a manufacturing giant would say to the government of Malaysia if they proposed increasing minimum wage? The working conditions are not necessary they are not a natural byproduct the resources are available to alleviate them. Nikes operating income was  billion dollars in   billion! Their profit margin is not just scraping by. China has the worlds second largest economy but it does not have a goal of improving working conditions. Working conditions are not improving despite the availability of resources not because of them. This is why I said how sweatshops are contributing is actually up to debate. Imperial colonialism did not develop colonies they exploited them for natural resources to benefit the colonizing state. The situation isnt much different with MNCs and developing nations. They are not reinvesting in Malaysia or Thailand they are benefiting American shareholders. Are the workers being paid and is that contributing to the economy of nations hosting sweatshops? Sure but is that money enough to reinvest and improve or is jut enough to feed clothe and house yourself? How much money are the host governments actually making from it its not oil theyre not making royalties. Exploitation is a much better word to describe the relationship between MNCs and developing countries than anything else. The bad conditions and low wages are not necessary to make a profit and much of the profit is not going to benefit the workers or the host state. Theres nobody to undercut anymore the MNCs have made them race to the bottom and theyve hit it. Now its become the status quo. The GDP growth of the sweatshop hosting nations hasnt changed much in the last  years. Malaysia and Thailand have seen growth in GDP per captia but others the Philippines and Vietnam have been fairly static with very slight improvements. Malaysia has oil too. If we expand our outlook to places to Bangladesh and Pakistan same trend thats basically static. Where is the development if this model works? Who is actually benefiting from these conditions? Could increase in economic conditions be faster? Could profits be better allocated or reinvested? Are the working conditions and wages actually necessary or natural or are people making extra profit off of the unnecessarily bad conditions of workers? Those are the questions we should be asking we shouldnt just say Oh it worked before and it sucks now but itll be ok!

There is a reason that when a punter kicks from  yard line or the  they can hit the same spot. They also account for the ball landing and can get the ball to have a favorable bounce back.

Then by teaching to the test the teachers are also teaching all you have to know for the course as well.All those factors you listed would either be present at the entrance exam or may actually measure teacher performance.Test anxiety if a student comes in and does poorly on the entrance exam they should do equally poorly in the exit exam as their anxiety shouldnt be any worse. If a teacher helps a student overcome this issue they are a good teacher and will receive a raise based on that students improvement.Students goofing off or doing poorly on purpose would happen both on the entrance and exit exams also a student doing poorly to spite their teacher would show that maybe that teacher wasnt the greatest.Family issues May be there for both the entrance and exit exams leveling the playing field.

Although a terrorist can be a Muslim and a Muslim can be a terrorist. Just like a WhiteBlackWhatever person may exhibit some racial stereotype that people may make fun of. Being WhiteBlackWhatever is not the defining characteristic of the person. I guess for some people it could be if they are very proud of their race but thats kind of a different discussion.gtpeople are not born Muslim they can stop being Muslim muslimness is not an expression of alles groups or geography.People do not choose what culture they are born into. Culture is very related to geography and I would say religion is very surely a part of culture. Sure a person can decide not to be Muslim but they may not want to choose to alienate themselves from the culture they know. There are plenty of people who say they are Mormons that I know and dont believe in anything the church is about but they still call themselves Mormons because they like to be a part of that culture.If you have a point you are trying to make then just say it because Im confused about what your point is.If youre trying to discredit my entire argument by saying that you cant compare Ethnicity to CultureReligion then fine. Thats not really that main part of what Im saying at all. In the comment you replied to Christianity is the example I used and its obviously the best one.

2806026,0,t1_cnmz54p,I think anal sex would generally be considered more gay because of how sex is generally viewed. With straight relationships a handjob is much less than penisinvagina sex or even a blowjob. Going all the way is usually a euphemism for PIV sex. In terms of what it entails its not all too arbitrary. Sex with penetration is generally more intimate and also entails more things to consider like disease and pregnancy. So a handjob would fall much lower level of sexual acts if you were to make a list based on how people generally rank them.So if you consider that and look at masturbation it wouldnt be very gay. Also since the goal of masturbation is your own pleasure its easily separated from a gayhandjob since the reward is your own sexual release not someone elses release.I can agree that many of the lines we draw are fairly arbitrary and sometimes silly but I think its pretty easy to understand in the example youve given.

On the other hand all other waves observed waves like on a rope water waves sound waves etc had a medium. It wasnt until some scientists tested more complex hypothesis and gathered more data that something like particle wave duality became the simplest explanation.

2833414,0,t1_cnq49vg,This is correct but that doesnt mean you should just stop trying at all.  I definitely agree that the kind of folks you see in rTumblrInAction are ridiculous and go way too far but I cant say I find the entire notion of trigger warnings to be useless.  IMO they should be used if its something in a context where you dont expect to actually see them or if theyre out of the blue.  Itd be silly to put in a trigger warning for war or combatinduced PTSD in a movie like Saving Private Ryan because thats to be expected.  And if you go into that and leave angry because you werent warned then thats on you and youre dumb because come on its a freaking war movie you idiot.But this is a commercial and being such could appear during any break on any TV show.  In this Marines case before getting his years of therapy and those kinds of things if his night of spiraling downward into whiskey and tobacco could have been curbed with a few simple words before the commercial at hand is shown would it not be worth the extra few seconds of screentime?  I mean from a monetary perspective probably not because extra seconds of airtime are expensive.  But from a moral viewpoint?In a way we already have trigger warnings on a lot of content in the form of ratings although thats more to avoid dumb angry parents and uptight people from suing the networkstudiopublisher.  But the idea behind ratings follows similar lines.  Would it be feasible to add a couple more letters to ratings to help warn people away that may be triggered?  Is that limiting on rights or a nuisance?Im just sort of thinking out loud here so to speak.  I dont know if theres an easy answer because practically speaking drawing up definitions and saying ok use warnings for this but not for that gets you into some asinine conversations.  But in general terms I cant say I disagree with the notion that they can be useful so I wouldnt dismiss them out of hand.,bestof,cnq5kuv,21,t5_2qh3v
2834524,0,t1_cnq4xig,Youre right all of the issues in some of these communities cannot be chalked up to racism. Socio economic status is probably the biggest factor in this whole thing. However when studies show that when you control for that and a bunch of other variables people of different racial backgrounds have different outcomes I think you have two choices. Either members of certain races are genetically predisposed to have certain outcomes despite socio economic status education etc... or theres something in society that affects them differently than others.Im not attributed this wide array of societal problems only to race but people in this generation have a bad habit of assuming that race doesnt factor into these problems. Thats the entire point of the OP.And I think its intellectually lazy to say Well I dont see people getting lynched and bathrooms are integrated so people are making too big a deal of this racism stuff. Whether people want to acknowledge it or not there are people who are using power structures to purposely mistreat and disenfranchise minorities. Take this quote from Lee Atwater one of Ronald Reagans closest advisers you can google it if you think Im making it upYou start out in  by saying Nigger nigger nigger. By  you cant say nigger  that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing states rights and all that stuff.

They are treated the same as gifts inheritance life insurance and other nontaxable transfers of wealth. There is no requirement to report the transfer on your tax return and it is not subject to income tax because it is legally not income.The only exception for this is someone whose professionbusinessprimary income is to win money in games or lotteries.

I never once talked about my own age.  Nonetheless people think im  years younger all the time.BUT he will he ever be a client of mine.  He is WAY too young.

Because thats always the wonderfully subtle racist implication that gets trotted out when this trifecta of completely unelaborated ideas gets mentioned. How do you think they GOT a small educated population in the first place?  By being racially homogeneous or by embracing progressive values?  Do you think perhaps it was because of things like birth control popular rejection of sexism leading to a society in which women have the ability to control their own reproduction and plan families and government heavily subsidizing education by offering things like living stipends for college students?  ,bestof,cnw51d9,266,t5_2qh3v

If that is true what more does the post offer to us than what we already know  the country is sharply divided and growing more so by the day. Of course that would be if we were looking at it objectively. But the point of the post is to stir us emotionally and appeal to our humanity and sway us toward OPs side.

Almost every major empire ended up dividing itself at a certain point in sizepopulation for exactly this reason.

2994370,0,t1_co8cfax,Its not really the Mormon scripture that bans things. The word of wisdom as its known is the law of health and recommends that we live healthy lifestyles. Aside from hard alcohol and tobacco use nothing else is really banned. It pushes for moderation in all things such as limiting your meat intake.Culturally however church members are encouraged to abstain from alcohol in general and some even go as far as saying that caffeinated drinks of any sort are not allowed which includes coffee black tea and various sodas.The majority of Mormons have no problem with soft drinks. In fact Id wager that  of all Mormons are addicted to either Diet Coke or Dr Pepper. Today Mormons generally abstain from coffee tea and alcohol of any sort. However back in the late s Salt Lake City had a thriving distillingbrewing market and even Brigham Young was investing in distilling IIRC and effectively bought up most of the market share. It wasnt until the prohibition movement came around that the church began to ween its members off booze. The cultural pressure to stay away from beer exists to this day. Yet scripture clearly states that mild drinks and grains of the earth are good for man. Beer is much more natural and healthier than Diet Coke and Dr Pepper. Plus Utah has one of the highest antidepressant prescription rates in the country. An all natural barley or wheat beer at the end of a day seems to be a better solution for relieving stress than using pharmaceuticals.,bestof,co8d4j5,3,t5_2qh3v

3002470,0,t3_2uisjo,This got a little bigger than I was expecting so let me make some general clarifications and commentsNo I didnt write the original and yes it was originally about European football soccer culture and so its not a perfect analogy for the current context of American football in general and the Superbowl in particular.That said I was reminded of that post and hunted it down to submit here because of the number of times in the last few days that Ive seen sports fans complaining about nonfans declaring their dislike for sports.On the one hand of course I see their point its silly to ridicule anyone for their hobby interests and its silly for nonfans to smugly imply some kind of superiority over sports fans. I get that to each their own.But that also makes it super ironic for sports fans to complain about having to hear nonfans declaring their nonfanness since of course nonfans are constantly bombarded with how much everybody else loves sports.So the point of this submission was to try to get sports fans to think about what life would be like if their favorite hobby interest wasnt one of the dominant topics of discussion throughout our culture because I think many sports fans honestly have no conception of what that feels like. As sports fans theyre part of the dominant majority and when youre part of the dominant majority it can be really hard to empathize and understand the experience of someone who isnt.So TLDR I am not bashing sports fans and yes Ive seen that xkcd and I agree with it. Its great that lots of people love sports a lot of my best friends love sports and I myself watched the Superbowl with them last night and listened to them talk about the players and coaches and strategies and it was fun.And when nonfans complain about being constantly surrounded by sports talk yes sometimes theyre being kind of rude. But when you as a sports fan complain about them complaining youre actually doing exactly the same thing. They have to listen to you and everyone else talk about sports all year round and  of the time they dont give you any crap about it. So if once in awhile right around a major sporting event you have to listen to them talk about not liking sports its not such a big deal.edit ypo,bestof,co97cpn,1,t5_2qh3v
3002790,0,t1_co90gj5,gtIf youre getting shit for not watching sports or participating in them without first putting them or the fans down then those people are assholes and this kind of mentality is completely understandable.Theres more to it than that. Sports is such a huge part of our culture that it can make you feel really isolated. Thats a big reason why people react so negatively to it if theyre not into it. I met another dad at a mutual friends kids birthday party. Things are going along great and Im feeling like Id want this guy over for a beer or two and watch some movies when he asks me about football. All of a sudden he gets this look like hes talking to a Martian and we no longer have anything in common. That sort of thing happens all the time. Its almost as isolating as not being a native English speaker. I was never into Breaking Bad. But if it was as huge a cultural phenomenon as football or baseball Im sure Id hate it just because its a constant reminder of how I have trouble relating to people. Now I wouldnt go out of my way to mock others about it but Id avoid the hell out of it. ,bestof,co98jr9,1,t5_2qh3v

3023026,0,t1_cobb0k3,Yes over the long term that might be the optimal way to run the business. But thats just one possible outcome and it doesnt seem particularly likely simply because labor is such a tiny percentage of costs for many businesses that rely on minimum wage jobs for a majority of positions.Its been estimated that about  of a franchises revenue are labor and a smaller percentage is minimum wage labor so lets say  of their total revenue.So lets assume theres a big change and the federal minimum wage goes up by  to about hour.  That means that minimum wage labor costs would take up about another  of revenue. If they charged  more on everything they would have to hope to see only a  decrease in sales this would mean they would break even by selling slightly less food at a slightly higher price. Lets also assume that labor is fungible and they can just cut hours to match demand perfectly and so they reduce labor by .Theres still a big mismatch costs of labor have gone up by  and theyve reduced the labor size by only . Total cost of labor has gone up . This happens because while labor is a significant percentage its still a small minority of total costs.There are a lot of market forces at work and it would probably take months or years for the change in minimum wage to work its way through the system and things to reach a new equilibrium. Undoubtedly that would involve some owners raising prices and cutting some staff too. But that means longer lines and higher prices for customers so maybe other businesses would higher more and lower prices and move towards being a volume oriented business  selling more at narrower profit margins?Either way by the time it had all worked it self out there would likely be as big of a macroeconomic change. Suddenly everyone in the country that was earning minimum wage has about  more income. From a household standpoint thats a much bigger change than the relative impact on a businesses costs labor is only a fraction of a businesss cost but its  of a households income. The impact on demand for goods could be substantial especially from business that are competing on cost  like McDonalds or WalMart.Its quite possible that the companies that are spending so much time lobbying against an increase in the minimum wage could be the biggest beneficiaries if it did happen.,bestof,cobc0wq,1,t5_2qh3v

3073086,0,t1_cogfhhb,Untrue. They can be picked up with not unusual difficulty they need to be shaped to survive hypersonic reentry so cannot be particularly stealthy and once they enter the upper atmosphere they generate massive plasma wakes that are easy to track. This is why along with the warheads themselves several penaids Penetration Aids are carried. These include chaff flares and inflatable decoys and are deployed once the warheads seperate to make identifying the warheads from the decoys difficult and require more interceptormissiles to guarantee countering all the warheads.Once inside the atmosphere in the last few minutes of flight these decoys are worthless as they are destroyed upon reentry. Interception here is either at high altitudes via nuclear fratricide detonate your own weapon high enough to cause only minimal damage to yourself compared to letting incoming warheads through such as the Spartan direct impact into warheads using highspeed guided warheads e.g. the modern SM or lower altitude higherspeed interception e.g. the incredible Sprint missile accelerating out of explosively opened silo doors at g.Trickier is interception of an ICBM flying a depressed trajectory. Instead of arcing out of the atmosphere over a long distance this involves the whole missile flying fulltilt sideways at very low altitudes using a reinforced nosecone to survive the temperatures generated by the compressed air in front of it.  Hitting something travelling at mach  falling down on you with a halfhour warning and a good idea of the trajectory from measuring launch location and velocity is hard. Hitting something at mach  flying sideways at near surface level with only minutes of warning is much much harder. Range of the ICBM is much reduced this way so a depressed trajectory would be flown from a submarinelaunched missile from just off the coast.,bestof,cogiubq,2,t5_2qh3v

I want a spinoff that occupies the same place and time but is just another camera telling a different aspect of the same story or a whole new story you didnt know but that had some impact you felt.What were some of the loose ends in BB that BCS could really make into great plot elements?  How about how Mike got hooked up with Gustave when we clearly see him being a lowly Parking Lot attendant.Prediction one episode will be Saul fighting with mike but then offering him a job just like he did the skateboarders but it goes so well he gets mike to be his PI.  He investigates Gustave for some seedy client that wants to sue Pollo Loco because they got sick or found a finger in their chicken and Mike stumbles accross his meth ring.

Aiming straight at his teeny boat. A quick key of the mike Tango  Ill pass to the right. And the finest fighter the kingdom had to offer in s cold war passed with a glorious roar on each side.

Wikigt In international relations a regional power is a state that has power within a geographic region. States which wield unrivaled power and influence within a region of the world possess regional hegemony. In terms of military Russia and China are not able to project significant force to areas outside their local region. Both are very strong locally. China is building a navy Russia is trying to rebuild a navy the US has the worlds largest navy. Politically again the US is clearly in the lead. Look at the number of allies it has and the number of countries that host its bases. Russia in this context has just shot themselves in the foot with this Ukraine thing  theyve alienated their old allies who are afraid of them Poland etc while repolarizing their old enemies. China has growing influence outside of their own region with their involvement in Africa South America and UN peacekeeping missions but its not there yet.  Economically the US is getting back on track and starting to hum along while Russias is in the process of shattering. China is really interesting because they are starting to hit a lot of walls economically environmental impact trouble in the housing market though they should be able to handle it well enough and rising competition for cheap labor. If China can successfully move away from being the worlds sweatshop and retain their economic success then they will definitely obtain superpower levels though it could be argued that they are already there  but stability is a big factor in being a super power so they need it to last.As for Ukraine everything about them is regional and to be frank just about everything kinda sucks there.

Services should either be provided by private enterprise or not at all.

Its a  year old test that attempts to describe the entirety of a persons intelligence in a single numeric value. It is a test created in the west by Caucasians and conveniently fulfills every Caucasian stereotype on race and intelligence. Just because its heritable does not mean its valid. Does it correlate with education and career success? Yes it does but again all of those studies are done in the West. Perhaps IQ favours a form intelligence that is appreciated here in the Western world but that does not mean it captures intelligence in broader terms which is what white supremacists try to make it out to be.Seriously its an old test.

Anything that is specifically directed towards a single person could be interpreted as medical advice and subject to the same stipulations and restrictions.  Even giving advice to someone in another state can be a licensing issue.  Its not worth the risk of defending a lawsuit.

Use your damn turn signal.You are really missing the point and I honestly dont think you can see the forest for the trees. No one is saying they cant do it. The fact that they did it with the schools logo made people look at the school negatively. The school doesnt and didnt want that. Im sure the school was happy to know so they could keep their reputation in tact. No they were not acting as representatives of the school but the logo means they were affiliated. It also sounds to me like these two were using that logo on their apron to act like pertinacious twats.

For instance I know someone who is very well off and so was her husband at one point. But something happenedI am not super close to them so I dont know exactly what happened and the husband became an alcoholic or maybe he always was an alcoholic and he finally just decided to give in completely. He lost his job and he still lives with them.He is not abusive to the kids or his wife he drinks secretly and hides his booze. He is kind to his kids and is involved in their life but it is all facade. She does not want to divorce him because she feels like it would tear the family apart.

Saying theyre not because if theyre unhappy with the arrangement they can just quit is like saying slaves werent slave because they could have always just stopped working if they were unhappy.gt I dont believe Ive said anything against Christians in this argument as well the bill isnt specific to any faith.Seriously?Youre basically saying IF CHRISTIANS DONT LIKE IT THEN THEY CAN STARVE TO DEATH! Thats not anything against Christians? I recognize were talking about two sets of groups with very different lifestyles but I dont think anyone should actually be forced to do anything. Youre specifically siding with forcing one group Christians to give up their beliefs to accommodate the other group. That seems pretty against Christians IMO.,bestof,cpx6335,0,t5_2qh3v

I dont believe the colorsshade are manipulated at all. I could be wrong but I have no reason to think they are. I dont see anything stand out to suggest it.However I did notice that the photos have different cropping. Look at the babys right eye left in the picture. There is a photo of a baby and a woman wearing glasses. To the left of that a photo is used  times in a row. But the rightmost of which is cropped so that the dark hair of the woman creates the top of the babys eye. Even if the color were manipulated that is entirely optional. The images put together still resemble a baby.More importantly its like this  Say I have a box of car parts and I arrange them in a way so as to look like a cat.

3688166,0,t1_cqccrck,It really does depend on what MMO youre playing. Runescape when I played it was home to a LOT of naive adolescent boys and thus playing as a girl resulted in a lot of desperate attempts to woo me. In early WoW this was somewhat as successful but definitely less common but as people began to exploit it it is now assumed that every attractive female character is actually a dude though many believe since its probably true that female characters that are unattractive like Orcs or Taurens are actually girls. In GW I did get helped all the time whether my character was male or female and I dont recall any special treatment. This is likely due to the fact that helping people is greatly encouraged in the game and since its very casual the majority of players seem to be there to have fun with others rather than focus on stuff like grinding or twinking like in WoW. I also played a fair amount of EVE last year although apparently it is assumed that every female character is a dude since there tend to be way less women who play hardcore games than men and that many have already tried to get stuff for being a girl.I say all this as a trans girl though I havent played any MMOs since I started actively talking like one so my only experience with that is through Dota  where Im treated pretty much the same with the occasional shit like a carry buying wards for my lane to impress me or people who give me cosmetic items.,bestof,cqcobx2,9,t5_2qh3v

An interception in football whether it leads to a score or not has a definitive impact on the game because there are so few possessions for each team per game. Same with a great passrun which runs the clock down and possibly gets the offense into field goal range. The problem with soccer is exactly what you said the amazing midfield move might have absolutely zero impact on the game. Soccer combines the fast pace of Basketball with the passing and scoring of Hockey. The problem I have is that soccer doesnt take the physicality of hockey with the scoring. No doubt the players are incredibly physically gifted to be able to run for so long without keeling over but hockey at least adds an element of contact to the strategy.

You cant do it on a real human because any protection like fire resistant gel would make it impossible to see potential burns. And at the same time if you use a stand in like a cadaver pig or doll they wont be able to undress themselves so it wont be an accurate experiment. You could do it in parts. Time how quickly someone can take off a burning jacket for example. Then see how much damage is done to skin in that time. I think the question here is that having a later between you and fire will almost certainly lower the temperature you experience  at first. But once the clothes catch fire you will be prolonging your exposure. So depending on how quickly the catch and you can undress it would be worth it. A leather jacket would be good.

Generally speaking men feel more comfortable applying for a job when they dont meet the full list of qualifications. Women dont. So if were talking about a distribution issue this is how women might end up with better qualifications than their male counterparts with the same position and this is also part of how a man and woman with the same qualifications might end up with different levels of jobs and pay.Again not saying this is the source of everything and there is zero gender discrimination but this is a factor Ive seen cited over and over and trying to figure out why this is has become something people are really looking at in higher ed and elementary level education.,bestof,cqm9x08,11,t5_2qh3v

The circlebroke posts are useless and have no real source a  year old  page thread is not proof that stormfront has massively infiltrated reddit some opinion piece which actually states that the interviewee thinks the racism is mainly due to the size of reddit and a list of subreddits which means nothing other than there are racists that use reddit something that was never in contention. The SRD link has a bit more information and goes into a bit of detail on how there are active stormfront users on reddit again something that was never in contention. What I did have trouble believing is that stormfront has an operation so vast that they have actively changed opinion on reddit towards nonwhites.. I dont see any proof of that.

There are plenty of reasons.Anyways the whole issue of gay rights seems to have been mostly resolved from a legal standpoint now which of course is not to say that gays dont suffer from discrimination.

3895070,0,t3_350ql2,I grew up in NJ and in an upper middle middle class town as well I am white and Ive also had my fair share of harassment from the police.  I share basically the same view as this post here and its pretty frightening.  Some of the shit he said about the cops targeting the younger kids at younger ages is spot on.  My town was very small and every group was combined into one large one with exceptions.  My earliest experience with the police is being in the th or th grade riding bikes with my friends innocently around town and a cop pulls into the parking lot comes out to speak to us and begins groping my drawstring bag.  Im just like what is going on and he says hes just making sure everything is ok in there.  Then when the fuck ups of middle school and high school start to arise they are all given passes to the point where they are all still fucked up in their late s.  The cops even use these fuck ups to get their own drugs and get an eye into all of the crime thats going on behind the scene.  Some of these fuck ups actually become cops when its known they have done bad things or have a record.  The police are basically like a mafia.Some other stories include getting  in tickets at a police checkpoint that was investigated by the FBI then shutdown  people in car at age   were family members judge didnt even listen to meno seatbelt tickets because I had to pull over into a police checkpoint and was instructed to turn my car off lower all windows and take off seatbelt getting pulled over for basically no reason on numerous occasions for dumb shit. your young and smoking a cigarette  your taillight is out but it isnt so Im trying to fish I didnt like the way you pulled out of that lot all bullshit.  I even went to court for a small matter with two girls a few years ago and the entire time the cops were winking at them and trying to get their numbers.  All the cops Im friends with have stories like I was doing mph drunk got pulled over me and my buddy flashed our badges and they didnt even get out of the cop car.   Also one time where my house my broken into and robbed and the man who did it basically left personally identifying information on accident at my house and the police were unable to get a search warrant even after he has a history of drugsrobberies and some solid evidence.  One of the only times where I actually needed help and they couldnt produce.  I eventually went to his house showed him my new home security system and told him if he steps on my property again he was fucked.  He smiled at me because he knew he was somehow protected by the law but he was afraid that I would take action without the pigs.  Only after that moment I was able to sleep in my house without the polices  help.  He only took a  laptop so I said if you need money you can ask cause thats not even valuable and taunted him to come back,bestof,cr09t1s,5,t5_2qh3v

But the issues Ive had with cops e.g. Getting followed home or pulled over and searched while walking at night or having a cop ask for my ID while I was literally unlocking my front door have all come from the Union cops. I dont say this to wag my finger at the UPD since these scenarios are few and far between though Ive had some situations with community members but thats another story but it always feels like the Union Police are assuming I did something wrong. ,bestof,cr0fs84,2,t5_2qh3v

Yes the rioting is causing destruction of property and forcing more resources to be spent fixing that situation rather than ameliorating the actual issue. However that is not the whole story of what is holding up due process. In other cities grand juries decided to not even charge officers whove caused loss of life as in Ferguson. There was no hindrance to justice or due process in the case of that city rioting. The Baltimore police department and city government are still investigating so no rioters are not denying justice or due process from occurring. And in the Revolutionary War there was significant destruction of property as well as other economic consequences such as the British blockading colonies ports and spending nonexistent money to fund a war which were the results of actions of by a rebellious group.,bestof,cr1ikt3,0,t5_2qh3v

The only downside I have found is drivers will instantly accept your ride and then decide afterwards if they want to cancel it or not depending on where you are going.

To protect stock and recoup costs of developing a contaminated drug. There is a separate court that hears   cases against vaccine manufacturers. The only evidence that can be used against those companies is the self reported data of infected people and sick people. So if your daughter is killed as a result of a bad vaccine  the only evidence is if more people are killed as a result of the vaccine. The only reporting allowed are US cases.  So if  people in Peru die because of the vaccine it is firstly not reported to the US and secondly if the data is available it is inadmissible. This is all on the CDC website. I have been having this conversation for weeks and am a bit exhausted. Go do some research. Look up the revolving door and how the Vax court works. Couple it with a history of corruption and you will find that forcing stuff into peoples bodies without their say so is beyond anything Orwell imagined. ,bestof,csp0f60,0,t5_2qh3v

4519113,0,t3_3cxmew,Im for temp shadowbans both on posts and upvotes. Obviously subreddit automoderators can only do temp shadowbans on posts but Reddit overall can do temp shadowbans on voting.Nothing malicious just temporary enough to cover activity that looks aimed at either unintentional spamming posting the same link  times in  different subreddits which is more common now due to the rise of subreddits. Same with voting where it seems youre downvoting every post or comment subreddit youre not subscribed. Same with downvoting a users content.Obviously these have to be secretive and sneaky in that it allow a post to appear for a minute or longer then remove the post and all additional comments in a manner that no one can see it except those in that comment chain. The point is to stop spam vindictive downvoting and brigading without permanently punishing people that are just being emotional or passionate.Personally I find the overuse of subreddit shadow banning by automods to be the worst behavior along with a mod banning a user across multiple subreddits. Again just as there should be controls to limit abuses by Reddit and Users so to should reasonable controls be placed on Mods.

4533762,0,t1_ct23iax,Couple of things to clear up then I dont agree that gamergate was ever about threats at all. Gamergate is a muckracking movement that shines a light on shady practices and when you shine a light on something on the internet it attracts attention both deserved and undeserved. Obviously threats were received and obviously thats shitty but on the other hand its how the internet has always been and probably how it always will be barring either massive draconian changes to its structure or fundamental alterations to the human species.  I never implied anything about threats staying on the internet. I said that internet threats are virtually never credible. Thats it and its true. I even said that reallife threats are something to take action on in my first post. From that you can infer that threats that move from the internet into real life merit attention.I disagree that internet to real life escalation is common however. It does in fact tend to stay on the net in the form of a single angry tweet or email before the trolls short attention span takes it elsewhere. ,bestof,ct2446h,2,t5_2qh3v

I was thinking Amazon being the general good company when they say they will beat Black Friday that tactics like that would be thrown out the window and they would genuinely have good deals all around. It ended up being more like a WOOToff which they own woot anyway. I dont deny that their were good deals. However the legendary deals were few and far between. The biggest annoyance was all the deals were timed and they didnt give the full listing at midnight. So who could really pop back on every  minutes to spend  minutes searching the deals.

The reason this post is so surprising and interesting is that AllLivesMatter was getting k upvotes on any thread about BlackLivesMatter. Ferguson Baltimore Trayvon etc. threads are dominated by white redditors telling everyone that black people are so dangerous that they deserve to be killed.gtVery few people are nowadays and we look at that as a horrible atrocity. Racism is prejudgment based on someones skin colour. Minor or major judgments it doesnt matter. Youre doing what Im talking about right now. Youre saying that slavery doesnt matter that its inconsequential and a part of the deep past with no bearing on the present. Thats another way of saying that things arent as unequal in america as one might suppose.Ill have to disagree with your definition of racismIn this paper Hesse argues that our insistence on a kind of equal presentism of racism i.e. anyone who ever brings up race against anyone else is being racist in the same ways confuses the ways in which racism is predicated on colonialism i.e that racism emerges out of our conscious and unconscious relationship to the past. Therefore at its heart racism requires material and social inequalities not simply personal judgements. Thats why BlackLivesMatter is so important it is black lives beyond most visible others in america that are subject to inequalities beyond rhetoric and the reason why it really isnt bad at all to be straightwhitecismale despite what the antiSJWs will tell you.,bestof,ct9otsa,21,t5_2qh3v

Ive seen many small business flood already flooded markets and made the same complaints. The ones who were able to manage it properly prospered while the people who just sat and whined lost money and had to either downsize or go out of buisness. I dont know what piece of the pie your folks take from it and frankly Im not looking for you to expand on that. Absolutely no reason to. However there are many in the work force who need a better explination than I have no idea how the business is going to survive or well have to restrict hiring people.IMO  is suggested as the wage that many believe we should be it.

So you say I should get my fair share.Oh responds your father Im sorry we must have just overlooked you. He passes you the food and you serve yourself some and begin eating.A few minutes pass and your black friend chimes in Ahem black people also deserve their fair share. You didnt realize he also hadnt been served you only noticed that your own plate was empty. Hes waited even longer than you did watched you get served while he waited and was overlooked again. He is understandably annoyed at this point.You realize your mistake when you hadnt been served you thought you were the only one who hadnt been served. Serving people at a dinner table seems like such a simple and fundamental thing. How could people be so bad at it? Furthermore how could you all make the same mistake twice?You look further down the table and realize that your trans female and atheist friends also havent been served. Were apparently quite a lot worse at serving people than we realized. You want to break the pattern of each person having to ask for their share one by one so as you pass the food to your black friend you make it a point to correct him everyone should be served.Youre surprised and a little bit hurt when he responds Thats easy for you to say you already have your share. But really hes only made the same mistake that you did when you finally got served you thought that you were the last one.I think that what most people are getting at when they say that all lives matter is simply that they dont want to force each minority group to ask to be treated equally. They want people to start thinking of equality as something that should be for everyone and not just specific groups because they worry that if we keep thinking about specific groups it will end in yet another group being overlooked.,bestof,ctdilxx,1,t5_2qh3v

Thats all good and well and op probably isnt thinking in the most rational of ways but if were seriously approaching this as the mental issue that it is its basically the equivalent of telling a depressed person to just cheer up. I would also add that as a woman the doctor isnt really in a position to relate to or comprehend the problem...and yeah i get it vaginal pain etc. but from the perspective of a guy thats a very very different condition than a micropenis. Unless they luck out with finding one of the women who would be okay with a micropenis which i think is actually a much smaller group than the doctor suggests i think it would take most men either a lot of time or therapy to get over a similar condition....and thats really what this guy needs professional help not internet comments. ,bestof,cthp6of,22,t5_2qh3v

4755714,0,t1_cttxp3n,gt But let these divisions sell themselves honestly on their own merits.Ideally I would agree. Honest advertising and respresentation would be awesome and appreciated in many many areas of our culture. Sadly this is never the case... and thus it seems strange to focus on UFC and the MMA community specifically for capitalizing on an undefeated fighter just because you have this weird assumption that every other female fighter she goes up against is just some diluted badass that surrounds themselves with people convincing them that they can go toetotoe with the best of the best men. For all either of us know the majority probably dont actually believe they can go toetotoe with the best men MMA fighters.And honestly I cant blame Ronda for going along with the hype. Anytime a fighter has any sort of hype built up around them they capitalize. Think of the countless male UFC fighters who go on to make claims that theyre the best in the world  or that soandso could never beat them etc. It happens all the god damned time. UFC pays their fighters shit for what they do  so thinking ahead and trying to get name and image recognition is important to benefit from your MMA career outside of the actual fights. Plus it just creates drama that apparently the public eats up and it benefits both the fighter and UFC. But it happens regardless of gender. So again it just feels strange to focus on this specific instance  rather than on the misleading hype that permates UFC and MMA.gt I think MMA as a business would be better served by trying to recruit some less pathetic opponents for Ronda...I would also agree with this. Good balanced matchups are what make for compelling fights  even more so than the actual skill level of the fighters.gt... rather than trying to convince us all she can fight men without ever believing in that statement enough to actually show us.Again hype around any matchup or breakout fighter is full of hyperbole and attentiongrabbing claims and unfounded expectations. Were you outraged when people were acting like Kimbo Slice was going to stomp the shit out of the competition?gt Its not like no one could ever be entertained by watching a fighter who isnt actually tougher than them. The Chinese used to gamble on cricket fights. And cockfighting exists all over the world.Youre really comparing womens MMA to cricket fights and cockfighting? Yeah youre totally not making value judgements throughout...gt But Rondas opponents have all pretty much looked like what I call dojo pets or gym mascots. Every place I ever go to train theres one or two women who are fairly agile and athletic who can do the moves and look good doing them. And they are surrounded by a thick bubble of people telling them that they are badasses that martial arts is a magical equalizer that enables them to go toe to toe and trade punches with the biggest toughest men. But they only actually sparrollfightdrill with the other women. Of which there are only a handful.This whole thing reeks of TRPesque assumptions of how these women lead their lives. Good lord. Where are all these claims from them individually claiming they can take on the men in their respective weight classes? I know Ronda made that claim for herself  but again that seems to be to capitilize on the media attention... which the vast majority of fighters take advantage of as well. Hell some of it is about playing mind games with future opponents.. Sometimes you praise yourself to freak out your opponent. gt In short these girls have never really been tested on the mat and never had to step up their game against an opponent tougher and scarier than them. They truly think they are tough because they havent had enough challenges to get shaken up. Perhaps many of them would have become more so if they had a deeper bench in where they train.More baseless assumptions.gt In other words the MMA business has Ronda and she fights well for a girl. But shes not entertaining to watch because they are scraping the bottom of the barrel for someone anyone they can put up against her. What theyve come up with so far is boring. Its boring to watch a fight where the outcome isnt in doubt.They may not entertain you but all this media attention seems to demonstrate that people are entertained by it. Women are probably more drawn to it because its not the norm and theyre finally getting mass attention in a sport that usually pushes them out of the spotlight because of guys like you. Because apparently everything should be catered to your specific tastes and play by your expected honest narrative. gt What they really need is more girls interested in training. Then maybe in five years theyll have interesting fights.Well you need to plant that seed of interest and make womens MMA seem appealing and worthwhile to younger women... Instead of pushing it out of the spotlight and simply telling them that theyll get the spotlight once they have enough female fighters of some arbitrary skill level.gt Now I dont think theyre going to be able to. Women care about fighting about as much as men care about baby showers.What stupid and ignorant generalization. I have plenty of female friends who love UFC far more than myself and some of them train at the gym because theyre inspired by it. Sure theyre not going to become UFC fighters because they got into it much too late  but the interest is there. Cultivating it by focusing more or at all on the female division seems like a totally worthwhile and logical way to build up that base of women interested in actually fighting  as well as watching.gt Id have no problem with seeing that.Somehow I dont believe this. Maybe youd love to be undeniably proven wrong... but it seems youre not going to be that cool with it until some women actually does come in an beat the shit out of the men in their weight classes.gt What I dont like is being asked to participate in a collaborative lie...Then stop watching anything. Ever. Youre participating in thousands if not millions as we speak. Especially if it involves business claims.gt Well of course thats the question I answered in the original post. Its all about those dollars especially the pink ones. But just because I understand why someone is trying to pull the wool over my eyes doesnt mean I am going to shake their collective hand and thank them for it.Same as above if you dont like dishonest claims and advertising perpetrated for the sake of making some cash  you should probably avoid watching and participating in any kind of sport. You seem disproportionately affected by this instance because shes a woman making claims about taking down men... and I suspect that just rubs you the wrong way. I have this assumption based on a handful of oneoff sentences and the way you preface an argument regarding the female fighters and viewers. You make baseless TPRlevel assumptions.

It changes with periods  pregnancy  and menopause  but it absolutely  exists. The thing is that society tells women from the crib that sex is something  they should not pursue and  in turn  they act in a way that doesnt show how much sex they want to have. If a woman  has a lot of sex and talks about sex and her libido  she is seems by society  as somehow less worthy and chastised. That drives us girls to refrain from acting in  an overly sexual maner. Which in turn make people think that women dont want sex and so men feel unappreciated.  If women had the cultural liberty to treat sex the same way that man do  this problem would be solved.

All the while inherently good characters are often demonized like with Elves who from Noble suddenly became gay even among circles that are very tolerant of homosexuality...

5080058,0,t3_3kkcel,When I was really young before preschool age my mom spent a lot of time with my brother and I teaching us how to read write do simple math etc. By the time my older brother started preschool he could already read things like signs and childrens books. According to my mom he would read almost every sign he saw out loud. We went to a preschool that was owned by the local catholic school so most of the kids who went there celebrated Christmas and the school did Christmas related activities including having someone come dressed up as Santa and give the kids presents that their parents secretly brought in for Santa to give to them.On Santa day while my mom was dropping my brother off my brother turned to her in front of all his classmates the teacher and the principle and loudly asked Mom did you drop your gift off??. The teacher and princpal got so mad they asked to speak to my mom in the office and demanded to know why she told my brother the gifts werent from Santa. Except she didnt tell him anything. He read the sign that was in front of the office that said Please Drop Off Gifts Here. They didnt think anything of the sign because they figured none of the preschoolers could read. And none of them could except my brother. ,bestof,cuyc867,1,t5_2qh3v

If you drink juice start diluting it just a little at first increasing the amount of water a little bit each time. Ive now reached the point where my diluted mixture is like  water and straight juice tastes way too sweet. Juice mixed with soda water is pretty nice.If you eat chocolate buy smaller bars. I have a psychological need to finish an entire bar so the smaller bars help. Slowly switch to dark chocolate. Its much more satisfying. If you eat milk chocolate eat a little dark chocolate with it and gradually increase the amount of dark chocolate over time. I now find milk chocolate much too sweet. With dark chocolate I only need a small amount to satisfy my chocolate craving.If you like yogurt the higherfat ones are much more satisfying. I like mixing Greek yogurt with fruity yogurt.

She might be an innocent angel and totally safe or she might have come there right from gangbanging a dozen worn out needleusign drug addicts bareback without even showering afterwards and might be the kind to only get tested if theres stuff oozing out. And you cant tell which is which from looking at how they dress and act.This is the problem Were so conditioned to jump to conclusions about peoples behaviour based on how people dress and act that we dont realise that a lot of the time it is just an act and about attention not sex. If theres one thing becoming a dad has taught me from attending various childrens birthday parties etc. and overhearing assorted conversations amongst moms they get filthy shockingly filthy forget calling phone sex lines  listen in to groups of moms talking it often gets far dirtier If you think that the nice conservatively dressed religious dedicated wife that you think youre the first to seduce is any safer.... Yeah Id take my risks with the sluttylooking girl in a club over a bored housewife any day.

Tournaments that are unofficial and thus dont count for things like Pro Tour qualification dont have to follow the rule against proxies and can allow as many proxies as they like. Vintage the format where all sets are allowed and no card is fully banned doesnt get many sanctioned tournaments because you actually do need cards that are that expensive to compete and people who have them would generally rather not play with them.With this specific card the threads talking about you could use a legitimate placeholder since the normal nonpromo printing of the card is only about .,bestof,cvy1ylh,1,t5_2qh3v

5412678,0,t1_cw3itaf,Lets give this a shotMichigan and Michigan State are football teams from the same state so their teams and fans are often fierce rivals. Both are pretty highly ranked this year so todays game was a major game in the season to determine whether either team would make it to the national playoffs.Michigan was winning by  points with only a few seconds left in the game. The only thing they needed to do to win was to punt it kick it down the field  Michigan State might have a single play at that point but itd take a miracle literally called a Hail Mary play for them to pull off a win.In order to punt the ball someone has to throw the ball backwards to give the punter time to kick the ball properly.Unfortunately the ball was thrown very poorly very low to the ground and the Michigan punter was unable to kick it away before before the opposing team Michigan State had swarmed him.This meant that the other team could grab the ball and make a play. As the final seconds ran down Michigan State brought the ball to the endzone which is worth  points giving their team the win.There have been quite a few lastsecond wins or upsets in football history but this particular sequence of events is pretty much unique. Which makes it all the more heartbreaking for the losing Michigan team.Hope that helps.,bestof,cw3j1sn,31,t5_2qh3v

Its pretty uncontroversial in feminist circles to say that gender roles patriarchy etc. actively harms men but there is a bit of disagreement on what should be done about it. Many feminists fear that addressing mens issues or just gender issues as a broad goal will move the conversation completely away from womens issues thereby resulting in no progress for women. Many feminists are supportive of mens issues but would like to see men tackle their own issues in a way that doesnt blame women and feminism for all their problems.Its important to remember that feminism is an umbrella term for a huge diverse movement thats more usefully broken down into ideologies liberal feminism Marxist feminism ecofeminism radical feminism etc. than assumed to be one unified movement that has all the same beliefs and all the same ideas about how to achieve their goals. Im not sure its really a problem that all feminists arent monolithic in their beliefs I mean take any other political or activist group and you will find the same issues. Republicans dont all believe the exact same things. Or Catholics. Or white supremacists or vegans or libertarians or anything. Thats how political movements work.

The chances of actually being selected if you have any sort of education or intelligence are basically nil no matter how interested in actually participating in the process you are.

There is basically no opportunity for you to make any sort of contribution except to the court vending machines because youre going to open your mouth get half a sentence out and then theyre going to rule you out so fast that you may as well have been shot out of the courthouse with a cannon.You could offer a PhD a million dollars if they actually managed to sit as a juror without actively concealing their level of education or intelligence and Id bet that they wouldnt get the money if you gave them a year.,bestof,cwfchus,11,t5_2qh3v

Sure cicadas  life cycles happen to fall on prime numbered years thats how a human would describe it to another human anyways.  But thats not what the cicadas are thinking that idea is what humans bring without us they would simply exist as they are not having concept of  or  or prime number sequence.gtSurely you are familiar with physics and chemistry. The processes described in those fields of study exist without humans.But those processes are not numbers or functions or operators they are physical. We model physical reality with numbers functions and operators but it is dangerous to confuse our model of reality with reality itself.The fact that math has applications says nothing about whether the math is intrinsic to the universe or not.  It says a lot about how humans perceive the universe.gtThats your problem is you cant wrap your head around nonhuman math.I wouldnt call this a problem my inability to conceive of nonhuman math puts me on the same level as Euler Dirac and you.

Space itself is stretching like a balloon being blown up.

5595940,0,t1_cwqpthq,Yes but Kim Davis cited her religious liberty as grounds not to do her job serving a portion of the public as an elected official based on her religious beliefs.  This is the entire point that the linked OP was making though poorly.At least on this one point he was right.  Kim Davis and her ilk thought that since she was a religious majority e.g. had the backing of a majority of voters she had the right to practice her belief to deny rights to a minority group in her PUBLIC SERVICE job.She does not.Of course places are going to pass moral laws and those laws can and almost exclusively are based on religious tradition e.g. alcohol prohibition.  Moral laws based on religious grounds are not automatically unconstitutional.  That much is correct.  But religious based law that infringes on the rights of a minority religious or secular group are unconstitutional.Democracy is not simply majority rules.  If that were the case then anti miscegenation laws would still be on the books.  America is a Constitutional Democracy which means a majority rule with extensive protections for minority groups.  The majority cant just make any law they want and yes religious minorities do have special protection under the Constitution granted by the First Amendment.  The idea that the First Amendments Establishment Clause only prevents the establishment of a state religion is just plain flatout factually wrong,bestof,cwqq9gr,2,t5_2qh3v

5662711,0,t1_cwycay5,Since I never worked in appliances I cant say anything about the delivery process but I can say that the clerk should have been aware about the card being charged twice. They should have controls in place to void out the first delivery. The problem I think may have happened with the card and Im just guessing is that if it was a debit card it would take the bank a certain amount of time for the void to be processed. I know this happened a lot when customers wanted a return on the purchase the same day they bought it. I dont think Sears had much control over the overdraft fee problem other than the fact that the clerk fucked up on putting the correct information in. I think what gets lost in these types of situations is the human component. Statistically you have a certain amount of control in manufacturing quality but in the service industry you can only do so much. I felt a lot of joy in my job as a cashier when I could help the customer out with something. Either opening up a Sears card to get a discount or redeeming reward points or bringing them a shopping cart when they couldnt walk without assistance. But not every experience will be of the same quality. Often times the person you are getting doesnt want Sears spying on them tinfoil heads and you cant create a better experience for them in order to retain them as long term customers. But I look at it this way If a cashier messed up my order I can see that version of myself doing it. I know that the cashier realized what went wrong and they will work on not making the same mistake again. I guess what Im saying is that maybe in the future you should give them another shot. Not that Im defending Sears but I know that their Kenmore and Craftsman products are still top quality and that their employees are doing what they can with the shitty hedgefund CEO they have. Maybe not go to that particular store but if not you should at least share your experience with one of the other managers there. ,bestof,cwz0iy4,1,t5_2qh3v

Telling residents that they should have been anticipating an earthquake during the incident they were convicted for would have been no different than telling the residents they should be anticipating an earthquake right now.People supporting this conviction are taking the position that the only advice that should be given is for the people living in this area to leave forever and never return because there is a constant risk of lethal earthquakes which occur in the area.,bestof,cxajf8l,24,t5_2qh3v

Surely not segregation a society wrought out of a melting pot will not suddenly change hopefully not forceably or by other means. Our multiculturalism is a constant in the equation. But whether this makes change more difficult to me is somewhat beside the point albeit is still a fair point for it does not change what needs to change for the better. That in itself is objective and largely independent. So what happens is people justify what appears to be cynicism or defeatism by saying Thats just too hard to implement here. So lets just settle for the status quo. And I dont think thats the right frame of mind to have. Will it be more difficult for us? Maybe but certainly not impossible.

5880964,1,t1_cxqdj9x,A weird thing about this is the nondisclosure agreement aspect.  From OPs postgt Employees were bound to nondisclosure agreements about the whole situation but theyre only effective for the duration of employment. My mom starts a new much better job today and I have no desire to do any more work there now that shes gone.If I read the post correctly OPs mom is the employee.  OP does not work there or have any desire to now that his mom is no longer there.  Thats why hes free to tell the story. A couple issues here all of which assume a standard nondisclosure agreement OP was never an employee and therefore never bound by a nondisclosure agreement so he could have told this story whenever he wanted. But maybe he wanted to protect his mom who was an employee?  Still doesnt make sense because if OPs mom was bound to a nondisclosure agreement her son already announced that she violated it by sharing the details with her son back when OP made his original I have a juicy story but cant share it until December  post. Additionally nondisclosure agreements are generally for a set duration such as for a set number of years or until the release of a bookmovie etc..  They are generally not based on a contingent event such as length of employment because that sort of undermines their purpose.  For example an employee could quitget fired the very next day which would make the NDA pointless.  Alternatively a person could work there forever which would make the duration indefinite and potentially unenforceable. Finally the timing of the nondisclosure agreement seems odd.  Usually someone will sign an already prepared NDA before the information is disclosed.  For example if I want to be on the crew of the new Star Wars movie Ill have to sign an NDA before I can start working on it.  Makes sense.  Here OP is saying that Romney said and did some weird stuff and then someone Romneys people I assume made everyone associated with the event sign an agreement that they just drafted on the spot?  And what obligation would anyone have to sign an NDA after the fact?  Hey remember all that weird stuff I just said and did?

You have a mountain to climb and you really must be more specific in your examples. Ive never seen that with Australians or Britons  Ive found them perfectly happy to accept criticism again when it is credible and well presented. Brits in particular like nothing better than to criticise the UK its a great hobby. Did you just present this criticism really aggressively or something? Because this does not tally with me in the slightest. Anyway your observations and youre welcome to your view even though I disagree heartily.But as a rather long final side note you are aware that immigration in Australia and healthcare in the UK are massive massive issues right? These are literally the most inflammatory topics you could pick and they have nowhere near the salience in the US as they do in the UKOz. If I were to criticise restrictions on abortion or the free sale of firearms in the US odds are Id get a much bigger reaction than in UKOz but thats not very meaningful! Comparing the most emotive topics with ones that arent overly notable elsewhere isnt like for like!With the NHS in particular I think the fact that the most controversial political opposition that can be taken in the UK is to advocate an insurance based system says a lot. A British person criticising the NHS without a lot of tact would probably start a blazing argument. It was once said the NHS is the closest thing the English people have now to a religion.With Oz and immigration its also very passionate but Ive not got the impression opinions are nearly so unanimous.

6010448,0,t1_cy6m9sq,Im sorry but thats a load of bull and you know it. You basically cherry picked an example described it as capitalism and then said oh hey capitalism is completely evil and bad and has turned our world to shit. Despite capitalism and free market helping fund and innovate entire world markets making life ten times better for everyone. If the world didnt choose capitalism free market philosophy letting people manage themselves the entire economy would have collapsed like USSRs socialism system. Are there noted flaws in capitalism? Yes absolutely. If you dont meet the perfect market characteristics you will find some problems like in Pharma but to say the entire system needs to be torn down is incredibly naive. Youd have us go back to the Stone Age and go through another major financial crisis. AGAIN.People yelling capitalism  greed are taking a gross oversimplification of the entire system. It essentially says IF each individual agent acts within their own interests the MARKET the group of buyers and sellers will PERFECTLY or close to perfect ALLOCATE SCARCE RESOURCES themselves. Which is amazing because if you take a  buyers and a  sellers and put them into the same room they can very quickly reach a solution that helps everyone its organic almost  the power of groupthink at its finest. Capitalism encourages greed raising prices and shenanigans like this but it has been perfectly legitimate in MANY other markets primarily BECAUSE the it PROVIDES ITS OWN CHECKS AND BALANCES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR REGULATION IF IT WAS A PERFECT MARKET.Pharmaceuticals is not a perfect market not by a long shot. If economists classified that industry they would point out that there is something deeply wrong with the industry and that the government should step in to make it more perfect. Unfortunately the Economist field is all but corrupt very much in bed with politics and lobbyists so that wont happen. sighPharmas have incredibly high barriers to entry mostly RampD costs of developing drugs COMBINED WITH DEMAND for said drug which is incredibly inelastic you NEED said drug TO SURVIVE.That is inevitably going to ALLOW Martin Shkreli to do crap like this without having any significant backlash. In a perfect market think orange growers market there would be a metric shit tonne of competitors who would immediately capture the entire market demand and lower their price and gain a significant advantage oh look this dumbass just raised his drug price by ? Well lets undercut him making it cheaper than ever before and really stick it to him!. Shkreli would have been committing financial suicide.But because of the characteristics of said market this will never if ever happen because drugs are unique they have very inelastic demand AND making drugs is still kinda expensive. For this you NEED some form of government regulation in order to regulate this....Id say oligopoly but since lobbyists pay for Congress that wont happen anytime soon. This is what happens when you leave a monopoly or oligopoly for too long  they accumulate far too much resources which allow them to not only distort the market for future competitors but also influence policy makers that would otherwise provide the checks and balances. ,bestof,cy7i0np,1,t5_2qh3v

6159652,0,t3_3zvegl,Supes is super smart. His intelligence is of a great magnitude that most other humans. Depend son his parents really. We will just stick with averages and say he was discovered by some native Americans living in a small tight clanvillage. They primarily lived off the land. Hunting and fishing and were also using agriculture to a certain degree. Supes would grow up a ridiculed pale boy. His hair skin and eyes would all be different than the people he grew up with. He could never fit in. He would harbor some resentment towards them because of it. Especially considering the culture he grows up in isnt prone to nonaggression. Some problems have to be fought out. He would grow up knowing that. Maybe his super brain kicks in first and supes becomes a young inventor. Able to create many scientific leaps such as building materials and designs easier ways to construct ships for mass transit traps for fishing and hunting. He may even develop smarter ways to use land. He could do all of these things before the age of . But once he hits puberty his powers begin to kick in. The other kids have all grown up mocking the pale boy. They use various combat training games for fun growing up and all of a sudden the pale boy is better than all of them. Supes grew up with all sorts of strange beings. Men who claimed to control magic. Women capable of seeing the future. Warriors who are unbeatable. He would just think himself one of them. He has no reason to hold back. From an early age Supes would go from the boy inventory to the god of the sun. With an unstopable force his tribe would expand rapidly. Supes would be smart enough to know to not utterly destroy his opponents but only fight when neccessary to force their submission to his tribe. Supes Tribe the Tribe of the Sun would grow in power. After reaching adulthood Supes would discover his father and the Fortress of Solitude. There he would learn of the destruction of his home planet. How earth is his new home. And How he can protect his new people and help them prosper. This would further Supes passion for protecting his culture. There would no doubt be modifications to the Tribe of the Sun to bring them into a bit more of a global society. Superman would be able to fly around the world able to discover Europe African and Asian cultues. Superman would be enthralled by the other paleskins he meets. People that look like him. He would no doubt attempt to interact with these people. It would not go well. They would see him as the devil and more importantly a threat to their religious states. He would be outcasted from Europe by the religions there and it would put a bad taste on these non Native American cultures. Western invaders attempting to conquer or take land from the Tribe of the Sun would have their leaders executed. Superman would politely remove their leadership from this plane of existence take out their lineage and take their wives for himself. His protection of North America would be complete. He would establish homes for himself on several mountains allowing him to use his vision to monitor the borders. Mt. Rainer The Rockies and mt. Mitchell would all become temples that Supes would live in. But around this time Supes would also discover something. All the women he won and slept with many would have given birth to his sons and daughters. When they reach puberty they would begin displaying the same abilities as Supes. He will also know that he is not aging like the others.  years pass and he appears to be in his s while the children of the kids he grew up with are dieing of old age. The first  or so years Superman would be catching the Tribe of the Sun up to the technology of Europe and China. He would have access to other cultures technology and he can also single handedly grow enough crops to feed his entire village for years. Allowing the Tribe of the Sun to specialize in Scientific R amp D. Supermans offspring would begin the next stage of life on Earth. His first  or so offspring would all be of Native American descent. This being the first spoils of war he had. After that would be the European offspring. these could potentially number into the s. Depending on Supermans lust and ability to conquer. There would likely be a destruction of all religions on earth as the Tribe of the Suns religious views on worshipping Supes negate lots of religious doctrine. Supermans kids begin raising hell as they enter their s. He is faster and stronger than all of them but heavely outnumbered. Their mothers are mostly inequipped to deal with them. He gives many of them their own land and tasks. Some become super effective farmers. Transporters using their speed to move goods for anyone who favors them. Some protect the boundries of North America. A few use their abilities to help others the only form of XRay at the time. They each begin specializing and they have years to enhance their craft. They delay aging but much more so than Supes. Some of them also appear to have certain... mutations. Abilities outside of the normal Kryptonian range. Telekinesis. Visions of the future. To change their shape. Some are even born with strange physical characteristics. Abilities and characteristics that superman himself does not have. Each of his kids gathers followers wherever they go creating factions of worshippers. Some go so far as to denounce their people from having to worship Supes. Superman can not be everywhere at once and for many humans of the Tribe of the Sun the only super powers they ever see are from his kids.  Supes spends the majority of his time sorting out the political problems his children and their factions create. Some of his children are true altruists and believe their purpose is to help the humans. They travel the world doing all they can for everyone they meet. When a problem arises they go to Supes as the leader of the most powerful nation on earth to send aid. But some of his kids were born in Europe and grew up indoctrinated in European society. Some too were born in Asia amp Africa. Most were born and raised in Supes temples by his wives but Superman slept around. His children would wage war with eachother. Tearing apart cities and civilizations. Non could stand up to his wrath. Many of his children would support him helping him keep order to protect the humans. He would be forced to eliminate a few of them to keep the rest in line. However this would only cause some of his Offspring to plot vengeance. Eventually over the course of s of years one of his childre or maybe his grandchildren the lines of lineage begin to get all blurred as the son and daughters of gods do not age normally they would discover a way to defeat him. Someone from his lineage would have a gift capable of killing Supes. A lightning bolt so powerful only they themself can create it. They would challenge Supes roll as world police and in the ensuing battle strike him down. With the unbeatable lightning bold ability the other offspring would be forced to bwo down to the lightning bolt one. And thats how the Greek Gods were created. ,bestof,cypseum,12,t5_2qh3v

6203150,0,t1_cyuornd,But the question wasnt whether buying  tickets would make someone likely to win the lottery it was whether or not the probability was much different than someone who only bought one lottery ticket.If you had only two options of buying lottery tickets either  ticket or  tickets you will find that . of the winners will be from people who bought  tickets. If it were the case the two probability of buying  ticket was about the same as buying  tickets then the distribution would be about . Clearly it isnt and that buying  lottery tickets gives you a pretty clear significant advantage than buying only  and in no way would the probability of winning be about the same between the both of them.Are you a statistician? Doubling a . chance is not really any sort of measurable increase at all. I can debate all day on why this is wrong and depends on the context of the problem. If lottery tickets were instead  cent each then it may be worth getting that double chance because its at little to no cost. So your argument that doubling a . chance its a subjective one that depends on how a person values money.No one is arguing whether or not the lottery is good to play. The expected value is in no way positive for the consumers no one is arguing otherwise. We are debating on whether or not buying more tickets improves your odds of winning over someone who only bought  more ticket. gtPeople who buy a hundred tickets for a powerball drawing dont have much better odds of winning than someone who buys one.Reread what the other user had claimed he said it would give no significant difference. You seem to be focused on the expected value of a lottery and not the odds of winning,bestof,cyuqd9v,1,t5_2qh3v

Young men fear perhaps rightly how a false rape accusation can ruin their lives even if they act with perfect propriety. They fear this perceived lack of control.  They do not realize this is the same sort of fear women feel everywhere. A man can rape them and they have little ability to defend or prevent it and if they report it there will always be men calling women liars. ,bestof,cz7im6t,3,t5_2qh3v

6453882,0,t1_czmqzlg,Those are tough ones but I will take a stab...HousingFirst lets define the issue. There is plenty of housing available at a national level. The problem we have is that the homes and jobs are not in the same place. The compounding factor is the already mentioned buyers market for labor that is in place in most of the country.The majority of the shortages are in the west and NYC. If labor is in a shortage businesses have to move to where the labor is or they have to pay enough to get people to stay or move to the area in which they are located.The sad thing about this problem is that much of it is created by the hubris of executives concerned about their corporate image. As an example there is no reason at all for a company such as Reddit to be located in San Francisco. They could easily relocate to Tennessee or Detroit pay their employees less and the employees would still have more disposable income. Right now they can choose not to do so. However if we turn the labor market into a sellers market their labor cost is going to be driven up even more than those in cheaper areas. In this case you will see more companies moving out of California Seattle and NYC and into Alabama Indiana and the Carolinas.One more consideration...we really need to discourage any further building and development in the Southwest. The population is already taxing the water supplies to the maximum. We need to do everything possible to shift populations away from that area of the country.Another front on housing is that we need to continue to make progress in sexual education and contraceptive availability. That along with reasonable immigration policy we can debate what that is another time can trim long term population growth which is what will drive nationwide prices up over time.So in summary the fixes are to decrease the labor supply as mentioned in my original post and indirect population control.Higher EducationThis one is nasty. I know that the popular opinion here is for everyone to just have free higher education. I have some concerns there though. First if everyone gets a  year degree then they really become somewhat worthless. Second there will always be jobs that need to be done that simply do not need a higher education. You also have to look at what has driven the insane rise in cost. In my opinion and I realize that some would disagree I think that the increase in availability of student loans has played the largest part in driving up costs.So for a solution here is what I would do...th grade would be the end of high school unless you meet certain criteria. Those that do not meet that criteria or that do not wish for higher education would be moved to community colleges for trades or general life skill courses as they choose. Those that meet the criteria would stay at their high school for college prep. The money from reducing high school attendance would go to the community colleges to cover the extra expenses. It probably would not be dead even but close enough for a rough plan.After completing the final  years of high school students would attend a  year college provided they continued to meet criteria. Only state schools can provide degrees. Private institutions can provide certificates but not a degree sorry Harvard and University of Phoenix but there is no way to get rid of one without the other.If your parents live near a campus and there is room the govt will pay for your tuition books and fees from a general fund provided that you go into an approved field that is based on projected workforce needs and aptitude tests. For each semester you attend you will pay a . tax on your income for the next  years. This will provide the general fund with funding.If you test for aptitude in a field that is not taught near you or if your local school is full the government will provide housing and food as well.The system for advanced degrees would be similar as well.There would also need to be options for adult education for those that messed up in their youth but have shown themselves to be responsible over time and want a second change or for those where technology changes have made their positions unneeded.There are tons of details missing but I am out of time. Hope that provides a decent basis to work from though. I would welcome any feedback.,bestof,czmvga1,0,t5_2qh3v

This has been talked about before but that whole thing was a nonrecurring phenomenon based on the facts of Europes infrastructure being destroyed in WWII women entering the workforce the previous generation opening businesses with their educations based on the GI Bill and so forth. Now you can blame the baby boomers and genxers for being myopic and thinking that their economic environment would persist or improve but in their defense they didnt have the means to look at history the way we do. Their history was from word of mouth TV and movies. They knew that their parents went through the Depression and the war but now things were better. They were fixed.

The second case no. Not even remotely possible. The guy in the gif doesnt even look like hes in good shape. Yet if thats a real motorcycle hes basically doing legged lbs squats with an extremely extremely unbalanced load. About as likely as pigs flying.TLDR Commenter is right. Motorcycle is fake.EDIT Just watched the video. Its absolutely clear the bike doesnt weight much.There are  guys who are lifiting it but thats because its large and bulky and they dont want it to fall over while its unbalanced. The speed and sloppinesscarelessness with which theyre lifting are clear signs of relatively light weight. There is simply no way they could have lifted a truly heavy object in that manner.Edit  Some people say the real motorcycle would weigh lbs not lbs. Even more unbelievable.Edit  Oh for fucks sake if you keep watching the video once the guy gets to the top he reaches up and overhead presses the motorcycle off his head then  guys drag the motorcycle onto of the bus using one hand each. Even if until now you believed we had just discovered the strongest powerlifter on the planet this confirms its a prop motorcycle. Absolutely busted.Edit  Just for reference this is what overhead pressing lbs looks like. And thats an ideally balanced bar. Even a guy that strong couldnt overhead press an unbalancecd motorcycle. And certainly he couldnt overhead press it nonchalantly while standing on a fucking ladder.Edit  The other thing to look at is the ladder. A typical decent ladder has a lbs weight limit. Sure thats partly for safety amp liability reasons but if youve ever hauled up heavy loads on one you know theyll begin to sag a bit. Lets say this guy is lbs so theyre supposedly putting a lbs load on this ladder. And it doesnt deflect even a little. Not possible.,bestof,cztkvpn,16,t5_2qh3v

I think its a good idea if you live in a health backwards place like the US to just wait with the person.Main things for seizures are  Get them on their side so they dont choke on their own blood if they bite their tongueWait with them.  Use their cell phone to call family or friends if unsure.  Let them know where they are when they wake up.  Some will wake up very confused.  It takes my husband half an hour to fully wake up and become aware after a seizure.However call an ambulance right away if  They seize for more than five minutesThey fall from a height or are bleeding from somewhere that isnt the mouth i.e. the back of the head better safe than sorryThey wake up and their shoulder is dislocated and no one knows how to set it.It really is a good idea to be better safe than sorry but the stress that comes with going to the hospital sometimes far outweighs the benefits.  Especially since every time hes woken up in the hospital they just did a blood test and sent him on his way.  ,bestof,d0bxrbh,1,t5_2qh3v

6723758,0,t1_d0ekhdo,Clearly the opposite.  Highlighting the problem folks is fine and should happen as the outliers should have the same repercussions ad everyone else.  No one is above the law.  If a few doctors in the entire country after years of practice had been linked to murdering people the entire media MSM wouldnt be protesting doctors labeling all doctors as corrupt racists and allowing patientslivesmatter to burn down and loot entire cities.  They would single out those single particular people and roast them.  We wouldnt have entire TV shows dedicated to publishing every doctors personal identifying information their families information where children go to school and having panels talk about how doctors everywhere just want to murder people and attack other races.If a doctor in another city or state was found to be murdering people I absolutely am not going to worry about my personal doctor or lose faith in any doctors.  It isnt about them.  Someone elses actions do not define the entire group.  A few examples of a problem does not make it systemic and the rule.  That is like if out of  million sodas that were manufactured this year  were flat.  That is not a systemic problem.  That is an outlier and needs to be dealt with.  Labelling the whole brand as a problem is wrong and not a valid solution.  If  sodas came out flat youd have an actual systemic problem.  Some asshole cop in Michigan who acts wrongly on an interaction doesnt make me and those I work with racist murderous pigs who deserve to have their families assaulted harassed and murdered.  On a related note if the asshole cop is now brought before the  justice system and he is either not indicted by grand jury or found not guilty if indicted that doesnt give people the right to burn down cities and go murder people either.

6812281,0,t3_48xjp7,Of course it isnt completely altruistic.  When America invades a country in the middle east with no provocation theyll be at the head of a coalition including an obscene number of these protected states.Take the ANZUS treaty for example.  The treaty is an agreement between Australia New Zealand and the United States to help each other in Pacific conflicts.  In order to make sure we stay on Americas good side so that they honor the treaty if Australia is ever attacked the Australian Defense Force has turned up to every single American war no matter where ever since.  Even New Zealand turned up to Afghanistan and Iraq even though the United States suspended the treaty with respect to New Zealand after NZ refused port access to American military vessels.  After supporting the US in these wars New Zealand has gotten back their trust and the ANZUS treaty is whole again.New Zealands treatment sends a pretty clear message.  America will protect you but only if you support them.  Its a good deal for both parties.  Us little guys get protection from the worlds greatest power America gets friendly ports all over the world and the ability to form the largest coalitions in history.And they can chat to anyone in the world about their politics because virtually everyone watches their elections keenly knowing that world security is utterly dependent on the sound administration of the United States.

6813114,0,t1_d0o6soz,gt Greece has a lot of borders...gt If they go through the coast the smugglers tactics is to destroy the lifeboats when they are within a few hundred meters of the coastline...gt If they go through Turkey that part is actually fairly well regulated. The border isnt large...I understand why you cant keep them all out though I think letting the die is the best action in some cases but how does this prevent deportation? Is it purely a cost factor and if so how would it be cheaper to keep the people there than to deport them?gt Of course its their right but it goes against the spirit of the EU...Does it though? Is the spirit of the EU going along with what other nations want regardless of your own opinions or is it not protecting your nation and continents autonomy? Who decided that either of these things are the spirit of the EU?gt These are statistical abberrations which makes a lot more sense in context...gt Its no secret that crime rates are far higher in the middleeast than in the west...gt If you want you can look at it this way...Ok I dont understand your point about the crime rates. I pointed out that the migrants are committing many violent crimes because a reason not to let them in is the safety and well being of actual European citizens. And when you pointed out that moving large amounts of people doesnt change their behavior you are making the exact arguments I am making that they arent only in a bad place because of the home nations but because of their culture and behavior. So when you speak of the EU taking people in to change them not only does that only work on an individual level it also puts your culture at risk of being diluted especially with such a high number of outsiders now and those still living in the Middle East are following the assbackwards extremist policies.gt Im not sure how you reached that conclusion. The EU works on a layered incentive basis...I understand that more most individuals the actions of the EU are nonconsequential hell thats most politics but this case is literally about who the people are.  I made the analogy because you compared the EU to the US with its member nations being the equivalent to US states. Now I can understand if the EU feels it doesnt need a strict border policy to nonEU states overall but after dealing with widespread mass immigration and economic migrants wouldnt it be better to find some way to enforce the EUs security? As you said in this case its something unmanageable not prosperous. Wouldnt strengthening the border security of the overall EU make sense? Even as a temporary measure?gt I havent been on the east coast so my only cultural reference here is TV but isnt New York famously very proud of its multicultural heritage? As it should be too. I envy what you guys have over there  this is why I travel. You have it all three streets away.Its half and half tbh. I live near Chicago for context so I may be off a bit on how people in a place like New York actually feel so Ill try to show what I think are both sides.For one weve had about  years to get used to all these groups. And with that being said its not that anyone would walk around drooling over diversity except a few tumblr stereotypes more so that some groups stopped giving a shit about each other and are considered equally American. Now tv does sort of exaggerate the multiculturalism angle. Are there plenty of places with multiethnic friend groups? Of course! And thats fine because theyre all hopefully Americans. But most of our neighborhoods are self segregated. Speaking to the Chicagoland area you have hispanic neighborhoods polish neighborhoods and most cities has at least one ChinaTown usually. And dont forget when each of those groups first came over and still a bit to this day they got shit from everyone else. German and Irish were seen as inferior workers Chinese were given shit treatment on the railways black slavery indentured servitude from England Italian city gangs and child labor etc etc. Like I said it took forever for some of those groups to assimilate and we still have differences to this day.Personally? I hate multiculturalism. Not because of race or geography but because I dont believe it exists. If you have multiple cultures come together in the same area to live then either one culture will defeat the other or the end result will be a mixture and you get a different culture entirely. The reason it kind of works here is not because were so multicultural or diverse but because we arent. The best parts of America arent the parts that are multicultural but the parts that are American. Now I dont consider food to be a big cultural thing. You can have a Chinese restaurant a Falafel stand and a Italian butcher shop next to each other and as long as theyre all American its good. ,bestof,d0okay1,1,t5_2qh3v

They then moved to Alabama and eventually broke up at which point bio mom decided that not only did she no longer want to be with her partner but that she also didnt want her kids around her either because I guess taking kids away from their parents is just fun and games! Who needs  parents anyways? This is when the shady started she tried to get Alabama to overturn Georgias decision by saying it wasnt legal to begin with. Alabama being well Alabama was like fuck it and fuck Georgias jurisdiction too and invalidated the adoption because we all know gays are horrible immoral people right? Thats when the Supreme Court came and said Alabama I thought weve told you before you cant just decide not to listen to decisions Georgia has made put them in the corner for time out and upheld the adoption. ,bestof,d0tqtxv,1,t5_2qh3v

Case and point this best of. A guy gives personal accounts that are only related to him and youre going to take his word on it because it falls into the narrative you want to believe. Being white only helps if the person youre dealing with is racist and thats not the fault of the person being judged but the judge themselves. So lets stop catering to this bullshit white privilege mentality and actually look at whats causing the illusion of it existing. Want to see what real privilege looks like? Look at any case in which rich people are involved no matter their race OJ for those of you wanting an example of a black man and you will see that privilege is bought not racially inherited. ,bestof,d0us1ed,-4,t5_2qh3v

6877414,0,t1_d0unygg,The but whites face racism too! crowd only likes to acknowledge racism when its convenient. They have this massive blind spot either deliberately or otherwise to systemic and institutionalized racism because as soon as you start investigating those forms of racism and how they work in the US the only real conclusion you can come to is that being nonwhite in the US comes with some pretty huge hurdles.I think a part of it is that racism as a concept is frequently seen as something that is overt and easily identifiable. They either refuse or fail to understand that racism is far far more insidious than just some hick with a shotgun or a street skinhead or Stormfront. Those things exist but aside from the examples themselves almost everybody knows theyre bad and at this point are almost a cartoonish exaggeration. Racism in the US is largely comprised of small barely visible things. The buzzword is microaggression but Im not a fan of that particular word because it implies a sort of maliciousness that I dont think is present for most people guilty of committing them. I think its far more characterized by ignorance habit and culture than malice though deliberate malice certainly can be an element.Everybody everywhere is guilty of racism at one point or another. Some of us me had to overcome being raised in a racist environment. We learned what these thoughts and behaviors were and how to recognize them and fight them but also realize that its something that we are programmed not to notice so must remain vigilant. My parents used racially charged words like commas and early in my life I learned to eliminate those from my vocabulary but thats not ever all there is to it. Being nonracist doesnt constitute just never dropping the nbomb.

It was the repeal of this act that opened the door to the financial meltdown. Dont take my word for it theres sources everywhere. These banks are still  to this day  leveraging most of their AAA mortgage backed securities while also cheaply insuring those investment grade securities against their collapse despite them being some of the riskiest assets on their books. How you can rate these AAA after having examples of their massive failure in recent history is beyond me but there it is. The whole thing is a pyramid scheme of risk allocation that leaves the bottom footing the bill and the top collecting the profits from an unbelievable amount of risk. We have leveraged our entire economy against this model and little has changed since the collapse. They have the capacity to hold the entire world for ransom as their financial house of cards has us all by the balls. Hurt Wallstreet profits? Dont make me laugh.

Some workers? You should check out the GDP growth over this time and compare that to the rise in real wages. That ignores those that just simply lost their jobs to the competition.

7057584,0,t1_d1gbmki,gt Isnt the reason that health insurance pays for health checkups that preventative care is cheaper in the long run than treating catastrophic illnesses? That is it not only provides better outcomes but makes it cheaper overall to incentivize patients to take proactive care of their health?Yes and this is a really good point.  Thanks for bringing it up I had to think for a moment.  Unfortunately I dont think this really addresses the problem in the pay for everything model.  Remember the premium you pay is based on the collective risk of incurring expenses.  Healthy low risk people who make regular preventative visits drive the costs down while high risk people drive it up.  If they charged a premium based on the assumption that everyone is high risk then youd be making a very good point but they dont do that... because what healthypreventative person would want to pay a premium like that?  There is a difficult balance between having to keep people as customers and having to create a sustainable insurance model there is an interdependency here.  And when your model is designed such that everyone will always have expenses i.e. preventativenonemergency its nearly impossible to sustain.  In my opinion this is the reason we continually see health care costs inflation that far exceeds the normal rate of inflation.

7062356,0,t1_d1guh5i,Well the hospital broke the law and i can grantee they actual did not and you misunderstood or are lying about your expedience. Here is the current law under EMTALA. This is also assuming you did not go to an outpatient ambulatory clinic that is not considered an ER many exist and few know the difference between the two.  They make you pay before hand    Individuals requesting emergency care or those for whom a representative has made a request if the patient is unable must receive a medical screening examination MSE to determine whether an emergency medical condition EMC exists. The participating hospital cannot delay examination and treatment to inquire about methods of payment or insurance coverage or a patients citizenship or legal status. The hospital may only start the process of payment inquiry and billing once they have ensured that doing so will not interfere with or otherwise compromise patient care.    When an Emergency Department determines an individual has an EMC they must provide further treatment and examination until the EMC is resolved or stabilized and the patient is able to provide selfcare following discharge or if unable can receive needed continual care. Inpatient care provided must be at an equal level for all patients regardless of ability to pay. Hospitals may not discharge a patient prior to stabilization if the patients insurance is canceled or otherwise discontinues payment during course of stay.    If the hospital does not have the capability to treat the condition the hospital must make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another hospital with such capability. This includes a longterm care or rehabilitation facilities for patients unable to provide selfcare. Hospitals with specialized capabilities must accept such transfers and may not discharge a patient until the condition is resolved and the patient is able to provide selfcare or is transferred to another facility.,bestof,d1gvnk9,1,t5_2qh3v

Since hemophilia is genetic multiple people from the same tribe had it. Back then hematological disorders were treated in specialized centers. Its not unusual to have a single doctortreating team ending up with lots of patients from a single tribe because of their genetic illness. So entire clusters of patients would be treated by the same treating team. Those tainted batches went to those specialized centers. There my professors prescribed them. Resulting in numerous HIV positive families under the care of a single department.  Those patients not only went onto  have HIV themselves many ended up unknowingly infecting their partners and passing it onto their children as well. Imagine talking to a family of  where everyone is HIV positive. Now imagine multiples of those families from a single tribe and there are lots of tribes. Those kids are in their early ss now  my age. My hospital still tracks and follows those patients and will continue to do so until they die. After the AIDS panic people didnt understand the disease. Healthcare workers were fearful. As a result patients were neglected.

However his stories still have small holes as others in the thread have pointed out.I was initially puzzled by how his DIs speech didnt sound quite right it started to sound a little too idealized and it kept going on and on. Ive gone on to read a couple of other popular posters in rMilitaryStories and I noticed that they dont have long unbroken quotes of dialogue. They might have a couple of memorable lines but the rest is paraphrased as in He told me about X rather than direct quotes. What bugs me about this is hes recounting a supposedly true story with real people and putting words in their mouths. Thats why other servicemen dont do that they might be talking about people who died serving their country and theyd be desecrating the only legacy they left which is their words and actions. We have to respect that and be as truthful and as accurate as possible unless the story is prefaced with Based on a true story or something similar.But what seals it for me is his lexicon of internet verbiage. With my background in DotA MTG and progressive political discussion call it whatever you want it would make total sense if I used terms and phrases like Internet police karma whore atheist who loves memes So yeah. There was that. Um no. Seriously wtf? ltface palmgt Dude. Check this out. neckbearded fedorawearing atheists playing tough guy over the net.Weve all seen older people try to use popular culture terms and miss the mark or slightly misunderstand them. He uses them correctly every single time.As to what would be the point of his wellinformed deception its not unprecedented that someone would go to great lengths to fake a military background. Its also fairly common on reddit that people make something up for karma. Even uunidan who was probably the most wellknown redditor at the time was found actively using sockpuppet accounts to boost his posts. The motivation doesnt have to make sense to a logical person it just has to make sense to them.I wasnt the one who literally called bullshit but I publicly expressed doubt and my conclusions are my own.

7372412,0,t1_d2g2pnm,So the patients should have no right to go against what you think is best for them?This may be anecdotal but tell me if you think the nursing staff was still in the right here.My uncle was suffering from some heart disease where his diet while hospitalized was extremely controlled.  What disease?  Didnt matter.  What I know of it was it was hereditary and he spent his life exercising and eating a strict diet.  Id never seen the man eat red meat in my entire life.  While he was in the hospital all he wanted was a burger.  All the man wanted was a hamburger and the nurses refused.His wife brought him one every day until he was discharged.Do you know why she did it?Because he was hospitalized following his oncologist confirming a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.So I want to know why the fuck any nurse would deny a man a decent meal after hed been given  months to live?  Heart failure wasnt going to have time to kill him. Obviously this isnt universal or even common but it is an example of why sometimes listening to the patient is more important than thinking you know whats best. ,bestof,d2g6xpp,-21,t5_2qh3v

And no the except does not cancel out the at all because like I said the point of the comment is completely different from what I think you are talking about. In my personal opinion however its clear as day how much each candidate is influenced by what when you analyze what each candidate says who and what they support where they get their money and who runs their respective Super PACs.

It ignores the possibility that more could have been accomplished in lieu of alternative societal cultural or political forces. What if at some point in the epochs past or yet to come a fledgling civilization in a similar position had a massive nuclear war and everybody died? We would look great compared to them. But what if a similar civilization had already mad manned explorations to ever planet in the solar system? We would look not so good. The fundamental flaw with being satisfied with our current progression is that we have exactly one planet to compare our own progression to when its quite possible our accomplishments have been lackluster all things considered. We cannot look at  other examples of civilizations evolving and place ourselves in a hierarchy of success. If the goal of such a thought process is to feel satisfied and derive selfworth as an individual in the face of a culture that increasingly is characterized by curated social media profiles then I guess its ok.

7676202,1,t1_d3eo4fg,Well this topic and the concept of defense spending is more than just logistical it is philosophical.  What is the EXACT figure that would be acceptable?  I dont know.  I readily admit I do not know.  There are far too many variables involved for a peon like myself to accurately calculate that.Here is what I DO know...  The USA is a member of NATO and has been since  as an obvious deterrent to a Soviet forces in post WW Europe.  As of  there are  member countries in NATO with a th on the way.  Germany is a member and it allocates . BILLION to defense.  In comparison the USA spends  TIMES that amount annually for defense.  China arguably the only nation on competitive par with the USA spends less than  of what the USA does on defense.  In fact the USA spends more than many powerful countries on defense combined and most of those are US allies who will most likely help defend the USA in the event of war many of whom have contributed to US nationbuilding all over Earth.So my question is simple...  Why is the USA part of NATO and the UN if it intends to fund a military that needs neither organization?  Is the USA the police force of the world?  If so why would it adhere itself to NATO or the UN?  Are these interventions and even INVASIONS in fact for the GOOD of Earth?We know that Afghanistan and Iraq were not responsible for  yet they were invaded.  We now know that the US defense budget has been used to arm terror factions in the Middle East and Africa in a clear attempt to destabilize the both regions for years now.  We know that Vietnam was based on a lie that would have been impossible if not for a very funded and unchecked military apparatus.I am not advocating isolationism as that isnt a logical predisposition in  however the other extreme is not acceptable either and that is exactly what we have seen for decades now.  Unchecked military aggression against anyone deemed by unelected men in power as a necessary strategic operation.Do I know the number?  Nope.  But I can tell you that the USA can maintain very stable defenses with  of its current military expenditure.  If it cannot then a LOT of people at the Pentagon need to be fired and replaced immediately.  I find it incredibly obtuse at best but most likely just moronic to assume the US is doing anything other than propping up its own failing currency valuation through constant military interventions all over the planet maintaining a vast and invasive military presence that it really cannot afford which is obvious when you observe US debt and US annual deficits and defense as a percentage of that.  ,bestof,d3eqlu0,-6,t5_2qh3v

Its frankly irrelevant what the Saudis or other allies pay for US equipment Id rather they get our stuff cheaply and man it themselves.

Badass but more interested in protecting the little guy than going after Supervillains and with a wry sense of humour. I mean he almost declines the invitation to join the JLU and then stays after he spots Black Canary there.

Instead we have a guy that is transparently treating the election like a huge sales pitch promise anything and everything to close the deal just make sure they never read the fine print.Hilary is hardly ideal but at least i dont have to worry she will invade a country just to protect her fragile ego. She is above all boring and venal only in the most pedestrian sense. She certainly has an ego like pretty much all politicians Bernie included but her ambition is clearly one of legacy not naked unrestrained selfaggrandizement. These days thats practically a virtue.The bottom line is that with Hilary i know exactly what i get as a politician and its fairly unremarkable. With Trump all I am truly certain of is that weve gotten a guy with a remarkably fragile ego that will attack anyone without hesitation at the first sign of the slightest challenge.

If people look at what hes doing and see it as weak then thats what it is to them.gtOur current best understanding of radicalisation includes building a legitimate seeming ideology that justifies extremism. Yes our current best understanding according to people like the president who given the the way events in the middle east have spiraled out in the last few years clearly dont have a very good understanding of either Islam or the middle east.  In his rush to mimic his predecessor and toss up a Mission Accomplished sign the president pulled our military out of Iraq and created a power vacuum that allowed extremists to take a foothold in the region.  On top of that in his rush to play nation builder and topple Bashar al Assad not only creating yet another power vacuum but also inadvertently supplying extremists and giving Russia who came in to support Assad greater influence and credibility in the region.gtWhat Obama and the rest of the world is trying to avoid doing is legitimising that constructed ideologyIf the president were as concerned about crushing these extremists wherever they are found as he was about legitimizing their ideology this wouldnt be an issue.,bestof,d4abi56,1,t5_2qh3v

8150428,0,t1_d4vgnpu,Kiddos mom here. Hes only just turned four.  He wasnt just sad he lost his toy.  After a couple of weeks of Fezzik the Elephant missing we thought well maybe hes outgrowing his stuffed friend.  Hed ask every once in a while after him and  we said Fezzik must be at the grandparents house as that is what we thought was the truth. We learned later than he wasnt there either.  He was well and truly missing.Then one night he woke up from a nightmare with a slight fever in the middle of the night begging for his favourite plushie since birth. He was brokenhearted when we couldnt bring him Fezzik.  We told him that Fezzik must have been off on an adventure to  comfort the sick and scared little one. It was am and the most important thing we could do is calm him enough to help him back to sleep. He woke in the morning feeling much better.  He also inquired as to when Fezzik would be coming home.  We told him that we werent sure  and that we were sorry. That brokenhearted look in his eye killed us. He was worried that Fezzik might not be safe and missed him greatly. So I asked him if he wanted a postcard or a letter from Fezzik to see that the Elephant  was alright. Boy did that clear his mind fast! I sent out a call to a friend from out of town to drop a postcard in the mail and another friend posted a picture on rPhotoshopbattles.  We didnt expect for Fezzik to come home  but we did think it was an amazing opportunity to teach our son about different places and cultures using Fezzik as the vehicle. Hes already begging to check out books about some of the places Fezziks visiting when we go back to the library.When someone found a listing to replace the toy and I dont think we had the heart to pass it up. There will be plenty of opportunities to teach him about loss or hard truths or ugly realities but I dont think any of us were ready for this Calvin to lose his Hobbes permanently just yet. Not when there is still so much Fezzik can teach him.,bestof,d4wcnju,6,t5_2qh3v

8195773,0,t3_4rjwoi,I died the first time I was on acid. Was a very surreal experience. I was sitting on the couch unable to talk or move completely drenched in sweat. The room was spinning around me but simultaneously staying still and there were voices swirling and reciting every poor choice I had ever made. Giant red letters reading ACID covered a lot of my field of vision and were constantly melting and reforming. I realized that I was dying and the emotions that came with that were undescribable. My only true regret at the time was my inability to say goodbye to my wife who was sitting next to me on the couch tripping balls as well. Then I remember slowly fading from reality even more than I already had and then watching my limp body from somewhere near the ceiling. I woke up in a different room not knowing who I was and very slowly snapped into it while my wife and the  other people who were tripping with us all first timers repeatedly told me your just really fucked up its just saturday we always get really fucked up on saturday. We just dropped acid this time. They all said I never actually passed out or anything I just wandered the house unresponsive for while then laid down on the ground in the other room. During the same trip I also visited a land of clocks got stuck in a reality roulette wheel and convinced myself that the world wasnt real. Acid was real and I had just been dreaming for the prior  years.

This combined with a lifelong love of art with duality themes realizations that we are all just extensions of the same ball of matter and tripping with a roommate who could be a maladjusted much less mature version of myself...

Anyway yesobviously Erdoan gave the Kurds more freedom than many of the Kemalists and dealt with Barzani because Barzani in return didnt actively support Kurds in Turkey. And recently given all the crackdowns and curfews in the southeast what information is getting out does seem to support the narrative that this is not just the PKK but a real war that the army is escalatingin which case military targets seem fair game to me although I cant condone the killing of civilians. But if Turkey doesnt give a fuck about Kurds creating their country in Iraq or Syria why isnt the government letting trade flow across the border? I can understand a weapons embargo and immigration control given security concerns but the restrictions on things like fertilizer hurt the ordinary people of Rojava much more than any PKKaligned leadership.

This is why theyre different from randoms this is why we question them so much and are so concerned about their ideology. Its not an outright explicit promise but it contains power.I say fuck him just to show the anger that would result. You chastise me for being closeminded but perhaps you should consider if youre not elevating civility and nonhate as you see it to the point where you are dismissing pretty valid reasons to be angry.I take it for granted that some position changes are more reasonable than others. Im just showing why people will get really angry and in fact should be allowed to get really angry the decisions of politicians matter.The man who flipped against unions can have multiple possible reasons some more justified than others. Im not going to spend my time telling the people who live with the material consequences that he just changed his mind like this is some high school philosophy club and that should trump everything else. They know he changed his mind and they are still forced to live with the reality. gtThere is always speech that is changed to avoid persecution. American courts can still hold people in contempt cant they? Id argue that youre not arguing for the principle but the extent in which that principle is enforced.Sure. But it doesnt matter. I can easily reformulate it.Free speech should proceed on more liberal grounds and with far stronger protections against persecution than currently exist in Europe. Charges against seditious speech hate speech and speech on a topic that has been deemed to be verboten like Holocaust denial should face an extremely high barrier so that in most cases such speech is allowed unless its direct harassment at least for criminal charges. Youd still end up with a gap between US and European views. gtI dont disagree with that notion I just think that it being so hardly unique to America yet being the greatest thing about America essentially just puts the country down. We disagree and franklyI feel like were going around in circles. I dont think a country needs to be unique to be great but YMMV. gtAs far as funding goes absolutely  though that isnt the only metric you can try to use to argue for the love of Science and Law. Its a multifaceted argument but for two points that raise contention on the matter America has a significant religious population including various political figures. A doctrine that is arguably unscientific has a significant influence on American society. Then as for the Law America has a notably high incarceration rate does it not?Yes theres more than one factor yes theres a high incarceration rate. I dont mean love of following the law this is also a complex issue with laws creating criminals instead of people just not loving being lawful I mean a very strong legal system thatfor all its faults is accepted as the legitimate guide of the land.See the late Roman Republic for a time when the law was accorded less respect or any of the various failing or failed states around the world.

8458906,0,t1_d5ytmik,Direct democracy still isnt viable. People dont invest the time or energy into learning the details or nuances of complicated policies. People have their own lives and jobs to worry about expecting them to be experts on trade and regulation makes about as much sense as expecting them to represent themselves in court diagnose their own medical issues or fix their own cars. Generally people who do these things themselves tend to bungle it up unless they have invested lots of time and energy into becoming experienced in it. And even the most dedicated hobbyist is unlikely to be better at it than a seasoned professional. Its no different with public policies. You can trust the public to make big picture decisions about an individuals values and judgement. They can also articulate in a rough way what direction they want to move in for major questions like whether to go to war. But the vast VAST majority of policy questions are highly nuanced and have lots of stakeholders whose concerns need to be considered. Its a job in itself to do all of that which politicians have but teams of people doing research and coordination on. Moreover what you call democracy in more properly called majoritarianism and is an inherently unjust framework. Just because a group is only  of the population doesnt mean a system is justified in disregarding their preferences. It should weigh their concerns in proportion to their size and impact on the rest of the polity but it is not right to ignore them. The function of government is to operate on behalf of everyone under their charge as best as they are able. There are going to be tradeoffs in any system but overdemocratization tends to breed illiberal and oppressive states. As for bundling of electoral votes only benefiting some of the states thats not really the case. It benefits those state legislators who want their states interests represented. We are in an unusually partisan era in our history so it seems particularly bad. But previously a Connecticut Republican would have way more in common with a Connecticut Democrat than an Iowa Republican. So they liked to magnify the power of their state in electoral contests because it would force candidates to operate with concern for the practical interests of states rather than the ideological interests of partisans. If it benefitting small states were true wed expect Texas California New York or Florida to be the first to introduce proportional splitting of their electors.

Will the police be able to respond before she is brutally raped and murdered? Somehow that doesnt make sense to me.As other user pointed out it would in a lock box and not loaded. Having it loaded andor not in a lock box is irresponsible and stupid. Thus its not going to be useful in the event that someone breaks down your door and tried to rape and kill you...And there are other things such as metal baseball bats crow bars lead pipes knives and all manner of things you can use to defend yourself with inside your home. Even in the hands of a frail small female a metal bat can cause fatal damage to any intruder.What if the intruder had a gun? You may say well if we lived in a society without guns that wouldnt be an issue.And if intruders are arming themselves with knives and bats and thats all you have and are out numbered you will then have to think and react quickly. Whether it be to run out of the house or what ever. In this situation you could say having a gun is being prepared for such an eventhoweve. Though if you take precautions such as better lockswindowssecurity it would be as much of a deterrent and protection as a gun.If you live somewhere this is a common occurrence then you should have a plan of action for such events. And having a plan would be enough to likely survive an encounter.But I mean your life can end in any number of ways at any moment. What are you going to do to protect yourself from a drunk driver from ending your life? Worrying about a home invasion and buying a gun would be like never leaving your house because you may get into a car accident and die.,bestof,d65i0db,-1,t5_2qh3v

Different countriesregions have plenty of different approaches to voting. If it turns out that almost all of politics on the ground is getting your people to the polls to actually cast a vote that could potentially be seen as evidence of a fucked up system and not worthy of praise at all.Typical sentiment in many comments here sure these people are passionate about their candidate and arguing about the issues but they fail when it comes to actually rolling up their sleeves and doing the hard work. That sounds very smart and adult but maybe thats because its still in abstract terms. If it was rolling up their sleeves and doing the hard work of donating loads of money to buy TV commercial slots that would get a vastly different response. Or in this case if were more honest and say rolling up their sleeves and doing the hard work of tracking and reminding their likely voters to actually bother going to cast their vote that again sounds way less virtuous and we may question whether that should be the real challenge of elections or not.,bestof,d66td0a,1,t5_2qh3v

My mentor teacher took me on so she could dump her course load on me while she did budget and planning for the school.  A teacher was trying to get fired so she could sue the district for discrimination.  She even had another student teacher proof read her letter to the district.I had a kid taken out by police.  We had a weapon incident where  cop cars showed up because a emotionally impaired student was sent to the office and he had a pocket Swiss Army knife.  I had a senior in my th grade English class who didnt try even though his full ride to Iowa depended on passing that one fucking class.  There was a gang fight across the street half the people in the fight were our students.The school was broke a year from losing its ability to graduate students.  We ran out of paper for the semester in November.  I couldnt let students take home their textbooks or copies of To Kill A Mockingbird because the school didnt trust the kids.  I had  th graders that were pregnant.  One gave birth in November and the other after I left.I was told that too many of my students were failing and I had to raise their grades.  Most of my students didnt do any work or didnt bother showing up more than once a week.  We watched a movie and I gave them a  point extra credit assignment which consisted of  blatantly obvious questions about the movie.  Only had a few full ones turned in and maybe only  of the class actually did any of it.Place was an absolute nightmare.  I cant imagine how students that actually cared felt about going to school there.  There were some bright spots like the football and basketball team.

On one side you have heartless people questioning and refusing to support any woman who claims she was raped and on the other side there is the sentiment of always believe her and give her the benefit of the doubt even when someone elses freedom is on the line.How hard is it to just support and be sensitive to people who say they have been raped but just apply some strict standards when that extends to deciding to potentially lock someone up for decades?

8726617,0,t3_4zgb8y,I think the police department attracts three big groups of people . Nice law abiding people who have had either a police office in their family or have had the police help them in some significant way in their lives. . Bullies who like bossing people around . Generally wellmeaning people who are usually fine but who are not calm. They have a hair trigger for either fear or anger. Number  is dangerous but number  is worse. I used to have a guy working for me. Really a very nice guy and very smart. I liked him a lot. But he had a rage problem. Something very trivial would set him off and hed suddenly be a different person. He asked me for recommendation for the police training program. Id recommend him for many jobs because he is really a neat and smart guy. But not the police. I had to tell him I never could because of his anger issues. People who are not calm cannot be around firearms because that one second of panic or rage can end an innocent persons life. ,bestof,d6wgx20,10,t5_2qh3v

For music I love good audio quality but Im somewhat tone deaf and my hearing in general is sorta shit so it eventually hits a audio quality point where I cant tell the difference. For food I honestly want to eat a tasty steak with some homemade mashed potatoes and freshly steamed broccoli. I dont even know if I could identify all the subtle nuances that go into fancy food presentation and how it is prepared. A  steak dinner is probably the pinnacle of quality I could appreciate and everything else is probably just wasted effort on me.Seeing things like  dollar headphones or  dollar dinners is baffling to me because its something that Im incapable of fully understanding and comes across as something thats x the price I would value it at. Honestly it makes me wonder how many people who purchase such things can actually fully appreciate its value and how many people pay those prices to just appear like they do.

8789584,0,t1_d74bkcw,No. I was an engineering student and now work on a construction site. I dont want to play the game of Whos Better Able To Approach This Objectively? because Id rather play the game of What can be done to convince you and people who share your opinion of math that its interesting? I dont mean to make some kind of you people thing out of this but its unavoidable when people all across the country share your view on math which is thank god I dont have to use that now that Im out of school or Im so glad my job doesnt make me use math. Even a lot of engineers that I know just think of math as a means to an end. Its just the toolbox that helps them get the job done. I reject that view and think that math is wonderfully enjoyable for its own sake. Clearly some number of people must agree with me due to the popularity of games like Minecraft and Sudoku. Now dont get me wrong video games have come a long way since Minecraft and Im sure that a lot of people would rather just shoot the shit with their friends over a beer than play Sudoku. But enough people know what those things are and how to play them and have probably dedicated an hour or two of an afternoon to playing those games that theyve experienced in some way how math can be fascinating interesting and fun. I maintain that even something as facially esoteric as Eulers Formula can open up to people something just as intricate and fun to explore as Sudoku or Minecraft or other simple games. ,bestof,d74dfq3,2,t5_2qh3v

Im writing to ask you to please take  seconds and sign rkratoms petition to the DEA to halt its decision to put kratom into the schedule  classification.  Kratom is a leaf which has analgesia painkilling and stimulating properties and has been used safely in Southeast Asia for thousands of years.  Many of us in fact tens of thousands use kratom to manage chronic pain rather than the horrendously addictive and toxic opiate narcotics that were prescribed to us.  Some of us such as myself were on the verge of suicide due to chronic pain and the horrible side effects of our opiates when we discovered kratom.

My husband had that and a  Chateau Margaux my brother in law bought  cases of that when his daughter was born in   it was to save for her wedding but thats another story  and they had named her Margaux over the ski week. Nobody TOLD him it was expensive it WAS expensive. His buddy has a huge wine cellar at his ski house. He just gave him the Bordeaux to take home because they drank a couple of bottles and my husband liked it. He didnt dismiss me. He was disappointed for me that I didnt like it and happy for himself that he got more  I have a finicky pallet. I will say I LOVE a bottle of wine and my husband will go buy a few bottles of it. He will then open a bottle and bring me a glass a month later and Ill say I dont like it. Hes like...really? You just raved about how good it was the last time you had it. Hes not a wine snob and he knows that the best wines to drink both for taste and value are around    dollars a bottle. Thats what we normally do but occasionally we get a special bottle. What I have eaten really affects the taste. Any soft cheese brie cambozola blue... makes me dislike my wine. Hell I ate some wasabi peas and took a sip of my white wine last week and almost spit it out. I brushed my teeth and drank some tea and later the wine tasted good. So with me its apparently a crap shoot. The truth is that most people including Sommeliers have preferences that change depending on their mood what they ate and perhaps the alignment of the stars that evening. I like most wines and if I dont I dont drink it and pretend I like its great. Im more like OPs dad. I thought the post was funny because Ive been there done that. My husband and I dont buy into the wine snob thing. We saw Sideways and joke a lot about what notes we taste stinky feet in my case. ,bestof,d798dq1,2,t5_2qh3v

Bush  refused to flatout win the first Gulf War and the truce that was negotiated was merely in a long ceasefire. Following  regardless of whether Saddam had anything to do with it it seemed like we had a good damn reason to orchestrate a show of force in the region and to vastly increase our presence. Frankly the culture there recognizes weakness and is merciless about it. Terrorists may hate us but for the next  years they kept their attacks within the region and away from us.

8856061,0,t1_d7busce,A lot of consumers have gotten into the idea of minmaxing where they will pay for a few luxury goods and go cheap on almost everything else. Online and big box stores are cheaper than malls and have been killing malls profitability. High end malls have done better but only because they are pulling in a less price sensitive crowd.However to say that only malls are doing poorly is to miss an urban inversion in the United States where urban centers are becoming more desirable and the suburbs in general are beginning to lose value. Some malls are dealing with it by becoming denser incorporating residential and other commercial development that is supported partially by mass transit. Other malls are in a race to the bottom as they become less picky about their tenants and lower rents.,bestof,d7cdg72,1,t5_2qh3v

8883015,0,t1_d7fhzwu,In truth its not an issue for most consumers. Let me preface by saying Im not happy with the choice and it is a bad idea. However everyone is making a huge ass mountain out of a molehill. Most people either charge their phone while using their PC and when theyre wall charging most people dont use their phone but briefly and usually its inconvenient to be tethered to your phone via abut  feet of cable anyway. Now also the AirPods are very competitively priced. Samsung made a similar pair that lasts  hours and costs . The  mark is pretty damn spot on for mid to high range wireless earbuds. Also all this crap about losing them amuses me. These sorts of earbuds have existed for ages people generally manage to not lose them maybe because when you spend  you want to keep them plus not everyone is that clumsy. Buts is so damn amusing that people are acting like Apple is the first one to make these and its sooooo bad. Not to mention cheap Bluetooth headphones are like  anyway. You can argue sound quality all you want but in the end its usually on par or better than the cheap  gas station earbuds  of people but to replace their EarPods anyway. Also iirc Apple uses a different version which not all BT headphones have so they use an older lower quality standard whereas ones that do use the standard are capable of higher quality than regular BT. The adapter sucks and I take it as an admission by Apple of fucking up. I mean how unApple like is it to include an adapter? But its still nice and just buy a second one and stick them on the end of your main headphones and your cars . jack. Or buy a cheap .mm to Bluetooth adapter you can find em for like . Basically if youre going to spend  on a top of the range phone you can probably afford some cheap  wireless headphones and a cheap Bluetooth .mm adapter. Also now that lightning audio is standard well probably see some lightning DACs which will make the audiophiles happy. Maybe those DACs will even have charging pass through who knows. Also the whole its over  years old it was bound to happen!! Argument pisses me off. It was around that long because theres very little to none you can improve it. In closing it matters but hardly as much as everyone is complaining about. Its an apple product so of course people are going to circlejerk about it till the end of time. If you dont like it the solution is simple dont buy it. Though  of the people complaining werent going to ever buy an iPhone in the first place. Motorola did this not too long ago and did you hear anything about that? A legitimate highly upvoted argument against that literally broke down into Motorola isnt as big as Apple so its okay. Its Reddit take everything with a grain of salt involving Apple. Its a horrible choice. But its not the death of iPhone and Apple like everyone on Reddit is predicting. TLDR its Redding being Reddit. Its a bad choice but to most users its at worst a minor nuisance and to most its almost a non issue. Most of the people complaining would never buy an iPhone in the first place and Reddit can be a large echo chamber at times. Also a pair of  earbuds isnt the only way to fix it. Again its a really really bad choice and I personally hate it enough to probably not upgrade unless o can get it practically for freebut I wasnt planning on it in the first place. ,bestof,d7fm2ay,0,t5_2qh3v

The interest then accrues over time so if you hold a debt with any interest rate above zero for a long enough amount of time that debt has cost you more to service than the initial amount of benefit you received from the debt.So if thats all correct the conclusions would be. the sooner the debt is paid off the sooner interest accrual ceases and the greater the benefit you realized relative to the total cost..

9104283,0,t1_d85mc65,The thing that really strikes me about this debate is that a consistent majority of doctors  who I strongly believe have truly altruistic motives  are against legalising euthanasia. The main reasons they give relate to perverse incentives. Firstly if euthanasia is legal terminally ill patients might feel pressured to choose this option rather than be a burden on the medical system. Secondly and similarly doctors operating under budgetary constraints could feel pressured to focus their resources on e.g. young children rather than old terminally ill patients. Prolonging a life comes at a cost and there comes a point when one begins to think that the money could be better spent elsewhere. To grossly oversimplify lets say you have a budget of . You have two patients one elderly and suffering from terminal cancer one infant suffering from a serious respiratory disease. Treating either one will cost a minimum of . Where do you focus your resources? Would you find yourself implicitly nudging the elderly patient towards choosing euthanasia in order to potentially save the life of the child? Is the life of one individual more valuable than another? Is it fair to put doctors in this position? Are they qualified  is anyone qualified  to make these sorts of moral decisions? Morally and on an individual level it might seem cutanddry. Theres no reason to prolong unnecessary suffering. But when you seriously think about what legal euthanasia would entail you begin to realise that it could skew decisionmaking and ultimately lead to perverse incentives for both doctors and patients. I think about this issue a lot but I have not been able to make my mind up yet. There are no simple answers.,bestof,d866ssp,2,t5_2qh3v

9229933,0,t1_d8lt2mg,I think this is a really really good question but also really really difficult one to answer. Again what Im about to say here is just opinion.I think that the best answer to this question again assuming that God is real would be that we are never forced to do anything. We are able to choose what we want to do with our lives and as a result people have varying opinions on different subjects based on experience personal preferences etc. But God wouldnt force someone into a specific way of life. Sure theres the stories in the Old Testament of him destroying entire cities and sending angels to slay armies and other forms of punishment but he never actually forces anyone to do anything. Im sure God would love it if everyone believed and did what he wanted them to and assuming God exists and has the power that the Bible says he does he must certainly have the power to make it so but he doesnt. And personally I would much prefer being able to choose my own life instead of having all my decisions made for me anyways.Hopefully that made sense.,bestof,d8lymmj,2,t5_2qh3v

9270189,0,t1_d8r14d8,Thats not really a fair statement. Its the difference between looking at America as one big group versus many small groups. Fiscal conservatives believe that by not meddling you enable the free market to develop a stronger and more efficient economy for everyone even if it is at the expense of some smaller groups. It accepts that if silicon valley can make better cheaper cars than the rust belt its better for everyone that the rust belt fails and silicon valley starts building cars. That way America builds better more competitive cars to sell abroad and makes more jobs at home. Its the group benefits even if a small unit suffers. The important point is that more people are better off.Now Im not advocating whether that is true or not thats a huge debate unto itself and I believe both sides have good claims to reality Im merely responding to the claim the fiscal conservatives are just agents of the status quo. Its probably easier to make the argument that the reverse is true. Namely that any effort to reinvigorate failed factory towns is shielding them from competition and preserving an inefficient status quo that weakens America as a whole.,bestof,d8r2agj,19,t5_2qh3v

If you go to the police and say my house got broken into they believe you even if they havent seen the broken lock yet at least enough to take you seriously and investigate it. If you say Ive been raped that rarely happens.Look yall can downvote me if you want but Im a survivor and Im speaking from experience. Believing that the victim is telling the truth to the best of their knowledge until proven otherwise is important when it comes to things like due process and significantly greater numbers of victims would come forward if they felt someone would believe them instead of immediately treating them like a fucking criminal for being assaulted. People whove had their car stolen get more empathy than people whove been sexually assaulted. Im sorry that happened to you can mean the fucking world to someone.Being treated like shit once means never going to the police again and a lot of victims are victimised more than once. Its easy to say well why did you put yourself in that situation again but if yall havent experienced it yall are gonna have a hard time really understanding how that feeling of having your agency over your body forcibly ripped away from you affects your psyche. Its the same reason abuse victims keep going back to their abusers or falling into abusive relationships over and over.

9372830,0,t1_d94281f,I agree we shouldnt use those weapons but I disagree with you analysis of us making it back. See the main thing is we wont need such massive power plants to start with and we can salvage what we have. Salvage solar panels and use the knowledge we already have to create wind turbines from salvage and you have now generated power. Salvaging will become the greatest resource we have to sustain and rebuild. First we focus on farming and salvaging then we focus on industrialisation and then we focus on advancement. It will take a while to reach where we are now but thats because right now we have  billion people working as a hive mind and sharing research and resources to advance. Mankind will be slowed down dramatically but I believe with enough time we would get to where we are now or exceed it. The main thing is technologies would take a different direction we wouldnt be using oil and coal because well if half the world is a no go zone you cant access the minerals but you can find many resources that can be used for other forms of technology. Although the world would look very different to it does now I think with salvaging and enough knowledge preserved we would eventually move into direction that would correlate with where we are now. Thats if we manage to survive in the first place which is the problem. The problem isnt rebuilding the problem is surviving to the point where we start. If the fallout happens chances are were all dying not just  of us. Whether we die from the initial explosion or the fall out afterward either way I think a full scale war will result in everyone dying. ,bestof,d942mrl,17,t5_2qh3v

For the me the stages were  Attaining competency I was terrible at games as a kid obviously we all were when we started Exceeding the challenge an AI can give. You play enough games enough times and the AI becomes a joke. I remember struggling against RTS AIs in the early s but later on it was just silly easy. Combine that with the fact that AI is now arguably stupider than it was back then mostly because the games are more complex and you get led into... Entering the multiplayer community. As the narratives of single player becomes repetitive and the challenge fades multiplayer is the best way to get entertaining narratives and challenges. Attaining competency at multiplayer. Single player pro  multiplayer novice Attaining expertise in multiplayer. And this is where I get salty about new games. The skill ceiling on everything is either low as can possibly be Battlefield CoD artificially raised by making the game clickspam SCII or veiled behind things like RNG and forced teamwork every Moba. Theres no more WCIII Halo D Guild Wars etc and its a shame.Now if youre stuck at  then honestly you arent really in it for the games you are in it for the narrative and you want it to be more storytelling than social.

Little background so I spent most of my highschool years listening to metal and after highschool spent  years drumming in a metal band so I promise you I wasnt just talking out of my ass when I referred to death metal as pig grunt music.But back during my highschool days of avidly swapping usb sticks full of music with friends Ill never forget the first time I heard a Cannibal Corpse song. Theyre pretty much the most famous of death metal bands just on the offchance you werent already aware.So the song comes on and I was digging the beat and the riff sounded great... Then the vocals started. And I started laughing so hard that I actually started tearing up. See the redditor who made the comment that this post is about said its whats underneath the music and I guess thats why I made the comment that you replied to. Because I do indeed love a bit of metal every now and then but the death metal vocals that consist of that grunty mumbling shit absolutely ruin it for me.To this day I cannot take it seriously and I apologize for discriminating against the people that do enjoy it.But The way he ended his explanation made me chuckle because it sounded like he was agreeing and saying yeah the vocals sound silly but you need to listen to the other parts of the song to enjoy it!. Well yeah in that respect I completely agree with him.I dont listen to much metal these days but I still standby the fact that its incredibly fun to play!

9452735,0,t1_d9e1uhi,jills response gt Nuclear power is dirty dangerous expensive and obsolete. First of all it is toxic from the beginning of the production chain to the very end. Uranium mining has sickened countless numbers of people many of them Native Americans whose land is still contaminated with abandoned mines. No one has solved the problem of how to safely store nuclear waste which remains deadly to all forms of life for much longer than all of recorded history. And the depleted uranium ammunition used by our military is now sickening people in the Middle East.Nuclear power is dangerous. Accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima create contaminated zones unfit for human settlement. They said Chernobyl was a fluke until Fukushima happened just  years ago. Whats next  the aging Indian Point reactor  miles from New York City? After the terrorist attack in Brussels we learned that terrorists had considered infiltrating Belgian nuclear plants for a future attack. And as sea levels rise we could see more Fukushimatype situations with coastal nuke plants.Finally nuclear power is obsolete. Its already more expensive per unit of energy than renewable technology which is improving all the time. The only reason why the nuclear industry still exists is because the government subsidizes it with loan guarantees that the industry cannot survive without. Instead we need to invest in scaling up clean renewable energy as quickly as possible.top commentgt Hello Jill thank you for coming to Reddit. Like other people in this particular thread I am an advocate for nuclear energy. I dont honestly expect to change your mind but I will feel better if I pretend you spent the time to read this and learned something. I learned much of this when I was getting my bachelors in Nuclear Engineering.Nuclear waste is a problem that is almost unique to inflated in the United States. The reason for this is that we dont reprocess our waste. What this means is that we do not separate the fission products from the remaining heavy elements. The fission products are the dangerous component because they decay relatively quickly giving a high dose in a short period of time. If we separated it though we would have significantly less volume of dangerous material to deal with. The bulk of the rest of the volume is also radioactive but it decays much more slowly and can actually still be used as fuel.As for dangerous I think you are discounting the discharge from other power and chemical plants during Fukushima. Most of the carcinogens spread around Japan were not from the nuclear plant which held up really well considering the events. I think you miss a lot of the picture if you do not realize how bad the tsunami was. Also statistically nuclear energy is the safest energy source per kilowatthour As for Chernobyl I think you might actually be touched to see just how well life is doing there after people ran away For the last point nuclear power is only obsolete in the US. This is because its been very difficult to get approval to build any plants since Three Mile Island. That was  years ago so of course the plants are old. In addition this approval process costs an obscene amount of money. The high cost of nuclear is largely inflated by the government. Once a plant is finally built actually running it is far cheaper than running other plants. This is another reason energy companies have been working to keep their plants open for so long. It saves them money.Finally if you are not aware of how much governments subsidize renewable energy then you are not in a position to move the US to clean energy. I hope that we can move to clean energy sources someday and I hope that research and development in renewable energy continues at the present rate. However its a lie to say that nuclear is more expensive than renewable technology today. Unless youre counting only hydro power but that is not the impression I got from your statement.Edit A few people pointed out I failed to mention mining. Mining is an extremely good point and I think it is probably one of the worst things about nuclear energy. Things like mining and fracking in general are always going to be dirty processes. Oil rigs will continue to pollute the oceans and Uranium mines will be unsafe places no matter how much we try to make them better. I absolutely concede this. Its not a black and white issue. As I said in another comment though I view radiation as another byproduct of human activity on this world. I absolutely am rooting for renewable energy sources and I hope to have one of those Tesla walls with solar panels on my house someday. However for now nuclear energy is so much more cleaner than what we are using and renewable energy cannot scale quickly enough to replace what we have. I personally am not as worried about radiation as I am about global warming and so my own view is that nuclear energy can do much more more good than harm.On the side of making obtaining Uranium in the future safer people have been working on extraction from seawater  Its still slow and expensive so this is not ready yet. But its something I hope for.Edit  Since Im much more for education and serious thought than shoving my views down anyones throat ulllamahas made a nice rebuttal to me below outlining some of the political difficulties a pronuclear candidate will face. I recommend it for anyone eager to think about this more.Edit  Im getting a lot of people claiming Im biased because Im a nuclear engineer. In fact I am a physics student researching dark matter. For example I can explain the Higgs mechanism just like I did on generating weapons from reactors below. I find it all very interesting. I just wanted to point out at the beginning that I have some formal education on the topic. My personal viewpoint comes only from knowledge which I am trying to share. Ive heard plenty of arguments on both sides but given my background and general attitude Im not particularly susceptible to pathos. This is the strategy a lot of opponents of nuclear use and it hasnt swayed me.Anyway I told you at the beginning what I know for some background. Learn what you can from here. Its good that some of you are wary about potential bias. Im just putting this edit here to say that Im probably not quite as biased as some of you think.It then devolves into pretty much  of the comments telling her how wrong she is with my own throwing in the billy madison speech from the principal,bestof,d9e78zh,93,t5_2qh3v

Do you even know what the scientific consensus specifically agrees on? The majority of scientists believe that . The earth is warming and has been for thousands of years.. All things equal atmospheric CO both naturally occurring and manmade is a greenhouse gas which causes warming.. The portion of CO which comes from carbonbased fuels contributes meaningfully to warming.. This is concerning and should be carefully studied. Thats it. Thats what almost every scientist myself included agrees on.If you want to go further to assert it is known with a high degree of confidence that current manmade CO carbonbased fuel emissions will cause specific quantifiable catastrophic impacts on sea level weather events crops or temperatures  now you are the one in the minority. Because the majority of scientists do not think we know those specific things with a sufficient degree of confidence to justify extremist political and economic prescriptions. That might change in the future and definitely merits ongoing study.Thats where the bait and switch is. Alarmist political partisans assert the majority of scientists agree but then switch out what was actually agreed on  to imply the majority of scientists scientifically support draconian political and economic interventions which very few do. On the basic science you and I are together in the majority with most scientists. But then you continue to go beyond the scientific consensus into unsupported conjecture about catastrophic effects justifying political intervention where there is tremendous scientific uncertainty. On that you are in the minority with a small percentage of activist scientists and political partisans while I remain with the scientific majority  we simply dont have data or confidence sufficient to justify trillions of dollars of economic upheaval or forcing millions of people into energy poverty.

And while I am liberal economically Ill leave that out of it too because I willingly pay more into the government than the value I get out of it and would probably benefit personally more from less taxes than more social services in the short term at least.

9645768,0,t1_da20dj9,Good question. Accidental hash collision are theoretically possible. Their likelihood is dependent on the complexity of the final hash value. What does this mean? To simplify it imagine the hash value produced by the hash function is just a single letter. Thered be tons of collisions between vastly different original sources making such a function completly useless for cryptographic purposes. In practice especially in cryptography hash functions are much more complex than the example I provided. They send the original file through insanely complex functions where only changing a single letter of the original file could severly change the hash value. To give you an example using the outdated MD algorithm heres hash values forgreenwizardneedsfood dbcacaafabdedfgreenwizardneedsfood daabaeddfcfcdfTrying to craft a file that matches the hash value can theoretically still be done but would require a significant amount of computing power. It has been done though. According to Wikipedia in order to crack a MD a collision attack exists that can find collisions within seconds on a computer with a . GHz Pentium  processor. So I guess you can see why MD is considered outdated these days. On a side note hashes are not only for these purposes. Another big appilcation is using them to speed up search functions by creating similar hash values for information of a similar type. Because those functions are less complex it would be much easier to create collisions on purpose. However there would be no real point in doing so since youre not trying to verify some files integrity. Instead youre using the hash values to search some database your managing much quicker.,bestof,da21gp5,8,t5_2qh3v

I wasnt questioning the gender of every character. I wasnt wondering if Han Solo after his breakup was out hookin up with guys. It doesnt matter. It wont change the story except any love interest things. Han solo was not defined by who he loves he was defined as the Captain of the Millennium Falcon a job. Just like so many other characters. They were defined by their actions and their jobs. They dont need to force it into scripts. If you want to make some story about some ordinary people and the main character is a female who has a female SO. Or the guy character has a male SO. Just do it you dont need to break the story.The other problem I have with making Women main characters is that the stories they write for these characters almost always end up with a character who needs help somewhere a long the way. You look at male lead movies and the character stays strong only wavering to a personal believe system and they are given help regardless of whether they need or want it. Women characters are continually written so they struggle and breakdown and need some other characters support to lift them up again. Why can we not have a strong female lead who is sure of themselves? Who gets helped but doesnt NEED help. What comes to mind is black widow from the avengers series. When we first meet her she is super strong no one messes with her no one gets to her she would take on Iron Man and win. Thats her character she grew up not trusting anyone always having to do things on her own. She has her belief system.But as the movies have gone on shes become a weaker character. Shes lost her leadership and solo strength shes just another random female who needs help. In actuality though she could be on par with the likes of Captain America or Iron Man in terms of personal strength and leadership.,bestof,da43c7b,12,t5_2qh3v

They are highly fucking motivated to keep the Assad regime in power and theyre very fucking good at it.A nofly zone will never happen because Russia wants to provide CAS to Assads troops and their own troops allowing them to advance. Yes they have fucking boots on the ground there and you cant have that without air support. Western troops dont have boots on the ground in Syria only in Iraq. Thats the reason the West is losing objectives in Syria btw because the coalition chose an air campaign. If there were SOF running with FSA like we have SOF in Iraq Russia couldnt have done shit.Russia can veto whatever they want in the UN. If the coalition wants to implement a nofly zone without Russias consent  which they wont give  then in order to enforce it they will have to shoot down Russias planes since they are the only other people flying there.

In other words learning chords makes sense but and now to switch analogies because my knowledge of guitar is limited you wouldnt be taught a combination or a form in martial arts or boxing as the same thing as a punch. Sure a  jab sequence is absolutely a fundamental and you should learn it early but its a  jab sequence not its own kind of punch its  jabs in sequence.Same thing.    is not its own thing that should be memorized it is               . And now all you need are your  multiplication tables and this other piece of machinery and you can multiply any two digit numbers not just  and .Oh and that same thing you just learned that fundamental of splitting the  digit numbers up into their components well thats exactly the same way that you multiply polynomials  years down the road.

The election proved that demonstrating economic growth simply doesnt satisfy people who feel theyre getting poorer while a select few are getting richer.  I think the wrong way to fix that sense of dissatisfaction is to fight globalization  because globalization and automation are going to happen anyway. Technology is just going to get better. If democratic nationstates dig in their heels and push antiglobalization policies it just makes them an obstacle that economic forces need to maneuver around in order to do business as easily and profitably as possible. Theyre going to be left behind and their legitimacy as a form of government is going to be less certain.

Over time weve come to learn which local outlets are reliable and which will repeat yesterdays news until the next press briefing by the incident commander. They sometimes pay more attention when homes are burning but they are then reacting to a situation and are kept out of the active firefighting area by firefighters who dont care about our TV viewing habits but care quite a bit about having to stop brush clearing to rescuer a  lbs journalism major and her cameramandriver. When the fire affects places of regional or national importance you get little more information just more cut and paste Yosemite is burning gets headlines and you click because you took a bus tour around the valley as a kid. But Yosemite is a big place and while its all great but if it isnt near Half Dome youre not getting a photograph or a map. I get it covering a fire is much harder than most things.

The pressure of being the only female face in a maledominated room as well as the fear of failing because society says men are better at this  as well as simply the general daunting nature of learning a new thing for any gender  can you see how the cumulative effect might discourage all but the most determined? Thats okay for the Marines but a bike repair class doesnt need to be survival of the fittest. Its the same for all people too not just women and minorities. A boy might want to learn ballet but be discouraged because people say thats for girls there are no other boys in the class  in that case why shouldnt a dance studio offer a ballet class for boys where they know boys will be supported with no fear they will be mocked or stand out in the room?The issue is so many people will read an example like this and immediately respond with Thats dumb. They should just do it anyway etc. That might well be true from a purely logical standpoint but it doesnt change human nature.Its the same thing when people talk about cutting welfare and when someone points out that children would suffer they say well people shouldnt have kids they cant afford!. Yes obviously and that can be discouraged but humans are fallible and it will never go away completely. Similarly when unmarried mothers were shunned and no abortions were available did it stop women getting knocked up out of wedlock? Hell no. Thats humans for you. What Im saying is if theyre going to be at all effective our responses to human issues need to take human nature into account.

If youre not interested in it then you dont have to touch it with a  foot pole.Also dont worry about the common its too late to catch up. A new player thats literally a day old can completely negate a  year old player in a very expensive ship in fleet fights.One example is the maulus a sensor dampening ship. Basically what it does is make other ships target slower or less far. If youre flying one as a day old character you can for instance reduce someones targeting range for . Imagine youre fighting people that have some logi healing ships with them. Those logi will want to be as far away from the fight as possible to survive suddenly they have to either get  closer well within range of your friends in the fleet to shoot him or stay out of range to heal his buddies. mil ship piloted by a day old character versus a  year old character flying a mil ship and hes useless.

9954540,0,t1_db52gwz,Non player character NPC player vs player pvp in game currency can be purchased legitimately with real money by buying in game items that act as monthly subscriptions  and then sold on the in game market at fluctuating market prices set by demand and supply curves from actual players so real money trading is something of a problem for the game.  Eves regions are composed of three sections the center is hi Sec where generally if you shoot another random player security from the game will come and murder you really fast but not so fast that you cant sometimes suicide into people in hi Sec low sec you can shoot other players without generating a security response except from space stations and space gates nullsec anyone can shoot anyone anytime for any reason and no game generated response will stop them. A key feature of eve is that when you die you lose your ship you were in and all the stuff in your cargo hold forever. Its gone no take backs no respawn with your stuff. There are concrete lasting consequences to dying.  Lower level ships can be insured by buying in game insurance but it only pays out the cost of the hull and not of any of the equipment so you still take a loss of in game currency.  Higher level ships are also insurance but the payout after losing it is a small fraction of the cost of the unequipped ship and usually an even smaller fraction of the total cost of equipment and ship put together.  When you die your pilot escapes in a small escape pod and can run away unless its caught through some game mechanics at that point your pilot can be easily killed where you have the potential to actually lose levels also higher level pilots will often have expensive implants in their pilots causing them to lose even more money.  Its an unforgiving game. ,bestof,db53o3s,1,t5_2qh3v

So dont assume that because I said Im a pilot that means I dont know anything about procurement or management  we are responsible for the whole spectrum of planesIn fact its when non experts chime in  like with Congress  that things go to shit like demanding a  mm cannon on the F and then deciding to not retire the A and then complaining about costs ballooning So your analogy would be like being an R rider who happened to work in engineering and development of motorcycles and working with people who are all riders and then having a new CEO come in who has never ridden or even studied a motorcycle and tell you that you need a new ride,bestof,dbjg5dw,24,t5_2qh3v

Turn that into a political system and eventually those you agree with will be tearing it apart just as much as those you dont all in the name of protecting it. I pretty much agree with what youre saying I disagree with most of those policies but its far from a comprehensive list. I didnt vote for Trump. I dont like him stacking his cabinet with billionaires. I might not like anything he does for the next four years. But I recognize hes a reaction. People saw Clinton as the embodiment of a corrupt system so they went outside that system. People can smell bullshit I honestly think Clinton could have won if she just owned up to her baggage and didnt try to spin her shit as not smelling. Once it became more about her than her policies she lost. Clinton was a shit candidate. Trump was a shit candidate. My problem is that the current system protects people like them. We know these candidates were shit but we rally around them anyway if they have the right letter next to their name. . We spend so much time worrying about the other side we dont keep our own house clean. So thats why I moved out. Forget the politicians. Republican or Democrat they rarely keep their promises anyway. Party platforms are like the bible everyone quotes it no one follows it. As voters we need to drop the guard finally. Stop spinning for these politicians.

Humphrey an edge in the  bunfight. On Oct.   he ordered Haldeman to monkey wrench the initiative.Leaving aside that this cache of notes reveals fuckall  What initiative? As this LichSu points out every assessment of Nixons purported actions in this affair are absurdly Americacentric. People are so wrapped up in this idea that Nixon prevented peace talks  he prolonged the war that it is outright rejected the fact that at that stage these werent peace talks at all they were surrender talks.gtthe OP seems to indicate that neither side of the Vietnam conflict was ready for any kind of agreement.Not so North Vietnam were ready to agree the following  America get the fuck out. South Vietnam prepare your anus. We gon have a massacre.The US had nothing to offer them at that stage  nothing. From the article in questiongtHenry A. Kissinger then an outside Republican adviser had called alerting Nixon that a deal was in the works If Johnson would halt all bombing of North Vietnam the Soviets pledged to have Hanoi engage in constructive talks to end a war that had already claimed  American lives.The inconvenient truth being that Johnson had already halted bombing of North Vietnam  which is the chief reason why the communists had no reason to negotiate with him. He had already given them everything they wanted.

Dont get me wrong I understand the emotional aspect of the argument but if the idea is that abortion would be illegal after the point that the fetus has rights how do you throw those rights away because they were conceived by rape?

10217236,0,t3_5m6cnw,This post is  hours old so I dont think it will get much exposure but Im gonna put this out there anyway.  I really really hate how abortion is looked at as a political issue.  It is NOT a political issue.  Its only something that is between a woman her partner and her doctor.  Thats it.  Not a congressman not a president and especially not an uneducated dolt who believes abortion is baby killing should ever have a say in whether or not a woman can terminate her pregnancy for any reason.All these far right religious nut jobs think that the word of their god should determine what choice a woman has with her body.  Whatever happened to the word of the founding fathers that these people seem to idolize so much?  Separation of Church and State?  Do they just selectively ignore that part?  They think theyre so fucking special that they get to choose the fate of not one but two lives that will literally never effect them ever.  As the OP said only  abortions last year were third trimester and all of them happened because the baby or the mother was literally going to die without it.  Im not looking it up because I dont think that I need to approve of any reason why a woman wouldnt want to go through an unwanted pregnancy but Im sure that the vast majority of the rest of last years abortions were done for completely legitimate and moral reasons.  Imagine a world so backwards and Draconian that a pregnant woman has to die because of a malfunction in her pregnancy that she legally cant abort.  What a fucking joke.And now all of the Republicans in our government want to completely defund and abolish Planned Parenthood because of this abortion bullshit.  Oh our tax dollars are going toward baby killing!  We need to stop this!  Do you know how much of the funding they use for abortions?  THREE PERCENT.  Thats it.   goes to STD treatment and prevention  to contraception  to womens health and  for cancer screening.  So they want to take away all of these very needed and affordable services away from women because of their religious views?  If they really want to shove their retarded views down our throats they should just tell Planned Parenthood theyre not allowed to give abortions anymore and instead use that  of funding for plane tickets to a country where the people who are in charge dont use fucking religious text and backwards morals to write their laws.  Dont take away affordable womens health services.  Again what a fucking joke.,bestof,dc26jdw,6,t5_2qh3v

Bennett moved the team to his home of Oklahoma City and changed the name to Thunder despite having another year lease for the arena causing him to fork over  million to break it.

A great example is that college rapist who ended up serving no time at all in prison. Has the US even really focused on rehabilitation in prisons?

Heres a summary of the term Ad HominemArgumentum ad hominem from the Latin to the person is an informal logical fallacy that occurs when someone attempts to refute an argument by attacking the source making it rather than the argument itself. The fallacy is a subset of the genetic fallacy as it attacks the source of the argument which is irrelevant to to the truth or falsity of the argument. An ad hominem should not be confused with an insult which attacks the person but does not seek to rebut the persons argument.  Of note if the subject of discussion is whether somebody is credible  eg believe X because I am Y  then it is not an ad hominem to criticize their qualifications.,bestof,dcmd7mx,1,t5_2qh3v

10460316,1,t1_dctq06t,I think that this particular stat has way too many flaws to use because this book is from  so the asked people had to be atleast  to be relevant. People in bigger cities like Berlin or Dresden wouldnt talk about stuff they knew to the same degree people in villages would talk about this stuff to each other. But  most people in the big cities would die while german people in villages had a higher chance to not die through bombs and not get killed by an invasion army because they arent as big of a threat as people in a cityvillages were way easier to observe than cities. The next point is that it is more likely to survive such an invasion if you know it is coming and you have time and knowledge how to prepare yourself a lot of higher nazis went to south america.There is also the flaw that german people that had to live through all this without knowledge just think they know it first hand because all the stuff they heardlearned in the last  years.But what we know from the newspapers radio and tv records is that the germans never made this stuff public and for most people the newspaper and radio were the only way to get information. Even now in a world with the world wide web availabe for almost everyone more than  of people have no real information about politics or stuff like Guantanamo. Most have ideas and suspicions and thats it.I havent read that book and it sounds really interesting but I would be careful with these stats because they can be flawed.,bestof,dcts6ud,-3,t5_2qh3v

10497012,0,t1_dcxtwg8,Oh for sure! Youre right. But that kind of songwriter is a rare breed in contemporary pop music. As far as composition Ed Sheeran has a lot in common with Taylor Swift. But for some reason these guys did something that other songwriters didnt do and made it in the pop world.I dont know why that is. Respect for a musicians influence and interaction with their own music is a subjective thing. To some people it means the world and to others it means nothing. I think the artists narrative informs that perception. If someone hates Kanyes persona theyre more than likely going to lean into the argument of Oh but he has teams of people writing his songs! Whereas if youre a huge fan of Kanye youre basically going to say the same thing but with the positively skewed implication that while he may not be as hands on hes adopted this new musical role as a director which is equally as important. Its pretty obvious that I  subscribe to the latter opinion. I dont know. The question you pose is one that is truly hard to answer. And I think about it every single day of my life. I mean there are so many great smaller artists who do have a greater involvement with their music who I think should be pop superstars. But that is because I get caught in a trap of thinking Oh well they masterminded every element of their music from the composition to the lyrics to the art work to the production to the mixing etc etc  so they DESERVE it. But then it just descends into a never ending thought spiral on the psuedophilosophical quandary of Does anyone deserve anything? and What does it mean to deserve something?Beyond that you have to remind yourself that you only think that any given artist deserves to be bigger in your own mind because their musicart resonated with you in a profound way aka HOW COME NO ONE ELSE UNDERSTANDS HOW AWESOME THIS IS?! Not everyones gonna like everything. It might not resonate with others. But thats the beauty of pop its music that is almost scientifically designed to be pleasing and irresistible. What youre describing is kind of maddening to think about. You have to consider countless intangible factors in order to understand why it all works.

I know this is a sensitive topic and people may think Im picking on your wording honestly Im not even from the USA but this is critical to building a case against anyone especially the President. If you want to convict someone of treason you need to bring in hard evidence to prove they are in fact committing an act of treason.

The Trump dossier indicated that one of Trumps advisers Carter Page was offered the opportunity to broker the sale if he promised to get Trump to ease off on the sanctions.Though Mr. Page was interested he didnt commit to anything and it looks like the deal fell through Russia instead had to rely on last minute funding from Qatar and Singapore to finance the deal. Whether or not Trump purchased any part of the newly privatized stake in Rosneft is unknown but its a reach. To my original point though the idea that Trump was offered the entire . stake is absolutely false.Seriously dont let your distaste for the man make you go full tin foil.

Muslims are about  of Canadas population compared to  in the United States. However the US population overall is about  times larger so obviously you are going to have more incidents there. gtWhat is your definition of a terror attack? A brown Muslim man with beard killing people? Would you count SC church shooting as terror attack? How about Colorado theater shooting? Sandy Hook shooting? For that matter all the hundreds of shootingskillings by white non muslim people?Terror attacks have specific definitions and some of the above I would consider terror attacks but some arent if they are motivated by mental illness instead of ideology. As I said the Muslim population of the US is about . So the fact that they are responsible for about half of all terror killings since  and the overwhelming majority if you include  means that they are greatly overrepresented in terror statistics. ,bestof,ddc2v8p,1,t5_2qh3v

Why is it that when its an inner city black man whos addicted to crack and robs a convenience store its all about how society has failed him and the result of his environment and that they have an obligation to improve his lot but when its about my cousin Cletus who is addicted to meth and drives his truck into building because hes been awake for three days they make fun of his teeth?Liberal Americans have a shockingly specific sense of empathy it seems. And it cant all be chalked up to antagonistic behaviour from white working class religious and rural communities. Mostly because a lot of the time there isnt a lot of antagonism. And also because those same inner city communities have plenty of antagonism towards the college educated white Liberals pulling this shit.The antagonism between the poor urban and the poor rural populations are pretty straightforward though.But it seems like the people who should be most capable of trying to reconcile this issues with their values on cooperation and compromise and respecting personal values and their higher level of education and the supposed critical thinking skills that are supposed to come along with it regardless of taking the Humanities or STEM are instead making it worse in order to discredit values that dont align with theirs by assassinating the character of rural and white working class communities instead of addressing the reasoning and context that lies behind their different values.Its very frustrating and it makes a part of me feel like while white working class and rural American voters dont really deserve Trump despite voting for him Liberal Americans kind of do as a sort of comeuppance for their arrogance and hypocrisy. It shall be a test for America to weather the Trump Presidency. And the Liberal Americans have got to start getting their shit together and focusing on what gets results instead of what is easier to do or else well I dont want to doomsay but I dont think it will be good.,bestof,ddo72s8,3,t5_2qh3v

Russia doesnt even have the means to export that oil either its part of the reason they took Chrimea why theyre becoming buddy buddy with Turkey and why theyre sponsoring rebels in the Ukraine. Mostly the crux of the issue is that Putin is a dangerous man who is about at the end of his rope in terms of maintaining political power in Russia.

Repairs would still be ugly unless you find an electrician or plumber willing to fix it in a manner similar to initial construction. Theyd make you pay out the nose though. But if you do it right the first time then you probably wont encounter a situation where you ever need repairs so long as you fix the minor problems when they arise. ,bestof,de799my,5,t5_2qh3v

They get paid the same if you live or die. If you have to take outdated methods to treat cancer and have unbearable side effects or top of the line treatments it doesnt matter to them they will give you whatever is easiest for them and move on. You can have some very BAD doctors in a socialized system that never get weeded out.I have seen this in Canada I have seen this happen to friends and family. Yes there are good doctors in Canada but they are full. America would absolutely suffer if they went socialized it would be like what is happening in Canada magnified.

10976952,0,t1_debxxxb,You struck a major chord with me here... story time.My mothers teeth started falling out when I was in my late teens. Not because she didnt take care of them maybe she could of done better she did smoke but because the amount of painkillers  she had been on for the majority of my life had caused her teeth to quite literally rot in mouth. Side effects from medications grinding dry mouth etc.  Those were the easiest days of her addiction for us both. This was before her body started feeling it. My mother was in a bad car wreck when I was a baby and at some point they quit trying to fix her. They put rods through her body and then just prescribed her all the pain meds she she needed. She knew she was addicted by the time I took the role of caretaker and distributor of her medicine. She asked me not to blame her when I refused her an extra pain pill. She begged me to forgive her for hitting me and telling me I didnt love her because I couldnt find it in myself to help her when she was in pain. My  pound mother was taking  separate types of pain killers  muscle relaxer  nerve pill a heavy antidepressant and antianxiety pill when she decided that she needed help. She was always in pain and was always going to be in pain but stopped trusting the people who had long ago Just started handing her prescriptions to take. My uncle had committed suicide years earlier off of a relapse where they prescribed him pain pills and he couldnt handle the withdrawals again. This wasnt going to be her fate. The last time I saw my mom alive was dropping her off at a pain clinic at the height of her self recovery. She was finally getting better and the world was hers for the taking. She died  days later from a massive heart attack. They told me her body was so weak that her heart just gave out. Im terrified of the DR now. I spend a lot of my time sick because Im so afraid and angry. Its a huge insecurity of mine because Im afraid Ill lose myself. ,bestof,dec7zru,9,t5_2qh3v

11040425,0,t3_5xml70,Since the original post was edited here is what OP saidLast weekend February  I was a little pressed for time all weekend so I used Instacart to have my groceries delivered. I knew that Instacart always added a delivery fee and a service fee and there was an optional tip. I also knew that at some stores if you shopped there the prices would be higher through Instacart than in the store. I was using Market Basket so the app and site told me that prices would be  higher than instore.Of course I was pressed for time and needed groceries for the week. So I bit the bullet and ordered. The only difference is that when I got my order I realized that Instacart left the instore receipt. Id used them a handful of times before and never got one so I figured Id use this opportunity to see what the Instacart tax really is. And I was totally blown away.The subtotal before tax on the instore receipt was .. Instacarts item subtotal before taxes and fees was .. This was a difference of . or .. I knew that prices would be higher than in the store  the siteapp even told me so. However I was anticipating a  markup not a  markup.I also noticed the difference in tax. The store charged a tax of .. Instacart charged a tax of .. Thats a difference of .. Not much but it appears that Instacart charges tax on their postmarkup prices. It also appears that they may include the Instacart prices for items plus their delivery fee when computing taxes. That seems suspicious but Im no where near familiar enough with how state and local taxes work in groceries to know for sure.Instacart also added a . service fee. I believe that this is a  charge. Again this is on the Instacart computed total and not the instore total. If you search for instacart service fee you can learn more. Apparently this was a rather controversial fee that upset shoppers and confused customers since its not a tip and doesnt go directly to the shopper or driver taking care of your order.Instacart also added a . delivery fee. This fluctuates based on time of day. Busier hours have a larger delivery fee it seems.At this point the store cost me .. Instacart is now up to . after taxes and fees. This is a difference of . or . I added a  tip honestly the shoppers deserve it especially shopping in a grocery store on a Sunday for me which brought my Instacart total to . for an . grocery bill or a difference of ..Lets look at specific items now.Pork chops were . in store and . in Instacart for an increase of .. Tilapia filet were . in store and . on Instacart for an increase of .. Large white eggs were . in store and . on Instacart for an increase of .. Market Basket brand mouthwash was . in store and . on Instacart for an increase of . Russet potatoes were . in store and Instacart charged me . for an increase of . this is likely an outlier  the other items were adjusted by the weight purchased the potatoes were never adjusted.Now a small number of items were cheaper. I saved . . on onions and . . on bananas. Two cans of pineapple juice were also the same price in store as on Instacart.I do want to be very clear. Im not antiInstacart. They can save time and Ive never had a problem with the shopper or driver when Ive used the service the handful of times that I have. However it seems like how they do their charging is very deceptive to customers. Saying that items will be  more than in store isnt wrong when you charge . more than in store but I dont think very many people will realize how much more they are paying. Plus when I emailed their support to ask about the high markup on some items they even admitted I received the instore receipt in error  they dont want customers to be able to price check and do what I was able to do probably because they are deceptive on the price increases.In short  Instacart may not always be worth your time. For me the time spent in a grocery store for a weekly shopping trip is about  minutes plus the time it takes to get there. This past week it was worth it for me to pay .  tip for someone to do my shopping for me. However now that I know this true cost Ill probably be more likely to try to find the time to go shopping before I place an order with Instacart.Photos of the receipts and screencaps of the Instacart receipts ,bestof,dejev9i,18,t5_2qh3v

You cant just split everything up into pretty buckets because our entire world experience IS affected by everything around us. Religion affects scientific belief war affects mathematical advancement geological activity affects engineering marvels. And honestly to insist on simply keeping math in math is to do an injustice to education and understanding the real picture.  Personally I LOVE learning about things like Creationism as much as I love learning about anything else that expands my world view and simply teaches me about the world I live in. When I was taught about any other religion or religious view it was taught very objectively and not trying to swindle me into their ranks.Creationism does have a place in that broader picture. In providing context for understanding the whys and the whats. I find it concerning that people insist on teaching our kids fewer things. Like exposing them to the idea of Creationism is going to corrupt them so we must hide it like porn or drugs. Teach them. Empower them with knowledge. Let them understand that people believe things that are very different from their own beliefs and its part of what makes us so diverse. Teach them to respect that diversity because its one of the most precious things we have  the freedom to believe in whatever crazy cooked up or perfectly logical things we want. ,bestof,deolwsh,-2,t5_2qh3v

Both professions offer different rewards you get into engineering because you know its bank you dont get into teaching for the money. You might do it because you like children. One of the main reasons teachers  are predominately female ish percent I believe. So in the end choices affect your pay and some jobs offer more monetary value then others particularly those that have a harder curriculum and are in higher demand. P.S. I should have worded my first reply better as the confusion seems to arise from the word value which is quite abstract. Teaching can be more valuable to individuals that feel a greater urgency to care give and can feed those rewards in an emotional fashion instead of monetary. ,bestof,depjhnr,1,t5_2qh3v

The problem is that some people on both sides think the entire  cents is down to discrimination which it is not. Its not biological either. If you look at Nordic countries the wage gap is close to nonexistentcompared to the US. This is due to a number of factors like equal paternitymaternity leave but also because there is less pressure on both boys and girls to choose genderstereotypical professions.To be honest I dont care about all that much about equality it is of course important but what I care far more about is the advancement of society and to do that you need to efficiently use brainpower.

They answer mostly to no one but themselves. gt In what other market is the market price of a good only known by the buyer and not the seller?This is a bad analogy. Again this stems to a philosophical belief of how a business should function but employees are simply no different than a screwdriver or a wrench when it comes to a business. They are tools to generate profit. Employees are not selling anything they are ultimately tools to generate profits for the company and the are compensated for their skill time and work. Whether they are compensated enough comes down to assuming minimum wage is met ultimately the employee and how much they think they are worth.   gtThis fucks the job market up badly.Not particularly. If a business compensates badly in a job market with few applicants and a lot of jobs supply and demand theyll have a tough time filling that position.

Like if my friend was alive hed be mocking every word she said as stupid bullshit so what the fuck is she doing giving a homily at his funeral? This funeral is about him not fucking Jesus. I dont need to hear about the way the truth and the light while my friends body sits in a box. Most of our group of friends are atheist and so we discussed it afterward about how thoroughly inappropriate it was. At the very least one of our friends was in control of the music played so the minister got to walk off to one of the decedents favorite metal songs. She seemed a little put out about it.I dont understand even if his parents were religious how that was at all comforting. It makes me think my mother is at least a little religious but my father is not at all.

This came to a head when Apple sued Microsoft for many of those very same technologies and Xerox came back in a said wait you cant sue someone else for our invention! and promptly sued Apple.in the end The courts threw out both Apple v Microsoft and Xerox v Apple claiming that these technologies were so simple ideas for computing that they couldnt be copyrighted.Heck that Apple v Microsoft battle went on for nearly a decade until Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy. ,bestof,deu36j0,2,t5_2qh3v

Emerging oversupply is a serious problem  this helps explain why just recently BIS Oxford Economics published a study showing  of apartments in Brisbane have sold at a loss since  as have a shocking  of apartments in Melbourne.gtAustralias market offers some major and increasingly politically contentious investment incentives  negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions and these in concert have made investment in housing extremely popular extending a boom into a bubble since at least  if you include the boom since the early s. Unfortunately without capital gains negative gearing may burst the bubble as people will effectively be holding lossmaking assets. Interestonly loans are also a huge problem comprising up to  of investor loans  and as banks have started hiking rates up to twice a month recently this is worrying.

The average median multiple nationwide puts median house prices at around x median household incomes over  in Melbourne.

But the number of people here on Earth is pretty large and if you assume that computer power will eventually get to the point where running a simulation of the universe is possible then the number of people running simulations could be pretty large. It could even be to the point where its like playing the Sims only the characters in the game are self aware and think its real.gtSo in summary... Some people think the number of advanced civilizations out there is pretty small but if any advanced civilization manages to create computers that can model the universe which they see as almost inevitable then the number of fake universes would be really big. Because of this they say its far more likely that were living in a fake universe than the real one.Heres a good article by Nick Bostrom on the topic.If you prefer video heres a min clip.Heres a good article on why theyre wrong.,bestof,dfp5p59,12,t5_2qh3v

The writing comedy wise isnt nearly as good as in Rick and Morty but it has very well written characters and gets surprisingly real at times. Both BH and Rick and Morty are two of my favorite shows but theyre not that similar except for how they both can get pretty dark and nihilistic.  It takes a couple of episodes to get accustomed to the characters but once you do its really great. You cant really introduce it with a clip cause its much slower and more emotional.The funniest part for me is often the background gags that you barely notice if youre not paying attention. One of my favorites is when Mr Peanutbutter who is a golden retriever opens his trunk and its completely full of tennis balls.

At no point is he holding more than his own bodyweight and holding on to a vertical pole with good friction for a few seconds is pretty simple. The whole maneuver is definitely very cool and impressive but not because of the strength involved.Edit for your editgtHolding on with your own body weight would be if you werent moving at all. This guy is going up which increases the relative downward force as hes accelerating upward.Moving at constant speed upwards is not accelerating and will not require him to use any more force to hold on. Sure theres acceleration as he goes from standing still to moving but thats only at the very beginning when hes basically leaning on the pole. Im actually surprised at how constant they manage to keep the speed with which they raise the pole. When I said holding I was also referring to the force he has to grip the pole with. Youll notice he has the pole under his armpit therefore basically resting on the pole while it is more horizontal. As the pole approaches vertical he has to use more force to grip the pole. When the pole is completely vertical he is holding his bodyweight. At no point before that does he have to grip on to the pole with more force than that required to hold his own bodyweight.This is awesome but it is not a crazy feat of strength.,bestof,dg04zgb,-2,t5_2qh3v

11513487,0,t1_dg10b5z,No problem at all! Always happy to help a fellow practitioner. That being said Im not actually sure how much use my advice will be because its essentially trust your gut. I happen to be of the belief that therapy is something of an art form. That is to say regardless of trainingand thats not to say trainingeducation is uselessthe effectiveness of therapists in my experience has a lot to do with their raw talent for empathy. A good gauge for this is probably how much you actually enjoy talking to your patients and what you enjoy about it. If you enjoy your work you will likely be good at it and you will be particularly good at the aspects you most enjoy. To be more concrete I suppose I would say that empathy is actually just an act of imaginationits fundamentally just imagining what it must be like to be another person. The limitation it necessarily meets is that you can only work with your own experiences to paint that picture and yet no one has the entire color palette in their personal inventory. As such its critically important that you bear in mind that no matter how talented you feel you are as a therapist you can still only barely scratch the surface of another persons inner world. If you consider your own mental experience and presume that everyone elses is just as rich and varied and then compare that with your perception of them I think youll realize that your conception of who they are is always a cheap caricature which pales in comparison to the true breadth of their mind. If you can just keep this fact in mind and allow it to keep you humble you will have avoided many of the pitfalls that many therapists fall into despite their best intentions. If youre looking for something more specific I can say that different disorder types reflect very different mental states in the brain and you should strive to make sure youre reasonably familiar with at least three of them depression anxiety and psychosis. Depression The biggest mistake I see both practitioners and laypeople make with regards to depression is thinking it is merely feeling sad. Depression is far more than that. The most prominent feature of it is actually the lower energy state compared to others. Depressives have littletono motivation and often feel tired for no discernible reason. Also while many depressed people will be able to give you specific reasons for their depression some cant and the presence or absence of a rationale is sometimes a good indicator as to whether or not a persons depression is principally caused by their circumstanceslife experiences or more biologicalgenetic factors. Regardless though understand this the core of feature of a truly depressed mind is not emotional pain or lossits meaninglessness. Personal hardships and losses can be catalysts for depression but the core of it is always a loss of purpose or sense of meaning in life as a result. The hardest part about working with depressives is accepting that they may never be able to sustain the same degree of realistic optimism you have for them. Failure to be patient with them results in frustration and blaming them for not being committed to the therapy or for having setbacks. Finally I have found that respecting the accuracy of a depressives worldview is actually quite helpful. Sometimes just acknowledging that life truly does suck as much as they think it does gives them enough relief to start considering what theyre going to do in spite of that. Anxiety Anxiety and depression often overlap but while it is common to see people suffering from both it is fairly critical to be able to determine which one theyre suffering from more as its usually not an even mix. Whereas depressives exhibit a lack of energy andor lethargy anxious people exhibit an excess of it but in a way that is clearly not enjoyable for them as opposed to mania which is similarly high energy but often far more enjoyable for the patient. The principal feature of anxiety is worry or uncertainty. Anxious people anticipate future problems and obsess over them trying to predict or control variables that they simply cannot. The trick to treating them is helping them realize and accept that they are not in control and never will beand that that is actually okay. Anxious people tend to distrust their ability to improvise and solve problems on the fly no matter how capable they are at actually doing so. Directing their attention towards past instances in which theyve coped with unforeseen adversity can help them with this. In the short term i.e. patients struggling with panic attacks teaching them easily employable coping skills is very beneficial. If you havent familiarized yourself with at least a rudimentary level of meditation I would suggest you do so seriously one or two classes or just doing a little research is sufficient. Elements of CBT are also phenomenally good at treating the immediate effects of depression and anxiety. Psychosis  The Big One. Psychosis is an utterly alien state of mind and very hard to empathize with completely. I would strongly suggest looking up videos of psychotics describing their own mental experiences if you want an unfiltered perspective. The overt features of psychosis are typically hallucinations paranoia delusions and disordered thinkingspeech but those are just the surface signs of something much more complex going on beneath. I have heard a schizophrenic describe their own mind as a kind of catacombs or labyrinth in which they are lost amidst familiar but disconnected imagery. A fellow practitioner once described it with the analogy of being adrift in a river full of rapidsones thoughts are so chaotic and random that as soon as something comparatively solid comes along they cling to it like a piece of drift wood. Psychotic minds are extremely associativemoving from thought to thought based on entirely subjective seemingly random connections in their own brain treating them often requires that you learn these connections through trial and error and then help guide them to solid ground based on that understanding. Concrete things are vastly more helpful to psychotics than mosthaving a daily routine and familiar and predictable environments is profoundly helpful for them. Finally because psychosis is so poorly understood by most people you will find that psychotic patients you develop a good rapport with begin to become hugely reliant on you and may demand more of your time than you are able to give. Do NOT overextend yourself simply because you are aware they need someone. Part of them learning how to cope with their condition is finding people other than you to rely upon. There are obviously more mental states than just these three but I honestly think these are the most likely youll be to run into assuming a relatively varied environment. Finally I will share with you the advice my first supervisor gave me when I was beating myself up over having made a rookie mistake with a patientif you harass yourself over every little failing in your work you will burn out and be unable to care for your other patients. You need to be able to forgive yourself for making mistakes because honestly youre going to make a fuckton of them. Accept this you will fail with some of your clients. You will inadvertently mistreat them fail to empathize offend them insult them which may result in them quitting treatment or even killing themselves. If you take that burden on yourself you will succumb to depression or anxiety and you will be useless to your patients and potentially harmful. Do not expect yourself to be the perfect therapist or anywhere close to it. Again you are going to fuck up a lot. Get used to failure. Learn from your mistakes and move on. If you can do this not only will you be preserving your own mental health you will be setting the proper example for your patients as well. I hope some of that is helpful.

Whether or not a mass popular uprising of the armed populous could take on the US military and win its obvious that the small subset of that population known as the black panther could not.To the extent that the black panthers were able to use guns effectively it was because the government was already sympathetic to there general cause.,bestof,dgky90b,3,t5_2qh3v

I know you said you dont want to get into it right now but youre going to have to at some point if you want to convince regular people of the validity of your movement. Communism if youve read a history book was just as brutally oppressive as fascism. It too resulted in tens of millions of deaths. And anarchy anarchy is a farce. No sane individual would want to live in an anarchist society. Suffice to say though a true anarchist society is fundamentally impossible. People tend to disagree on things they will find likeminded people and form their own separate societies. Those societies will form their own hierarchies with written rules and laws.

It doesnt mean that over time you will get a superior organism or that the conditions wont change see atmosphere of planet and then this creature that has developed for millions of years doesnt just die. People often conflate evolution with better over time. Or smarter over time. This isnt true Evolution over a very long period simply asserts that the most fit organism will be the one thats still kicking. In a given environment with given resources etc. fit can mean any number of things and doesnt correlate to sophistication or intellectual capacity. It could be that old ideas we have discarded from yesteryear say slavery come back into vogue again due to some cataclysm or upheaval that changes the parameters of our existence on this planet. We dropped slavery not because of suddenly developing a conscious or becoming enlightened but because it was a less efficient method of production. Technology advanced to the point where it was no longer a cost effective option.So I view the free exchange of ideas in a very darwinian way. Survival of the fittest. You can tear down debate analyze and dissect the ideas without having to always go through the extremely expensiveresource intensive of asserting your will through blood shed or force. Theres a cost there. This goes back up to but isnt it all subjective? sure but the more we dont reset the clock and kill each other the more data we have to work with and analyze an idea.

You have everything from straight up Boo Trump picket signs to meaningless topical jokes that have the thinnest connection at all to science.The goalposts have changed significantly from the intended message. Like the womens march from earlier this year people have taken to politicizing the demonstrations in a way that doesnt even feed back into the issue of science. And people yet defend these politicizations by claiming that politics and science are intertwined. True though that may be there is little discussion if at all of science within politics. All there is is political conflict with a sprinkle of science on the side to give the march legitimacy.So no need to preach to me about impressionable children when the only real difference between being against or for the march is which political agenda you choose to shove down your kids throats.,bestof,dgn0nmf,2,t5_2qh3v

Whenever someone makes an argument against the existence of God that can be summed up as how can God fill in the blank if he is fill in the blank? then a perfectly reasonable response is the book of Job.And believe me I understand that this can also be perceived as the granddaddy of all cop outs.

God allowed something to happen not because hes insecure but because he knew there was a bigger picture to this challenge. It wasnt about Job. It was about all mankind. He allowed Satan to test Job because he was very secure in Jobs faith.

11736437,0,t1_dgqbogj,gtGod isnt flexing his muscles. He isnt talking about power at all though I admit this is the first impression it gives because humans tend to view everything through the lens of power. If you look at the words God is talking about knowingI think this is objectivelt wrong God explicitly talks about both his power and his knowledge in Job he talks about where he can go what he can see and contrasts human weakness using leviathan and Behemoth as an example he brags how powerful these creatures are and that man cannot stand against even those creatures yet he created those thingsgtNo one is fierce enough to rouse it. Who then is able to stand against me? Who has a claim against me that I must pay?  Everything under heaven belongs to me.I think you are reading what you want into the text rather than what it says. gtAlso the Book of Job is not a work of apologetics nor is it a book of philosophy so to try and demand that it speak to the problem of evil is setting yourself up for disappointment. Im not the one who uses it to justify the problem of evil I have however been in several long discussions where people do just that including yourself you said gtAnd yet it logically comes to the conclusion that based on the scenario presented in the first two chapters there must be some greater mystery that resolves the conflict between the existing love of God and the existing suffering of the world....gtThe Bible as a whole argues that the desire to know and understand God is impossible not just because humans are flawed but because they are simply inadequate to the task.This usually comes up at some point in the conversation I have to ask then how do you know god has good intentions for us? If gods will is so mysterious and his intentions so unknowable we by definitions cannot conclude that god has our best interests at heart.gthow arrogant am I to expect God to fit into my understanding before I will consider approaching him?its not about fathoming the whole existence of god its about god being consistent with his purported characteristics. If the god of the bible appears to consistently do things which you would not expect from an all powerful all loving all knowing god then it is perhaps time to look at your definition of god.gtI honestly feel like a lot of your questions cant be answered by this bookIts a discussion about gods moral int he book of Job it necessarily has to be based around this book.gt If youd like Im happy to accept PMsId rather converse on here but thank you for your offer.gtI would encourage you to stay thirsty and hold onto this passion that I sense from you.And I would in turn encourage you to look at your own preconceptions about gods character and the contradictions therein perhaps read the bible with an air of scepticism and see how it change if it were written by ancient people desperately trying to make sense of a chaotic world. ,bestof,dgqcsa5,3,t5_2qh3v
