568329,0,t3_20ls74,Im glad we didnt accept an invitation to a lowend postseason tournament. After the emotional way the CAA tournament ended that felt like a natural end to our season. I dont think playing in a basically meaningless tournament would be a good way to end the season. ,williamandmary,cg4vhib,2,t5_2s6lm
938234,0,t1_chax2ng,I am not saying they shouldnt expect. I am saying that it seems based on this story it sounds like places like the US are already so much more progressed on stuff like this compared to what I am used to or even people in places like the US  generations ago that OP should sort of feel better and relieved that most of the road of for him is already behind them. Its like when you feel poor and you read international newpapers about poverty in Africa and then you feel better  it is all about comparison and perspective.,williamandmary,chaxl30,1,t5_2s6lm

11161450,0,t3_5zcsp6,WampM requires you to have  credits obtained at the College itself just an FYI. Not sure if your current schedule will have you on track for that.  credits especially with upperlevel classes will probably be tough to juggle on its own let alone with a job. Its certainly doable but you might want to talk with an academic advisor about just what it entails. You could also try your best to spread the worst of the classes of your classes out so youre not stuck with  credits that are even harder than you expected  idk how exactly your major requirements are but if all you need is creditsgeneds you should be able to balance everything within reason.,williamandmary,dex4zub,5,t5_2s6lm
