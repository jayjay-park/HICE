41874,0,t3_1ul1in,I usually use the cup transfer method. My small porcelain cups bring the water down about C when hot water is poured into them. When making delicate green teas that require C water I pour into three cups and then brew. You can get more accurate measurements by experimenting once with a  USD food thermometer but after that initial experiment you can do it all by intuition.The other intuitive method is by looking at the size of the bubbles.

122546,0,t1_cesdgb2,No worries and let me go look.Okay Im back.  I know in a flash right?  Anyway.This is from a cursory glance and not having any firsthand experience with their pots.The three yixing pots that I saw listed were all made from the zisha clay.  The purple sand clay is not as highly sought after as the original zhu ni and is not quite as good.  Its still a great material but it isnt the rust color nor will it be exactly the same.The red one they have concerns me though.  I doubt that there is any risk but it is unlikely that it is actual zisha clay as it is far too red to be that way.  Which means the manufacturer is either altering the color with chemicals andor additives or is actually using hong ni clay which isnt from the yixing area and while unglazed is not as good a pot.  Judging by the reviews I skimmed this would seem to be the case.If I was going to have to recommend any of the three Id say get the Zibo.  It looks like it would be the least altered clay and most likely the most authentic.  The Dalian pot looks like it could be well made but the red harbin is just unsettling because if it was zisha clay it wouldnt be that red.  If its not zisha and its that red its either hong ni as I said or zhu ni.  And if its zhu ni they wouldnt be selling it for  bucks nor would they be able to supply a large quantity of them.So... basically I dont know a lot about adagios specifically.  But a quick glance and evaluation leaves me wondering about them.  I would expect that they are more likely to be something you can get cheap and use until you can get a better one andor find one in a store that is of extreme quality that you can put your hands on and look at before you buy.Since you have a local adagio in the area you can go in and look at the pot most likely.  However all three of the pots on their site are likely to be safe since they import them theyd want to make sure theyre safe before selling or recall them if they are tested and found unsafe.  But that doesnt mean theyre real.  Yet for the money youll get a pot that has a lot of the qualities that come with the unglazed stoneware that is  it absorbs the tea and over times helps compliment the flavor and produces a very pleasant brew.But if you feel you must have authentic Id say that none of those are of the highest caliber yixing but theyre good pots for the price.,tea,cesdwf0,2,t5_2qq5e

221410,0,t1_cf31kir,Try eBay.You should consider what kind of tea youre drinking though. If youre drinking wulong and puerh then you might want something a bit thicker. The only wulong that I dont try to maximize the heat is dancong but then you also want to experiment.Cups are cheap and plentiful and youll probably end up with a million of them. For now though if youre drinking alone then you should get something that will hold the entire contents of your teapotgaiwan. Getting something a little big wont hurt and may even trap the aroma while you drink like a wine glass does.Using a pitcher and small cups when youre drinking by yourself only serves to cool off the tea and then youre going to miss the full goodness that you only get when its hot. I also never use a strainer unless Im brewing for a nonteaperson but any of them are fine if you really want one. When brewing for other people I usually just pour back and forth between the cups. This makes a tray handy but you could just as well use a plate bowl towel etc.Youre on the right track with mostly plain stuff though. Your tastes will change as you get more experience and exposure but the more plain teaware that you get will always remain a staple for common use. When you start out youll probably have a hard time with using so much leaf and youll want to save leaf and money the only good way to do that is with small teaware so smaller is better although I find it hard to get good results with anything under ml.If you were in Portland Id invite you for tea and offload some of my old teaware ,tea,cf3nwz4,1,t5_2qq5e

669631,0,t3_21sp9p, If you like sencha you could try Bancha. gtBancha is harvested from the same tree as sencha grade but it is plucked later than sencha is giving it a lower market grade. It is considered to be the lowest grade of green tea. There are  grades of bancha. Its flavour is unique it has a stronger organic straw smell. Wikipedias page on bancha.I actually prefer bancha over sencha although I do like both.  there are several different jasmine tea types of varying qualities available which ones have you tried? I am a sucker for the very cheap sunflower brand in the gold tin but some people find it too astringent and I find that most people who do that I have spoken to on the subject prefer jasmine pearls. there is also black tea scented with jasmine but i find that much harder to find I  know little to nothing about oolongs so blank on that one. you can always try a different Breakfast tea from another brand. I like scottish and irish breakfast better than english breakfast. Irish breakfast from twinings and Scottish breakfast from enjoyingtea.com i also love BOTH brands Prince of Wales teas which brands blackcurrant tea did you try? everyone in my house tends to love the stuff I wonder if maybe you got a bad batch or a really low quality one batch i mean.  ,tea,cggdwsj,1,t5_2qq5e

723352,0,t3_22fllu,Tea contains a number of compounds that affect your brain chemistry. It obviously has caffeine but it also contains theanine an amino acid which mildly elevates dopamine levels in the brain. Theanine makes you feel calm without feeling tired or groggy and counteracts the effect of caffeine that makes you feel jittery which is why you might get the jitters after a couple cups of coffee but a whole pot of tea wont do this.Tea also contains theobromine a chemical also found in chocolate that is responsible for the feel good effect it has. White and green teas both contain plenty of theanine but black teas and heavily oxidized oolongs contain very little. Additionally some tea varieties such as gyokuro are specially cultivated in a way that maximizes theanine production in the plant so different types of tea will definitely have different effects on your brain.,tea,cgmhyg8,1,t5_2qq5e

I spent a few seconds sitting down as I found good coffee and let the taste of it fill my mouth.But good tea. Oh man. Ive sat down spent hours of loving the taste of different teas getting the new experiences that I missed when I was younger.I drank black tea only Earl Grey with lemon and honey or milk and sugar  the teabags of green tea made bitter disgusting tea that I had no interest in  the flavour didnt get better with honey nor sugar.And then I started working in a teahouse had a cup of good green tea and it changed me completely. I still drink black tea I still love it. But Im in love with this South Korean green tea grassy and summer in its flavour. Light oolong for those sunset evenings.

If you drink enough you will develop a tolerance to the effects of the caffeine and if you drink too much you may become addicted. Matcha contains more caffeine than most tea around mg per cup but not as much as coffee or yerba mate so physiologically speaking it should be safe to consume even in large quantities unless you have heart problems or are otherwise very sensitive to caffeine.

I know how my progression went I started drinking boxed teabag tea because I didnt like coffee. Then when I wanted something better I did some searching and Teavana was the first thing I found no other tea shops near me. But now that Ive come to appreciate tea even more I know that there are much better teas out there than what I can get from Teavana and Ive started searching for other stores in the area. Theyre all at least a  minute drive from my house but theyre worth it.I think Teavana is good for exposing people to looseleaf tea. If you have a small shop near your house youre probably going to go there for tea. But for most people Teavana is more visible.

First of all I stay away from plastic ceramic and porcelain as they all retain bacteria more than glass or some bpa and bps free plastics. Second is If I am brewing a pot of tea and not just a cup I probably want something a little bit bigger than this one seems to be so I can have at least two or more cups. Also I cant recognize the filter in the pic so I am not sure how you actually infuse and filter with this set. All that aside if you are looking for a cute and what looks to be a well detailed tea set you can use to serve guest small cups of tea with this might be great and worth the price. I however have abandoned collecting cute and expensive tea sets I move a lot and they break etc a longtime ago in favor of spending a still good sum of money on a pot that will last me a while.

2042184,0,t1_ckz77tn,You dont sound like a shill at all! Its actually really great to hear an insiders perspective on things! And just because I would feel bad if I didnt say it I have never ever blamed the employees aside from that one Hepatitis case at Teavana for the fact that the company is less than desirable in my eyes. What the company asks its employees to do is a reflection on the company not the employee. In general I would say that you are right not to believe the bits about cement until you see them. However unfortunately I have had this happen to me with another mass production tea company so I have an easier time believing that people have found cement in other mass production tea companies like Teavana. I do really wish that people would post photos though! I think that the ick factor is what prevents a lot of people from doing it. I remember when I found a feather in my SOs Blueberry Bliss and when I found a cigarette butt in a package of Bai Hao Yin Zhen from Ten Ren that I was so grossed out I could barely take the photos. Tellingly even after I did manage to snap a couple of shots in order to show it to friends I actually  deleted them because I was just too grossed out. The fact that people complain that items are out of stock is just so indicative of the ideology of Western society. The majority of people in the US are just so selfish when it comes to material things and they dont even realize it. These complaints to employees that they werent able to buy something that they wanted are just so ridiculous. Customers are not entitled to everything that they want. The world does not revolve around just their needs. I used to work a bit in customer service and I realized very quickly that my personality type could NOT handle all of the negativity. The fact that you are able to work at Teavana and get through tough times like the holidays is amazing to me. Its just so often that the average customer looks at an employee at a store or company as less than them not even their servant but as an entity that does not have feelings or thoughts. Yelling at someone or being rude to someone is not going to help the fact that the item is sold out. And it is completely counterintuitive if that customer has the desire to be aided efficiently and with a smile.  Unfortunately a lot of companies tell employees to adhere to the old saying that the squeaky wheel gets the oil. You sound like a nice person and a nice Teavana employee.  Its just so sad that the powers that be still havent gotten their act together and that customers can be THE WORST. XDsorry for the wall of text!!,tea,ckzenqf,1,t5_2qq5e

2230407,0,t1_cln9qy6,Not sure if youre familiar with Contigo mugs  theyre double layer vacuum insulated. Stainless in both areas. Im a huge fan. Hell they float. OP soak the lid in some warm soapy water. Cascade dishwasher soap works quite well. Let it sit overnight see if you can find a test tube brush or something similar in size. In the AM try to scrub it down. Rinse it out then give it a try. Its a real PITA to clean the tops of those things which may be causing your issues. I really wish theyd make the lids out of stainless as well but I think manufacturing costs would be astronomical for something like that.PS you can precharge any travel mug with hot water to help reduce losses due to the liquid heating the steel itself.,tea,clnc63o,3,t5_2qq5e

2265963,0,t3_2l5ahu,I am a devoted Harney buyer.  Ive had both of the teas you mention.  They really are different as another has commented the Russian has a smokier flavour due to the Lapsang which I think makes it a very hearty tasting tea well suited to colder temps.  Im not much a fan of the Queen Catherine...I found it to have a sort of flat minerallike quality which I personally did not care for.  Of course the palate is individual and YMMV.  Paris is a vastly different sort of tea from the other two its more in the style of an Earl Grey than a strong black tea though not the same flavour as Earl obviously.  It depends on what you like.  Someone suggested getting the sample packs and I totally agree.  Ive managed to trial many of their teas prior to purchasing a larger size and saved myself a considerable amount of money buying what I like in larger quantities rather than hazarding a guess and being proven wrong.  Enjoy your sampling Harneys teas really are lovely.  ,tea,clrsjwz,2,t5_2qq5e

2312248,0,t3_2lrlc2,Making tea requires  things     Kettle     Brew vessel     Tea LeavesAnything else is mostly extra however most people like split out  into a brewing vessel and drinking vessel.Since you already have  you can get by with just a brew basket like this one You put the leaves in put in cup and then lift in cup. The combination of your cup and brew basket becomes your brew vessel. Its important that the brew vessel gives space to the leaves to unfurl especially if you get into ChineseTaiwanese style teas that do not break up the leaves during processing.If you wish to dive into Eastern style brewing I am a huge fan of plain white porcelain gaiwans which are just cups with nifty lids. They require a bit of skill to use but honestly it seems many people exaggerate how hard they are. A day of practicing and some common sense will make you proficient. Pots are another step up. Japanese Kyusus are an easier to use alternative. Of course English style tea pots are another options. I would recommend against a large oz English style because the pot itself soaks up so much heat.In many cases the pot itself will have a build in strainer to remove leaves but many times small bits still get through. In which case a small strainer is poured through. You have English style strainers which are really pretty and the Chinese style strainers which come in metal bamboo etc. I would stay away from any clay unglazed pots like Yixing when starting off. This market is filled with tons of misinformation and in general is an unscrupulous industry. Porcelain ceramic and glass are the way to go. Dollar for dollar buying better leaves will always yield better tea than any kind equipment you can get. Bad tea in a  USD early R.O.C. Yixing Pot will be forever be bad tea. However very nice leaves in a  USD gaiwan makes for good tea.,tea,clxiccd,6,t5_2qq5e

2890734,0,t3_2t7lll,To buy the best Tie Guan Yin from Muzha youll have to preorder from the teamakers a couple of years in advance... This is the kind of stuff that win agricultural tea competitions in Taiwan. Otherwise the easiest way is to get a friend or a proxy in Taiwan to ship it to you. Good quality leaves ones that are rated second or third tier prizing in competitions usually come in sealed containers of  grams or more with an official seal from the Department of Agriculture. A container like that should last you a while. Unfortunately I am not aware of any online shops that stock competition grade tea... I would be very happy to be corrected. My experience has been that unlike other Taiwanese Oolongs Tie Guan Yin requires more skill from the tea makers and thus can be a bit more hitnmiss if you cant taste it in person then spending a bit more on a prize winning tea is less risky as a panel of experts have already tasted and priced the tea. Tea entered for competition sell at standardised prices set by the local agricultural association  pricing depends on award tier and this makes the buying process more transparent if somewhat rigid. ,tea,cnwoho3,4,t5_2qq5e

3178640,0,t3_2wjk9x,Have you ever had one of those days  weeks where nothing seems to brew right? Earlier this week I was experiencing that. It was really frustrating. Weve got a stack of homework puerh to test and all of it brewed like hot leaf water. There were specific aromas and flavors noticeable even some chaqi but all the teas lacked any real emotion or body. Once I noticed the issue over a handful of teas I tried brewing some teas I have prior experience with and it was the same thing. My wife and I called it a day at that and set out to explore the issue the next day. We went out and got a few different bottled waters to sample and try. We experimented with tasting them cold and hot. We settled on one that has done well for us in the past. Then we set about delimescaling the kettle. Both of these things helped but maybe only got us  closer to where I thought these teas should be brewing.  We put things on hold for a few days while doing the Chinese New Years rituals of eating drinking visiting relatives and late night fireworks. We got back from a long day out driving around Dian Lake and I sat down to brew some puerh. Just like that the tea brewing groove was back. Each tea I tried was thick rich and full bodied with all the emotion I knew they could present. I dont know what changed. Have any of you also experienced events like this? What have you tried?,tea,corgqbc,4,t5_2qq5e

3219826,0,t1_covjuvk,I think a lot of people that learn to appreciate whats in the bottle on that level end up having to relearn putting the bottle back down. This struck a real chord with me. In some ways tea has become a replacement of sorts for whisky and particularly bourbon. My relationship with spirits wasis passionate and appreciative and while I was never a problem drunk my craving for these flavours and my slowly spiralling purchasing habits would not have ended well. The only sustainable outcome was to stop right there. I have a cupboard stacked with barelyopened bottles. Maybe Ill get them out when friends come over. Ill happily have the odd dram in a wellstocked bar. I wont be pouring myself four measures to run A B C D tasting comparisons when my girlfriend goes out for the evening. I wont drink alone again. I used to say that I wished bourbon didnt contain alcohol and I stand by that. Im not particularly fussed about wine or much Scotch or any other spirits. I do like an occasional beer but I hardly ever get any. Im not denying that I have a latent issue with alcohol just that it tended to be of a very specific nature Corn rye wheat. Tea appeals in many of the same ways. Theres a meditative appreciation of colour of the nose of mouthfeel of subtle development of flavours and of the finish. And yet moreso theres a soothing contemplative process to the preparation which requires care and attention. It lightens and refreshes the mind. It encourages and rewards appreciation of simplicity of earthiness of just being here of doing very little. Ive become a source of some amusement and a little curiosity among my colleagues and students because I always seem to have a cup of something steamy in my hand. Ive shared a few different varieties todays pu erh didnt go down especially well! and Ive perhaps turned on a few light bulbs along the way. Also its supposedly good for me!

3313237,0,t3_2y3mt8,first off welcome to the world of tea. sit down relax and stay a while. as always check out our FAQ for most of the basic questions. but as youll quickly find out there is no definitive way of doing anything around here. we all have our methods and we all have our preferences. what i like might be something that the other folks hate. but as long as you enjoy it it really doesnt matteras for equipment there is no need for fancy stuff. any method of boiling water will do. i use a cheap electric kettle that i picked up at bed bath and beyond while i was shopping for other things. simply boiling water and waiting a bit till its the proper temperature is fine for most teas especially starting out. you never want to use freshlyboiling water so i generally let it sit for  minutes depending on the tea before using it. same goes for cups pots spoons kettles or any other equipment you might need. anything works. the only exception here is your strainer if you choose to use one. youre going to want something that lets the tea breathe. those tea balls or novelty strainers youll see on amazon are fun but they usually confine the tea into such a small space that the taste just isnt the same. most folks around here use some form of basket strainer or pour their tea into a larger pot that comes with some mesh on the spout the kind of tea you use is again a matter of preference. depending o nwhere you live you might be able to find a local tea shop that sells good loose leaf. most local places wont have fancy equipment or even the best quality stuff but theyll be a good quick and convenient place to start and they should have the basic stuff at decent quality. even the cheap basic stuff is many times better than bagged tea. for more selection and higher quality there are a number of online retailers. while amazon might have a few the vast majority of folks around here use a mixture of different online sites to buy their tea. below are the sites i see most often around here. there are many many more of course but these seem to be the favoriteswww.whatcha.com www.uptontea.comwww.davidstea.compersonally i prefer harney a store based in new york with fantastic blends lovely tea tins and fast shipping since i happen to live in pennsylvania and whatcha a smaller retailer with a fantastic variety of teas that you generally wont find in other locations. ,tea,cp5xqqx,7,t5_2qq5e

Each leaf is of humble origins but blended the way it was it becomes something larger than the sum of its parts.  We are neophyte blenders. I know quality when I taste it but I dont know how to blend to create a cake like Top of the Clouds. We made two blended cakes this year Hidden Song and Special Sauce. Theyre both quite good especially Special Sauce. Theyre sourced from amazing original material though. The real skill is taking ordinary average leaf and making something amazing. Thats why Top of the Cloud was cheaper. That and we bought those cakes in bulk at a great price. Every time we buy more they are more expensive. Were going to have to raise the prices soon. This is another one that is affordable but really well blended.  Not as great as Top of the Clouds yet. Yet!

Edit Start with a relatively lower steeping time if suggestions for a tea are given e.g.  minutes start with  minutes on the first steep and increase about  seconds  a minute with each additional steeping.If the teas to weak to your taste the first steeping just start at the higher range of suggested steeping time  If it gets too strong after the first steep reduce time slightly in the future.

4606336,0,t3_3e2wmu,Please do not confuse gongfu tea brewing with ceremony or with the performance art that is the Chinese Tea Ceremony which borrows elements of gongfu brewing and other brewing styles. The Japanese tea ceremony is entirely different still from either gongfu tea brewing and the Chinese Tea Ceremony.See    It is all about skill technique and getting the most out of your tea leaves. There is some etiquette that comes from common courtesy such as using not touching the lips of cups with your hands and using tongs instead. Spilling is okay if it was your intent and has purpose. If I pour water on my pot and have no place to capture the water and wet my guests... No good. However if its on a little tea boat or over a tray? No problem! Same goes if you overfill a gaiwan or something p The mindfulness is the same mindfulness you apply to any pursuit of mastery whether it be the feel of the strings on a violin the cadence of your feet and breath while you run a marathon or the feel of a brush while you paint.

5616881,0,t1_cwt6knf,These are amazing! Im very envious. With the beautiful colour and translucency I think its a type of jade and due to the green colouration I assume its nephrite... jadeite the other type of jade has much larger variance in colour but can also be green. There isnt much difference between the two nephrite is slightly softer and slightly tougher than jadeite.Although it is also nephrite the classic Chinese jade is much lighter greencream colour. Due to this I doubt the jade is chinese... The Maori treasured jade pounamu and used it as a replacement for metal due to its hardness.  I believe some Native American tribes also treasured it... around B.C. if I remember correctly... I suggest you buy complete identifier rocks crystals minerals if you want to work out exactly what rock it is made from.To be honest though it wont add any value... what you have there is amazing a real piece of art.

And even among them you can explore individual mountains blends of mountains quality age dry and wet storage storage from different parts of the world young trees old trees etc. Theres so much to explore.

6379268,0,t3_431chq,Hi Nag typically the unglazed cast iron pots which are called tetsubins are kettles and not teapots. They are designed to boil water in which would then be poured into a teapot not to be steeped in directly which is generally why they dont come with a basket.I have a cast iron teapot and a tetsubin and I have never boiled water in the teapot as I have read that the iron and the enamel will expand and contract at different rates which can cause the enamel to crack which isnt a problem when pouring boiling water into them but can be problematic when applying a flameburner to them as the heat is much more extreme and concentrated. But maybe others have done this without a problem?I guess you could steep tea in a tetsubin if you put a strainerbasket in it but the tea will react with the iron in some capacity and Im not sure what the result will be over time. I have seen some old unglazed iron teapots on eBay however but otherwise I would recommend buying a tetsubin and a teapot which can get very expensive unfortunately.Why do you want an unglazed teapot exactly?,tea,czer5uu,3,t5_2qq5e

Since many people dont have a scale in their kitchen that they can use for tea I give both weight and volume guidelines for all my teas. It is impossible to really use a volume measurement with some teas such as Tai Ping Hou Kui since the leaves are so big. At the end of the day if it is a tea you drink often many people can do a decent job of eyeballing it. I almost always measure by weight. I even have a little travel scale I take on the road. ,tea,czvewli,1,t5_2qq5e

6557519,0,t1_czx5fbo,Im not sure that I understand your explanation correctly but Im not sure youre right. There is a correlation between pressure and depth which is really cool when you start to think about sea waves so we know the pressure is higher at the outer edges. the pressure is generated by the rotation and higher speed means higher pressure. Since water or tea in the bottom of the cup is being slowed by friction from the bottom surface the pressure in the lower parts of the sides is lower. and since nothing is stopping the high pressure liquid in the top from moving to the low pressure in the bottom it does just that gt we have a current.I wonder how a cup without a bottom or a rotating bottom would work...

It seemed to change a lot over subsequent steeps and reveal a lot of interesting and good flavors.   It sells for g which puts it about in the middle of the yancha price range as some out there can be g or much more.  Maybe one day Ill try these high end ones and see how they compare.  ufrisbeehead mentioned Tea Hong which is a vendor I have yet to try but their name seems to come up wherever topic of good yancha or good oolong comes up so I definitely want to give them a try sometime.Also theres also a whole category of oolong that Im really inexperienced with so far the PhoenixDan Cong oolongs.

6629494,0,t1_d04vt1f,Do you normally put sugar in your tea? If you are using a good quality tea I would advise you not to but that is up to you  If you want a really deep flavored grassy green tea I would recommend a sencha. If you like more floral notes I would actually look into Chinese green teas. They are usually a little lighter and very refreshing. For Chinese teas I would go with either a dragonwell or a Gunpowder Gunpowder is fantastic. If you are looking for Japanese specific teas I would suggest this  This sampler is a really good deal and comes with some super highquality teas with a lot of different profiles so you can find your perfect one! If you just want a specific type they are on that website as well.As for the gunpowder and dragonwell...             dragonwell       GunpowderAs you can see the gunpowder is much cheaper so I would probably recommend that to start with. The Dragonwell is a very high grade of green tea and while my absolute favorite green tea is a little expensive. If you can afford it I say go for the Dragonwell though. For the Jasmine teaThis is the jasminegreen tea blend that I love so much. It is really really refreshing and a great everyday tea.These are called Dragon Pearls and produce the purest jasmine flavor. They are a little more expensive but the tin that you get will last months and month. They also bloom in the cup and look really pretty. I would really advise you to try both types of green tea Japanese and Chinese as well as the Jasmine teas. You can never have too many teas on hand I think I have like  or so now XD. Also! So this is totally personal preference but when you brew your green tea try just putting it in your strainer and pouring boiling water over it no steeping. There is no need to follow the specific temperature instructions that everyone harps about I promise. This is the method that was taught to me by one of the family members from one of the largest and most famous tea plantations in China. As for cups I usually am a Gong Fu Specialist so I dont have too much Japanese teaware yet... That being said Japanese Tea Cups are usually pretty easy to find and very cheap.If you do want to purchase I suggest Music City Tea. I have had really really great experiences with them. They sell really high quality tea and the owner is incredibly nice. There is also a Leap Year sale going on now just use leapyear I think... let me know if that doesnt work and you will get an extra  off.Did any of that help at all??,tea,d051oyf,1,t5_2qq5e

The orange peel ball has been separated into two parts with a circular incision the upper part is the lid and the lower part is the body acting as a container which is stuffed with dry white tea leaves. As we known Tea leaves are highly absorbent and can attract odor from anything they come in contact with.

6964303,0,t1_d15ooc4,Its a great question! I havent tried making tea in it so I dont know if the pot imparts any kind of weird taste. Given that it doesnt smell old or like clay it probably doesnt give any off flavors and might make tea okay. It pours at an okay speed and the shape is good as expected from a cast item. The spout kind of sucks and doesnt pour cleanly. I bet I can probably help that with some careful filing down though!Im not so sure about the firing. The clay feels too sandy and doesnt appear to have any obvious cosmetic layers. Id be a bit worried about the pot cracking over time from constantly being heater and cooled. This is why I would not call this a bad pot assuming the clay isnt leaching anything pIf I see this pot sold at a Chinese super market for lt  then the quality is right for the price. The problem is if this product is sold as a premium pot for gt  or if the clay is otherwise misrepresented as genuine zisha. How important having nice clay is a personal choice. Knowing good clay takes time and so I want to point what things to differentiate a cheapo cast pot from a better cast or slab built one.,tea,d15qmmv,5,t5_2qq5e

If there is a cafe or restaurant where youre a regular they may be more understanding and may even let you keep a tea of your choice on the premises but just showing up and brewing your own tea is going to be percieved negatively  times out of .That being said if you rate having a good cup of tea as more important that leaving a good impression then go for it.I certainly understand where youre coming from I take my tea and coffee very seriously and never travel without some premium tea either bags or with an infuser and my fresh beans hand grinder scale and aeropress.

Both can be done genuinely and fluently by someone who understands why theyre doing it. Neither excludes or threatens or objectively improves on the other.

Ideally yixing is handmade and slab formed but that will get quite pricey. Half handmade pots are a fair compromise theyre slab formed using molds and the spouts and handles are slip cast. Theyre not as crazy expensive as handmade but theyre better than an all slip cast pot which can be thin and often lack the air pockets and porous properties that make yixing so insulating and flavor absorbing.The more expensive ones are also sometimes cheap ones that are just marked up so you have to look carefully.,tea,d5u3e9r,6,t5_2qq5e

9231193,0,t3_56srwf,Well we can both agree that boiling water is boiling water. I think that when you start paying its mostly for convenience. A cheap kettle may not stop automatically when it boils. A more expensive kettle may show you the current water temperature allow you to set a specific temperature and have cool colors when the water gets hot I got something like that. A TFal that I paid CAD  years ago. Still works like a charm.Some teas are more fragile and to be prepared properly will require specific temperatures sometimes much lower than boiling water.So if you dont want to pay too much Id suggest getting a cheap kettle and a thermometer. ,tea,d8m4dlr,5,t5_2qq5e

That being said having a teapot even just a small personal one is a lot more fun for both you and any guests you may have. Although if you have guests you might want a bigger teapot than your personal one.Its like the difference between one of those fake fireplaces that are gas with the cement logs and a real fireplace. Sure they both have flame and they both heat you up but one is more fun to use than the other.Plus if you fill the whole kettle up you would make a lot of tea and use a lot of leaves. If you only poured in a mug or two any strainer you get might not actually reach the water. Depending upon the size of your kettle.And if you discover you enjoy tea youll start collecting tea pots left and right anyways. May as well get started. POne last point of note if you do brew in a kettle dont leave the kettle on a hot stove that you used to boil the water.

Saying that mate is tea is much akin to saying that coffee is tea.In tea enthusiast talk where tea is specifically understood as Camellia sinensistaliensis saying tea when you mean herbals can sometimes be confusing.If you want to be entirely clear that youre drinking a mint infusion instead of tea with mint which is a very common blend you can say infusion tisane brew or just mint.,tea,db0zqwl,12,t5_2qq5e

10408417,0,t3_5ozukp,Basically puer as a tradition is aged fermented leaf. Stored properly and given enough time what starts as a green tea transforms into a dark dry leaf full of musty character.  Some decades ago techniques for artificially accelerating the fermentation process allowed manufacturers to skip the aging step. Puer leaf that goes through this artificial process is considered ripe. Leaf left to age the traditional way is raw.,tea,dcnv1cz,1,t5_2qq5e

The entire idea of the gaiwan method is to steep short and often. Learn from the short steeps gradually increase each steep time and if it was too light you can always go quite a bit longer on the next time. Sounds complicated but you get a feeling for it after a while,tea,dcps4fj,3,t5_2qq5e

10478710,0,t3_5q0hyz,Yes its worth trying some mid range loose leaf teas to see what you think. It will be a big step up from the bagged varieties.

10499176,0,t3_5qcif2,You probably are using too little leaf and maybe also your water is not hot enough.You should weigh the tea. Just looking at random images on the internet this appears to be a very boldleaf tea that youd be better off using something like a coffee scoop if you insist on trying to measure by volume.Did you preheat the teaware or just put the tea in it cold and then add C water? Also with Chinese green tea IMO the preoccupation with lower water temperatures is sometimes misguided. Particularly if the tea seems weak and youre sure youre using enough leaf try water right off the boil.,tea,dcy6xl5,8,t5_2qq5e
10510204,0,t3_5qic5o,Is it a problem? If you put hot water in the bottle let it sit closed then open it and pour some in a cup can you taste the flavor? Im willing to bet that even if you can you wont be able to detect in when brewing something else. ,tea,dczfyui,2,t5_2qq5e
10537358,0,t3_5qtikc,The optimal steeping process is a matter of taste and opinion and varies not only with genre of tea but with subtype and somewhat even with particular tea within the subset. For instance I have two wu yi rock oolongs one is best with a little more leaf than the other the one with more leaf steeps a little less than the other. I learned this by experimenting. And that experimenting is much of the fun. I think that one thing people miss out sometimes is that you need to make mistakes. Put too much leaf in see what happens! Put too little in. Vary the time of infusions according to the taste of the last one. Play try to find what opens up a teas flavour. Good starting points can be found all over the place but theyre just starting points.,tea,dd2iy68,2,t5_2qq5e

10567747,0,t1_dd5yk0n,The reason I ask the question is because I found it underwhelming my impression was that it the smell was nice kinda like faint grandmas perfume  I initially thought it was just a smell coming from the paper wrapper but that it barely tasted like anything.That said Ive been sitting with a pot of it here for most of the afternoon and I think I sold it short.  I actually poured a cup of hot water to compare and it was only next to the water that I noticed how much flavour there was and how pleasant it is.  Its kinda like the absolute leastoffensive earthy puer Ive tasted and Im still trying to work out if thats a good or a bad thing.,tea,dd5z28n,1,t5_2qq5e
10571771,0,t3_5rdf1w,Score! You got some really beautiful basket infusers perfect for loose leaf tea. Its great for brewing both Western and Gongfu styles. I am guessing these are ChineseKorean due to the fact that those holes are too small for Japanese green tea. You can use that infuser with pretty much any tea it works great. A great tea to start out with it are Taiwanese oolongs they would be perfect for that. Mountain tea company has some really good Taiwanese oolongs.

The writer of the article seems to presume that no brick amp mortar tea shop can do much better than Teavana for some reason.If its some cheap and generic loose tea or mini tuobrick then its probably going to be mediocre or bad.

However this does not mean that all tea sold now will be in season. Why? Teas take time to prepare dry out and mature for some. To emphasize the point jasmine silver needle which is made using Bai Hao silver needle is being picked as we speak I know a few farmers who have already started picking their baihao. However this tea is held until late springearly summer when jasmine flowers start to appear. The tea is then held over a bed of jasmine flowers to absorb the smell. So although the tea is in season it wont be ready until later in the year. However if you want a concrete example of a tea thats in season now its Dragonwell Long Jing. One of our farmers picked his first batch on the th of February. However you wont see this batch for a little while yet in the West as it takes time for high quality teas to make their way over here mostly because the selection and sale process takes a bit of time not to mention that MOST Dragonwell is picked in March. In general I agree with negativedelta. One of the main reasons that tea is dried out is to preserve it and for flavour of course. This means that if the tea has been stored correctly it will taste good for a long time a year or more. However as with most things the fresher the tea the better so look for a picking date. Treat most teas like fruits and treat aged teas such as puers like wine. They get better with age and vary depending on the quality and care that has been put into them.Hope this didnt confuse you.Sasha.,tea,df6uy4f,4,t5_2qq5e

11389505,0,t3_62iww7,Im not sure that its true that theyre better chilled. You mention that green tea is better at lower temperatures and this is true just if by this you mean youre supposed to brew green tea at lower temperatures than eg black or oolong. Normal brew temp for green tea is C vs C for some other types. Im not an expert at all but if i had to guess id say its a bad idea because I think tea esp green tea and even more so matcha bc you are keeping the actual ground up tea leaf inside the water the whole time will change a bit chemically after you brew it oxidization? im not sure. I know that if i brew green tea in the morning and put it in my metal thermos it will be a different color and have quite a different flavor by pm. Anyway i suspect that matcha that sits in water for days and days might become way over steeped maybe making the matcha bitter and may result in the powder becoming hyper oxidized. thats my guess.,tea,dfmzcmw,2,t5_2qq5e

11624141,0,t3_65vz2b,Dont sweat it. Gear can get absurdly technical and specific so dont get too caught up in all the permutations. You can accomplish nearly the same results with a much more pedestrian setup. For instance its fine to brew green tea in a gaiwan as long as you keep an eye on water temp. A gaiwan wont ruin your tea. For awhile I brewed everything in a small ceramic teapot and poured my infusions through a strainer It was a little akward but I got good quality steeps out of it.They key pieces of gong fu brewing are water to leaf ratio water temperature brew time a brewing vessel which allows the leaves to float freely and open upIf youre mindful of all those you will get good quality steeps. ,tea,dgdlway,7,t5_2qq5e
