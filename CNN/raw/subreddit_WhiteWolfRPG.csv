1227970,0,t3_285oyh,. The Storytellers Handbook for Hunter points to the Ministers from the Kueijin thus hinting that they are the Ebon Dragon and Scarlet QueenPhoenix who may be two of the last celestial Angels in creation. This ties into Kueijin mythology making Hunters a possible recreation of the  Warriors Wan Xian to protect the earth against the Yama KingsEntropy They became the  Demons the Wan Kuei aka KueiJin. Since the Wan Xian also draw parallels with Exalted this can also make Hunters a weaker more disorganised but more numerous recreation for the modern era. Other stuff aside making the Messengers the two last angels is pretty cool in my book with Lucifer and possibly Charon being the other extant angels.. Depends. If the Imbued Hunter is brought to a state normally sufficient for Fallen possession deathlike state or spiritual death and has enough faith a demon could try to possess them. Of course most likely this would be blocked by their Imbued nature same as conviction blocks mind control etc etc. If it didnt for some reason then you could do standard stuff for that merging of the two memoriespersonalities. They would of course lose any Hunter powers and Conviction what with no longer being an Imbued Hunter. If you mean a nonImbued Hunter like a Society of Leopold or something then yeah go right ahead if conditions are met though I have no idea if SoL True Faith would hinder or help Fallen possession.,WhiteWolfRPG,ci7rj8o,5,t5_2u6fa

2786865,0,t3_2rzvcr,Im digging on a Demonic cover broker right now.A former Messenger assigned as a therapistcounselor in a juvenile detention center to uplift chosen delinquents and put them on a path that better suited the GodMachine. He fell when he started to develop paternal feelings towards the kids and started to take a more active hand in all their lives instead of just names on a list.Now he works as a motivational speaker like Tony Robbins taking on individual cases when he can. He protects and encourages people at their lowest point puts them back on the right track and puts them in touch with powerful people his Allies to get useful employment. While he works with them hes super paternal and protective. Hed do just about anything to help his clients and is constantly on call to help them with any troubles they encounter.Then once they seem to be standing on their own two feet he turns them into assets. Either he uses their new found positions to help his next clients or he cashes in on his pacts by taking parts of their lives. Then he uses those pacts to barter and trade with other Demons providing new identities for protection and influence in the Demonic community. It also ensures that when the groups token bruiser risks cover or even goes loud he can do so with a safety net.Unfortunately his cover is also a notorious womanizer so hes mostly broke thanks to alimony and child support. Hes a terrible dad since he doesnt trust himself to treat his kids like kids rather than assets to develop and turn. Better to watch from afar than to selfishly meddle.Currently hes on the lookout for a protege with the ultimate endgame of a soul pact in case something goes south with his current cover. That way he can step into the proteges shoes with minimal difficulty since he knows just about everything about him and hell be on a familiar career path to his original cover.Naturally he has a Generous virtue with the Corrupt vice. At his best hes helping out troubled people down on their luck but he does so with the expectation hell be getting returns on his investments. ,WhiteWolfRPG,cnkuuny,7,t5_2u6fa

His name is Bison.Basically he has an ego the size of the Titanic and beats the crap out of people who do stupid things to him. The character concept was a school bully turned werewolf. Oddly enough him being bully made a bit of sense in hindsight but I think thats a different story.He is at school football practice. Just getting the hang of his abilities and having a good time at it. In the stands he sees this guy with an umbrella. This cannot stand.As practice goes on I make a roll to get the football team just as angry as I am about this weird ass shit. Critical. Fucking. Success.Bisons buddy tries to stop everyone. Critical failure.So like  guys surround this kid and break his umbrella. I am about to start smashing the fuck out of this guy for having the nerve to come and be different in my school. Right as I have my fist ready to go he yells...BUT I HAVE CANCER!Then we notice he was bald.And really sickly looking.It has become a thing in the game when Bison does something stupid to yell BUT I HAVE CANCER!I have more if anyone is interested.,WhiteWolfRPG,conl0rl,10,t5_2u6fa

It largely depends on the people working on the project and their schedules but delays are pretty common. For example Werewolf the Forsaken . was in its First Draft stage the same stage nWoD . is now according to the latest Monday Meeting blog in March of last year and it still hasnt released. Mage the Awakening . was projected to be released in the beginning of  but has been the victim of complications and delays so the projection is now Summer.That said the nWoD . rulebook may benefit from a lack of fluff.

3360183,0,t3_2ynnk6,Welcome aboard!Youve got a few tough tasks ahead of yourself! I like to use metaphors and then speak specifically so lets do that.  Mage is to DampD what Metal Gear Solid is to Halo. In Halo and DampD you Gallivant around bashing anything that dare move confident your shielding cleric will keep you alive! Punch first! Ask questions while punching!In MGS you try the same tactic and you die.  Must have been a lucky headshot. Try again.Die again.The first thing new Mage players need to learn is that Mages are SQUISHY.Lets compare damage here an arrow to the head in each system.DampD d damage health pools start where this is dangerous but quickly out grow that MtAs  damage  for the called shot to the head but if this is a gun thats  and no one gets much more than  health!Thematically this means everyone needs to be afraid of combat and look for way around it because with paradox everyone is that level  sorcerer albeit with some spells way high level but can only cast a few per combat and a dude with a baseball bat is terrifying thereafter.As for Paradigm realize and iterate to your players that Paradigm is THE hardest part of Mage but also the most important. Quickly the games power will get to a point where the question isnt can I cast this spell its how do I want to cast this spell.Paradigm is the how.I have my player act in character and ask them how they would cast a number of spells. I usually go for tracking spell fireball and teleport as well as a few others.When they answer act kind of like a  year old.How do you cast a fireball?I would summon flames from the pits of Hell and cackle as my enemies burn and perish!Okay but how?Forces  prime Answer in character pleaseUh.  My mastery of fire lets me do this.How?  Do you use a focus?Uh yeah my Wizard staff!Cool! How does that work?Well I mean... It has runes on it?That sounds neat! Do the runes have any meaning for your character? And so on. . .If they seem stuck let then know that this might just be something your character cannot do! Some mages can not perform certain effects. Also feel free to chime in too! You need to understand their paradigm and foci as well as they do since youll be policing it.Tldr mages are soft act like a  year old until they know their paradigm or bribe you with Oreos.,WhiteWolfRPG,cpbaahn,13,t5_2u6fa
3366947,0,t3_2ypch8,As the others have said pick a theme you want to explore through your story and let that inform the challenges your characters face throughout the game. I enjoy running Lovecraftstyle stories similar to what you describe above. The main idea behind these stories is that characters begin in their normal ignorant world and then go down the rabbit hole never to return. Theres also another Lovecraftian theme that we are very very small in a large indifferent worlduniverse which I feel works particularly well with both Vampire games.Vampire can also be a very social game and many people play it as a social game rather than a DnD murderhobos game. Many groups spend entire games without rolling the dice once talking to people discovering their motives and learning others secrets. After all when youre sired youre very much a normal human in heart and mind so its no small wonder that now with an eternity on your hands you would take it upon yourself to make your desired utopia. This is where you get people that found groups like the Carthian Movement or the Ordo Dracul Vampires who want nothing more than to have their own perfect world for all eternity. This is a fantastic idea to play on because its often strong motivation for NPCs to do any number of horrible things to advance their position in society and fulfill their goals. On the other hand some NPCs perfect world may not even tread on other peoples toes at all  they may just wish to spend the decades painting. Until they get bored that is . TLDR Theres tons of stuff to do seriously. IIRC the Requiem rulebook has some good tips in there for Storytellers not to mention an explanation of the different themes and ideas Requiem explores i.e. the themes built into the game as part of its design. So if youre running Requiem check that section of your rulebook out.,WhiteWolfRPG,cpc22pc,5,t5_2u6fa
3399933,0,t3_2z0j91,OK being new at World of Darkness games is easier than at others.If youre new to DampD your character knows a whole load of stuff that you dont.  He knows the Gods the geography the creatures the technology the various races the politics etc.  Dropping a new player into the game can be hard work because everything theyre trying to do is built on false assumptions and limited knowledge. In World of Darkness if youre playing a new character then whats often happened is that youve woken up one day and realised that everything you knew was wrong.  But its everything that you the player knows.  All the false assumptions that the player is suffering from You know things like Gravity is real are things that the character is suffering from.  What that means is that theres a small chunk of information that your characters knows on top of what you know already but thats pretty easy to fill you in on.  And then theres the mechanics which at the entry level come down to Count the dots and roll that many dice.  Yeah it gets more complicated from there but actually getting into it is easy.  So just show up be interestedinteresting and see how it goes.  Also can I just say that Im really fucking jealous right now.

3938765,0,t3_35kepr,I usually allow people investing a lot into Retainers because I think it adds a lot more storywise whan investing in certain other aspects of the character. If done properly it adds a nice fleshedout character or several for your player to interact with.On the other hand investing in Retainers is a tricky business because a large number of retainers or a single extremely powerful one are bound to draw attention from other Kindred. And with that attention comes jealousy fear and the rest of the Kindred Negative Emotion Cocktail. Overusing your retainers is thus actually kinda risky as you may just find your Ghoul in three feet of cement one of these nights.As far as Character sheets go I usually make a simplified char sheet for NPCs if I make one at all  as long as Im aware of the general stats of the character no need to put paper in the way of fun. But in the case of the Ghoul the player has a say in his stats so just consult him for the skills he is looking for in his retainer write the essentials down and wing the rest. At least thats how I do it.Note Im talking from VtM experience am not  sure RetainersGhouls work in the same way in VtR but the basics are the same,WhiteWolfRPG,cr594lt,7,t5_2u6fa

4110590,0,t3_37p5re,There was one Malkavian Ill never forget. The game was a somewhat small LARP ish players and had about  Malks total. The one in question was a lot of fun to watch. He had multiple derangements one of which was Masochism.He fed by being hit by cars or by being mugged. Not a very efficient way to hunt but it worked. He would Obfuscate and put himself in situations where he could be hit by a carbikeetc. If the driver got out to help it was dinner time. Likewise he would purposely get shotstabbedetc by muggers then play dead. If they went through his pockets it was dinner time. In every case he would use Obfuscate to hide his identity so anyone on the lookout for Masq. breaches would have multiple conflicting physical descriptions and Dementation to make the victim freak out hopefully to the point of a psychological break.One particular scene really stood out we were in an Elysium where the hot topic was several missing Kindred former PCs that had vanished under mysterious circumstances. He runs in to the room bloody and with his clothing torn and dives under a table. Shaking and out of breath he has a minute panic attack all the while going on about werewolves and cockroaches. At the end of it he wass hyperventilating and almost screaming until finally a Tremere used Dominate to make him stop talking. He left immediately and was killed later that night while attempting to feed by the Glasswalker that had been tracking him since they first encountered one another earlier that night that encounter being the reason why he had flipped out in the first place. ,WhiteWolfRPG,crotz2s,11,t5_2u6fa

4859026,0,t3_3hd8t1,Ive been collecting notes and ideas about how I would make a VtM game. One thing that stands out the most is that you should be allowed to live out your life as a Vampire or the creature in whatever other WoD game. The capability to go around the streets and hunt and feed not to mention build a network of contacts cash flows find and choose your ghoul. I think its immensely important for the immersion aspect of the game to be able to just be a vampire. Because that makes the struggle with humanity so much more important. The aesthetic has to be right. In fact it should change over time to reflect the characters slow understanding of what they are. Everything should look normal almost a realistic depiction of the world in . Then eventually as you are exposed to more weird and wonderful the way you perceive the world changes. You could return to the exact same location you went to as a fledgling and find that the colours are slightly different different people are accentuated in the image and the smell of blood is all consuming. Combat needs to be fast and deadly. It can only last for  rounds maximum against mortals and neonates. Longer when you fight others and become stronger since you begin using blood to heal. It needs to be so risky so much so that weapons even with bashing damage ignoring the GMC everything does lethal to mortals rule and sticking with the oWoD as the weapon says. The high risk factor on combat  every single combat encounter  will change the way people play the game. Social skills like Dominate and Presence will become important to scare people away stealth and obfuscate will be relied upon to avoid combat and potence and protean will be used to fight in any situation. And in every case the Masquerade is maintained because of how you would just naturally deal with combat.I could go on for a while I guess. I believe this can all be done through a d game but a Fallout style game like Bloodlines also does it quite well though it accentuates different elements to what I talk about. I love bloodlines and the dialogue options should be a staple to any WoD game.,WhiteWolfRPG,cu70lu5,2,t5_2u6fa

4965707,0,t3_3iwitl,Kapaneus Caine has powers at least two levels higher and probably much much higher than any antediluvian. And hed have access to disciplines which no other vampire in existence ever even heard of much less developed in any meaningful way. Hes not something the systems of the OWoD were meant to accommodate. Hell... the books tell us over and over not to treat the antediluvians like highpowered characters because they are so much more than that. And Caine is older than them by thousands of years and has them beat by two generations. Thats my pleasant way of telling you that what powers he used on Beckett are probably not in the books in any way. He definitely used both Auspex and Obfuscate several times over during the course of the novel. Theres no telling what he did to those two Assamites... but when you have PURELY BY SYSTEMS which do not matter for this purpose at least  dice in strength dexterity potence and celerity... theres no fight to be had with you. In the end however all vampires are subject to the withering. We can assume that Caine eventually dies. The world is ending after all and at worlds end is when Caines own curse is finally lifted and he can be judged by God. But Theo and Beckett are definitely dead in whatever world is left.

Some plots take time to develop and wont all unravel instantly. So if you present events as needing time to develop theres plenty of time to dawdle and it feel like a meaningful use of time.Whats more depending on how you run your games you might have introduced a number of vendors or sources of information to your players the spaces to breathe are great chances to go back to them and figure out what that random weird book they picked up was or whatever.

5533143,0,t1_cwigdk9,nd Edition brings Mage up to date with the God Machine Chronicle nWOD ruleset and makes some improvements to the magic system that streamlines it quite a bit Forces and Life are no longer on their own scale you can compel all life forms if you know the Practice of Compelling for example.  You dont need a certain level to affect radiation as opposed to heat.  Theres a lot of stuff that makes it more gameable and does things like develops the Seers of the Throne alongside the other Orders from the very beginning in the core rulebook.  The fact that Atlantis is just a metaphor or more of a lingua franca than actual history for mages is made more explicit.  Storytellers get a lot more support advice and structure in terms of what to reveal with Mage Sight and its no longer a spell but more of a splat ability.  Like a Vampire burning blood points to boost their strength Mages can focus their senses to see the Supernal World yes world as an ability rather than a spell.The theme is Addicted to Mysteries and the system is mechanically adapted to that theme.  You gain Arcane Experience when you investigate Mysteries magical phenomena and access to a Mystery is a contested and coveted commodity think Mr. Norell jealously guarding his books and being obsessed and set in his ways in the Susanna Clarke novel Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell or two mages fighting over the right to magically experiment on a Sleeper whose Fate seems inexplicably and supernaturally twisted or frayed.   Wisdom is about judicious use of power rather than being a good or bad or deranged person.  Harry Dresden would be an example of a low Wisdom mage now.  Hes a good guy but he has a tendency to throw Forces magic around a lot and set things on fire.  Magic feels good to use and the more you use it the more you want to use it you can regain Willpower with a critical success on a spell for example.  But the more you use it the more unwise you are considered to be.  Its not a moral judgment to be low Wisdom but you have to walk a very fine line.Id recommend reading through all the lead developers blogs at the link above.

5606846,0,t3_3r6c9a,I developed a Discipline for my chronicles called The Crimson Philosophy precisely to counteract the issues you describe. The idea is that a group of Kindred scholars at some point probably before the inception of the Camarilla developed a meditative Pathbased discipline similar in some respects to the Coils of the Dragon from Requiem although I will say this discipline is based more off of the Blood Disciplines of the VtM Redemption video game long before Requiem was a gleam in the eye of WhiteWolfs marketing department. The paths or Bloodrights of this discipline allow the Kindred to creatively work around the limitations of Generation by building upon existing vampiric powers like the ability to insume blood and convert it to vitae more efficiently or store it more effectively for later use or to create more powerful ghouls. The Inconnu may have been behind the creation of these powers or it may have been a now defunct secret society of Kindred. The aim was to afford vampires of a higher generation the opportunity to increase their power without resorting to Dialblerie. Of course somewhere down the line a practitioner devised the Right of The Amaranth an heretical Bloodright that allows a vampire to more effectively commit diablerie and may have spawned the infamous Ritual of the Bitter Rose.,WhiteWolfRPG,cws30gn,1,t5_2u6fa

Better even since normal people cant call up their case agent and tell them to fuck off for good with enough oomf that they actually will while that is definitely an option for mages changelings quite a few demons etc. Werewolves stay off the grid anyway and travel through the spirit world when an airplane is inconvenient. Vampires are a bit trickier but they are just so good at blending in an urban environment. Almost all of the clans can mindcontrol charm or hide from a mortal agent of the law the ones that cant would just tear off the agents head and go about their way.Most vampires dont pass through security check points on a regular basis. When vampires do fly they tend to fly in coffins as corpses going to their final place of rest which get scanned but dont need extensive paperwork. Producing technological records and such is also doable that is what high ranking ghouls are for and any Prince worth their salt is going to provide access to that sort of thing to loyal subjects if they dont already have it. ,WhiteWolfRPG,cx59mzx,3,t5_2u6fa

6002051,0,t1_cy4sr4c,Here is I think what is being got at in WW canon Caitiff are reviled. That is a fact. Indisputable fact there is a reason the Time of the Thin Bloods is considered to be a sign of Gehenna Vampire Armageddon. Caitiff are removed from their progenitor of any clan that they arent considered any clan really. Almost by definition they are too thinblooded to Embrace I believe I could be wrong that instead of a Clan weakness they are unable to Embrace by OWoD canon. If I remember correctly in order to have a Caitiff with ANY blood disciplines you need ST approval what this means is that somewhere in a background you should explain why precisely your Caitiff has Viss. Perhaps he was Embraced in BC and is a th or th gen whos sure was a proper Tzim then it makes sense as to why you have it or a Sabbat pack mixed their blood and fed it to you but then you should at random roll for your disciplines among the ones the pack has.That establishes who Caitiff are really and what is bad about Caitiff in mechanics. The plot and story OWoD stigma of being Caitiff comes here each clan is obscenely proud Ventrue Lasombra Tzimisce Brujah Toreador CappadocianGiovanni all take great pride in coming from nobility. Meanwhile even Gangrel Nosferatu Malkavian Setites Assamites TremereSalubri Ravnos all take pride in being different some Nos revel in their hideousness anyone with blood disciplines is understandably proud of something that makes them different. This should illustrate to you that Embracing someone who is not even a capable member of your blood is embarrassing. Can you imagine being so proud of your Chimerstry Mr. Ravnos and trying to pass on your Roma heritage to a childe only to Embrace something that does not empathize with your weaknesses and revel in your strength because they dont experience it? Each individual Clan hates Caitiff that come from their blood because its an embarrassment to their blood particularly if this Clanless has their Blood Discipline. Its not necessarily because their secret is out though it certainly plays a part but its more like the entire world knows their Blood as a Clan has evidence that at some point it is too weak to produce a rightful heir. Due to these reasons in canon a Caitiff that exhibits blood disciplines is almost automatically hunted by the Clan with that discipline not always because secrets but because pride. There is a canon explanation as to why Caitiff dont have blood disciplines anything that ties them to their parent Clan should be snuffed out. It is why most Caitiff that are in play are biteanddrops not because sire is too busy to raise a whelp but because it would be embarrassing to present a Caitiff to your Clan so if you have no special disciplines they dont have to worry about you.I was in an OWoD game where we played DAV and my ST adored canon we went to the Convention of Thorns the signing of the Treaty between Giovanni and Cam all of it loved canon. Anyway before this during like AD we had a Brujah I played a German Lasombra who attempted to sire a childe this Brujah was already th gen super weak for DA and my ST had her read up on her Clans disposition towards Caitiff and Embracing etc. just to let her know what exactly she was risking. She risked it Embraced a Caitiff the stakes were higher. As soon as we hit a town with her newly Embraced brat the ST made this NPC the single most annoying creature in the world akin to an  year old with one joke one of the townspeople went and told his regnant this towns person served a Ventrue Prince in the closest city who announced AT COURT that a Brujah had both broken the Ancient Tradition of Progeny by airing outside of his command. This Prince then rubbed salt in the wound of his Brujah Seneschal I guess they didnt get along by announcing to the ENTIRE DOMAIN that the said Brujah sired nothing less than a CAITIFF. Our coterie spent the next  sessions in combat out of combat trying to run away running into teams of Brujah and their allies out for this Caitiff and his Sire for no other reason than because a PC Embraced an NPC Caitiff and understood that it came with consequences. That was drastic but it was a lot of fun to politic around saving the group at first we tried to defend her poor Childe was toast from the start but towards the end she had become too much of a hassle for the rest of us my level  Obten couldnt hold them off much longer neither could the Tzims level  Viss and at the end the group Dominated our Retainers into carrying her box out to the nearest field and setting each side of the field on fire during the day. The fire reached her box caught it on fire she burst out in full frenzy and ashed in that field no amount of Celerity or Fortitude saved her for long. It was harsh from the ST but that was what I believe to be a fairly canon response to Embracing a Caitiff. Plus I got a personal Domain out of it so it wasnt all that bad.,WhiteWolfRPG,cy6edmk,3,t5_2u6fa

6251374,0,t3_415e1r,I could very well be wrong but from where I am sitting you sir are teetering on the edge of a total cluster fuck Your format has a huge flaw. Even if you have  players if you do a scene that is at most  minutes a piece that means players have to wait half an hour before they can do anything. And lets be real those scenes will go beyond  minutes especially if theres combat. But in that downtime that guy is going to get on his phone and on reddit or youtube and be a distraction. Also theres a huge tendency to unplug and disengage from the game and not get into the character. Which is unfortunate because Vampire is great when people are right there doing their thing. Also if you have each player pursuing their own goal then how do you get them to interact with the central plot without hijacking and railroading? That would involve a ton of work on your part to take multiple story threads that you dont and cant anticipate that are bound to change several times over the course of a game and work them into a predetermined plot. That sounds like a game killing nightmare .Vampire is whatever you want it to be. All the WoD games are really. The personal horror thing shouldnt really be a driving force of the story but something that is always there in the vampires requiem. And it should be added to taste. I personally dont want mopey vampires lamenting their eternal existence while they cry cut themselves and blast Nightwish. So I think what you should do is think of some reference to base your world on. For me I was really attracted to the tone and the ideas behind Being Human the US version. Then you should create the frame work of who rules the city and how. In my world Detroit is run by the Circle of the Crone and the cult rules from the shadows enforcing their laws through paranoia manipulation and blood magic. Which creates an uneasy peace and a more anarchistic domain that is strangely more free than many so long as you dont offend The Circle.

6709631,0,t3_46nsrs,The best Sabbat plot that I have run was one that I didnt expect to run but did instigate. At the time  maybe  I was running a moderately sized Sabbat LARP of about  or so players. The game began with the typical youve just conquered the city scenario and most of the early plot centered on clearing out the last few Camarilla holdouts. That plot ended with the discovery of the Tremere chantry and the lone remaining Tremere who also happened to be an infernalist. Once that series of plots wound up I retired several of the NPCs that had been involved including a Bishop. The Archbishop that had been leading the crusade announced that he would be ordaining a new Bishop one year hence at the next Palla Grande and that anyone who wished to be considered a candidate had until then to prove their worthiness. Almost immediately the packs there were around  or so began politicking with one another to figure out who the primary candidates would be. Eventually they decided to use Games of Instinct to separate the wheat from the chaff as it were. So for the next  game sessions the PCs did nothing but compete with one another in games of their own devising. I continued to manage and progress events in the city in the background while they were distracted but very few of the plot hooks I presented to the players were followed up on. They were really absorbed in competition. After the Games concluded there were four candidates An Assamite Antitribu a Nosferatu Antitribu a Tzimisce and a Pander. The Pander was quickly and quietly destroyed by the unintentionally combined efforts of the Assamite and the Tzimisce. After that the three factions quickly dug their trenches and began trying to outmaneuver one another. At this point the players began to become interested in the city at large again and a few managed to discover that there were some demons running loose and building a power base. This news quickly spread and as soon as they heard it the three remaining candidates decided that their campaigns would focus on destroying the demons before the Inquisition showed up. Over the next several months the game consisted of very heavy politicking among the three factions while they each tried to solve the demon issue while at the same time preventing their rivals from solving the demon issue which the demons of course used to their advantage as by then at least  PCs had become infernalists in the employ of said demons.Finally in late Augustearly September the Assamite decided enough was enough. He had become aware of one of the PC infernalists and used her to set up a meeting with the most powerful of the demons. After about two hours of solid role play not a single test thrown a deal was struck wherein the Assamite and his pack would destroy the demons in view of other Sabbat and the demons would leave town. At the end of the discussion the infernalist was killed in a joint effort by the Assamite and the demon.The Assamite went back to his pack and declared that he had killed the infernalist but not before she had told him where and how he could destroy the demons. He and his pack left to do so but not before leaving behind enough information between several other PCs to ensure that other Sabbat would show up quickly enough to see what was happening but too late to join in the action.So the Assamite and his pack arrive at an abandoned Masonic Temple in one of the worst parts of town and after snooping around a bit arrive at the predetermined spot where the demons would attack. The fight was basically a dance until the other PCs began showing up. Then real blows began to fly. After a few round the demons were vanquished but seeming at great cost to the Assamite and his pack  two were left in torpor and one was permanently maimed until a Tzimisce was able to fix it anyway. The other candidates witnessed this much to their dismay but they conceded that the Assamite had won the Bishopric. That Palla Grande was a fantastic event we put a lot of money and effort in to it  candelabras silk amp satin elaborate and detailed costumes etc. and the ordination ceremony was RPd from start to finish. There were readings from the Book of Nod and one of the players even came up with prayers to Caine for his pack priest to recite. The Assamite assumed his new role and no one but he and the demon knew the truth. The three candidates remained rivals which provided some fantastic PVP plotlines but a status quo was established that lasted for two years. Right up until that Malkavian Antitribu infernalist came to town fleeing from the Inquisition...,WhiteWolfRPG,d0dc0do,3,t5_2u6fa

6903066,0,t1_d0ypana,Very well.On a different aspect of the topic I would like to point out that as a character spirals downward on the Integrity scale they begin picking up conditions. These conditions likely have an affect on their ability to interact with other people. While the conditions dont seem particularly harsh to begin with the larger negative modifiers to breaking point rolls coupled with likely much worse breaking points thus lowering the dice pool further leads to a much greater chance for a dramatic failure which results in some pretty severe conditions that inevitably damage their ability to function in any normal social capacity. Very likely they will be locked up but with it being CofD and very much WoD they might be just as likely to go free untreated spreading their own personal brand of crazy. So while the only apparent penalty to a low Integrity is more failed breaking points there is a deeper level to that mechanic that really penalizes the character.,WhiteWolfRPG,d0ys55c,2,t5_2u6fa

A few weeks after the embrace his sire and himself are assaulted by a small pack of hunters. His sire is wounded and he carries him away having decent Celerity which his Sire lacks to safety however the wounds from the gunfire cause the Sire to slip into Torpor.He is very low on blood and he can hear the hunters searching for him outside. He could risk a confrontation but this low on blood he cant be sure that he would even stand a chance. He could run but with this little blood he might not get far enough or could frenzy out of hunger...Or...Well its not like hell be needing it.So youre a Tzimisce whose entire family and support network are back in Central Europe who is now in the US or UK or wherever your chronicle is set.

If mages can manipulate Essence with the Spirit Arcanum I suppose they could learn to manipulate Aether with Prime. If they do however that would likely draw the attention of the God Machine as well as the ire of a few demons. Actually allowing them to study the Aether as a Mystery unto itself would give me good reason to test out the longterm investigation option in the SoS document and the ability to manipulate Aether could be a reward for success that they learn from the Deep Info.

7650977,0,t3_4k3me6,A little over a year ago I ran a Mage the Ascension game for a group where the majority were new to the Mage line. When creating characters I had spent a lot of time talking about how the crux of paradigms and reality was belief and that the power of simply knowing that something can happen was enough for a mage to make things happen. I felt like it would be important to make belief a central theme to the campaign as it enforced the lines themes really well.The BBEG was an ancient evil I called The Foremost an embodiment of entropy that had been banished from the realms long ago with all effigies burned and writings about it destroyed until millennia later it had been completely forgotten.The concept behind this BBEG however was that this evil gained more power as more was understood about it. With one follower on the Earth the Foremost was nothing more than a whisper in the wind...but as more people began digging and uncovering facts about it the BBEG grew stronger. Each piece of a ritual or old texts on its vestiges symbols of its power everything the players learned gave it strength as it slowly became realized again.The threshold I decided was its name once they learned that this evil was known as The Foremost I cant remember the archaic name I made up for it then it would have enough power to begin touching the world again.The last session was probably the most intense one we had I had a player that couldnt make it due to another commitment so I brought them in and ran them as an NPC. It wasnt until they were deep in a tomb and trapped in the dark that the character I was NPCing was possessed by the Foremost trapping them and nearly killing everyone.Unfortunately after the group survived the trap and the session ended the Mage game ended afterwards. Two of my five players had to leave the game at the same time and they were the ones who were really driving the story and most engaged. Being left with people that really would rather be playing DampD we shut the book on the campaign and moved over to e although I have been considering seeding the Foremost into that campaign to make it inescapable...,WhiteWolfRPG,d3bvgir,18,t5_2u6fa

8030816,0,t3_4oysk3,Seconded though as a current inhabitant of the Chicago I can tell you the mortal side of the city needs a drastic update. A lot has changed in  years and it would really benefit from having a less cartoonish perspective on the city. The second edition CbN version of Chinatown was literally the synopsis of Big Trouble in Little China. Rush Street as The Rack is also hilarious. I know Chronicles of Darkness did a new version but I havent looked through it. Id love to see a good writer tackle the policegang violence the decline of the Machine and the current tension between those who want to make it a global city vs. the disenfranchised that are getting left behind through the perspective of the World of Darkness. Theres clearly a Camarilla versus AnarchSabbat thing going on there. Setbacks and advances on both sides. Im currently running a mortal hunter game in Chicago thats preBlood Red Moon though set in  with players who have never played a cWoD game. Its probably the most fun Ive ever had as an ST because there is no metagaming and they are genuinely astounded and confused by everything that is going on... They also have no idea whats coming. One of them is friends with the Fanum and getting rumors of some prophecy while another is a mobster who just had his first sitdown and ghouling with Al Capone.

8541576,0,t3_4wk8p5,MMN Imagine having a subreddit. Place said subreddit on a neural net. Give neural Net Sub to the playing with poop racecars wings of every mental ward on the face of the planet. Make interfacing at speed of thought. Watch chaos happen. But seriously its pretty hard to give the Network an aesthetic. The insane talk in riddles even those who are not completely cripplingly deranged. There will be times where things make sense to the character there will be times that its clear as mud. Sometimes information will come in whispers. Other times in cackling. Still others in screams. The way I always handled it was be as cryptic as possible in your role play of the network but allow wits and alertness rolls for the charcter to clarify what he has witnessed. High Humanity PCs Hard call. On the brightside they dont register to Lupines as the undead. On the Downside depending on company kept there is greater chance for degeneration as well as the madness that comes with losing yourself. As the ST its a difficult task to cater to one or  players vs the rest of the group without feeling like you are dicking someone over. On the other hand murder hobos is only entertaining for so long. My suggestion would be try to make the choice to stay high in humanity difficult  having the Beast inside is a bitch but attainable. If the rest of the group goes all Hobo with a Pickax but Steve the Shimmy manages to make his rolls and stay pure describe that moment of clarity for him. If the group goes out to spike toddlers like footballs but he stays back to focus on his own morality spend some time with him on that. Highlight the difficulty of his urges but have the player role play it out how they would deal with that situation. There is no greater tool in the ST arsenal than MEANWHILE BACK AT THE HALL OF THE CAINITE LEAGUE...Golconda Ah. The Myth. The Legend. There really isnt a great deal out there on how to attain Golconda just the rumours that one might be able to. Even Looking back into Chaining the Beast or some of the other supplements anything involving Golconda is very vague. somethings that may come in handy The novel Series Masquerade of the Red Death had Lamech the Cappadocian obtain it with a potion. The Transylvania Chronicles hints at Saulot not obtaining it but faking it. Children of the Damned implied Vlad Tepes was trying to attain Golconda but had difficulties. Ultimately I would suggest you take a look at some of these resources use what works discard what doesnt and work with your players. Note For a straight up VTM game the player may be able to rid himself of the BerserkShort Fuse but never the Curse of Brujah. Just putting that out there.

9288660,0,t3_57nkf3,I think the biggest easiest thing for you to do is first ask your players what sort of game they would have fun with. Combat heavy? Filled with political intrigue? Hunting for mysteries? The best stories are a combination of all but the best thing to keep in mind is that everyone including you should have a good time.Since they want to play as themselves you have a big head start on the problem. You presumably know at least a bit about each of your friends. What would interest them? What would confuse or throw them off? What can you do to push their buttons if you need to? Story hooks are about interest. If one of your friends is a womanizer set him up with a beautiful seductress. If one fancies himself a regular Sherlock Holmes dangle an unsolvable mystery in front of his eyes. Play to their strengths and their weaknesses. If its a story about getting sucked into the world of darkness and its seedy underbelly what is the best way to get each of them involved?If you just want general ideas dont be afraid to borrow general ideas from other stuff youre familiar with. Movies TV shows even music can all provide ideas. If none of you have really played before its okay to throw in a trope or two to get everyone comfortable before moving on to more complex material.

The important part IMO is that the identification changes over time like what style of clothing deemed feminine or masculin but in a lot of cases it has been rooted in the social roles based on the sexual dimorfism. Like violence and fighting in general is masculine because in most places through most of human history men were the fghtinghunting sex because they are often bigger thus physically stronger especially in upperbody and also because from the standpoint of the whole population theyre more expendable than women. So gender is indeed more fluid and changeable but often its distinctions are based on the bilogical sex.,WhiteWolfRPG,da3t6qg,1,t5_2u6fa

10013109,0,t3_5j0kka,Im not exactly sure what you mean by nonmechanical I think the things you are citing are a part of the mechanics of the game. Whenever the bar patrons do follow Alecs suggestion they feel warmer and a bit less sad that would lead me to believe that he is using Slip Knot Dreams to reduce their sorrow. Them accepting his suggestion is a loose interpretation of the Catch which is the target simply has to accept something from the Changeling in the last  hours. They dont know why they do it but it makes them feel good so they do.The shot glass also has mechanical weight it is an Emblem for a Corporeal Pledge. That shot represents the other Changelings pledge to him to return the favor. When he wants to call it in Im assuming he will drink the shot.Its hard to give specific advice about how to do this without knowing what kind of character you are playing. CtL characters are by far the most diverse of the White Wolf supernatural pantheon. Kith Seeming Court and Mantle each have subtle effects on how people perceive and react to you. People may unconsciously clear the way for a high Mantle Summer Court member because of a nagging feeling that they are the type not to be messed with. A devout Catholic may feel the urge to make the sign of the cross when crossing the path of a Witchtooth. It all fairly personal. As an added note whenever a mortal has entered into a pledge with a Changeling they know the agreement is significant. They dont exactly know how or why it is but they know deep in their heart that something bad will happen if they go against the bargain.,WhiteWolfRPG,dbcqjfm,6,t5_2u6fa

10745540,0,t3_5tn4u9,I would recommend looking in Hunter The Vigil. Especially if your players have a DnD background this can give a reminiscent feel of being the superheros beating up the baddies that go bump in the night. It can also give you an opportunity to sprinkle a lot of different creatures in your game  to firstly introduce your human characters to these creatures as monsters gives it a really fun twist when you start playing a vampire or werewolf or changling or what have you. There are several different kinds of Hunter groups. I recommend giving it a looksy.,WhiteWolfRPG,ddobk4r,8,t5_2u6fa

10849121,0,t3_5v2ipd,One of the other things to remember about Bloodlines is that its very selfaware. It understands quite thoroughly that the TTRPG sometimes descends into the silliness of trenchcoats and katanas and other absurdity that doesnt quite come across sometimes with the writing of the RPG books. It can quite successfully skirt the line between selfparody homage or love letter to the RPG depending on how you play it and how you play the RPG.,WhiteWolfRPG,ddz0dp1,8,t5_2u6fa
10857346,0,t3_5v7i61,Nice to see someone posting that has a decent Discipline spread I mostly see super low powered characters.  If I were you Id be hyped about Custom Devotions with a spread like that you could come up with some really cool stuff.Feral Whispers for Breaking and Entering is where its at imo.  Ask a rat to turn a deadbolt lock or maybe have a crow peck in a code to a security system unlocking it for you.  I also like using Summon the Hunt for search and retrieval.  Call in the animal squad give them something to go find and have them just leave it somewhere then come back a few nights later and pick it up.,WhiteWolfRPG,ddzux62,1,t5_2u6fa

If it takes a flaw to do that a normal kithain is not going to be hurt by touching regular iron.Now if you just didnt take to the game thats understandable.

11624839,0,t1_dgd8yub,Honestly I put that sort of thing down to bad storytellers. WW told us plainly in no uncertain terms time and time again that the power strata were not linear. That age was a major factor in NPC power especially with regards to methuselah and antediluvians. That these beings were NOT DampD dragons to be taken down at the end of a chronicle to grab the loot. They made some mistakes early on giving us raw stats for certain methuselahs and interpretations of what those stats might mean. So a lot of players saw this as something achievable. But the simple truth is that while a normal coterie of players might maybe be able to thwart some lowlevel plan of of some methuselah there should not be a circumstance where four or five generation  vampires could possible encounter a gen  vampire and win. Even the two early Diablerie books stressed this strongly... that the story should probably end with the deaths of the coterie unless the players hit every mark perfectly... and in both cases the methuselah was weakened in an incredibly dramatic way. Later books were far more careful. The listing for UrShulgi is probably the best possible example Stats dont matter. If your characters look at him the wrong way theyre dead. Period. Dont roll for combat. And hes just the servant and possibly eldest childe of a being whose power would dwarf his own. Most of the rd Generation arent even vampires anymore. Not in any sense that any coterie of players would possibly understand. And thats how you storytell them IF by some chance you MUST use an antediluvian in your tale.... which you probably shouldnt! Theyre operating on a whole other level. Haqim? Hes basically death on wings and probably doesnt even have a physical form any longer. Lasombra? Oh you thought he was diablerized during the Anarch Revolt? Not so much. He still exists and is now part of the Abyss... hell. He might even BE the Abyss. GangrelEnnoia? Shes earth melded with the entire planet and her anger is earthquakes and volcanoes and hurricanes. Literal Biblicallevel shit. And lets not even get started on Tzimisce. Bear in mind our conversation is about Caine! And Ive been describing beings who are two generations lower than him who havent been around anywhere nearly as long as he has who literally learned all their disciplines with some rare exceptions from him. For all storytelling intents and purposes hes a literal god. Good storytellers and players never even touch on the IDEA of Antediluvians. They and Caine are at best boogeyman tales that sires tell childer to get them to behave. A good storyteller should be able to take an environment like GothicPunk Chicago and work out storytelling worth years of  hours twice a weekgaming without ever even hinting at the existence of either of the Methuselahs in Chicago who are behind it all. ,WhiteWolfRPG,dgdor21,3,t5_2u6fa
