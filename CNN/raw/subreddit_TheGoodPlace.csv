9283539,0,t1_d8r2mr2,I feel like Friends in season  when they were all out of ideas and they put joey and Rachel together for no reason hahahaha,TheGoodPlace,d8sr85d,28,t5_3ekfb
9320000,0,t1_d8wjo9b,I like the idea of Jasons multiple lives! Maybe his good deeds are cumulative over his different reincarnations.,TheGoodPlace,d8xdmiv,3,t5_3ekfb
9512658,0,t3_5b0or1,That high school cafeteria scene was a prefect illustration of how Eleanor isnt good but she isnt that bad.,TheGoodPlace,d9lmyln,36,t5_3ekfb
10129134,0,t1_dbhr8n5,I disagree.  Its a comedy who cares if the episode progresses some overarching plot as long as its funny.  Look at How I Met Your Mother the best episodes had nothing to do with Ted finding his future wife.,TheGoodPlace,dbrtyex,17,t5_3ekfb

10288310,0,t1_dc2yiwf,I liked his portrayal of the character but I dont like the character very much. Im not sure he adds much because hes so onedimensional. Hes just an ass. Well played but I just think hes unnecessary. It will be interesting when Shaun shows up. ,TheGoodPlace,dca8i3u,2,t5_3ekfb

10438602,0,t3_5p0kec,Does anyone have an HQ shot of that graph hed made of them while presenting his idea? Him being Michael. Ive tried but I cant really make out the words and Ive love to see what notes he made and the analysis of how theyd torture each other.,TheGoodPlace,dcrafux,2,t5_3ekfb
10446322,0,t3_5plpyw,I think it would get only quickly if every season ended with a reset.  ,TheGoodPlace,dcs6ea8,4,t5_3ekfb
10447834,0,t3_5pmd8e,That would be interesting.  It might effect Janet subconsciously.  ,TheGoodPlace,dcscp2s,5,t5_3ekfb
10452122,0,t1_dcss8nk,Maybe hes some sort of enforcer rather than an architect like we see in the flashbacks.,TheGoodPlace,dcsukap,3,t5_3ekfb
10472655,0,t3_5pzzle,Keep in mind that Michael said at the very beginning that every religion got about  of the afterlife right.  Now we cant trust Michael in light of the recent revelation.  But there was nothing to gain about the percentages.   ,TheGoodPlace,dcv6m1j,24,t5_3ekfb

10483426,0,t3_5q11js,The trope of an enemy becoming an ally in order to face a bigger enemy is certainly possible. I think its unlikely that anyone here will accurately guess how that will play out since its unlikely that even Schur has written that far into the story at this point.That said I think its reasonably likely that such an alliance will happen at some point in the shows run but it shouldnt happen until there  is a planned final season. Such an alliance should happen with one or two seasons left depending on pacing so that theres room to build trust test that trust and still have a little bit of lead up to the final climax.,TheGoodPlace,dcwekyn,1,t5_3ekfb
