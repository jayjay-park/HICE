As there are never enough rematchers to go around in each exchange some people dont get a gift.  And we HATE IT when that happens.  However the way that matching works is that if you are shafted in an exchange an effort is made to pair you up with a known good gifter in the next exchange that you participate in.  From the feedback that has been received that seems to be working well!,secretsanta,cejupgd,1,t5_2rc6h

143256,0,t3_1votf4,Only participating in the HP gift exchange this time around because I wanted to be one of those cool gifters that puts a ton of time and thought into the gift that they send. I felt bad about this past Secret Santa because I just ordered stuff online and had it shipped to my giftee without wrapping or anything. Since I have been looking forward to this day since I signed up last week I retrieved my match immediately then spent about  hours finding a couple of things online. After I finished my orders I went to the store and bought about  more things then spent the past few hours personalizing them for my giftee! I really hope that she likes my gifts because I totally procrastinated studying for an important midterm to make her gift special... and may or may not have spent my monthly grocery budget on her bunch of gifts.  ,secretsanta,ceuqx3m,9,t5_2rc6h

Mark your gift as received! However since you received gifts from both your original Santa AND your rematch Santa you should check with an admin supportredditgifts.com to determine how to post the gifts so that both Santas receive credit. Also theres no need to wait until next year to rematch! New exchanges happen every month and you can participate in any of them or sign up to rematch for any of them. There are also still people who need to be rematched for Secret Santa this year so if theres money in your budget you should absolutely consider that.,secretsanta,cevodym,1,t5_2rc6h

Kids a newspaper is something that people used to pay for and it was thrown in their front yard every morning so that they could read all about stuff that happened the day before.The general consensus around here when it comes to homemade edibles is to ask your giftee if they are cool with it first.

What do I do?If your teacher asks for nothing but expensive items please contact supportredditgifts.com and we will look into it. If your teacher asked for an iPad or expo markers. Go with the markers. Some teachers include their dreamcometrue wishes along with the basics and thats okay. We try to remove requests for classroom sets of iPads or chromebooks. Let us know if one slipped through. The majority of teachers will be super happy to receive pencils or a ream of printer paper. ,secretsanta,cjx98jl,5,t5_2rc6h

2061655,0,t3_2ifpkw,On a similar note and this probably needs its own thread Id like to see an additional option when the secret santa system autosends those did you get your gift? things. Theres yes and theres no. If I check off no then theres a lovely black mark on my senders account. If I ignore it Ill eventually get the email once every couple of days. It gets annoying. There needs to be another option for other circumstances like  mailing issues so the buyer and seller have time to sort it out. In my case the item I was supposed to receive was custom so it took awhile. Im not comfortable with checking yes or no and the reminders are a nuisance after the fifth one or so. ,secretsanta,cl1vqmr,2,t5_2rc6h

I dont even know what to say about the tracking status thing. I mean my point is the only way to prove that I have shipped the stuff is by taking a picture of the things being in a box with the address of my giftee in the postal office. I cant guarantee that I can have an employee join the picture.. ugh..,secretsanta,cmwpwus,0,t5_2rc6h

Gifts have poured in from various places across the country and my heart is so full with joy and thanks.  My secret santa went above and beyond for my family and myself.

2597577,0,t1_cmxmxfs,Nope dont own a digital camera.  I own a film camera thank you very much.But you have just insisted that Redditgifts make it mandatory for everyone to provide a picture immediately.  Which means to participate all people who sign up are going to be required to own a digital film device.  Which means youre automatically excluding those who may not be able to afford one.  So unless Redditgifts is going to go out and purchase a digital camera for every participant that doesnt currently own one or says you can only participate if your economic worth is above a certain value your little tantrum of you not getting recognized isnt going to fly.  A great description from someone who doesnt own a camera is just as good.,secretsanta,cmxn27g,0,t5_2rc6h

2600133,0,t1_cmxxs3g,Theres not really a specific policy for missingstolen gifts. You will be getting a lot of emails reminding you to post your received gift because the system will think that you should have received it. Those are automated and you can just disregard them if you havent received anything. When the time comes that you are asked to report whether or not you received a gift you can mark no gift at that time and then opt in to rematching if youd like. ,secretsanta,cmxz3j0,1,t5_2rc6h

2603254,0,t3_2pnok5,I think a lot of people are feeling a bit like this but I implore you please try to keep the faith until after the deadline has passed. I am totally cool with seeing this post on December th but meanwhile your Santa is quite likely hard at work making your present extra special. Maybe they had a family emergency. Maybe their exams arent over. Maybe there was a special thing they wanted to send you the best thing of all the things that they felt you just had to have but they wanted to include a personal note so they sent it to themselves first. Maybe they have been writing you a long and thoughtful letter about everything they love about Reddit Secret Santa. Maybe they really want to make you happy and are struggling a bit trying to figure out how to do that. And so with generous thoughts of you preoccupying them they stop in to check on you every little while and read your posts. It must be a bit disheartening not to be believed in. It definitely takes some of the magic out of it for everyone especially you and your Santa. So keep the faith! I am going to start prescribing Arthur Christmas,secretsanta,cmydsr6,1,t5_2rc6h

2615129,0,t1_cmzww0t,Thats just disgusting.  If people do stuff like that and its verified that they did it or just didnt send anything do they lose the right to do it again?  I mean I know you can always just sign up for a new reddit account but.... Id hope theyd at least be ineligible with their current account.I spent  total gifts and shipping because I had SO MUCH in common with the girl I got.  I took so much joy in creating a gift for her and I couldnt decide which things to not put in her package so I ended up spending more than I had planned but that was absolutely my choice.  She received it yesterday and wrote me a very sweet note about it all.  Shes going to post pics today and I keep checking to see if she did yet!  I absolutely loved the experience so far and I consider it to be worth it even if I dont receive anything.A week or so ago my match told me she was a little behind on stuff and her original plan didnt work out so mine might be late.  Im still trusting that shell pull through for me but if she doesnt... Ill be disappointed but Im still glad I participated.  Ive been reading this subreddit and just tearing up and being so thankful that I was a part of this great thing.  I was on the fence before I signed up but Im so happy to be a part of something this fun and lovely this year. I dont get gifts from friends or family so this was my Christmas.Im a teacher and today is my last day with my students before we go on break and we got really shafted.  Im really surprised to be honest. A few families did small things but other classes pooled together and got their teachers large gift certificates to the local chamber of commerce to be used at shops restaurants etc.  Im trying hard not to feel badly or feel let down.  Holiday gifts are not why I teach. But I still feel yucky today.  So reading all of the SS stuff is making me feel happier.,secretsanta,cmzxosk,8,t5_2rc6h
2615171,0,t1_cmzxoav,Yes this is for real. LOL.  I wrap each present with lots of love! I go through crazy amounts of wrapping paper ribbon and bows each year.

During the holiday season post is often a lot slower. Especially if it wasnt shipped airmail. International packages on my experience can take anywhere from  weeks with  weeks being the average.

2702262,0,t1_cnb7v7a,Yeah my rematch giftee doesnt seem too bothered about receiving a gift either. Would be nice if rematches were only done for those who truely appreciates being gifted but that is too hard to administrate. Could be that your giftee just hasnt been online or seen your message. Mine is an active redditor but has not replied to any messages. I dont expect much from his gallery posting either. Fortunately my original giftee althiugh new to redditor posted a nice thank you in the gallery and I hope the rematch guftee likes his gifts whether he tells me or not  sorry for the rambling,secretsanta,cnb8jfl,2,t5_2rc6h

Its not like me sending my giftee stuff with my name monogrammed on it. I am NOT famous. I love the gifts they fit Snoop perfectly and the giftee was pleased. Snoop is active on reddit kind and generous. I for one would not expect a generic gift from a celeb... I would be so happy to have something so personal to the celebrity.

But when theyre posted in the sub you might be surprised at how quickly things that you might not think are complaints get completely out of hand before anything can be looked into by the admins.  Personally if you stated in your profile that you would be against such a donation I would totally contact the admins at supportredditgifts.com so that they can look into it.

I dont know what the median giving is for that exchange but if you cant make it work in your price range maybe message her.  Explain it.  That might be something someone who is better off could handle but if you cant do it you cant do it.  And you dont have to.You could email her and say Id love to help but I havent been able to find anything for that many kids in my price range. Is there something I can buy for the classroom that they can share?  Im a teacher and I cant imagine asking a Santa to send me something for each kid in my room.  It would never occur to me actually.Or if all else fails maybe contact Redditgifts and see if theres a way to rematch.  Explain that you cant afford to meet her request.

My giftees present was delivered only yesterday but what if he doesnt post anything? How do I get my credit back so I can do the next ones?

Now relax and go be a rematch for someone that has been shafted,secretsanta,covjp9b,0,t5_2rc6h
3251517,0,t3_2xcix9,Not Mexican but living in Mexico. Your package might be delivered within the next  years. Or it might dissapear. It might also dissapear and then suddenly appear on the giftees doorstep a few monthsyears later. There is no real way to know before the package is actually delivered. It also depends on where in Mexico the package should be delivered. Lots of towns have no real good system for addresses. Where i live you have addresses like Street X behind the yellow house after the green wall. People actually send mail to addresses like that.

3406654,0,t3_2z83ki,Im sorry that you didnt get a gift.  Sometimes it works out that way and it sucks and we HATE IT.  However the way that matching works is that if you are shafted in an exchange an effort is made to pair you up with a known good gifter in the next exchange that you participate in. That works really well.  Your gifter will be banned from all future exchanges if they cannot provide proof that they actually shipped something.  And if a rematcher doesnt follow through they are no longer allowed to sign up to be a rematcher and they will not be eligible to be rematched themselves in exchanges.  Also please remember that there is not a hard shipping deadline for rematchers so sometimes it can just take a while.  They may have pulled your information  days ago but the time frame between Matching Day and the shipping deadline is three weeks so  days isnt really all that long.  ,secretsanta,cpgl0pz,2,t5_2rc6h

She wrapped them in Justin Bieber wrapping paper which was really funny to me since I am NOT a fan at all. Sent me a Reddit Game of thrones shirt which has become my favorite shirt ever.  discs  I play disc golf  and the Pizza bible with a personal note from her inside. It was just perfect and made me smile for weeks. It also inspired me to take my gift giving to the next level. I think my giftee is gonna be pretty happy this year ,secretsanta,cxaoujh,2,t5_2rc6h

Also Im not sure where you are or where this was sent from but the southeastern US has been experiencing huge delays because weve had deadly tornados in a couple of states somewhere around  people and pretty bad flooding in many areas. Thats on top of the whole its Christmas so were already running several days behind deal.  Once some more time passes you will get an email that allows you to mark I received no gift on your exchange page. But if you were given this tracking stuff a week ago or less Id give it a bit more time.

6558799,0,t1_czxntah,Thats exactly it though.  I dont want a generic scarf or book or print just because its in my favorite color and thats probably what Id end up with.  I have enough scarves and books and I want to choose my home decor myself and based on something other than it being my favorite color.  I liked the variety of exchanges before because it offered guidance yet didnt limit people.  Coffee and Tea was great for exactly that reason  I knew Id receive items I had a practical use for since it was a theme I liked but I could ask people not to send me another mug or tumbler.  Theres a reason I chose not to participate in Secret Santa apart from rematching and its because the broadness is difficult not only as a shopper but also as a recipient.

7359356,0,t1_d2eowik,Im showing that out of the  exchanges that you have done the only other time that you did not receive a gift was for the Star Wars exchange in .  Since your Santa for the SciFi exchange did not mark your gift as shipped you will be eligible for rematching in Round .  Rematching is random and we almost never have enough rematchers to go around for everyone so there is no guarantee.  However if you do not get a gift in an exchange an effort will be made to match you to a known good gifter in the next exchange that you participate in.  That works really well most of the time.  Anyone who does not send a gift is banned from all future exchanges.  ,secretsanta,d2epihc,2,t5_2rc6h
7366471,0,t1_d2eb3mk,Fair point and generally I am thrilled to get anything. But I signed up for out of country for this one because it would be cool to get some foods or whatever from another country.

The way redditgifts is set up they will do their best to match you with a known good gifter in the next exchange you participate in this is automatic.It really does suck not to receive a gift the same happened to me in my first exchange.

7877587,0,t3_4n7mw6,Not sure if you are aware that your Santa and giftee are two different people except in very rare cases of people who choose domestic shipping and live in a country where there are very few participants.  If your Santa never sent a gift or is unable to prove they sent a gift they would be banned from future participation.Rematching is random and we never have enough volunteers to rematch everyone.

There is also the option to message your giftee anonymously through the redditgifts website to get more information.If you do decide to sign up and want some brainstorming help when you are matched just send me a message. ,secretsanta,d4m8x1h,1,t5_2rc6h

9475917,0,t3_5ajo4z,The risks of this exchange really should be stated up front. I got stiffed the very first time I tried this and didnt get a rematch either. Even if only  of people dont receive anything thats still  folks that get the short end of the stick. Just keep it in the back of the head that you may very well end up with nothing at the end of this exchange.

About a day or so after I knew there package would have arrived I check the profile again and it was filled out better specifically added in with ABSOLUTELY nothing from this genre that I had gotten them something from.

9625516,0,t1_d9zgy4z,The way I see it a user has had negative experiences a mod has looked into why and notices international shipping as a possible reason for the experience not going well. I dont know why a mod should skirt around a subject when being direct means the person in question can be helped quicker and other people reading the thread can also see all the details. When asking why they chose international shipping it doesnt sound accusatory. Its asking whether there is a reason. If the person specifically wants things outside of their country thats fine but if actually said person wouldnt mind more local things choosing domestic is more likely to be successful and thus result in a good positive gifting experience. Were all mostly adults here on reddit I think we should be able to communicate and understand each other while being relatively aware of the intention of each others words. A mod of redditgifts isnt going to try to make people feel bad theyre going to try and help people as best they can.,secretsanta,d9zjkdw,8,t5_2rc6h

Obviously you could take the results and decide not to use them but Id be curious what they are hopingexpecting youll do. You guys do a great job with quality control and those who dont send gifts are souring it for those who do.My suggestion though Im sure you dont need it would be to allow those who have old bans to be a rematcher at least once maybe twice. That way we know they are actually good for sending gifts.,secretsanta,da1s0xv,2,t5_2rc6h

And as with all hobbies the process of choosing the gear has rarely anything to do with being cool or flashy it has to be suited for the job and match personal preference. Also good quality comes at a steep price. You dont get a good gaming keyboard for  let alone mouse AND keyboard.This may sound harsh or negative but it really isnt meant that way.

10578783,0,t3_5rg9vq,The same thing happened to me too.  It was my second exchange and I got a note saying that my giftee had been shafted.  I sent an extra special gift and my giftee did not even post in the gallery.  USPS tracking said it was delivered.  I would have liked to see the post and if he liked it or not.

Ive dropped them a wee message each but having said that im not at all worried about whether or not my Santa messages me! I didnt hear anything from my Santa last year and it didnt impact my enjoyment of it at all. Edited to add that I got a very thoughtful pressie from my Santa last year and hadnt had any messages from her  I must have given her all the information she needed!,secretsanta,ddewtji,2,t5_2rc6h

10658216,0,t3_5shxyn,Dont be too nervous! Just have fun with the exchange. I doubt your santa will be confused. They probably appreciate that you took the time to write down your preferences so that they can find you the best gift. I know the only time Ive been confused is when someone leaves things blank or doesnt give me much to work with.,secretsanta,ddfbarb,2,t5_2rc6h
10665108,0,t1_ddfojux,Im showing that you chose international shipping. International shipping can sometimes take a very long time depending on where it was sent from how it was shipped and where it was going to. Also the possibility that something gets lost or misdelivered with international shipping is definitely higher than with domestic shipping. Its hard to say if something was actually sent or not it was marked as shipped. If it were me and I was going to do another exchange I would stick to domestic shipping.,secretsanta,ddg0whg,2,t5_2rc6h
10665668,0,t3_5sm6qv,Hmm.  Maybe something like a few small rain scented candles if its a girl?  Are you mailing a package? Just trying to picture mailing an umbrella XD. I do the same thing  one big item a few smaller ones  and little extras.  candy is my go  to extra  for my anime exchange Im using bags of Japanese hard candy instead of packing peanuts.

11053368,0,t3_5xua85,Im sorry that you didnt get a gift.  There is not the option to report No Gift from a rematcher.  The way that matching works is that if you are shafted in an exchange an effort will be made to match you to a known good gifter in the next exchange that you participate in. That works really well most of the time.  Anyone who doesnt send a gift is banned from all future exchanges.  And if a rematcher doesnt follow through they are banned from rematching as both a giver and a receiver.  ,secretsanta,dekvper,3,t5_2rc6h

11172948,0,t3_5yq1dy,Afraid of this happening what I usually do is I ask to take a picture of the parcel with postage stamps whether theres tracking or none regardless because therere still little stickers that are put on... for Canada Post anyways. Then I take a picture of the whole receipt that says Ive sent it and whether the tracking number is available or not. I think thats enough proof for me personally. Ive never needed to have my proof be verified yet because all of my giftees have gotten their gifts but well see for the one exchange Im having similar trouble now  Space Exchange. ,secretsanta,deyfwdl,2,t5_2rc6h

Even those that order on the less than  Ive been in enough emergency financial crises to give them the benefit of the doubt. Besides remembering the fact that a crappy or thoughtless gift has nothing to do with me and everything to do with the giver helps lessen the sting of disapointment.    ,secretsanta,dfzd71b,1,t5_2rc6h
