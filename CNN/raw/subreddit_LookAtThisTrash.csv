3863137,0,t3_2s954d,Tryin to deal with this juggernaut guy.First things first You have the wrong name in your character chart.Secondly is the power suit giving him any kind of bonus or is it just fancy armor?Following this the powers. First Madness Manipulation. The base mental willpower to resist the effects of this power is a bit high as a mental willpower of six is not an iota of resistance however in context represents significant mental strength.  The recovery from this needs to be brought down a bit. Also concerning recovery he must not be able to a absorb the madness from people that is implanted by him or b be able to absorb both madness and sanity. This would create a perpetual cycle that is not okay.Now Juggernaut Momentum. He cant be unstoppable. Especially with this wearing through thing.  How can you stop him? Speaking of which how fast does that happen? He cant be invincible while running. Currently while running you must be able to output enough power to level a city in order to reliably harm him. This needs to come down. His extreme strength should be limited to while he is running.Also I have concerns about this character being a part of a team. If he is designed to be used with multiple characters in a team I feel his power level should be lower than what it should be if he was a solo hero. With teams like this having all the characters be close to this power level isnt really going to fly.,LookAtThisTrash,cqwmri8,1,t5_34ey0
