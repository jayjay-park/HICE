10445507,0,t3_5pj8dv,Ill add my experience since I had a similar situation. I was leasing a  Civic Si vroom vroom because my last car died before I was ready for a new commitment. Was thinking about just buying out the lease but since it was as worth more than I owed I looked around for a used car to cut my monthly expenses. I test drove a  Honda Fit Sport and absolutely loved it. I missed having a sixth gear but its still a zippy car for a daily driver and I have no issues with the drop in horsepower. The things I like more than the Si holy crap I have room Ive always loved how practical hatchbacks are and I gained much better fuel economy without compromising reliability despite getting an older car with more miles. All that being said the fiesta st is a blast to drive. It seems like a good compromise between a sports hatch and a practical daily driver. The only worry would be long term reliability but if youre ok with that I think its worth taking on a test drive. ...but the Fit is still my pick! Good luck!,hondafit,dcs30hc,2,t5_2vc0t

10927880,0,t3_5w123k,We have a  Fit. With the custom sunscreen to fit the large windshield. That does make a huge difference. But the AC is not great. Im going as far as saying it sucks.  Using the AC with the Eco off seems to make a difference for us.    We bought the all weather season floormats at the dealer made for the Fit. Very similar to the WeatherTech type of mats. We just use them year round to protect the carpet. Or whatever that material is that slightly resembles carpet.    Definite yes on the mudguards. Keeps tar gum and other crap off the car.,hondafit,de74ucg,2,t5_2vc0t
