92208,0,t1_cc116mr,gt For example A lot of mages I know used Frostcanist in MC and into BWL because it gave frost damage.Are you sure you arent misremembering that? I dont believe there was ever any gear called frostcanist. The T set was Arcanist Regalia and it just gave  spell damage. Mages were wearing that into starting into MC to get T Netherwind Regalia. Rags dropped the legs most of the other pieces came from BWL. The set didnt give frost damage but fire resist which was extremely welcome when you were farming MC.I could very well be wrong I played a warrior in Beta and a rogue all through Vanilla so I didnt pay a ton of attention to cloth.,hiddenwow,ceoxe30,1,t5_2vg52
