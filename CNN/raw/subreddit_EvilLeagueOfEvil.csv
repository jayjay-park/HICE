11323672,0,t3_61lm5y,I have an idea. Its risky but it may keep us all alive for a few more days. We need to get the nonELOE teams to start voting against the Cowboys Steelers and Packers more. If we can diversify their vote it will take pressure off of the Patriots our hate shield who is barely surviving each day. The Cowboys Steelers and Packers havent been in danger of getting voted out yet so taking some of the edge off of the Patriots could give us a cushion.To execute this plan wed need insiders. We need members real or fake of non ELOE fanbases to create chaos. We would need a significant amount of people saying to vote Cowboys a significant amount saying to vote Packers and a significant amount saying to vote Steelers. If CowboysSteelersPackers manage to absorb even just  of the votes the Patriots got yesterday thats enough for a comfortable margin of victory.Thoughts?It appears as though the rCoalitionAgainstEvil is unintentionally making this happen,EvilLeagueOfEvil,dffipok,21,t5_2vp1v

ELOE isnt some flybynight sub that just sprung up. We are veteran shitposters and memelords of the highest order. Our brotherhood runs deep. What they fail to realise is that  Getting our  to be the top  is the goal. Sure Id love the ers to ultimately win but Id honestly rather see any of my ELOE brothers win than any of the pleb teams.  We know that if we turn on each other we are all doomed. None of us can win if we go it alone nevermind top  or even top . They think the Pats and daBoys are going to turn Brutus on the Giants only to be picked off by the mongrels nipping at our heels next? Maybe if they had any experience in winning they would understand how to do it. ,EvilLeagueOfEvil,dfkak52,26,t5_2vp1v

In my years following the NFL present there seem to be an inordinate number of quarterbacks that have been thrust into the game before theyve had adequate time to learn.  RG III is a perfect example.  Tons of promise oodles of talent but the Redskins shove him in and his inexperience regarding staying in the pocket leads to serious injury.  I believe hell never be the hall of famer he might have been due to team mismanagement.  Some guys can walk right on the field from college but I think they are very rare.  The successful ones usually sat for some time learning.,EvilLeagueOfEvil,dgv4kpo,1,t5_2vp1v
