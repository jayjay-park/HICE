7825356,0,t3_4kstg5,I think being a famous person can bring lots of benefits. Being a celebrity you can buy lots of things you want have lots of holidays and have lots of opportunities to travel to lots of places and different countries while you are working. Although some people may think being a celebrity may also have lots of problems such as having no secrets or privacy in your life and you had better be perfect etc. From my point of view I think it is worth it and I could bear it. Once you choose to be a star as your job you can imagine those kind of things happening one day. If you are a celebrity it means your dream came true. Your dream is that everyone watches you and because you are famous you draw everybodys attention. There are lots of people who always dream of being a celebrity one day but not everybody can make it. So I think that being a celebrity brings more benefits than problems you probably like the life and enjoy these kinds of problems.Corrected with the help of uEnglishTutorMatt.,EnglishTutoring,d3vmxai,1,t5_3c0bp
