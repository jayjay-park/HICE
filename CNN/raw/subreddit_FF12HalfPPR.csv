2297841,0,t1_clvg9xa,this guy gets it. TEs are so overrated unless you have the top  or  and even then nothing is guaranteed like having a Luck at QB or Forte at RB. grab daniels if you can. i have a very similar situation on my teama nd im just playing Daniels unless i can get thomas gronk or graham for not much. people over evaluate TEs way too much in FF.,FF12HalfPPR,clvq8v2,2,t5_33prp
