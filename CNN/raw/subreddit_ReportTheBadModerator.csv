11505852,0,t1_dg06lfm,gt No my problem is the fact that were now only talking about my choice of wordsYou came here with a complaint related to being banned. The problem is that you refuse to see why you were banned.My comments to you and one of the subs moderators are clear. I understand your comment dont feel its racist and disagree with their interpretation of it. But you were banned for your comments after that.They wont admit to being wrong because they arent wrong. There are multiple people here telling you that YOU are wrong. You should probably self reflect and analyze that.,ReportTheBadModerator,dg06tfi,2,t5_2x4sd
