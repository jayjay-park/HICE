343278,0,t3_1y0sqs,Oomph this is so beautiful I hate being relatively broke. One day... In other exciting news Im bringing my older sister in next week! She wants a helix though she might go conch now that Ive introduced her to the world outside of standard mall piercings. This also means I can FINALLY get that daith Ive been talking about for months Im stoked. ,Legitpiercing,cfgcm96,2,t5_305lh

939822,0,t1_chb3c5c,Oh thats new I hadnt heard that before. Will need to do some research about that. I was always under the impression that it didnt damage the surface and if it did it was on the micron level. ,Legitpiercing,chb43ft,1,t5_305lh
1092889,0,t3_26lqbr,uIIIPowerIII has it right. All materials will have an effect on gums and teeth. Its a common misnomer that things such as silicone or acrylic help. They dont. Theyre just as detrimental to teethgums. With that said we need a bit of clarification. What size is your lip piercing at?,Legitpiercing,chsik5z,5,t5_305lh

2085630,0,t3_2iplqa,Ive had my daith pierced since March and Ive got a cluster in mine too. Ive worn Klipsch Image Ones since I got it pierced with no problems. I dont like inear headphones because I have to move my jewelry out of the way to put them on and I dont like irritating it if I dont need to. ,Legitpiercing,cl4xgtp,3,t5_305lh

2276521,0,t3_2lapn2,First a question. Is there anything safe to moisturize the areola around my not yet totally healed nipple piercing?  I obviously wouldnt be putting anything ON the piercing site but my skin is SO dry now that the air is getting cold and dry.Now a quick rant maybe someone has words of wisdom.  The extra length on my nipple bar is causing some irritation so I keep wanting to get my bar downsized.  I swear to god the second I decide to make the trip I live over an hour from Rockstar my nipple swells usually over night  maybe from rolling over wrong on it so I have to baby it for a couple weeks until its healthy again at which point the cycle starts over again...I just want it to heal dammit! ,Legitpiercing,clt3hjz,4,t5_305lh
3083611,0,t3_2vgwzm,My understanding is that aftercare for piercings typically isnt meant to kill off bacteria so much as it just keeps the area clean so the body can do its thing and heal itself. Thats why most piercers suggest saline solution it doesnt agitate the healing piercing or clean the wound it just helps promote the ideal environment for the best healing.,Legitpiercing,cohm58u,5,t5_305lh

5003363,0,t3_3jg2i2,Your piercing looks to have been performed poorly with inferior quality jewelry unfortunately. I would strongly suggest finding a more reputable local piercer for assistance in person.  ,Legitpiercing,cup3cm6,3,t5_305lh

7107092,0,t3_4cwk4r,Ive had my tongue pierced for  years and Ive never actually chipped a tooth however there have been times when Im eating and as my tongue is moving around my mouth Ive chomped down on the jewelry so hard that I was afraid I might chip a tooth and I have no doubt that its possible. It feels awful. There are also times Ive had to take it out for a while days because my inside gums right below my bottom front teeth gets irritated from the barbell rubbing against it. Edit I dont think clicking it playing with it against your teeth causes damage but its REALLY annoying to the people around you and it makes one look like an idiot. ,Legitpiercing,d1lypli,5,t5_305lh

7716110,0,t1_d3iifv9,No worries!  I personally would highly recommend getting both done at once then you only have to psych yourself up for that pain once.  Unless of course you enjoy it then by all means get them done separately. P But Id also recommend it so that theyre healing at approximately the same rates.  Totally up to you though.One more tip this is a pretty good resource for nipple and genital piercing info.  I would agree its pretty hard to find info on those ones.,Legitpiercing,d3j9ovu,2,t5_305lh
7877729,0,t3_4n7b8w,All septum piercings can have a little bit off a smell if you will. Sometimes its caused from low quality jewelry or improper cleaning. I personally have noticed it even when both of these things are taken care of I wear gold and clean it daily but its nothing to to super stress on. ,Legitpiercing,d41j2jc,4,t5_305lh

10202061,0,t3_5lxkqo,Okay So Im gonna lock this down and give our response as a mod of the sub.Saline soaks can work when theyre done correctly and with the correct saline solution. When were talking about a sterile saline solution Sterile Wound Wash and using sterile nonwoven gauze then yes soaks can sometimes be helpful in certain circumstances. Cotton roundspuffsswabsetc can have some issues. Mainly the fact that the fibers can become caught in the jewelry or piercing and in turn can cause issues and irritation.The only real issue that I can see at this point is making the saline yourself. Please please please stop doing this. This goes for everyone. When you attempt to make the solution yourself the balance is basically impossible to get correct. The saline solution needs to be isotonic and youre not going to make an isotonic solution in your kitchen with such rough measurements.To address a couple of the other comments that were made Stop suggesting HOcean. It contains lysozymes that people may be allergic to. This is the main reason most professionals stopped carrying this years ago. Boiling water with a pinch of salt is NOT a proper aftercare procedure.,Legitpiercing,dc0glbz,6,t5_305lh

10951922,0,t3_5wd7nu,Definitely get her two cents on it but generally speaking a forward facing piece wont necessarily be any easier. Mind you this is coming from a large handed piercer haha. Tell Hannah that Brett from Illinois said to take good care of you!,Legitpiercing,de9m2tt,2,t5_305lh
