5880857,0,t1_cxqic40,well ... Id prefer to keep the shaming in this thread limited to nocontact snipers.  Well have a larger shaming thread down the road for those who shafted so we could probably work nopics in with the shafters. ,secretsniper,cxqih5w,4,t5_2s1oi
5914567,0,t1_cxux55s,Good to know! Though I usually end up losing mm cases in the grass or mud before I have to retire a piece even after being reloaded a halfdozen times or more. These cases have a long happy life ahead of them. Cant say the same for the projectiles though. Thanks again! D,secretsniper,cxuxk41,1,t5_2s1oi

9914852,0,t1_dazkcrx,Yeah. It shipped as a  cal plastic ammo can inside a plastic  cal can. I think its this  to give you fair warning though you cant close the  cal can with the mags in the configuration as pictured due to the handle cut out in the lid. You can stack all the mags on the right side as pictured. The left side you can stack  mags upright and you have to lay the other  or  on their side. Still a great compact  way to transport mags. Im curious if you could stack them all upright with a metal  cal can. ,secretsniper,dazxgc1,1,t5_2s1oi
