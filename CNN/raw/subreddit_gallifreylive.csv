329543,0,t1_cfabxs1,Really? I was always of the idea that the Doctor encountering them so many times afterward actually facilitated them in becoming so powerful. ,gallifreylive,cfexf9u,2,t5_302p7
334743,0,t3_1wus1w,He comes off as gruff and unlikable. He seems to be morally superior to Ian and Barbara and can even be a little aggressive. Ive seen a few episodes and know that he does soften up a little so I look forward to seeing the character progression into the personable presence we know and love today.,gallifreylive,cffgst1,1,t5_302p7

715485,0,t1_cgllltm,As much as I would love to pay for them all at  dollars a piece and there being easily more than  audios I definitely cant afford it. Ive downloaded a good portion of the audios from that torrent and my computers fine. I assume its safe!,gallifreylive,cgllrcg,3,t5_302p7
1023109,0,t1_cg9jvq0,I loved that Napoleon scene as well. Did the Doctor ever meet him? That would be interesting  a visit with Napoleon.,gallifreylive,chkl18r,1,t5_302p7
2855847,0,t3_2st694,Sad that I couldnt find time to watch Hartnell and Troughton but Im making sure to watch Pertwee. Pertwee was my first Doctor and thisll be the first time Ill rewatch his whole run with this Inferno and Carnival of Monsters already rewatched over the years.That said this might be one of my absolute favourite stories at least Top . Everything about it works it looks gorgeous the villain is great the monsters are unforgettable its perfectly paced and it just feels like a breath of fresh air. Theres also something so modern about it and I think this An Unearthly Child Rose and The Eleventh Hour are probably the best starting points of the show.Also the freaking BrigadierI absolutely cant wait to fall in love with Pertwees Doctor again,gallifreylive,cnspkr1,5,t5_302p7
