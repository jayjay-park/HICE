7317118,0,t3_4f9bsc,JUST finished my first draft!  Huzzah!  Was a little distracted from client work that I had over the last month but Im back on track now!  Plan over the next few weeks is to revise edit and finalize some of the minigames that I have sketches and charts of and translate them into the appropriate formats.I will also get started on some finalized sketches in the next week or so to get a break from staring at word processors and spreadsheets.,vndevs,d29wnge,1,t5_2zmuz
11723093,0,t1_dgofusm,To show the other side of the coin OP for me it looks like your goal is to learn C and you want to build a VN engine and game to practice it. If that is your goal by all means go for it. Using a proper library creating a window and drawing a shape is not so hard And there exists tutorials that will teach you how to show images and text and play sounds based on user input or when you want. Building a VN engine is not the same as building a VN. It might be a lot easier or a lot harder depending on your skills.If your goal is to create a VN using Renpy is going to be a lot easier and using Renpy will also help you understand what a VN engine is.If your goal is to build a VN engine or learn and practice Cmaking games dont be discouraged and definitely try out the C way!,vndevs,dgoucmt,2,t5_2zmuz
