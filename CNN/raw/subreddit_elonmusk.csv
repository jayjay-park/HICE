It was no skin off your back if the companys profits dipped unless they got to a point where they had to make cuts and you would lose your job. Im sure you didnt think that refusing service to a customer would affect your income thats why you did it.Elon is the face of his brand. People are not investing in Tesla they are investing in Elon. When he goes off the deep end like this it makes investors question the man at the helm. It was childish and investors dont want emotional and reactionary folks in charge of making them money.This is not the first time that he has made an ass of himself in public. In fact it seems like he has been doing it with increased frequency. Remember his immature twitter outbursts against Jeff Bezos? the stock market is taking note of this and is starting to question their investments. This is the last thing that Tesla needs in the face of low gas prices in the foreseeable future.

Heres what Ive learned from life and university and I hope you wont make the same mistakes you have to do something because you genuinely enjoy the act of doing it not the fame or glory. You can major in physics but from experience I can tell you its not an easy major. If you do not LOVE physics youre going to make yourself miserable. Youll crack under pressure of not being able to live up to your own expectations. Do not put too much thought into what you want to do when youre   just keep taking classes explore new things and see what you like. If you find a subject that makes you excited to get out of bed then major in that. You can keep the career prospectives for that major in the back of your mind but the main thing is that when you go to bed on Sunday you feel excited about going back to classes the next morning. I bet a lot of people tell you that youre young and you shouldnt think about your future as much as you do but they are absolutely right. Please do not center your whole life on being like Elon. Doing this will make you far too narrow as a person. What happens if life doesnt turn out well for you and youve dedicated  years of your life on trying to be like him? Youve made it the sole mission in life to be like Elon and you find out its not going to work out. What happens is that youll base your whole identity your entire selfworth on the mission. Once the mission turns out to be a bust youll realize that without the mission you have nothing. There would be no difference between you and an ordinary person  there never was. Do not try to be like Elon. Instead try to be like you. What does it mean to be you? Only you have the answer to that. Go out join a sport or a club get laid always use protection and live your own life instead of trying to live Elons.,elonmusk,d6lkhpw,3,t5_2tr91
