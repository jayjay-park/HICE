9512264,0,t1_d9k1hbc,Didnt really fail at Villa or Blackburn he did exactly what he was supposed to do keep them in their respective divisions. People often forget he had his hands tied at both clubs no money and one of which was run by the Venkys. His record at Norwich is nothing to be sniffed at and he did that without breaking the bank. Perfect choice for me.,WWFC,d9ll7n7,1,t5_2sa1w
