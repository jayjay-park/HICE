Question for OP So depending on how much money the individual weight the individuals decisions based upon how much of an economic victor they or their ancestors were is somehow better than democratic institutions which assumes each individual is equal and basing the societys decisions on how persuasive the ideas being shared?

Unlimited privacy. Unreasonable privacy. That is not realistic in a modern world. You guys operate only on fear the fear of transparency.You live in a world where you are afraid of people knowing about what you do at home in your computer. It wouldnt surprise me if many of you pirate movies and smoke marijuana and are deathly afraid of government agencies because of such activities being mostly illegal yet accepted by society.Im not saying this to piss you guys off. Im not saying this to tell you that you shouldnt pirate movies or you shouldnt smoke whatever you want. Im telling you that you guys are so full of yourselves that you actually think a national agency that deals with the most important security issues in world politics would ever be concerned about you or your friends or your loved ones etc. Or maybe some of you think well when I get older Im going to become president. Therefore I sure hope the NSA isnt recording everything Ive been doing on the internet. Thats just absurd. The amount of data we are talking about here are in the yottabytes and zetabyteseven if they had a datacenter the size of Rhode Island to fill up that data lets assume in the future they do because the one in Utah can barely store probably  petabytes they would never be able to sort through all that data and that simply isnt an important issue at all. I mean there are people in other countries who became prime minister after being an exconvict. There is such a thing as statute of limitation.Basically you guys want an unreasonable amount of privacy and you also have an unreasonable amount of paranoia about the government.Theres no limit to what you want private.

3169931,0,t1_coqiaje,Well indeed. But the FBI has a long institutional tradition of overreach of confusing legitimate dissent with subversion. Over the years Ive come across many things to suggest this is not so much willful tactical conflation as a simple inability to understand the distinction. One thing that troubles me the most is how very monocultural it is. That means that it must miss and misread cultural cues all the time. Its one of the many things that cause me to wonder how much value there is in massive electronic interceptions if they are as likely to misread communications in much the same way as a parent trying to decipher tweens texting one another.None of the Snowden revelations have done a thing to reassure me that my suspicions are unfounded. Theyve largely confirmed them. The fact that Snowden and Chelsea Manning for that matter were able to do what they did shows a reliance on very superficial things  on the order of proving you are an American by knowing the score of the last Yankees game.It seems from my perspective that they are very vulnerable to social engineering. It makes me cringe to think how likely they are to completely misunderstand data intercepts  and of course its now very easy to tickle their confirmation biases. FBI attempts to communicate their mission  particularly their Hollywood associations  seem designed to project this flaw as a virtue.If you know they may be listening  its not a difficult step to start telling them things you want them to hear.,restorethefourth,coqk8m4,4,t5_2xhsu

This Change should prevent account abuse although some of affected victims will not share that feeling by any means.TEAMVIEWER SECURITY CHANGES COME AFTER THE FACTSTheMerkleUnauthorised Access TeamViewerThere has been a lot of commotion over the past  hours regarding the breach of TeamViewer accounts. A lot of users reported their login credentials being abused and some users even lost some funds in the process. So far there is still no indication as to what happened exactly and what the company will offer as compensation.While the investigation is still underway the company managed to implement two new security features. Trusted Devices and Data Integrity as these new features are called will ensure account safety. The first option lets users mark new devices as trusted assuming they are logging in to that machine with an existing account. An automated email is generated during this process and users will need to click a link to confirm the status.Data Integrity on the other hand tries to analyze account behavior and flag anything out of the ordinary. Login attempts from an unknown IP address for example should be identified immediately. If events like these transpire the account owner will need to reset their password. Perhaps not the most elegant of solutions but its something functional at least.Moreover TeamViewer acknowledged its software has been used for unauthorised access and users have lost funds in the process. However it is difficult to pinpoint the cause and given the number of data breaches on other platforms it is possible some customers used the same credentials for multiple services. Nothing has been officially confirmed yet though.What remains of particular concern is whether or not TeamViewer users with FA enabled were affected by these breaches as well. Several users mentioned how it is possible to use the login and password when connecting remotely which does not require FA verification. More information will be provided as it becomes available.,restorethefourth,d3x445u,1,t5_2xhsu

Its meant to get you to use them more but it can also turn into a filter on what you see politically.But theyre easily defeated. When you search use Incognito mode for your browser. Google wont remember what youve seen before. Your searches will be different especially if you search on political things.For Facebook you will have to Like pages that are very different from your politics to see more. Also go to your friends pages not your main feed to check up on them. Youll see more things they did that Facebook doesnt show.Also please seek counseling. It sounds like youre having trouble processing some things going on right now.  Its okay to get help.,restorethefourth,d7qhg21,15,t5_2xhsu

10520473,0,t1_dd0lpo6,OK so here is the disconnect I think. The press has absolutely no legal protection except from censorship. If a cop says disperse that includes reporters. Cops tend not to arrest reporters because of the backlash.  If a reporter is breaking any law it is the same as a private citizen. This gets tricky with classified information handling but we are talking about protests. Press credentials are a helpful in controlled access areas and sometimes the cops will go easy on you. However the value of the press credentials is basically as good as the reputation of the reporter or syndication. Having a body to even track who isisnt a journalist has way too many practical problems to get into. And would be used to persecute journalists who attack the governing body that controls the credentials. Look at White House credentials which are needed and appropriate because its a controlled area. Trump is using pulling them to threaten journalists he doesnt like. Imagine that nation wide. ,restorethefourth,dd0ly0b,3,t5_2xhsu
