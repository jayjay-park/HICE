252284,0,t1_cf6tuwu,California California Penal Code f considers public intoxication a misdemeanor      Law enforcement is permitted to take a publicly intoxicated individual into protective custody      Detainee agrees to remain at the sobering facility until the staff consents to his departure usually up to four hours      If a person is being combative they will be taken to jail      A detainee under f will not later be prosecuted in court  So regardless of how the lady and other vocal people felt the officer was within the law and operating in the general public interest.  The drunk guy was NOT within his rights to be publicly drunk or not to comply with an officers orders.  In a few hours after sobering up hed be released and not charged even if he was combative.  Thats actually pretty fucking generous anyone else whos combative against an officer would face charges.  Personally if I were observing Id feel the action was entirely warranted I may have called  myself and if anything were getting out of hand Id assist the officer.  I hope most citizens would not hesitate to do so as well.  Anyone who is reacting negatively because they think every cop is going to beat and shoot every black man is WAY out of line.  Grow up people there are thousands of legitimate police incidents every day.  Not every time an officer takes an action is he abusing someones rights or going to kill someone.  If people get so intoxicated they cant control themselves in public they ought to be detained not just for other peoples safety but for their own safety.  They could easily walk in front of a truck fall onto BART tracks or become a crime victim themselves.  This idiot was talking about giving away thousands of dollars a scammer could easily overhear and target this guy.  ,bayarea,cf6wji9,28,t5_2qjyy

430847,0,t1_cfpecy3,Funny thing happened to me once. This guy in a manual transmission Dodge Challenger had parked across from me in a mall parking lot during my lunch break. As I look through the restaurant window to my brand new GS MT about . months old I notice the Dodge is slowly rolling out of its spot and I just shake my head because I know what he did. But soon I realized that the Dodge was headed straight for my cars front bumper. I ran out and there was nothing I could do but watch it slowly impact my car. Unbelievable.Not only had the guy failed to set his parking brake he had left his car in neutral. Thats bad driving.More recently I bought a  Grand Cherokee Overland last month. The car was  DAYS old when it got a rearend full of Civic Si driven by some college girl. This was at a yielding intersection with a car in front of me no damage to the car in front since I gave it adequate space.  DAYS. The car was in the shop longer than Id owned it by the time I got it back. That is friggin sad.If you dont notice bad driving on the freeway then open your eyes. You still have to be careful of bad drivers. These are people that never use their turn signal so they arent cut off. Also how about those people that wont let others pass so they start tailgating the car in front of them. Or there are those that just always tailgate even in rain. Lets not forget about left lane hogs that dont understand how to let other cars pass to the left. Or how about cars that dont understand how to come to a complete stop. Virtually nobody I see makes a complete stop at a stop sign or right turn on red. NOBODY. So if you dont notice this one then you must do it too. These all may seem minor but when youre going  on the freeway one little slipup can lead to disaster. Its irresponsible and dangerous to drive like this and I find it extremely hard to believe that you dont see this every day you drive on the freeway.Like I said though theres nothing you can do to change these peoples bad habits. Their children will learn how to drive from them and nothing will be solved until we have autonomous cars. The best thing to do is just stay calm and drive as safely as possible.,bayarea,cfpf7kq,14,t5_2qjyy

468952,0,t1_cftkddn,Okay. First of all pizza is a comfort food which one associates with home and the pizza one grew up with. I would not hold up Newton Highlands Greek Style pizza as the best in the world but I would shoot someone to get a slice right now because it reminds me of home. So thats a built in bias I was trying to explain  pizza places for me here dont have that quality of being local staples of food provision to the neighborhood. This is generally for positive reasons the diet here is less carb based food is of a generally higher quality there are fewer chain restaurants etc. So the neighborhood pizza place is not a staple. I expect there are ways to explain this culturally as well.Second pizza dough is pretty simple  flour water a little bit of yeast. So the difference in water from one coast to another is much more noticeable than in a more complicated type of dough. Its not a better or worse thing  its a difference. And because as I said pizza is a food which one has a lot of associations with outside of food the pizza here will never be right. For better proof note that the best pizza place in LA is run by a guy who flies in NYC tap water to make it so this isnt just me being crazy. It makes a huge difference in taste and consistency.Hopefully that flushes it out a little. Again  across the board  the food here is better but the pizza is wrong. Not bad just wrong.

Mountain View at the very least is wellconnected to VTA and CalTrain so can get away with a bit less local housing than might otherwise be required. Perhaps retail core or commercial core might better describe MV. I would agree that everything north on the peninsula does seem hopeless.Housing costs are a nightmare everywhere and will be a huge drag until if theyre addressed. I know I couldnt afford to buy my condo today.As to parts of the South Bay other than San Jose Campbell seems to be taking some baby steps in the right direction and Sunnyvale once seemed to be but has since regressed. Santa Clara is in waitandsee mode with the developments around the new Niners stadium. Milpitas seems to be building itself up around the Great Mallwhich is kinda weirdbut may work for them.I guess a lot of it depends on how successful San Jose is in actually making itself the Capitol of Silicon Valley.

539957,0,t1_cg1jt8k,If weve proven one thing with rent control its that you cant artificially make prices lower.

542346,1,t1_cg1w105,My point regarding minimum wage is that we choose as a society not to strictly follow the laws of supply and demand. The minimum wage is a price floor on labor. According to your own logic the same thing applies to rent control. Its a price ceiling on property. They would both be considered inefficiencies according to that point of view. There might be arguments against rent control but I think if you use price control as an inefficiency as one of those arguments you should at least be consistent with it.Rent control exists because in the absence of it landlords are able to boot longtime residents when they choose to hike their rents. It allows them to exploit people like the elderly or those with children who they know will have difficulty moving. In contrast rent control prevents bubbles like the tech bubble from gutting our city of the low and middleincome people who have lived here for decades. So it raises prices on new apartments. Excuse me if I dont shed a tear for the techies that want to move here.,bayarea,cg1x64x,0,t5_2qjyy

I definitely agree with your point that texting even while in stop and go traffic adds some element of danger and encourages people that its okay. In all honestly though I think that as long as youre not a dumbass you can handle texting under that condition and that condition only. To say that people will creep up their texting speed is a slippery slope fallacy so Im not going touch that. I think texting at mph is ok for competent drivers. Do I think everyone should do it? No because some people can barely handle driving without texting. I just dont like how this vigilante is trying to shame people who are texting in stop and go traffic.

1116441,0,t3_26vrt4,I have mixed feelings about automated license plate readers.On one hand I love tech I love automating things and this automates away the problem of catching stolen cars and wanted cars and whatever.On the other hand our police enforcement is predicated on a certain amount of inefficiency. A cop can follow you around all day every day but it costs a lot of time money to do so so unless theres a good reason to be followed around its very unlikely that you will be. On the other hand if we bring in all of these passiveautomated tools meaning not just efficiency boosters  like cars for example being more efficient than horses or like computer records being more efficient than paper records  but things that work entirely autonomously requiring no input we lose that inefficiency and suddenly it doesnt cost money or time to track you. Now a cop who wants to know where youve been just types in your license plate and hits refresh five times a day. Far easier to use for justice and far easier to abuse for injustice.I think a balance could be struck if the addition of autonomous devices meant the reduction of police force. If you can track everyone all the time when theyre out driving then you need X fewer cops on the road watching out for specific cars right?

From what I remember the backpacking is all firstcome firstserved. Generally the nearby campsites fill up fast on weekends but since youre willing to do  miles round trip youll have no problem finding a campsite.If you really want to get out into the remote areas Id suggest you bring along mountain bikes with racks. Strap your packs to the bikes bike out aways along the fire roads until you get to a trail junction then lockstash your bikes in the bushes off trail and start your hike from there.

1446155,0,t1_cixi807,gt Sex workers wouldnt mind being registered if sexwork was legal. See Holland or Australia for ready examples. Sex workers in those countries are safer than their American counterparts and are NOT social pariahs.Even in those countries there are people that dont want to be registered.  Once you are in a database it is almost impossible to get out of it.  So a person could retire and then  years later have the database get leaked.gt Sex Workers will not be persecuted socially if their profession is legal because any of those methods of persecution  such as the housing discrimination you referenced would become illegal.Please grab a paid of paper go to Safeway or wherever and ask people coming in if they would answer this one question survey Would you feel comfortable with a neighbor that was a prostitute andor had patronized a prostitute assuming both acts were legal?  Let us know what results you get.Discrimination can be justified in any way.  They arent a good fit is a goto excuse it can be very difficult to prove discrimination occurred.  And there can be legitimate reasons for this in housing like an apartment or condo a sex worker might have johns coming and going that means potential strangers.  At a job if it gets out some coworkers might start harassing the former sex worker.gt Employment is another issue  teachers get fired all the time because they used to be sex workers or burlesque dancers. While that remnant of virulent Patriarchy remains in society the legal protections for a tenant are much more effective than those for an employee.It doesnt seem like a good idea to force people to suffer social stigma while we wait for patriarchy to go away.gt Not the sex workers that I know...They do it because they get off on it. They live in nicer apartments than I do and I work for a law firm NOT BROKE. My ex was a stripper and knew the woman in the article..and many girls like her. That young lady is not poor was not forced into prostitution and made her own choice as she reaffirmed in the article. Not all prostitutes need to be saved.First not all sex workers are going to be in the same circumstances.  Given that you work at a law firm I am guessing you are at least a clerk.  If you decided to patronize a prostitute not accusing you of doing this you probably wouldnt try to go low budget.Second part of a prostitutes job is to convince johns they are enjoying it to generate repeat business.  Maybe some people have reluctanceresistance fetishes but it is a thin line between crying for pretend and crying because they are being raped.  Assuming a person believes that consent is impossible when one is desperate enough.Third high price can be a way to build trust not just to build value.  If someone is paying hr well it is probably more profitable to get that john as a repeat customer than to try to rip them off.  So the john trusts the worker to be there just for the money.Fourth we lie best to ourselves.  There are loads of psychological experiments where they tested the impact compensation has on enjoyment.  One example was a boring activity that rewarded the participant with either   or .  Then they had the person come back a week later for a follow up.  The test was how the subject answered a question How is the test? when asked after their initial activity and on the repeat visit a week later.  When asked at the end of the test they all responded pretty negatively.  Those paid  didnt change their answer after a week while those paid  had their opinion move in a positive direction.And that doesnt factor in the rationalizations we manufacture to justify things the store is out of X well I didnt want X anyway..  Even saying Where else can someone make so much money with so little trainingeducation is a rationalization.,bayarea,cixjvf8,0,t5_2qjyy

My solution was to get a cheap immersion blender and start making my own buffalo sauce which is easy and delicious.  franks and butter is a magical starting point because that much butter will make ANY flavor absolutely pop. Oregano basil jalapeo Serrano habanero... they all come out tasting amazing if not authentic.  A pinch of brown sugar for balance. And of course dont skimp on the bleu cheese.

If youre in the right area though its a decent price  or so for  Mbps I think. I considered it even though theres a sizable speed difference because it is a local small business thats supposed to have good customer service. Id recommend finding them on Yelp and seeing if youre close to them. Otherwise you might be stuck with Comcast like the rest of usATampT only goes up to about  Mbps but were getting our Comcast speed for  a month I do own my own modem and router so that keeps speeds up and cuts down on cost.

They usually charge you  a month for it so it doesnt take long for it to pay for itself. Definitely that can help you reduce your bill!We told Comcast we were thinking about switching from ATampT. This is sort of truewe did have ATampT before but when we called them we had recently moved and were without internet at the time. The guy we spoke to was like Well let me see if I can find you a deal. So it was actually super easy. Yup.

3283906,0,t1_cp2jqs9,Its not that its bad its actually quite nice. Its that its boring and very very expensive. Not only is the rent pricey so are the the groceries the restaurants the drinks etc. Its just not worth it for me. The majority of folks are white or Mexican and its very obvious what neighborhood your in. Oakland and Berkeley are some of the most multicultural cities in the states and even though there is obvious economic segregation your constantly surrounded by people of all races. I could get to all kinds of restaurants within walking distance in Oakland. Here my choices are Chipotle or the over the top pretentiously named Mexican joint that caters to white economic elite that live here. Obviously Im generalizing but thats the area. Businesses cater to the folks that can live here and I can barely afford to do that so I just dont feel welcome.Luckily there is chatter about moving the business primarily because of the over inflated real estate which will hinder our growth. I work in manufacturing so space is important and its something a few of our local vendors have done already. They are closing shop on the peninsula and moving over to Hayward San Leandro and Fremont.,bayarea,cp2lbl9,2,t5_2qjyy

This child has been found all the way in Tijauna  miles away. The kidnapper could have gone in any direction and we dont know how much of a head start they had. Look at the Hannah Anderson case just last year  that guy had at least  days head start and he got pretty far.

I know people who live in an attic illigally have to climb a ladder to get to thier bedrooms and everything in a bad part of town and are paying mo for the pleasure. They cant afford anything better. They both work hard. One has  jobs the other works full time. None of us have the time or money for a longer commute than we already make into SF every day. Soon none of us will be able to afford where we live.Affordable housing HAS to be a part of the future for this region because there will always be low paying jobs and the people that work them have to live somewhere.

4277218,0,t3_39uaxf, To avoid the problem with fines being simply too low to matter to entitled rich people we have a really good system here in Germany. ANY HIGHER FINE is not over x  but instead you are sentenced to x days. They take your average income over the last  months and thus determine your earning per day and that is how much you have to pay for every day of your sentence.That way fines are really fairampequal for everybody !   I bet when they suddenly have to pay . since they where sentenced to  days and have an average daily income of  even they will think twice Wink It really works like a charm and especially poor people do not have the usual unfair disadvantage through fines. If you dont or cant pay the fine you go to jail for the amount of days which you where sentenced to. A fair and simple system basically only for really small fines anything so small that it does not involve any judge it is not implemented since it is way too complicated to determine daily earnings. The maximum penalty is  months over that you go to jail.,bayarea,cs7revc,1,t5_2qjyy

4562732,0,t1_ct5pzh9,It definitely could be that union dues or benefits or one of many other things caught up.What it often is unfortunately is the mentality of the government takes more than I earn which is a narrative sold as a more extreme version of the government takes more than is fair coupled with a poor understanding of money management and where the hell your paycheck goes. I am getting paid more but I dont seem to have more in my bank account.If you were to look at their full pay stubs which list all the ins gross earnings hourly or salaried multiplied by hours or days in the pay period and outs federal income tax federal social security tax state income tax state disability tax medicare contributions to k  pension  IRA plans contributions to benefit costs medical and dental insurance vision plans food plans transportation plans like ten types of flexible spending accounts gym memberships life insurance employee stock purchase plans and so on you would most likely be able to piece together precisely where the money is going.Also if you get a  raise and  out of that goes to taxes and dues up front and your car needs to be fixed its very easy to imagine feeling like the raise just disappeared in smoke.Of course a detailed look at your friends pay stubs is not exactly something youre likely to see as people tend to be fairly private about this sort of thing.But god save us from the countless people who only look at the final dollar number deposited in their bank every pay period and who look at nothing else like for example that their withholding was raised more than it should have been and that they will get a tax refund later... or an even sillier example people who are crying about going from being paid twice a month to once every two weeks because the paycheck is smaller. And since people are pretty bad at estimating what their tax refund should be and minimizing their tax refund when they get next years refund they dont notice that its bigger than before. Especially if lets say they got their raise in June and filed taxes in April ten months later and only get their refund almost a full year later they simply forget.Tax structure is fairly complicated so even if there are only ten or so moving parts for the average person like you and me most people dont navigate it well enough to understand it all.And of course how much we get paid is a fairly emotional matter easily exploited by political narratives for political gain.The TLDR is this never trust any statement that the government takes more than you earn. Government may be bloated incompetent greedy occasionally malicious but it will not survive for long taking more from people than they earn. It happens only in the rarest of cases which are usually amended as soon as they come up at least in this country.,bayarea,ct5qxyt,1,t5_2qjyy

And I somehow doubt well see East Bay connection for a very long time.. at the rate the Bay Area is doing any transit upgrades. Ill be long dead by the time I see that As a Santa Rosa resident who spent over  years there growing up working attending the JC etc before moving down to the East Bay SMART is sadly just a bit of a boondoggle.Imagine if BART was built today but it didnt go across to SF and the closest stop was say... th Street. Lets say it was planned to go to SF but certain politicians from a certain side sort of hijacked it and postponed that Phase of the project. What would happen is almost no one would use it and certain  politicians would point to Hey look no one is using it because duh it doesnt go to SF. Its a failure! lets just pull the plug on future phases and reduce service dramatically! further making it even uselessThats a bit pessimistic but thats predominately what sort of happened with SMART. I think Obama Administration has actually got some funding to match and put towards the important phase but its still wishywashy and up in the air. And the service really should not launch until its done. IntraSonoma use its not going to be that helpful. Traffic on  can suck but it mostly sucks down more towards Petaluma by the time you hit the Cotati grade.  Unlike SFOakland where a lot of the jobs are centered in major areas most jobs around Sonoma County are quite spread out and bus system sucks there.  Unless its very lucky that a job is near one of the stops people arent going to use it to commute to their jobs from say... Windsor to Santa Rosa. Its just going to be faster cheaper and easier to driveespecially since your job may be an office park that could easily be  minute walk away or longer.   InterSonomaltgtMarin use I dont think itll be that helpful either. While I knew a fair amount of people who lived in Novato and attended the JC or worked up in SR area it could be more helpful for the former but theyre a drop in the bucket. I dont really think it was common to live in Sonoma County and commute down to Marin since Marin doesnt have a lot of jobs and if they do its very very unlikely that it will be anywhere close to one of the stops. Adding more points of failure in a commute from like Train gt Bus  Job gt Bus gt Train is not something that people want to domost would rather just drive if only for the convenienceespecially since regional MarinSonoma bus system blows.So really the main demographic and target thats going to be used for is  SonomaMarin ltgt SF use. And surprise it doesnt even go there which should have been absolute priority before launching the system.  Even then having to connect from Train gt Ferry is going to be costly I think train could run  and Ferry an additional ? Thats going to really hurt some ridership there.,bayarea,cwb0ssr,4,t5_2qjyy

But highway  does indeed mergesplit many times too. merges with US  US  US  I I I US alt I in Council Bluffs I in Des Moines in Nevada it overlaps the original Victory Highway State Route  and U.S. Route  at several stretches. And the Lincoln Highway through the Utah salt flats and I as they pass through Salt Lake City together. And thats just from Sacramento to Iowa.In fact just looking at a map I can see that it overlaps almost as many interstates and state routes and other federallyrecognized highways and roads as US.So by your own metric US  doesnt really go all the way to NYC either.Also of course  is an interstate in federal terms a limitedaccess highway US is an eastwest route of the U.S. Highway System which predates the interstates. If I had been built earlier and smaller as US was of COURSE it would have just as many overlaps as .I mean the only reason there arent consistently US signs along the way is because its an older road parts of it are used locally and many signs havent been replaced if they were ever up to begin with.

5656860,0,t1_cwy97y4,A business is a set up a certain way. For InNOut it is set up to handle a lot of orders actually...just not a lot of delivery orders placed in bulk.An easy example is a food truck. It is designed to sell food to people at the truck. The limiting factor for sales besides production is how many people will fit in front wait in line and how much they can carry. Normally no one would show up to a food truck and order food for  people. But if someone is being paid to do so it really screws up the food truck..because now they have this huge order that is going to be low quality because they arent equipped to have  meals ready at once and it slows it down for actual customers who made the effort to go. So who is at fault? The food truck which does what it says or the guy making a giant order at a little place? The food truck can handle  orders from  people but not  orders from  person. Its not a catering service.For InNOut they sell a lot of burgers. But they like to serve them fresh. They have drive through sure. But when InNOut give you the food it is fresh. If you want to wait to eat it thats on you. When Door Dash delivers it cold to the customer that reflects on InNOut...they have no choice but to eat it that way. Their food is not really made to be delivered or eaten  minutes later. In addition most people come to In and Out and eat there or go drive through. That means a big order is  burgers. Door Dash is I imagine placing bulk orders. So one person waits in line and orders    burgers. That screws it up for everyone behind them in drive through or in the restaurant and makes a bad burger delivery. In N Out can handle large orders and serve fresh burgers. But they arent a catering service not a delivery service so they cant really maintain their quality and make  burgers at once for delivery. So they dont want to do it and they dont want Door Dash making money by making them to do it...businesses reserve the right to refuse service I believe.Now you can argue that any private person could go order  burgers too. But who the hell is going to do that? How are they going to carry it? Sure it probably happens. But I imagine not as often as Door Dash aggregating multiple small orders and placing a bulk one. Not to mention that is a customer making an order for a birthday party or a meeting. Not an uninvested driver dropping off  burgers at  houses.Ever been to some a hole in the wall restraunt with  cook  seats and  minute wait and someone orders  meals to go and ruins the whole flow? Thats what door dash is essentially paying people to do.edited,bayarea,cwyaea7,2,t5_2qjyy

6310139,0,t3_420axv,Lots of good advice. Ill throw my hat in the ring.It really depends on what you want. There are a lot of options.I am actually going to Muir woods this friday. My parents are in town they dont really want to do a big hike. Ill have my  kids. Basically its easy. You get to cross the bridge. There are a few view points along the way and you get to see an easy nice maintained trail through the redwoods.Redwood national forest is far north. I am pretty sure there is camping near there. I remember thinking it was nice but not necessarily spectacular.My regular trip is to Henry Cowel state park. You get a beautiful drive down the coast on Highway . There are a few options of really nice hikes both a fairly easy one with signs describing the trees etc... and a longer one that goes through the forest. There are many trees that you can stand in to get that photo. There is a cool albino redwood. There is a train track that runs through the park. You can do the drive down early do some hiking then go to Santa Cruz for the afternoon or you can spend more time at Henry Cowell. You can take your time and stop at some beaches and things on the way down. Lots of options.When we want to go hangout in the redwoods thats what we do.

From snowplay to desert hiking to Oceanic exploration to mountain climbing and anything inbetween!  Also SF is one of the top culinary cities in the world. If you like to eat and eat well the Bay is your place bring your credit card with the highest spending limits though  ...  C for culture. The art and music scene here is surprisingly banal and corporate and its purely a money driven affair and given how expensive life is here thats no surprise at all. I see very little creativity coming out of Frisco these days. Ive basically stopped looking and I go out to Oakland when I want to see a show if at all.  NOTE Id surely LOVE to be proven wrong about this!  The glories of the San Franciscos artistic past The Beats the Hippies the Cyberpunks? Thats all long long gone except maybe as a tourist attraction.  People seem to think culture in SF means waiting in long lines to pay exorbitant prices for mediocre shit so they can take a selfie with it and put it on instagram to impress their friends and little else...    D for civic life. The city government is in shambles and there is vast inequality and marginalization in almost all vectors of life financial racial political etc. The past  years  of crony capitalism and absolutely nonexistent political will aptitude? has all but ground the citys notoriously byzantine government to a halt and its a purely paytoplay game now.

They listed the resale prices not the original sale prices.  If you didnt want to pay exorbitant prices for resale tickets you could have tried to buy at the original point of sale.. Not everyone who wants to go to the Superbowl can go to the Superbowl there arent enough seats.  Its not like there are going to be wide swaths of seats sitting empty because the NFL is holding the tickets ransom.. Not everybody gets a piece of every last thing they put taxes into.  Not everybody will drive over bridges collect Social Security put kids into school etc.  Get over it.I feel bad for situations where locals cant watch their own kids compete at the Olympics because the organizers have reserved huge chunks of the seating for themselves but come on this is ridiculous.,bayarea,czi6b2z,34,t5_2qjyy

Im a CS major so most of my classes tend to be online which makes things a lot more flexible in terms of being late. Having a social life is a concern though I would be living with friends and I am in a professional fraternity. If I lived in SF I would definitely make a point to occasionally stay over at friends places in Berkeley or invite them out to mine. To be completely honest the CS workload prevents me from being able to go out and have fun as much as I would like to anyway.

Any treaties trade agreements or other items need to be ratified by  the senate.Executive orders are technically binding without congressional approval but only to federal agencies they are subject to judicial review however. Without congressional approval however the president does NOT have broad powers to manage the economy or protect the security of the united states. So that wall? No dice.

8091500,0,t3_4pxb40,Its not just you.  I was a foreigner too to this area  years ago.  I came from the east coast near those little cities of Boston and NYC.  I had never expected this area to be so run down looking.  I remember looking for my first rental and one place I looked at was in Belmont and like most of the nd tier towns on the peninsula it looks like lower middle working class areas with lots of pickup trucks and cars on cinder blocks in some driveways.  Nevermind all the check cashing places and strip clubs especially in Redwood City.  Anyway I told the agent that was showing me the rental house that this looked like an area I wasnt interested in.  That it just looked so run down and like people didnt care about the neighborhood  not the kind of place I wanted to live.  She was noticably shocked and offput by my comment responding with something like This is a very nice neighborhood with lots of money.  I didnt believe her and moved on.  I think people that are from here just dont understand what a time warp it is to be here living in old s buildingshouses that have never been renovated.  It doesnt make sense when you think about how much money there is here but you have to realize that most people dont have that money unless they sell you their house and now that dumpy shithole is your problem.I was so naive when I first moved here.  Not realizing that CA is indeed another planet when you come from just about ANYWHERE else.   It was a while until I figured out the entire bay area is like this unless you can afford M for what would be considered a decent middle class house anywhere else.So yes the bay area is some distorted bizzaro version of reality where a million bux buys you entry into a lower middle class neighborhood with jacked up cars on cinderblocks and redneck pickups in the driveways and toothless neighbors I actually only found these during open houses in San Jose but still.I grew up in neighborhoods that looked like parts of Palo Alto or Atherton.  Just normal upper middle class places in CT MA NY.  But here I make what I consider a pretty obscene amount of money but that only affords me a lifestyle much like the poorest areas I remember growing up in on the east coast.Welcome to the SF Bay Area.,bayarea,d4pk3t5,4,t5_2qjyy

8111919,0,t1_d4q5arw,gt The folks in this thread have not the mental fortitude nor the negative experiences as the victims or families of victims from crime. They fail to see the destruction as possibly the destruction caused by crime seems normal to them. Either way they will downvote the living hell out of every word against being nice to criminals and giving them the high rise of what socialism has to offer. This is presumptive and inaccurate. People who have empathy for prisoners dont have mental fortitude dont see the destruction of crime and want to socialize everything specifically for criminals. What? If you are really concerned about crime you should be concerned about what reduces recidivism rates. These types of programs are proven to reduce rates of reoffending. This program is financially selfsustaining so it has nothing to do with socialism. It sounds like you have a caveman view of criminal justice that crime equals punishment and thats it. Society is a lot more complicated than that. This is the type of viewpoint that got us into this mass incarceration mess in the first place. ,bayarea,d4rupoi,1,t5_2qjyy

Fang is better but pricier.Good Indian is really difficult to findat least at an affordable price. There are a couple really good restaurants that are expensive but nothing like the consistently great cheap Indian and Pakistani food you find in London Sydney etc. I dont have anything to recommend in SF except DO NOT go to Pakwan!SF is best for Vietnamese and Thai all kinds of fusion California Cuisine and some incredible but expensive culinary experiences.

Fun large group that we would meet up at the Ferry Building and skate around the piers Marina Chinatown Union Square and back on to Market Street. Majority would stop at lights warn each other and move over for vehicles to pass by and respect the police officers when were asked not to skate at certain stops. We were just a group of people who were enjoying our time not to make a point to the public. Thats what I also thought Critical Mass was when I first heard of it not this activism.

8588770,0,t1_d6f5axy,gt First Im not comparing houses to other assets in strictly the tax sense.Yes you are because the only way the housing market is deatched from its market prices is taxes there is no other way its detached.gt It could be subsidies for apple growers. So different why even bring this up.gt A more proper analogy would be to say the tax you pay on profits for that expensive painting is capped at  of the value per year you owned it and not based on what you actually sold it for. But the person buying the painting now has to pay the tax based on the full present market value of it.Wat? First off there is a similar thing in effect not with paintings but investments and its called long term capital gains and its a good thing because it promotes long term investment WHICH IS GOOD. Secondly I dunno wtf your example means one person would be paying a tax on the income they recieved while they other person would be paying a tax on their purchasesales tax I guess which are wildly different taxes. The best example of this would be a stock which falls under long term capital gains where the person buying doesnt have a sales tax. You would be comparing two different taxes in your method which wouldnt be the same there is no sales tax on homes as I am sure you know.gt Second yes pegging property tax to a nationwide measure of inflation for an asset whose value varies dramatically on a regionallocal basis is effectively  decoupling it from its market value.  doesnt mean what you think it means especially when that includes a maximum growth factorso it still goes up as the price goes up just has a maximum it can go up in a given year. Honestly  does not mean what you think it means your wording is awful.gt Do RE agents and appraisers look at inflation to estimate your homes value? What does this mean an appraisal is for the current price why would they look inflation? You understand people are taxed normally at the sale rate if they sell it for . million they pay taxes on that the low increase in rate is ONLY for property taxes while they own it and again property is the ONLY thing that has this type of tax so you cant compare it to anything else. If those people had to pay a reduced income tax on property that went up when they sold it your argument would hold some water but they dont they have to pay the full price on any money they get just like any other income.gt No I have no problem with inheritance. You got a house fine. Explain to me why that asset transfer should be pegged at the time your parents bought it or your grandparents etc.First off its not pegged at the time your parents bought it its pegged at the price of purchase  a maximum of  increase in the time since per year. But we. Secondly AGAIN this isnt prop  you are complaining about its reappraisal which is prop passed in . Most of your argument is about inheritance this entire time.gt The tax benefit gets better and better the longer you stay in one place and tie up a property!The tax benefit gets better and better if the price goes up more than  yes. Tie up a property This is where I am annoyed someone is living there you feel that they should have to pay more to live in something they purchased for a certain price because you would have to pay more to live somewhere similar. They dont feel that as they havent gotten any money out of it and they want to live there and not forced to sell their personal property. Its selfish but its equally selfish on both sides. You are selfish because you want it to be more fair for newcomers to a popular area they are selfish because they want to maintain their cost of living they were promised when they bought it. A huge benefit of home ownership is creating roots in society to help society grow like it or not its one of the things that made America great.gt Yes because when you artificially lower taxes for some you constrain supply which drives up prices increasing the tax bill for those who come after. Youre effectively subsidizing the people who came before you. Simple example if there are ten houses the price might be k per house based on a demand X. The tax man gets  from each so k. Now there are only  houses because laws have constrained supply. Same demand X for those five houses so the price now goes up. Each house is now k so k from those  people and k from the people who bought before. Tax man gets his k but five people paid the vast majority of the tax for all ten homes. New are effectively subsidizing the old.Great you have adequately explained how max rate increases on property taxes contributes to higher home prices. Nobody argues that it doesnt in some waybut acting like it is the bulk of it is just idiotic the bulk is lack of space to build and the enormous amount of people wanting to live here and the extremely large amout of high paying tech jobs in the area but sure blame prop  all day.What you didnt explain even after reading it is how this higher house prices somehow connects to these other people paying for other kids college? You are making a stupid emotional connection that isnt true. If I live in my house and send my kids to a private college did my neighbor who pays more taxes somehow pay for that? Give me a break. Maybe you could make an argument that it pays for public schools and public programs in the area and one neighbor is footing more of the bill but you are also ignoring that the other neighbor has been paying that bill for many more years and probably contributed more than the newcomer. There is a lot of ways to look at this data.gt And there is nothing inherently wrong with that when housing is following normal appreciation because those cost differences are minimal. I didnt even include compounding in my example and erred on the side of extremely conservative numbers real numbers closer to k in that example but even that oversimplified example shows just how dramatic the effects of this legislation are. Its long long since forked from its purpose of protecting poor owners and instead becomes a systematic wedge of income inequality.A systematic wedge of income inequality. LOL no. You are attribute WAY WAY too much of why housing costs are high to this property tax max rate increase. The housing prices in the area are not crazy high because all these old people and inherited people its because of flocks and flocks of new people coming to the area for amenities and jobs and the high salaries that are paid allowing people to buy these houses. If you think suddenly upping everyones taxes would suddenly drop housing prices because a bunch of people would sell errr maybe? But I would argue its not because of the cost inflictedI think the majority could probably afford to keep their house but Id argue that there would either be less demand because home ownership just became a lot scarier knowing that stability is goneone huge reason you buy a house and you could eventually not afford to stay in your own house. This could in turn create lower prices as owning a home becomes more of a risk. The problem is having people rooted in communities creates good communities. I totally understand feeling unfair that someone is paying less than you because they bought it  years ago but unfortunately life isnt fair. ,bayarea,d6f6ogi,1,t5_2qjyy

The firm expects to invest  billion to purchase and develop the project.gtWe saw early on with the support of the City of South San Francisco that there was tremendous potential for growth in Oyster Point said Taotao Song CEO of Oyster Point Development LLC and executive vice president at Greenland USA in a statement. Our vision is to further cement South San Franciscos role and reputation as the worlds leading biotech hub by creating a bestinclass campus that will stimulate and sustain its economic and social fabric.gtGreenland USA partnered with Ping An Trust Agile Group and Poly Sino Capital Limited to buy the development in a joint venture called Oyster Point Development LLC.gtThe joint venture expects to break ground on the development in mid and plans to rebrand the site with a new name.

Why are cigarettes taxed more than milk or any other agricultural product? An unfair tax is literally that A tax applied unevenly and unfairly that disproportionately affects a minority group in a significant way. Regressive taxes such as sin taxes have no effect on the rich and are easily passed yet have a significant quality of life impact on the poor up to and including hurting their ability to exercise their freedoms. This is the literal argument used against voting ID laws yet somehow its fine when its another freedom such as your personal pursuit of happiness?

Currently sure you can cook all that in your oven but obviously you need to add seasoning prep ingredients add water to your rice check for readiness and plate everything yourself.

Thats literally the definition of trolling. It is akin to fake news sites spewing bullshit to rile people up. See this NPR episode for more on fake altright trolls.Your second article is talking about state funding. When a state decides what types of programs to spend money on it is making an investment decision. The state wants to produce graduates that will have a high return on investment. Of course its pretty difficult to quantify this so there is a debate to be had about the true ROI of churning out engineers vs a wider variety of majors. From the articlegt All the people in the world who want to study French literature can do so theyre just not going to be subsidized by the taxpayers like engineers will be for example.Thats a pretty reasonable statement. There is only so much funding to go around so the state has to decide where it is best applied and where it makes more sense to allow private funding to pick up the slack. Its not about hating on the liberal arts its about being realistic that we cant possibly fund all the different types of programs that people are interested in so we have to make these tough decisions about what should be a priority in funding.

10126851,0,t1_dbrbczb,I think the problem youre going to see with trying to address this via increased labor demand is that it is very difficult to increase demand for the kind of workers making these low wages without also increasing demand for all the workers higher up the food chain. If you make the labor market tight enough to increase everyones pay you usually just end up with inflation unless you also manage to increase total labor force productivity.gt Instead youre advocating policies which shrink the supply of jobsA basic supply and demand analysis generally suggests that when you set a price floor on a good you reduce demand assuming demand is elastic which is true for most goods but the most recent empirical research on changes to the minimum wage Card and Kreugers work in particular seems to suggest that modest increases dont have a significant negative impact on employment levels. Obviously there are a lot of limits to empirical economics research but periodically natural experiments arise in which one area raises the minimum wage and another nearby economically similar area does not.Of course all of this is not to say that an increase in the minimum wage wont reduce employment at some businesses marginally profitable businesses that sell goods with very elastic demand will probably go under or reduce staff just that in aggregate those losses will be made up elsewhere. It also wouldnt be surprising if a  minimum wage would be high enough to cause problems if set at a federal level. The areas that have introduced  minimum wage laws generally have high median incomes and can presumably support a higher minimum wage as a result.,bayarea,dbrj9ex,4,t5_2qjyy

Than speeds up and half way in the intersection breaks to a almost full stop. Than takes off and once past the intersection breaks to a full stop and than takes off. I drove behind it for  blocks and it did that at each intersection until the driver pulled over finally and relived us from the presence of this dreadful car.

If a huge proportion of crimes committed can be solved by the help of illegal immigrants a strong case can be made.I dont think this is true though because its pretty common knowledge that illegal immigrants cause less crime than do native born Americans.So the problem comes down to by making California a sanctuary state we are paying for people who are living in the shadows through our welfare system and who can and often are taken advantage by small business owners for lower pay.

10892410,0,t1_de3ftku,My understanding is that it is corporatewide policy to understaff safeways. ALL safeways are always understaffed in my experience. My suspicion is that this is to push consumers to use selfcheckout as part of a longterm trajectory towards phasing out all checkers.That Safeway has NO selfcheckout so the result is there are long lines . the store is understaffed so the few people who ARE there are stuck at tills dealing with the huge lines....so restocking falls by the wayside. The result is that I go to this safeway to find that they have failed to restock and appear to be OUT of things like apples lettuce normal shit you go to Safeway for. I have even gone to customer service and asked to talk to mgmt saying cmon hire more people  this is clearly constantly stupid. The mgr. said oh weve been trying to hire more people for months now and i said if you cant fill a job here in months pay more thats how the market works and i got the blank CSR stare of I have no control over this decision and i stopped asking.But then later i talked to an employee who said the mgr DOES have control of scheduling and there are workers who would like more shifts but cant get them because it would trigger benefits. Im sure its one of those mgr incentives where a mgr gets a bonus for keeping labor costs low.TLDR They skimp on staffing and pass the frustration onto you While charging more than anyone besides whole foods! That Safeway is so bad that I would outright skip a meal before I would shop there. ,bayarea,de3h3s3,9,t5_2qjyy

In my experience Berkeley is not nearly as liberal as people make it out to be. The whitesAsians in HaasSTEM actually tend to be more fiscally conservative than your average American though most people do dislike guns and tolerate illegal immigration. I can express my conservative views to most people but I never get attacked for it because unlike BCR I dont go out of my way to insult annoy and belittle people for their leftist views. Basically BCR are not true conservatives. Theyre just a bunch of weak crybullies trying to latch on to the altright movement for shock value and a sense of selfworth.

We then found and patched the plumbing leak plumbers area  lot cheaper when theres no drywall for them to worry about. We found mold on a few of the studs which we bleached and then painted kilz over. We replaced about sqft of insulation which was also moldy. We put up new drywall and new cabinetscounter. Painted with kilz and then normal paint. This was  years ago and totally fixed the mold issues and we didnt die of mold. This work was all diy except the plumber I think the source of the mold was a diy plumber aka previous owner. You can often find used cabinets vanities and other supplies in good to fair nonmoldy condition at the habitat for humanity restores  We taught ourselves to drywall via youtube videos  craigslist materials section sometimes has folks selling extra from remodels and such  we only needed three half sheets of drywall and some left over new insulation also from cl. ,bayarea,dfd0t2g,1,t5_2qjyy

It does for those who got a good deal  years ago but its a wide brush and also helps a lot of people that dont need it. Everyone else it completely screws. The only solution is to build more housing to account for everyone that wants to live here. No rent is never going to be the same as say Topeka KS but itll be a hell of a lot more affordable than it is today.Getting development done isnt difficult. It just involves allowing more density in areas near public transit. If its zoned for it and theres as of right permitting itll get built.gt Look at New York City a huge Rent Control city. NYC is not a huge rent control city. Units prior to WW are eligible and only if you or a direct family member have been residing in that unit since the s. Once they move out its a market rate unit. Theres also income restrictions applied to that. If you make over a certain amount the unit reverts back to market rate within a couple years.,bayarea,dgj6uva,1,t5_2qjyy
