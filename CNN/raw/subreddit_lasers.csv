369182,0,t3_1y9xos,According to people on laserpointerforums.com that site is legit its one of the sites they recommend to people there who ask info to buy a laser. The second laser they recommend often. They claim it is quality always works in any temperature etc. Read that thread it is recent. On the first and second page people are recommending the nd laser you linked here and the OP is asking of that one is really good people who have that specific laser answered.If you go for the  mW green one make sure you get the IR filter with it for your own and others safety. It will pop a balloon straight and light matches have fun  ,lasers,cfj14uu,3,t5_2re2g
486232,0,t1_cfuzw5p,Laser safety goggles are designed to withstand a direct strike for a certain duration. Standard impact safety goggles may not give you very much time to move out of the way before the material fails. Id recommend getting some proper laser safety goggles for this reason alone.

1370213,0,t3_29rs9k,its done all the time to precision tune the frequency. downside to peltiers is that they are rather inefficient.  you are adding a hundred or more watts to move maybe  watts of heat.  your heatsink requirement will need to be an order larger than just sinking W. Usually in commercial systems the peltier hot side is coupled to the main water cooling and used more for tuning than cooling,lasers,cio1m04,1,t5_2re2g

2349985,0,t1_cm18isw,gtIt looks like the model you bought has a listed output of ampampltmW which is about the same power as a cheapo red laser pointer for use in presentations. It only looks brighter because your eye is more sensitive to green.Ive tested some of my low output higher price lasers and what Ive found is theyre purposefully stating a safe power so they can be imported into some countries with laserpointer regulations...For instance a lt mW laser turned out to be around mW. It wasnt  though  but . still cheap parts but better than advertise outputI dont know if its overpowered and soon to burn out  it hasnt so far... with about  hour run time in total.,lasers,cm263l9,1,t5_2re2g

3754736,0,t1_cqk9j5o,Maybe maybe not. Some of the dirt that gets through filters is sticky and if so it could have created hot spots of dirt build up. I have had that happen on my external water cooling system. With internals the only time I saw mold was in one that had literally sat with stagnant water for multiple years.,lasers,cqk9mop,1,t5_2re2g

5008119,0,t1_cuplkf4,Hmm that did sound bad let me rephrase that. I currently own a class III laser powerful enough to see the beam in the dark. Even with such a low level laser I realize staring at the dot is bad for your eyes almost like staring at the sun. If I want to go up to a class IV just powerful enough to burn small dark things what kind of laser should I buy?,lasers,cupo1d6,1,t5_2re2g

5698222,0,t1_cx3chwk,You can try something simple as projecting an expanded beam through a transparent image like a slide or a negative.   This will act exactly the same way a TV projector works but using lasers and a still image.  Sorting out optics from old projectors can help maintain a clear image and cast it further.  Youd have to worry about beam divergence.    However a small expanded beam hitting a tiny transparent HIGH CONTRAST image and then later refocusing the beam back down to achieve less divergency shoooould work well.Hell grab a LCD projectorLCD projector TV and just swap the lamp for a laser might be the simplest!!!!  ,lasers,cx3f3wu,1,t5_2re2g

If its right in the beam path youre going to have a bad time... Heads up ... one use a HeNe does still have these days is for aligning other lasers  semiconductor diode lasers dont like back reflections it can kill them HeNe lasers dont care though. The typically superior beam specs on a HeNe help with alignment too.  Edit I imagine you already know all this... P,lasers,d6ao570,2,t5_2re2g

9287440,0,t3_57kl0c,Get it focused to a fine beam and you can start a fire a fair distance away.Also  get a mw red laser and shine it in your eye... itll leave a dot in your vision after blinding you with dazzle. Now stop and consider you have one x more powerful.So a reflection of th of your beam reflecting into your eye remember a laser reflection DOESNT spread like normal light its like a laser beam shining right back at you will be just like that mw beam in the eye.... dazzling and leaving a dot in your vision for a few minutes.Get a  Watt laser reflection full in your eye and you WILL instantly burn a jagged line across the tissue of the back of your eye. Hell a  watt laser would too...Why?That thin  to mm burning  watt beam of the laser will be shrunken down to a point smaller than one tenth of a millimetre wide by the lens in your eye. Think of an elephants foot but in the space of a stiletto...  It can vaporise the surface of plastic easily in milliseconds and it will cook and cauterise your retina for life.It heals with scar tissue and your vision in that part of your eye never returns.All this from a rogue reflection from the laser across perhaps two rooms... theres almost no difference in brightness between holding a laser in front of your eye and having the beam travel across a room because it diverges minimally What Im saying is  use the right color of protective wrap around glasses and dont use the laser when theres animals nearby.Watch out for smoke from furnitureHave fun!,lasers,d8t909r,4,t5_2re2g
