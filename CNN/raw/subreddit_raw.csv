1516342,0,t1_cj5ovcj,Lots of people dont touch tomatoes cooked or raw so who is to say we can even use the chemical compound after it has been cooked. Just putting forward a debate in regards to protein that people have claimed for years that Humans get protein from meat Red fish chicken or otherwise or selected veg spinach beans or something else. Where as it is not the case at all and that we create our protein for ourselves with amino acids I hope amino is spelt correctly by passing them through the liver and creating a specific protein many types strictly for us. The argument is that my protein and your protein are different and that I couldnt use yours and that you couldnt use mine. Coming back to the point the chemical compound that is created by only the cooking of the tomatoes is it  something that humans need  if we need it do we only get it from the cooked tomatoes are you sure the chemical compound is compatible and used by the human body are you sure we dont create this by some other magical way we have yet to find out about Sorry for the poor grammar the over explanatory sentences and thank you for creating a good debating topic,raw,cj6cm27,3,t5_2qmp6

4087650,0,t3_37ctqm,I also had durian for the first time today!  I bought one at the asian market it was frozen and then when I went to the grocery store they also had unfrozen ones previous frozen but thawed so I got one of them so I could immediately enjoy it and let the other one thaw overnight.  I am hooked on it but like has been said you can have too much.  I ate about  pods over the last  hours and am totally stuffed.  I will eat a bit more tomorrow too but its definitely a treat not a mono meal.,raw,crm7u09,2,t5_2qmp6

11595738,0,t3_5einmd,there was another guy on youtube who said raw food is healthier than cooked.raw meat. raw eggs. he ate raw goat meat for a year and you could actually see his transformation.he became visually more fit and you can see the signs of his improved healthy appearance.he even said when we cut our hair we will lose our intuition.this is why some formal education and in the workplace you need to be clean shaven and have short hair. its actually mind control.but I somewhat disagreed when he contradicted the natural and the supernatural.natural food and lifestyle is in opposition with the industrialized packaged engineered food but not the supernatural.is raw food actually more beneficial for us? is the NWO trying to make us belive the modern lifestyle lies?in order to weaken and therefore to easier control us?,raw,dgadvrf,1,t5_2qmp6
