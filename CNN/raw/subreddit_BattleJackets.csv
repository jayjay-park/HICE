1713683,0,t3_2e0uem,Ive just ordered priest and sabbath patches from a patch maker i know through facebook hopefully ill have them in time for the text patch pickup thread. I wouldve made a trade today for some patches but holy shit is shipping expensive. I was supposed to send a dude in mexico a record in exchange for a handful of patches but my shipping charge came out to almost double the price of the record. I had no idea it would cost so much so I had to let him know i cant complete the trade. i feel really bad actually because he wanted the record very much but itd be cheaper for him to find a copy in mexico than for me to send him mine. ,BattleJackets,cjv678n,1,t5_2tqtv

2450988,0,t3_2nky42,I got one from Amazon. Was like  quid fake leather obviously. It did have zips and padding everywhere though which made sewing patches on a pain.

I have a Tank backpatch for example.

4173803,0,t3_38hk01,I havent made a back patch but I do paint patches. I buy black canvas fabric and use acrylic paint. Dilute the paint before you start your outline. After youre done spray it with an acrylic sealer. You may also want to try Saral paper to create your outline.Edit I forgot to mention that I use an embroidery hoop to keep the fabric taut. Get one big enough for the entire design. The fabric will be permanently stretcheddented after its released. This is part of the reason why I dont paint back patches. Theres probably another good way to stretch the canvas.,BattleJackets,crw0qvz,1,t5_2tqtv
