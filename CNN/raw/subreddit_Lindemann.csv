4127356,0,t3_37w3qd,When I first heard Pussy I was almost disappointed at the English lyrics but after a few more times I actually grew to like it.The same goes for Praise Abort the first time I listened to it it seemed rather weird and out of place but once you get used to it youll realise that Tills English is rather unique and he keeps the language style from Rammsteins german songs.,Lindemann,crqqrgf,5,t5_35q0o
4305921,0,t3_3ab94j,Sorry meant to elaborate Skills in Pills  Like most of the songs on the album its just basically a big chorus no bad  thing with Lindemann at the helm his ability to sell a chorus is virtually his USP but its a good one. Think most people here would have already heard it so wont say too much more about it. Ladyboy  Dont know why but I really like this one. Its actually one of the weaker choruses on the album but its weirdly fun and the synths are cool. Fat  Not keen. Extremely grandiose but not much to it aside from the surface bombast. Fish On  Definitely more potential to grow on me than Fat but the chorus sounds like some kind of missed opportunity. The ending isnt bad. Children of the Sun  Definitely the worst on the album basically a rehash of Fat with less revolting lyrics. Home Sweet Home  a ballad with some cosmetic similarities to those found in Reise ReiseRosenrot era Rammstein. Its OK nothing overly special. Cowboy  very brisk a lot of fun nothing earthshattering. Golden Shower  a really bizarre one this. The intro and especially the interlude which reprises the intro music is probably my favourite moment on the entire album but the rest is decent at best. Out of the clips this was the one that didnt really do anything for me at all and I enjoyed it more than I expected.  Yukon  absolute instant classic. Nothing else to say. Praise Abort  weve all heard it its adequate at best but irritatingly infectious. Thats My Heart  very gothic and grand pretty good and a slightly more reflective end to the album than what has come before.,Lindemann,csb03re,2,t5_35q0o
4376993,0,t3_3b1y5y,After watching Praise Abort I knew this was going to be some goofy side project. After seeing Tills ridiculous outfit it was all over. Did you see his hat? That was him saying Im just having fun guys Im about to be incredibly schmaltzy. This isnt really new however I saw him in New York then California with Rammstein and it was practically a comedy show. Thats a byproduct of some serious depression. Also I feel like English makes him even goofier. Hes also had incredible success so I cant blame him for exuding some happiness or light heartedness in his own way. All this to say the album is a fun experience. Id love to see him and Peter on tour. Bring out the dancing girls like the old days. If you dont like it terribly thats fine Rammstein will be back soon and the old albums exist. ,Lindemann,csj0tzz,3,t5_35q0o
