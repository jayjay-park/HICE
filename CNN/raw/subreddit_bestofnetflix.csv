294210,0,t3_1xgpxc,I quite enjoyed this movie.  Over time Ive come to enjoy normal life movies over blockbusters.  Two underated females actresses put on an impressive performance of just dealing with hard real life issues.  This was the movie that made me think Oh Anna Kendrick isnt just the annoying chick from Twilight.From a Chicago standpoint they depicted it quite well.  The brewery is Revolution Brewery which I highly recommend to craft beer lovers.  They even had little details like the fact that Revolution didnt start canning beers only bottles until well after they opened.  I absolutely loved the Malort scene as well.  A running joke here in Chicago.So this movie isnt going to win any awards but I very much enjoyed the depiction of normalcy by a well known cast.,bestofnetflix,cfb9dna,8,t5_2s1cv
