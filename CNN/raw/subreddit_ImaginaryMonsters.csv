997912,0,t3_25i6gn,I actually think the underwear really damages this piece.Because if she was completely nude youd just go oh right shes some sort of angelic creature that does not feel base human things like shame or have any particular desire to present herself as sexy or anything like that so she might be a being of purity or somethingOr if she was clad in armour youd go that armour probably has some magical purpose maybe shes the last soldier in a war on demons or somethingOr if she was wearing regular clothes youd go maybe shes a person who became an angel or something maybe its symbolic of some personal issue she hasAll of those options add story. But the fact that shes wearing just underwear seems really strange. Its clearly not for protection so the armour idea is out. Its clearly not that shes cold because shes not wearing regular clothes. So the only remaining plausible idea is that she wears those undies because she wants to look sexy which really clashes with the idea that there are these two mythic beings fighting an epic battle.And if youre going for oh shes an angel who wants to look sexy this isnt a particularly good execution of that either since you cant tell her emotions and it doesnt really look like shes wearing lingerie or lipstick or whatever.Its weird how that tiny little detail makes the whole piece feel confused.,ImaginaryMonsters,chhpxhg,86,t5_2sbzt

Its probably my number one wish in film to see studios put out some goodquality gritty and mature animated features and I think GoG would have been perfect for that. I was already amazed by how gritty and hardcore the combat felt so imagining you being able to take it one step further gives me chills.But my favorite scene in the film I think is when Ezylryb teaches Soren how to read the air currents. I loved how you could see  as Soren sees it too  just the slightest path in the air and rain showing him how to maneuver it through the tunnels of air and stuff. I loved it.That movie was so good I watched it three times in  hours. ,ImaginaryMonsters,dgtfub7,3,t5_2sbzt
