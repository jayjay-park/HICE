6167083,0,t1_cyqmigj,Our guidance counselor tried to talk me out of seeking further education. I came from a poor family Later he lied repeatedly about mailing my transcript to the school I applied to. I finally had to ambush in his office during the summer and make him hand it over so I could get it in before the deadline.  It was only years later when I found an old copy of the vhs tape they made of our graduation that none of the poor kids got scholarships.  Ive often wondered if he sabotaged that too. All I can say is I hope that they all live well into their declining years and are cared for by people who treat them just like they treated us.  ,RegularRevenge,cyqmt3b,4,t5_3b6io

10017002,0,t1_dbd7wvl,This subreddit is typically for peoples personal stories that they went through. Sometimes people post for someone in their family or a close friend but someone that theyve never met or are very distant from is usually not looked kindly on. Just wanted to let you know Im not trying to be rude about this.,RegularRevenge,dbd8shh,4,t5_3b6io

11674263,0,t3_65agix,Honestly I dont think that you really needed to give FF much reason to stop rooming with the kind of ADULT thats talking shit about someone they havent interacted with since ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. I have a feeling that HG would have been insufferable to actually live with anyway.,RegularRevenge,dgjalbs,3,t5_3b6io
