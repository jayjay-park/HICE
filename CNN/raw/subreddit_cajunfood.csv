6850603,0,t3_49jtfu,I buy the rotisserie chickens at Winn Dixie tear them apart and use the meet with the Tony Chacheries boxed jambalaya mix. It takes all of  minutes and its a quick good meal. I realize its not a traditional from scratch setup but it tastes good its cheap and its made quickly. If Im adventurous Ill add in some smoked sausage from one of the local shops. And Ive started buying two of the rotisserie chickens you can buy different flavors too ... garlic and lemon bbq etc. at a time ... I shred the meat use some for the jambalaya and save the rest for tacos later in the week. Again this is all to make it quick and easy. From scratch is another issue but its not too difficult either.,cajunfood,d0stnkc,3,t5_2urum
