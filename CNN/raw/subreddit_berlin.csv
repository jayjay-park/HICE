8784437,0,t3_50cq6z,Its hard to compare exactly but compared to the countries of Scandinavia which feel like bilingual countries by comparison its much more the case that German society expects immigrants to learn German. However the situation is probably better than France or Italy. Although many young people speak some German I suspect far fewer German teenagers can speak it effortlessly compared to the Netherlands but this is all really just anecdotal evidence based on people Ive met.You can certainly manage OK without German. How much you learn depends on your motivation. I know lots of people who have come here with a partner and child already in tow and for them there is zero motivation to learn German because it would just take time which they could spend with their family who also dont speak German.Its hard to say how long it takes to learn German. I found that my ability to understand German increased gradually without much effort simply from hearing and reading it every day but my ability to write and speak requires more work because I hardly ever have a need to do it in real life.In the tech company I work at the vast majority of the people I work with are Russianor Ukrainian Belarusian etc. so I hear more russian than than I do german.

10560816,0,t3_5r7dpy,i think it is important to mention that germans dont really categorize too much and dont like to put people in a specific cornor or boxes.We probably prefer treating you as human being no matter what color you are what religion you believe in what you income is or what your hobbies are. For most of us you are a human being not more and not less. I get that americans like to label themselves but in the end you are kind of making yourselves prisoners of your own labeling.You may be proud of being of color or being proud of your culture and that is totally fine. Keeping a culture alive is important. But what is also important is giving yourself the freedom of being the same es everybody else   to at least some extend.So really feel free to seek out communities of people of color of your religion of you believes of your culture of your hobbies of your political views of your ideals  Just dont fence yourself in and dont block yourself from experiencing the possibility of being not only part of a small group of people but being part of all the people in this country as a whole. Its sometimes harder for americans to understand this philosophy but i think most of them embrace it with time. Its a big difference in our germaneuropean culture compared to the US. Just some friendly advice!,berlin,dd56row,-5,t5_2qt49

I have paid and yes I did donate blood and used the money for it. I hope I dont have to ever do that again tho.    To OP I suggest that you pay your first month and then apply for an exception the instructions are on the back of the bill they sent you you might get one or you might not if you do you could pay  or   which is better than  anyway.    I am currently looking into other options like asking the state for money to pay for it through bafg because well fuck that shit i dont wanna pay for a tvradio service that I dont use and on top of that it is too fucking expensive anyway  I could probably get satelite tv in my country for that money.,berlin,df379ru,2,t5_2qt49

From what I am reading  no fluent German coming from a foreign school system  it is probably not impossible but nowhere close to guaranteed. After all most German dont even make it. Also should you really think a school will sit down with you to discuss how to manage school attendance with your employment situation you are dreaming.  They wont care what you do after hours but attendance is mandatory and you will be failed for skipping too many classes. ,berlin,dgf4vsl,2,t5_2qt49
