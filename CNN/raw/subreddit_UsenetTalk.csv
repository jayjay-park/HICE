5196301,0,t1_cvcbmoo,Look I appreciate this type of reply I really do.  Humility is a good attribute. I dont however have time to explain everything about network operations.  You would be better served getting some networking experience and from there start reading IETF technical documents.I will leave you with this my response below is not an all inclusive reply that describes every possible network scenario.Feed servers or any type of packet routing does not equate to running and maintaining large storage systems.   A business or network running NNTP may allow their users to post messages. Feed servers may be used to transmit packets and simply to push messages out to other systems.At the same time a business might not want to assume expenses to run their own storage systems or pay for operational costs and bandwidth at rates higher than what a larger business can provide more efficiently.So a  It is possible to run a feed server to push messages out  b  It is possible to resell access to other systems to provide delivery of other services.,UsenetTalk,cvccjgc,1,t5_39vrd
8449570,0,t3_4vd5vi,To expand on the original post a bit if articles being downloaded do not pass through UsenetFarm NNTP servers does it make sense to continue to classify it as an independent provider?For example we classify CheapNews and BulkNews as XS News resellers even though they have independent servers not running within the XS News ipaddress range because They use XS News numbering for their articles. Articles downloaded from their servers have an XS News server as the terminal server in the Path header. They do not have any newsfeed servers in the TOP.Right now UsenetFarm appears to meet two of these three conditions.What might have gotten lost in all the technobabble is this does UsenetFarm have ndays of local retention like it did a few months back?,UsenetTalk,d5xqebw,1,t5_39vrd
