2453007,0,t3_2nmhbl,So weve decided to keep Saria  yay! Ive been slowly introducing her to Lily Midna too and did so to socialise her with cats even when she was not a keeper. Theyve been getting along well and Lily who has never had kittens has started mothering Saria. She cleans her scolds her and plays with her. She also watchers her quite intently and follows her around. There is no growling or fighting and Lily has learned that Saria is a bit too small to play the way she would like her to. Saria purrs when she is around Lily and seems to enjoy being in the room with her.Please note  Saria is not old enough to be with Lily all the time. She is with her for an hour or two a day. Its basically like kitty daycare and their mother seems grateful for the break. Its been a very slow process to bring them together but Im very happy they now seem to be accepting of each other.,bengalcats,cmew7z2,1,t5_2tf0q
2453142,0,t3_2nfqi0,The descriptions of bengals left so far seem accurate to me! When resaerching my bengals most seemed to be . I found a breeder in Portland that was willing to sell two for  because they said they enjoy selling them together as they do well that way. Sounded sketch but I went through with it. These were brown marbled bengals both boys and they were both smaller than their white marbled brothers. One was the runt without a doubt. He was weaker than this brother was a few weeks behind in development like jumping on the bed still is much less coordinated and had a sniffle for a few weeks but  years later they are both in excellent health and the best cats I could ask for considering they are bengals and are a handful.I think my bengals really love having each other. I was worried that because they were both boys that I would have issues with them fighting over being the alpha but that is not the case. One is the alpha and the runt is not simple as that. It works well for them. The alpha is the stereotypical bengal and the runt while still highly intelligent persistant and loud at times is very shy and reserved. He really doesnt like people hides under the bed when he hears a loud noise isnt as much of a lap cat just on his occasional terms and it seems we have many traits between the two the good and the bad.I feed my cats a raw diet the recipe by Lisa A. Pierson specifically and this has worked well for them. They were on half raw and half dry kibble for a bit but one cat had multiple UTIs so I put them on  raw and has had no UTIs since. I have also tried Prey Model Raw but this was too time consuming for my lifestyle so making ground raw food in bulk it is.The bad part about my pets is that my life has been more unstable than I predicted when I bought them and I moved across the country twice have lived in  sq ft for over a year which was hard on them I trained them both to use the actual toilet but one goes through phases where he wants to poop on the bed instead and also went through a pee on the couch phase which stopped when we established that the couch was ours and not his through squirting him when hed look at the couch pretty much they wake us up sometimes multiple times throughout hte night trying to get under the covers they often are loud when we want to sleep in sometimes they yowl when we go to bed so we often sleep with ear plugs and one of them is very persistant often where he digs at us because he is so desperate for attention and play even when we give them attention all the time. We dont do deliberate play like with a toy every day and they really would like it. When we play with them hard  times a day with their favorite toy they are much more calm and seem to be more quiet at night but with our busy lives we arent as disciplined as we should be with dragging the toy around for  minutes at a time.The other hard thing is travel. We find ourselves needing to travel a bit and dont have any friends or family in the area that will stay with them or check in on them xday for a while to play with them. They tend to get into trouble when we are gone for more than a day and the one with potty issues will most likely poop on something. We hire a sitter to check in on them x a day if we are gone which isnt a fortune but that means for every vacation we need to budget maybe  for pet sitting depending on how long we are gone. This was not an expense I thought about and while the money isnt a  big issue I do worry when we are gone for long periods of time as I know they need a lot of attention to thrive so I almost always feel guilt multiple times while traveling. I didnt get a cat to feel tied down. I also want to downsize even more or live in a yurt or trailer for a while so we can build a house in the near future and Im not sure how that will work out with bengals and I dont like the idea of letting them outside freely when theyve been indoor cats....With that said I love the little buggers! They are really fun and make me happy on a daily basis. I enjoy caring for them spending time making their food playing with them and I dont mind being woken up here and there. This is what I signed up for and mine are fairly easy to manage most of the time so long as I respect their needs of needing to run climb make noises and be curious about EVERYTHING  all the time. One night we came home from a long job at am there was poop on the bed and right as we fell asleep the cat broke the medicien cabinet off the wall which woke us up again and then in the morning there was more poop on the comforter on the floor. Its times like this that really make us want to pull our hair out but then again they have very strict needs and this is what you get when you work long hours or dont give them enough attention. Just being honest! They are a lot of work but very rewarding if you are up to it. I never want a normal cat again! ,bengalcats,cmewtl2,1,t5_2tf0q

4135839,0,t3_380tfc,Our bengal throws his water dish across the room every time we fill it.  He also slaps the surface of the water with his paw like a bear fishing for salmon.  For us a water fountain would be a terrible idea.  There would be water everywhere.  ,bengalcats,crrpe2w,1,t5_2tf0q
4509176,0,t3_3cti4h,Yes! Mine wants to cuddle you to dead when we wake up in the morning and will just continue snoozing if I decide to do so. And not because he wants his breakfast if he wants his breakfast he will get under the blankets and bite my toes..The rest of the day he pretends to be the tough guy. Until you leave him alone for a day then its a cuddles when you get home D,bengalcats,csz13ws,1,t5_2tf0q

4686713,0,t3_3f2nr1,My Bengal seems to always be going through some quirky phase be it pulling plugs chewing cords hiding under the couch. Shell be obsessed with it for a few weeks then just lose interest. I would say just do your best to correct it when you can and ride it out and hopefully shell lose interest.,bengalcats,ctlazcw,2,t5_2tf0q

Though she didnt seem to care too much and would use the litter while we were moving.Our male also likes to chase RC helicopters and airplanes even the big ones!  Hes taken down one of the big Eflight helis it is hilarious.,bengalcats,cuazu8x,2,t5_2tf0q

9694784,0,t1_da83185,Yes it was quick from when I last posted. I always wanted one before though. I actually went to a local breeder and surrounded myself with bengals. Stayed in the rooms where all the bengals would hangout. Held them and pet them. I purposely didnt wash my hands after and decided to itch my eye and see what happens since I didnt get any other reaction. It slightly got itchy and red for  minutes then went away. I also wore the same clothes all day that I had worn when I went to the breeder. ,bengalcats,da836en,2,t5_2tf0q

11672343,0,t3_66jgs8,We are currently awaiting our first bengal to be old enough to leave mom. I have read quite a few posts on the internet about walking bengals on a leash. Seems like a lot of people do.Check out Youtube there are some videos there of people walking them on leashes and the cats seem to love it. The way bengals were described to me is a dog in cats clothing ,bengalcats,dgj2r8o,1,t5_2tf0q
