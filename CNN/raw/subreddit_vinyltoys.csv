1282354,0,t1_cicu85n,Sounds like you know your glues so let me ask you a follow up.  The person Im getting the figure from glued a broken limb back on.  But the way they glued it left a line or lump of glue between the two pieces instead of making them flush.I would like to undo their glue attempt and try again.  Any idea how to get rid of that glue and try my own?  Once I get it I can try to just snap it off and hope the lumps will just chip off but maybe theres something safer I can use to dissolve it?  any ideas?,vinyltoys,cidvr0t,1,t5_2s9cm
