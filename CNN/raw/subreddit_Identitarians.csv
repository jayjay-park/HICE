7429212,0,t1_d2mmfio,gtYes well in the UK the Labour Party has members affiliated with antizionist organisations. Turns out there are shitheads in every group on the planet. But dont let that stop you blanketsmearing.Yes and local parts of the ruling Social Democratic Party include a Turkish fascist organization called the Grey Wolves or Mili Grs in their May Day parades. Such things happen. Thing is the Identitarian Movement membership is identical with farright wing organizations. Think  and the others just arent active anywhere else or else it would be . Its one thing to have members that are affiliated with others its a whole different beast if say every member of the Labour party is affiliated with antizionist organizations. Good luck trying to call that blanketsmearing.gtThe LeftRight debate is a jokeI as an anarchist agree. Thing is The New Right is trying to reframe the hegemony not to discuss and evolve the concept in itself. We experience this at first hand in the current process for the elections of our head of state and have been experiencing it for quite a while. Far right politicians calling themselves the new Jews and others fascists all the time Calling a neoliberal professor from the Green Party fascist for not liking his political enemies? Come on reestablishing old terms of Nazi speak. Its not a well you know it isnt as easy as LeftRight and we should have a proper discussion about it its a very successful try to muddy the waters.Dont get me wrong I like discussions with people that have totally different ideas and yall can have your opinions even if I find them absurd harmful and have to combat them in arguments in my own life. What I dont like is when we have to battle for the discussions framework. The Identitarian Movement is far right as it is an evolution of the Vlkische Ideology its synthesis with Mussolinis fascism and with some organizational strategies copied from the French left. And thats ok. Its the idea. Now we can discuss its basics go to Economics and Critiques on Capitalism from various perspectives we can go to Darwin and take a look at his own perspective on Social Darwinism we can discuss our definitions of culture and use the socratic method to gain deeper insights and all of this. Its ok. Your side is currently reframing political discourse all over Europe and were between a fight against a USSRclub of remembrance and the annihilation of social movements by Social Democratic shills.
