2022147,0,t1_ckwuhm1,Sure no problem! Ranked weapons or tier weapons are stronger weapons. Every weapon has  levels. Every character you unlock starts with lvl  weapon. You unlock  or  in legend mode but most of them can be unlocked in adventure mode see these golden sword symbols on the map? When you search their maptiles and get an A rating you will getunlock tier weapons lvl  or lvl.  In short go for the golden sword symbols on the adventure map and get a ratings. Higher tier weapons are way stronger than the best weapon of the previous tier and can have more slots. Also they have a different art style!   Hope that helps!,HyruleWarriors,ckwv5te,1,t5_30t9v

Makes for incredibly easy kills and exp. After that you obviously just finish up Dark Link. The whole process can be done in about  mins depending on your weapon and skills.This should shave a few mins off your average min time and the trash mob farming for mins will net you a nice chunk of your level too. I average about  levels per run Currently lvl  Link and around k rupees.,HyruleWarriors,cl93etf,1,t5_30t9v
2120088,0,t1_cl9at8e,Heh sorry. Heavy is your Y attack if youre using Zelda controls. Not sure what button on Warrior controls basically your big combo finishers. On Link a raw heavy is his sword spin. When using Lanas summoning gate if you just use a raw heavy you summon a random giant boss King Dodongo Manhandla Ghoma and Argorok to do an attack and then vanish. This gives you a buff which changes the property of the combo associated to that boss and creates a new combo finisher.BY summons DodongoBBY Summons ManhandlaBBBY Summons GhomaBBBBY summons ArgorokSo for example using the Argorok combo by itself BBBBY summons the dragon who launches forward in a straight line and breaths fire on everything in its path. However if you summon Argorok first using a raw heavy so just pressing Y and then use the Argorok combo while still under the effect of the buff BBBBY youll instead mount Argorok and be allowed to fly around on his back for a bit as he breaths fire on everything in his path path of your choosing and youll have the option of ending the ride early by pressing Y which will cause Argorok to shoot a big fireball that does extra damage to stuff it hits.So the weapon is all about summoning a monster with raw heavy and then using the right combo to get the most out of the monster. You gotta play around with them to really learn what each does buffed or not and see which variation is best for any given case.Hope that clears things up!,HyruleWarriors,cl9b59g,2,t5_30t9v

2647956,0,t3_2q9vrd,The most likely candidates from Majoras Mask are overwhelmingly Skull Kid Tingle and Young Link  the only other noteworthy people from that game are Darmani represented by Darunia Mikau represented by Ruto Kafei possible but not really noteworthy for anything but solving puzzles and a few others.That said I think a case could be made for including Darmani or Mikau because the powers you gain from their masks in MM are not the same as the powers that Darunia and Ruto have in HW. But they can only add one so Id rather see a voicecostume pack for DR than either character getting added in full instead of SK or Tingle.If Im being completely honest I want Young Link or Skull Kid using a bunch of different masks to transform to fight but I suspect Tingle will have the highest odds of getting in due to being the most... insane option.,HyruleWarriors,cn47wwb,6,t5_30t9v
2746524,0,t3_2r91kr,Lots of practice is the best solution.  For Darknuts and Stalfos captains you can hit them once then dodge to the side hit again dodge to the side etc...  They have a chance to go into their weakened stance.  Volga is  learning to react to his stuff.  When he turns into a dragon and crashes down you can dodge through the initial explosion the lasting fire deals no damage and hit him then.   His stab the ground is a reaction you need to learn nothing to really look out for.  Always remember that an activated Magic gauge attack will break your enemy into their weakened stance.  And while you have your spirit Rush active you break through their guard so use it to get some normal hits in and then end with the spirit breaker.  It also helps to buy the stamina fruit badges as quickly as possible.  As they make it easier to burst through weakness points.  It is pretty much the main priority badge alongside fierce deitymore special attack gauges Farores wind capture keeps faster utility page and mogma mitts do damage through guards  Completing your combo badges still takes priority though.,HyruleWarriors,cng9o3v,1,t5_30t9v

Either way we cant be sure whats going on P,HyruleWarriors,csbw6zu,3,t5_30t9v

Streetpass Links To replace the WiiU versions Network Link mechanic but will function the same    Amiibo support Still has yet to be revealed what functionality it will have.Changes Proof can be found from Youtube videos and official site below    The games looking to be completely rebalanced from the WiiU version with level changes difficulty changes adventure mode map rewards mixed up with all characters through out the new adventure maps. Example you now get Zeldas Wind Waker weapon from the Great Sea adventure map or Heart Containers and Pieces for Ruto and Volga from the Great Sea map as well and so on.    The Level cap starting off is  How it was when the WiiU version first came out it could be increased with updates like the WiiU was over time.    Each row of Health now displays  Hearts but there is still  rows so when you collect everything and level up to max you will have a massive total of  hearts.    Some weapons can have a Gold background on its image portrait. Possibly a super rank of weapon of some sorts these weapons can have a power of  instead of the Max  in the WiiU version. It also may possibly have its max speed unlocked right off the bat instead of needing to be in Focus Spirit or have a Hasty Attacks skill on the weapon.    The Master Sword now has  hidden skills to unlock.    When an Enemy captain is about to use a Special attack a Item indicator shows above their heads showing what item to use against them.How about next time do some research instead of none at all.,HyruleWarriors,d156z96,1,t5_30t9v

7032293,0,t3_4bxjq9,I actually dont think the Wii U is gonna get a Legends balance patch. The game itself is near broken requiring you to almost level completely up to level  on some rounds. To patch over it with the balance that Legends would probably make any level over  pointless besides I guess getting more health. Legends is the current definitive version of the Hyrule Warriors we have. If it were not for the upcoming DLC The dev studios involved might as well be making a Hyrule Warriors  probably for the NX. But since Hyrule Warriors is a big hit even getting multi platform releases Id say that a sequel game on the nextgen console is as imminent as Mario Kart .,HyruleWarriors,d1dgre4,2,t5_30t9v

The white witch was a much more logical addition for that reason.  And even without that atleast they actually did something with them in the story.  Linkle has nothing going for her she was created from a bad idea to begin withadding in a female Link and then when they came up with a marginally better idea for hercooky grandma thought she was the hero and filled her head with delusions they dont do anything with it for her story.  honestly the time spend on Linkles boring doover the levels with deus ex machina compass chick tale would have been better spend either on the windwaker story or even just a nonrelated story that worked in Young Link Tingle and so forth or just about anything.  ,HyruleWarriors,d35bpxt,1,t5_30t9v

Id love to see  Twinrova  Groose  Vaati  Saria  Nabooru  Byrne  MalladusChancellor Cole  Ralph  Onux  Veran  Makar  Happy Mask Salesman  Maybe not four swordstriforce heroes links but the villain from TH I forget her name  A character from BotW.       Id love loads of new stages with Koholint Island and Termina being my most wanted.      Id love to see loads of new weapons and if feasible some characters it may not be Id love to see every character get at least  weapons even if some weapons were shared between two characters the wind waker for zelda and toon link for example. Id like the mini cap phantom zeldahourglass and spirit train added for toon link the sheikah slate added as a weapon for link and the a set of the Deku Goron and Zora mask for young link.

Music Apparently the Wii U version lets you change the BGM for the current battle. DS does not let you do this. Also Wii U has the soundtrack dynamically change like when you go into the tunnel in Eldin Caves. Enemy Count Naturally the handheld cant render enemies on screen like the Wii U can so it gets around this by sort of queuing up enemies and popping them in depending on camera position or you killing them. However there are occasions when this leads to enemies going invisible at inconvenient times like when you set off your special and the camera does a dramatic pan. I rarely notice this myself but it is worth noting.  Finally theres Lanas Summoning Gate weapon. Instead of summoning miniature models of the bosses she summons colored orbs that function the same way. Unfortunate but it retains its functionality from the Wii U version... mostly. In legends Lanas Strong Attack causes her current summon attack to instantly despawn which make crowd control trickier for her than on the Wii U. YMMV of course but it is a mechanical change and worth noting. ,HyruleWarriors,d6iwg8c,7,t5_30t9v
8674856,0,t1_d6ornme,As far as I can tell the boosts to any specific type of attack WPS normal attacks strong attacks special attacks etc etc are modified proportionate to how strong that attack was originally prior to the boost  in other words if the attack was really weak initially the buff provided by the respective skill wouldnt be a huge increase compared to other attacks and their buffing skills. Thus because normal attack buffs the regular often also called weak attacks the boost it provides is very small in proportion to other skills such as finishing blow etc.The only exception I can really see to this fact is if you basically use nothing BUT standard attacks which makes beating harder enemies much more of a chore for most characters but to each his or her own I guess.In regards to the OP topic Id say I like keeping multiple weapons for different purposes  yes farming for multiple s  weapons takes longer but I find the benefits of having something for different scenarios such as a compatriot weapon version for certain keep maps defenseless weapon for farming materialsfoodsetc no healing weapon for easier adventure mode clearing far outweighs the cost of having to farm somewhat longer.,HyruleWarriors,d6pza0o,2,t5_30t9v

Its probably Ganondorfs best option against character officers yknow when you meet a playable officer on the enemy side in closecombat and can work as a crowdcontrol attack that hits around Ganondorf when hes surrounded by smaller groups of mooks.

9121665,0,t3_557wmq,Stats amp Numbers from Round Spreadsheet of resultsPeople said they were reading the stats stuff before so... lets try medium length? I dunno! out of  weapons yesterday appeared on at least one top list  the only two which didnt being the Magic Rod and Hylian Sword.  were on a bottom list with only Ghirahim the Gauntlets and Spinner escaping. Interesting to note four of those six are Link weapons.Highly controversial weapons seem to be Zant Scimitars who scored  . This doesnt surprise me too much  he once had a reputation as one of the worst characters in the game before he got slapped around with the buff hammer. Hes pretty complex to play and has a lot of attacks that deal low damage quickly so it can feel like hes weak as he never makes a health gauge drop huge chunks at once  even though he reduces HP reasonably quickly overall. Lana Summoning Gate with . . Again not too surprising  she has hugely powerful attacks that she can spam from a distance but she can be highly unsafe. On top of that a few things that make her very strong in Wii U such as an infinite combo with C and having multiple summons on screen at once dont exist in HWL. Link Horse with  . Slightly smaller numbers than the above but since its so close this one could be interesting to watch. I... dont know how I feel about the Horse. Its complex and feels relatively weak overall but it has some great juggle capacity so it might actually be really strong.,HyruleWarriors,d889wwm,4,t5_30t9v

9691417,0,t1_da7i6j9,Thats so confusing... I get that columnletter rownumber comes from the fact that usually there are lots of rows and much fewer columns you wanna square tables and text is longer horizontally and since the opposite is true for HW maps maybe they should be flipped. But I like sticking to conventions and making an exception for this game is overly confusing IMO. Besides I bothered to put the name of the mission in brackets precisely because there is no consensus on what to name each tile.Moreover if someone is confused by the coordinate system Im using at worst theyll have to check  maps and see which is the one Im referring to. If I used the other convention this would still be true. So I dont see much point in changing the way I name coordinates unless everyone starts to consistently name it the same way. Specially since it goes against the more general table coordinates convention.Im not exactly trying to convince people to change their system I just think there is no one system so I chose the option I preferred.
