7189255,0,t1_d1vcbyh,I saw one dog all weekend last year. It was Saturday afternoon around . It was the entrance right off the dirt road behind all the vendor booths.  Its the only one I saw that you didnt need to go through camp grounds to get to.  Not sure if it was the main gate or not.  ,ssmf,d1vcv6b,2,t5_3d436
7218333,0,t3_4du4vi,Ive been to ssmf the last three years and it has gotten a little more strict each year. Two years ago they did have dogs walking up and down the lines of cars when we first got to the festival however they honestly looked like they were for show and possibly not even legitimate drug dogs. The security also waved us through without going through our vehicle or anything. Last year security went through every square inch of my things even searching underneath the ice in the bottom of my coolers  this was to get into the North campground.As far as security to get into the fest grounds it starts off normal the first day general patdown but nothing extensive. As the timedays went on the security got so lazy to the point where they were overwhelmed and just letting people walk in. I think though that this may have been due to the impatient attitude of many festgoers after they shut down the shows due to the weather then when the sets were back on  people were frantically running around everywhere. Somerset village police seem to be pretty strict especially since this festival is known to have caused a stir in the local community in the past years however with how many people will be aroundleaving the festival you have no reason to worry unless youre planning on taking all of your drugs before you leave then attempt to drive all messed up. Just dont do that and youll be fine haha.,ssmf,d1yo354,2,t5_3d436

8479652,0,t3_4vsfi7,QuestionRV camping again this year arriving Fri afternoon due to rv not being ready until then but dont want to miss out on the good spots i.e. in the horseshoe. The rest of our crew is trying to go early fri or even thurs night in their car to reserve our spot. Tried email infoss they said dont worry about it but thats not worth much in my book...Anyone have experience with this? Last year we got gypped for our jumbo spot because there werent any left by the time we arrived. Still had a blast but we were super cramped bc we have people in tents too. Cant wait to see everyone there look for the pirate flag!,ssmf,d61hzu6,3,t5_3d436
