Its difficult to make the case its an over reach by the government when its a referendum the people vote for and not a political bill. Also the only thing this amendment is doing is to amend the Constitution so that it makes the Constitution NEUTRAL on abortion where there was a SC ruling that our Constitution was pro abortion.

2280885,0,t1_clthssv,k was a rough ball park as an example. I did   . the grocery sales tax rate. Its actually worse because obviously no one can spend their whole salary on groceries. However at that salary range they wont be  taxed by the federal income tax so they are mainly taxed on all their purchases and at that salary range those purchases are most likely for survival.Theres no way you can currently say that an income tax will definitely hurt you because the tax brackets have never been allowed to be set for state income tax. No one knows what it could look like. You might pay more or you might pay less. My idea of a good implementation would be that someone who is at the exact median income would see no additional tax burden. It would just shift from being mostly sales tax to mostly income tax. Above median would see their tax burden increase based on a scale. But now no one will ever have the chance to see how an income tax could be implemented. People with lots of money will continue to pay a pittance and have lots left over to corrupt our political process further. We will continue to struggle with paying teachers a fair salary building and repairing roads building new types of mass transit to prevent Atlantalike sprawl of our cities.

I think people should be allowed to have whatever weapon they want short of weapons of mass destruction.  They already do in fact.   And yes its quite possible to believe that people who want to limit natural rights truly dont understand what theyre limiting.

And now I see how you come to that conclusion.  See thats what I mean.  That right there.  PROOF you dont understand natural rights at all.
