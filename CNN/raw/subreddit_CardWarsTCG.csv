8973735,0,t1_d7qcvao,Yeah I knew they dont die when you flip them I was able to kill all her creatures leaving her with no creatures and no landscapes.  I flipped one in one turn two a turn later leaving her with only  blue plains and she didnt have anything she could play in her hand so she was stuck drawing cards waiting.  Then I flipped the last and she was just out of luck I guess.,CardWarsTCG,d7qi9tr,2,t5_32u2v
