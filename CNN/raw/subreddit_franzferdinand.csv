213088,0,t3_1wj2a3,So for those of you who might not have been fans back then the original version of Lucid Dreams was available online months before Tonight came out and thats still the version I prefer. Its more to my taste musically although I do like the dreamy quality that the song got in the album version. I remember being mad that they cut out the lyrics that referenced the shipping forecast South Fisher German Bight in the album version.Ive never been able to decide if the song is about being far away from someone you love and wishing that you could meet up with them in some idealized place in your dreams or if its more general than that. ,franzferdinand,cf2prpe,2,t5_2r0fe

3587985,0,t3_31f5ma,I love this song but I really wish they didnt pick up for the chorus. It feels out of place in the song and it keeps me from listening to it but every once in a while. That being said the bridge and verse riffs are some of my favorite from the bands entire line of work and I love the lyrics. I feel like its one of those you need to hear live.,franzferdinand,cq19ayn,3,t5_2r0fe
3588777,0,t3_31f5ma,I think Im Your Villain is a standout track honestly. Its such a fun song and it really nails that darkly sexy vibe from their first album. Its one of the few songs from YCHISMB I never skip. ,franzferdinand,cq1cju9,4,t5_2r0fe
