5510307,0,t3_3qknso,It is remarkable how many people think their Holy Text is inspired by God the only book or books so inspired yet they have read little or none of it.  Most religious people I know unlike the people I discuss with here online who seek out debate havent read the Bible.  They are familiar with parts of it but mainly second hand.I think Ive read all of it over time but never succeeded in going from start to finish. And my efforts to read the Koran or Baghivad Gita or Book of Mormon were even worse.  Im thinking that one of the universal attributes we can ascribe to all Gods is that they just arent very good at writing books. A claim by anyone that their god has written or inspired a book thats a real page turner that grabs and holds the interest from start to finish may be dismissed. Either the book doesnt live up to the hype or its a false god. Real gods write or inspire tedious books.,FreeAtheism,cwfzptn,2,t5_2xe09
