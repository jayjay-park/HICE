11506338,0,t1_dg08mdj,I hope to be friends with all and am in the process of making friendships with the Rhubarbs and Carrots as well as the Yams in hopes of bringing all fruits and vegetables together in peace.Should they decline my offer I will gladly become an ally. Should they accept my offer I will not become an enemy but I will be neutral in the hopes of accomplishing my goal of peace. Edit I have visited the Rhubarbs and have seen that they have surrendered. In light of this new information I shall ally with you and the Rhubarbs but I will not give up on my alliance with the carrots as I want them to join out of friendship and not hatred.,CabbageCountry,dg08t1c,4,t5_3jxir
