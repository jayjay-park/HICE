The series game mechanics were at their most polished in that one and it shows. Also Geos grown more mature by the third game naturally. What youre looking for in your first paragraph is in the third game and brought it to a higher level on a side note why were you ever expecting there to be such complex things in the first game?

All of these should work but only in the aspect of multiplayer. were designed with PvP gameplay in mind first before the actual game so their story modes were weak.

9020426,0,t1_d7vsjr2,A majority of people dont like BN for the reason of Liberation Missions. Sure theyre not hard but they add an unnecessary difficulty that isnt present in any other game in the franchise Timed fighting. And not every Navi in liberation missions are designed with this in mind Im looking at you Middy and NumberMan. It was tedious to manage folders with this in mind and it got even more annoying when the game forced you to have people that you relied on sit out in the name of keeping watch. It wasnt fun it took a long time and Id rather have done a standard dungeon than a liberation mission.I think the reason why it comes as a surprise to most that other people dislike BN is due to the game that came before it. BN gets a huge amount of hate for the franchise given you need to reply it at least three times in order to get all the souls and attempt to fully completing the game. Because of this anything looks good in comparison so BN is viewed as a good game as a result.Of course thats not to say that BN was a bad game. It had a number of good parts to it that I actually really enjoyed. Recruiting team members was really fun and playing as other Navis was for the most part not to bad you can tell they definitely capitalized on this in the final game because they realized how enjoyable it was. Plus BN Double Team did manage to fix a lot of the issues the standalone games had.,BattleNetwork,d7w440t,3,t5_2zwjl

Unintentionally by the developers but you can arrange it so that you receive up to  chips per turn.The most reasonable use of this however is the th chip glitch. By stacking  Custom s along with custom style you give your self an th chip which can be accessed by selecting a chip then moving to the right of the th chip in your folder.Unlike the other  chips however this chip will always be the same chip. Whatever the second chip in your folder is. You get access to that chip every turn and it can be any chip. ,BattleNetwork,d93whre,6,t5_2zwjl
