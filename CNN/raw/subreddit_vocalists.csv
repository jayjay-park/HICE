10434486,0,t3_5avn68,Play to your strengths build up your weaknesses and dont hurt yourself. Im a Pentatonix nerd and IIRC Mitch Grassi has only been singing about  years? But also he sings all the time he probably had lessons and he sounds great if you check out the high school performances with him Scott and Kirstin. Personally I think he has a beautiful voice. But I suppose it depends on your definition of amazing.Keep working at it if you are improving then thats great! When it comes to auditions my advice is prepare as much as possible and be able to sing the tune really well a cappella meaning basically all you need is a starting pitch maybe then you can nail it. Even if you dont think youre an amazing singer yet go for the auditions! Its good experience and you never know. I auditioned for a jazz combo one semester and goofed a couple of words because I was nervous but I just rolled with it and focused on singing and being comfortable etc....I honestly didnt think I was going to make it. Then they put up the list and I got placed in one of the coolest jazz combos of my whole college career! Believe in yourself be confident dont be afraid to audition.As far as practice each day see how you feel. It is important to listen to your voice. How do you feel after stretching and warming up? Check in with everything if you feel great get to work. If anything hurts stop. I am of the opinion that it is better to rest and come back to it later or the next day than to hurt yourself and be unable to sing for a week or several days. Also I find it super helpful to transcribe by which I mean imitate as exactly as possible other singers and get a feel for their techniques. So singing everything exactly like they do all the notes rhythms tone inflection articulation pronunciation phrasing literally try to sing it identical to them. For singing its good to find a singer you like who has a similar range and voice type to you. I like Chet Baker and I just enjoy singing along to him and he is easy for me to sing along with so Ive kind of done that with him through osmosis just singing along in the car or whatever. I have also done this in the practice room with him Nat King Cole and others i.e. Ella Fitzgerald Fats Waller Frank Sinatra etc..... Its a good way to learn how to sound more like a singer I think. What this does for me is to help me learn the singers techniques by breaking them down to understand them better. Especially when you slow it down you start to hear all the tiny nuances that make them sound so incredible like how in pop singers you hear stunning falsettos riffs touches of vocal fry Ive heard some say vocal fry is bad for your voice others say it is supposed to relax your voice? Cant say it has ever caused me an issue personally. quiet close to the mic singing etc....In jazz singers Ive noticed the tiniest things like holding a note for a long time somewhere inside the note in a rhythmically appropriate spot they jump to a neighbouring tone for the smallest moment sometimes returning to the original note then a lower neighbour tone and back up. Dropoffs at the end of phrases almost like big band hits in the brass section drifting down into a little bit of vocal fry or speaking range at times etc....The way they utilize vibrato is really beautiful to me like Nat King Cole in this song where I transcribed his vocal part you can hear most of these things occurring.Also just pay attention to the way they channel their voice and their air. Like listen to Dean Martin He sounds like the words are just falling out of his face like he can barely be bothered to sing them. And he sounds incredible! Hes so relaxed just engaging the muscles he needs to to sing properly. Nat King Cole sounds like this too but he has a little more smokiness to his voice and he uses more techniques on this song I used the same for both so you could hear a comparable difference. To hear how youre doing its good to record yourself singing the transcription and compare it to the recording. Do they differ at all? Keep at it.Note...the term transcription is kind of bastardized excuse my language this is how my teachers have described it to me and fellow students and in the jazz world means to learn the part from a recording exactly by singing perfectly with the recording then without the recording and then playing it if you play an instrument with the recording perfectly then without the recording perfectly. Then you break up phrases and work it into your improvisational ideas for soloing etc.....TLDR Youre doing great take care of your vocal health and listen to your voice. Drink water. Sleep enough. Imitate singers you love by singing identically literally identically to them and absorb their techniques. Record yourself to listen back great to do in general lets you hear how you really sound and you can try changing little things and recording yourself singing something different ways and have a clear understanding of how it affects your sound.Apologies for my giant nerd comment hope this helps. Good luck ,vocalists,dcqthiw,1,t5_2veab
