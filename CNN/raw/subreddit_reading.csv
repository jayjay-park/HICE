8614534,0,t3_4xo4vd,also not in reading any more and not sure if these places deliver but i had good experiences from the following went multiple times to all so not oneoffs hot stuff oxford road pretty standard kebabtype place but the chicken wraps were good bakery house london street already mentioned but this place does amazing kebabs and all sorts of lebanese dishes if you want to sit in bhoj oxford road standard indian fare always tasted decent dubai grill oxford road kebabs and the like chicken tikka wrap was always nicetheres a thai place in tilehurst thai now that i tried a few times before leaving.  flavours were nice but one time they sent a dish that was basically just too hot and i can eat a fair bit of hot food and the portions are quite small which is never good when youre greedy like i am.  id recommend trying but your mileage may vary.totally offtopic but sushimania is probably the best value for money if you go in when their menu is half off.  i think its every day before a certain time but best call if you want to try it.,reading,d6iexhs,2,t5_2revv
9048177,0,t3_546luv,Its one of the best places in England for casual walking I would say . How far do you want to walk? For short stuff have a look at the area bounded by the M A and A. Maybe start with the pub at Frilsham as you can do some loops from there. For longer stuff go north of the river in to south Oxfordshire  for instance I have a favourite walk which goes more or less in a straight line between Henley and Goring  both have convenient stations. Thatcham to Pangbourne is another good one or Aldermaston station to Pangbourne. But basically theres almost as much footpath as road here so its not hard to put together a good walk on the fly generally with a pub for lunch.If you let me know what distance you are interested in Ill dig up some GPX files.,reading,d7zg2rd,2,t5_2revv
