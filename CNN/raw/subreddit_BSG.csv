56431,0,t3_1uf72p,This never made sense to me either. Then in the re imagining it did not make sense to me that they were not encountering settled planets. If you think of that universe economics.. there are FTL powered air liners and I am sure there were rich people with their own FTL powered ships. One episode mentions Tauron rebels working close to the border between Colonial space and Cylon space. It would make sense that the Sagitarons on Taurons or even Caprican privateers would have set up colonies somewhere else. ,BSG,cekus58,1,t5_2qlvu

94840,0,t1_cep5ssq,We play with parts of the expansions.. We use pretty much everything from Pegasus but weve House Ruled the New Caprica part  we only trigger New Caprica if the distance is exactly . If we skip past  we skip past New Caprica and play it out as normal.We use the Cylon Fleet part of Exodus but not the extra Trial stuff because we usually have a small group playing and it becomes weird.We havent used much from Daybreak yet because my nephew is just now finishing up the show and I didnt want anything to be spoiled for him. There are some Crisis Cards that are spoilery and so is the whole Demitrius and Rebel Basestar thing.We also use all of the characters from all of the expansions.So far because we were pretty familiar with the regular rules doing it this way makes the game much more interesting without complicating things too much.EDIT Oh!

234265,0,t3_1wrzoy,Definitely Caprica. It was much deeper than Blood and Chrome. While I did enjoy the whole scifi woooo spaceships and CGI entertainment factor of BampC Caprica is definitely the better show with more canon storybuilding and lore.Plus honestly I couldnt get over the modifications they made to the Galactica.

387921,0,t3_1yarr6,If you were a big fan of BSG and its universe you might really like Caprica in the end. I didnt like Blood and Chrome Razor was okay but its meant to be watched before S I believe. The Plan was disappointing considering it came after the series ended. Caprica is a much different type of show bordering on soap opera at times however it was at its best when showing the beginnings of Cylon technology. Dont expect any space scenes and the first half of the season can be very slow at times but its all worth it for the buildup that pays off in the last  episodes. ,BSG,cfkz2a2,2,t5_2qlvu

You have the Commander Cag XO top pilot Gaeta D master chief and every influential political figure all in one place with presumably a skeleton crew left on the battlestar... What happens if the cylons attack? What if a bomb went off and the ship depressurized?

What if Starbuck is a man what if Boomer is black again... why does that matter to you? Why do you let it matter? It will simply be a piece of entertainment you dont engage with. Their choices have no power to rewrite overwrite or delete anything you prefer instead.gt If it fails that probably means no more BSG ever.No difference whether it fails or not  theres not going to be any more RDMreimagined BSG. If thats what defines BSG for you  as it does for me  a Glen Larson film is neither a hindrance nor a help. The principles have moved on the sets were sold the story was told... theres not going to be another chapter. A Glen Larson reboot is for those fans of the original who havent gotten their reboot yet is my take on it. Nevermind that there werent enough of them to convince anyone to reboot it before the RDM production.,BSG,cgnh8yw,1,t5_2qlvu

1332539,0,t3_299vfe,Typically the Cylon raiders are terrible dogfighters thats why the human pilots easily kill hundreds before a cylon makes a lucky shot and kills a human pilot. The point of having fighter support is to stop the missiles that raiders can fire. Some raiders are equipped with nukes and kamikaze attacks are the normal for raiders since they are reborn shortly afterwards. Without fighter support the Galactica was poised to take the beating of a lifetime and without Fat Lees sacrifice of the more advanced ship and its supplies the Galactica would have never survived that assault.,BSG,cijiznh,7,t5_2qlvu

Quality not relatedMad Men. Obviously theres no scifi action but as in Battlestar you have amazing characters acting cinematography and music. Like BSG its set in a dynamic wellrealized society that is very familiar in some ways but alien in other ways.

6493157,0,t1_czqw7ap,I agree that she could have said what she did about Cain in part for the benefit of the Pegasus crew but I think theres more to it than that and its one of those small honest counterpoints that made me love this series so much. I believe Kara developed a very complex lovehate relationship with Cain during the brief time she got to know her. She recognized and somewhat identified with Cains strength of will her passionate hatred for the Cylons even her reckless disregard for consequences in pursuit of her goals traits she echoed more than a little bit in herself. Having been tasked to kill her especially through a deception perversely only strengthened her complex emotional bond with her and while she would have followed her orders I think she was immensely relieved that in the end she did not have to. Regardless of Cains brutal methods she had earned Karas respect in some ways and it was rare for her to come across someone especially another woman who commanded that. So part of that could have been for Pegasus but in some way part of that could have been a stinging reprimand for the way she had been asked to betray her part of her could have believed it. ,BSG,czqxvnt,8,t5_2qlvu

I love Baltar in this episode. Its a top Baltar episode. gtIm still very unsure if the cylons actually want to be loved if its a strategy for them to deceive humans in an effective way or if it is some mix between them being a human clone while still having cylon control and the human emotion side of things can interfere with that directive.Very interesting.

10651452,0,t1_dde3t3f,I think it made a lot of sense if you compare US Navy ships that were kept operational after a major war. The best comparison is probably the USS New Jersey BB. She was built for WWII with loads of secondary  guns. When they brought it back into service in the s they removed many of the  guns and antiaircraft batteries with harpoon missile launchers and PHALANX radar guided defence turrets. You can also look at the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal CVA. She was initially built with    guns. They were all removed eventually since a carriers best defense was determined to be its airwing like Galactica. Ron Moore was a Navy guy. He put a lot of great subtle touches into the show. ,BSG,ddem5rt,1,t5_2qlvu

11219427,0,t3_602ppf,Ill grant the premise It is kind of pointless. But then again so are a lot of episodes. You could skip a lot of episodes of the show if youre just going by what you absolutely have to see for it to make for the largescale story to make sense. It wouldnt flow very well but honestly you could skip directly from the miniseries to Kobols Last Gleaming and pretty much make sense of whats going onthey captured a Raider? How did... Oh yeah I guess that happens. You could cut a lot of season two too They built a stealth fighter on the Galactica? Uh... Well okay I guess why not?Ill also give you that there are some problems. The premise of a scientific team going out to do work is one of the shows very few jarringlyTrek moments and Adamas involvement is a little contrived. The Acast roped in for the hangarbay scene are game but the greenscreen work is really poor like Blood and Chromelevel obvious. The flashbacks could have used more work and better choices I know McCreary loves shoehorning in that Stu Phillips theme especially in moments where it feels sensible to evoke TOS but here it doesnt work. The attack on Scorpion Yards is tasteful and mostly excellent particularly the character beats but marred by one of my most hated TV tropes the moment a character says impact in ten seconds youre on the clock and youd better be done in ten seconds.I also think youre exactly right about seeing the events versus hearing about them from Fisk. Seeing events isnt always better. Id apply that criticism primarily to The Plan rather than Razor. A CG prn realization of the Fall isnt as visceral or as intimate as experiencing it through the reactions of the characters in the miniseries Im thinking particularly of Dualla and Cally but also Starbuck and Tyrol but I think youre probably right about Razor too. This is also a problem that haunts any attempt to flesh out the cylon war.But I still like Razor. Its true that you arent really missing anything if you dont watch it. But it adds interesting color texture and context to Cain and Starbuck and perhaps depending on your relationship with TOS to the mythology and backstory Helfers really good and Forbes and particularly Jacobson are charismatic enough to carry the material. The Starbuck v. Shaw tension and Shaws cold Im not playing your game approach to her are fantastic. Im more interested in the characters and the world than the nominal plot and Razor gives us a lot of hints on that score although I concede that it largely depends how well you like Forbes. So two cheers for Razor but I certainly do take your points.,BSG,df3pi22,5,t5_2qlvu
