1813597,0,t3_2fak64,Heres a restored photo for you.  Sorry I didnt have the time to colorize it.  Honestly I think its a beautiful photo in Sepia Tone.  When you colorize an old photo it looses its charm and just looks like the family got together for one of those oldies portraits. Personally I think that if it was taken during the BampW era it should stay that way.  Also I left in the tiny imperfections that dont detract from the photo for the same reason.  I think those little aged pieces just add to it. Anyway here you go ,estoration,ck7pvf5,4,t5_2ww45
