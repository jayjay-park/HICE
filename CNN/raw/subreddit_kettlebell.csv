447495,0,t1_cfr425p,Cant really provide much info. This is a lowthought plan for me and thats why it works.When I first started losing weight around the end of  I was around . Simply switching one meal a day to a salad or something like that caused me to steadily lose weight until I got to  at the beginning of summer  where I stayed until the fall. In the fall I decided to start exercising again regularly. Mostly running and the insanity program. That got me down to the low s where my weight loss again.Enter the kettlebell and IF. I started kettlebells in November. Ive dropped down to about . When I started with the lb I dropped from the lows to the mids. I upgraded to a lb a couple weeks ago and that took me from the mids to the highs. That works out to about  of a pound per week and I dont really watch what I eat just when I eat.But Ive recently signed up for a vegetable coop so Ive been eating a lot more healthy food in the past month. I havent observed any difference in how I feel or in my weight loss.I generally eat between  noon and pm every day. I work out before my evening meal.Doing a bodyfat measurement would be a waste of my time and money since theyre ridiculously inaccurate unless you pay to use proper equipment.,kettlebell,cfr5bvz,5,t5_2rpqv

People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence belief perseverance when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false the irrational primacy effect a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series and illusory correlation when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations.gtgtImage iInteresting Congruence bias |  numerology | Anecdotal evidence | Observation Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcrna oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecrna.

In your plank position widen your legs a bit then row only with the right arm. Ideally the flat kettlebell on the left should provide a little bit more stability than holding onto the handle.

The only way to maintain those gains is to maintain a similar routine after the end of the k.  Two thoughts on that  Doing  swings plus other movements  per week isnt so bad and you could easily push that up to  and  I reckon the k provides a useful kick up the arse.

5389552,0,t3_3oun65,I do SampS on TuesdThursSat and a body weight routine MWF. Im happy. I dont expect to build giant muscles but I am becoming noticeably stronger. Too easy? Nah. If SampS is too easy then use a heavier kettle bell or find ways to make it harder. Use one arm swings exclusively or use multiple bells. Move faster. Engage your core even more. It can be as hard or as easy as you want it. I recommend that you alternate days. The Turkish getups can really fatigue your shoulders so it will compromise your ability to do heavy arm balance work like L sits hand stands or using rings for pushups. The SampS routine also hits your core pretty hard so planks and other body line work may suffer if done on the same day. Vice versa as well. The full SampS routine if done with appropriate heavy weight feels complete. Likewise body weight routines. ,kettlebell,cw0kqke,5,t5_2rpqv

But to answer what I think youre asking the part of me that limits the movement or almost goes out varies.  Stepping up to this weight has forced me to be formconscious about each step in a way that I never had to before and if I forget to focus at any point I will feel it.  Sometimes its my core struggling to get my lower shoulder off the ground other times I feel my loaded shoulder wobble when Im starting back down from standing.The thing that helps me most is to utilize form cues to get each part of the movement as efficient as possible and to keep my core rock hard at all times.  That second part seems to be the unifying factor that makes it work and even reduces things like shoulder wobbles.  But it is getting easier.  I think the only thing keeping me from more reps or a higher weight is that I havent been doing this one long enough.  I fully expect to get there and then to go through all this again.  ,kettlebell,d5rz3x9,3,t5_2rpqv

When making big jumps in weight we tend to overcompensate by tensing up too early in the drop and overgripping the KB. Technique is lost.I used to think we needed heavy KB sets to force technique because we dont have the raw strength to move the bell but now I believe that doing so actually breaks technique rather than building it. Without a video I have no idea of course what youre doing. But the most common thing I see online is people staying too upright and throwing the KB forward. Try and move your shoulder backwards and relax your arm just kind of getting out of the KBs way as its falling. You want to lean far back enough to take the slack out of your arm so theres no big shock to the forearm and its nice and smooth transitioning into the backswing.,kettlebell,d63h5jy,5,t5_2rpqv
