7170514,0,t3_4dpmck,Evergreen supposedly has really good acceptances to ivy league schools for science. I took the general analytical and physical chemistries at evergreen. All the programs except the physical chemistry program was with  other courses the general chemistry with general biology and calculus.The classes are long and hard generally you have class from  mon tue thur and  wed and then you have and then you have a lot of homework. Generally however they are taught very well. All the science classes are overbooked so the teachers haze the students to get them to drop. They make it unnecessarily hard. My physical chemistry class went from  people to  and my general chemistry class went from  to . The organic chemistry class I do not think you should take there the teachers are dicks so Ive heard.Id like to clarify that the teachers are very supportive and they work with you to learn the material what I meant by hazing is that there are a certain number of people in every science class who are liberal arts majors and very under prepared for the class who will drop if you put enough work on them.,evergreen,d1t7xpv,5,t5_2sgda
