134451,0,t3_1vl93z,A case where a patient suffers delusions similar to a soldier experiencing PTSD. This patient through whose eyes we see everything is rapidly getting worse and is starting to see monsters and strange beasts. She starts to believe these visions to the point where it is nearly impossible to restrain them. They escape one quiet night find themselves in a operating room that is being set up for a procedure set to take place there. They reach for some of the blades there thinking that they are swords and daggers. The door opens! A monster enters the room the patient panics and howls in fear charges forward and stabs the monster in the neck. The patient flees as the monster crumbles to the floor bleeding profusely alone....The patientstill wielding the tool and covered in blood is found by a doctor who has the sense to shout for a security guard who comes and subdues the patient. The doctor notices the blood and checks the patient for wounds....but there arent any. The alert goes out to quickly find anyone wounded. But it is too late by the time the monster is found....he is long dead. The monster is Shane and he leaves us forever.,greysanatomy,cetqs4z,10,t5_2t2vo

When their all attendings you feel almost scared for them when they screw up. Youre scared of the higher ups and it literally feels like the bottom of the food chain. Crazy to think where they will end up in  more seasons. Who lives. Who dies. Who gets introduced. ExcI do think its a bit inconstant though.

Webber has a lot on his plate since hes dealing with a new daughter he never knew he had and now Jacksons mom is back in town after dealing with the death of her grandchild.  I really hope they rekindle their relationship.  I would love to see more of her character on the show.  Even getting remarried for Webber would be awesome.I would especially love Jo to be paired with Bailey.  She hasnt had much of a good storyline in forever it seems.her human genome project that was shut down wasnt really that interesting IMO. I think thats why they cut it I miss her kicking intern ass when the show first started.  She could def kick Jos ass in gear.  She has become more of a purring kitten than the fierce lioness she used to be.  Everyone used to fear her now she is pretty much a joke.she only scares Webber now.

I read somewhere once that Ellen is in it for the long haul but doesnt think she will pursue acting anymore once the show has run its course. And if she changes her mind for some reason I think her leaving will be the catalyst for the series ending. Granted I said the same thing that the show would end with their departure many times about lead characters on ER but ER wasnt called Greenes ER or Carters ER so I still think its different for Greys. ,greysanatomy,cwqcqyj,1,t5_2t2vo

I liked the abortion arc because we saw both sides of it unlike with Burke in S.

You need to check in case your next one could have something and if you can do anything to make sure its healthyI am not an April fan at all but I can somewhat understand where shes coming from in regards to this. Often times woman who have had problematic pregnancies in the past do choose to hold off on testing and take some time to be happyblissful about the pregnancy before having to worry and fear for more heartbreak. Especially in Aprils situation where termination is pretty much off the table. Is it the most rational choice? Absolutely not but it makes sense. ,greysanatomy,d14t3nm,7,t5_2t2vo
6956404,0,t1_d14khpq,Im with you and usraydenk because I see what you mean on both sides. I do however agree it was a shitty way of going about it. I think she should have told April that she was going to tell Avery if she April didnt do it by a certain time. Given the fact that it was a genetic disease that killed the baby it is extremely important that this baby be tested.

7101471,0,t1_d1l9gep,I totally get Jacksons anger and feel he has the right to be angry but I also get Aprils side.  You know Mama Avery...I know April!  Jackson and April love each other so much but they are both terrible at communicating that especially April who is and always has been pretty socially awkward and immature.  When she fought for marriage it was because she loved him but she didnt get that he wasnt hearing that.  And honestly whatever she did during that divorce hearing would have doomed her with him and with fans.  If she had told him he would have been pissed and accused her of getting pregnant on purpose to make him stay and so would all of the Aprilhaters.  She didnt tell him and let him go not because she didnt love him enough but because her heart was broken and she was holding on to the last vestiges of pride she had.  And she thought she was giving him what he wanted and she didnt want to make him stay when he didnt want to and she knew he would and she feared he would just hate her for that.  She had tried and tried to make him stay for her and she just couldnt do that anymore.  The other reason April didnt tell him is because she is terrified this baby will have problems too and that he will push her to abort.  She is terrified of losing another child.  He was rightshe WAS waiting until it was too late whether she realized it or not and thats because she is so scared.  People raking her over the coals arent thinking about how absolutely terrified she must be on top of being so heartbroken.  Catherine needs to butt the hell out.  She manipulated April to get what she wanted but for what?  The only side any of them need to worry about now is the babys side and for Catherine to want to take the baby away from April out of spite is just shit. That baby needs both of its parents. I hope Jackson stands up to her and Richard tells her off...he saw what happened to Meredith when her bitch of a mother pulled that with Thatcher and then he lost his own child when she gave Maggie up for adoption out of spite.  I will hate him forever if he stands by and lets her do this to someone else.  Honestly there is no reason for her to even do this...its not like April would have kept Jackson out of the loop forever and shes not worried that he wont take care of the baby either.  She wasnt going to try to get money or anything and she wouldnt have kept the baby from him.  Catherine is doing this just because she is huge freaking bully who can get away with it because of her money.  She screwed over Cristina before and now shes gunning for April.  I really hate her.  Because as different as they are Cristina and April are my favorite characters!    ,greysanatomy,d1lbo6v,2,t5_2t2vo

7121517,0,t1_d1m6vt3,There is no way April would be at risk of losing custody. She hasnt proven that she would put her child in harms way. Its VERY difficult to lose custody completely if you are a normal person. Avery would need to prove April cant be trusted with her child or poses a threat to the safety of the child. If anything when the baby is born April will have more time with the newborn if she plans on breastfeeding. Catherine has NO rights as a grandparent. In some states grandparents can attempt to gain visitation but thats when they already have an existing relationship with the child and usually happens when a parent dies and the grandparents on that side dont want to lose touch with their grandchildren.

The fact that Callie was presented as so selfcentered and thoughtless to think that Arizona would be cool with her walking out with her child was just ridiculous.  That April has been indifferent to Jacksons feelings through two tours in Jordan a divorce and the start of a pregnancy is appalling. Andrew asking Why do you need a code word for a bunch of old people? was immature and lacked foresight.  Meredith blurting out her rage at Amelia was mean and showed a lack of selfrestraint.

They have such a tight bond with each other and I really just dont want to see them engage in romantics. Its just weird to me then again maybe thats just me being afraid of change. If it were to happen I would be abit uncomfortable but I think.i would warm up to it in time.But on the other hand these two have been through SO DAMN MUCH for  seasons now. They have been in each others lives for  whole years and they obviously love and care deeply for each other. They have so much chemistry back in them up and Ellen and Justin are close as friends and actors. I mean did you see how supportive Alex was of Mer after her attack? He didnt get anyone else to comfort her he got in the bed with her like she does at his home and laid there right next to her letting her know he was there and even making her laugh like he tends to do alot. He was like ger teddy bear in a large sense and I cant thank him enough  I couldnt ask for a better friend than Alex.If they were to ever get together I can say without a shadow of a doubt that he would be  committed to her.

8326624,0,t1_d5i5hbn,Yeah she lost a lot of people but there is still good left and shes just very dark to me now. Her character has developed from dark and twistywhich was absolutely cute to like depressing and serious. Does she even laugh anymore?! Yes Amy hasnt been a true sister but shes Dereks sister. Sisters are different in every family. Amy has tried to be there for her in a way she knows how and Mer has pushed her attempts away. So what she isnt Cristina. No one will be Cristina. That doesnt make her any less of a sister. And at time Cristina was an awful friend and kind of bitchy! Like half the time theyre talking at each other and not to each other and its so funny when Izzie points that out. Dont get me wrong I love their friendship at times it was beautiful. But sometimes it was just like two dysfunctional people who are trying to be there for each other.the whole time Cristina quits surgery after the shooting and goes fishing with Derek? WTF. My sister better never do that. Even if Im not what you need teach me tell me give me a chance. Dont just go running off with my fucking husband! That made me so mad. Anyway Cristina has had plenty of trip uod yet shes still her person. She should give Amelia the same chance.I didnt like Thorpe or Riggs for Mer anyway. But still I guess since was looking for what she and Derek had and why make her date if its going to subpar and not magical?

8681497,0,t3_4yvwvr,Your interpretation is interesting and I like it. I see Jo as Meredith she doesnt like to talk about her past has commitment issues has parent issues is talented and smart but was never the end all be all. I actually see Steph as the Cristina of the group. Shes driven motivated talented. She had problems in her childhood that she doesnt share like Cristina losing her dad. She puts career before love then changed her mind then changes her mind again. She had a relationship with an attending that blew up in her face at a wedding. She wants to do big things but doesnt want to slow down for people to keep up with her. And Jo is her Meredith even when they fight and hate each other. Jo even got jealous of her the same way Meredith did of Cristina in season .Shane seems like the oddball out to me. Hes definitely not Alex although they share the same commitment to their patients. And I think youre pretty spot on with Lea and Heather. ,greysanatomy,d6qt8a8,29,t5_2t2vo
8689717,0,t3_4yyl2r,Who is your Favorite character and why? Cristina Shes just a badass. She operated on Derek with a gun to her head. She was the best at not letting personal drama get in the way of her work and I respect that.   Who is your most hated character and why? Shane Ross. I honestly cannot think of one thing I like about him and I really really hated him with Cristina. The only good thing about him being close with Cristina was he left with her and I didnt have to look at him anymore.What is your favorite episode or episodes if its an arc? Fear Of the Unknown aka Cristinas farewell episodeWhos relationship do you like best non romantic? Although it was short lived I really liked Derek and Heather Brooks. I loved how Derek thought she was really weird and annoying at first but then he came to appreciate her weirdness. Whos romantic relationship do you like best? Teddy and HenryWhat relationship failed that you wish did not? I wish Teddy and Owen had more of a relationship. I dont really know when that would have happened in the timeline but I wanted to see how they would be together.If you could bring  character back to play chief in season  since bailey sucks now who would it be? Definitely Addison ,greysanatomy,d6rucaa,1,t5_2t2vo

What with him owning an equal share in the hospital and not being on the board then the revenuedividend payments or him selling his sharebeing forced to sell would just get nuts.But they just ignored the whole thing and assumed I would ignore it if they made him an attending.

10863001,0,t3_5uj8ht,I have a very real fear that they are killing or writing off Alex at the end of the season.  Or possibly Bailey. But most likely Alex.If you go back to the beginning each time they decide to cut a major character they spend the entire season on character assassination.  They made George a nobody. Izzie had ghost Denny sex technically was written off beginning of the next season. Lexi and Sloan spent an entire season playing love cat and mouse doing little else with any storylines.  Christina became a terrible bitch to Mer and they fought constantly until she left.  Derek and Mer nearly split and he almost cheated.  And they completely ruined anything good about Callie with the pettiness of that trial last season.Alexs storyline is really starting to feel like a goodbye  between being a terrible person at the beginning of the season to now missing from multiple episodes I can think of  off the top of my head he was completely gone with a small cameo in the one in his bed.  It all feels very familiar. ,greysanatomy,de0fx4c,2,t5_2t2vo
