3570923,0,t3_2yi375,I think it is a cultural thing some people believe children are for the young.  But so many of my friends tell me now they didnt appreciate them when they had their kids.  Also medicine has improved enough that having children later in life is not the great challenge it used to be.  Is it easier physically to have a child when you are young yes.  Is easier mentally  emotionally and financially when you are older  yes.  Even though my newborn is driving me crazy now I would have rather had her now than when I was in my twenties and emotionally not ready. ,FTParentsOver30,cpzb9xq,1,t5_37b78
