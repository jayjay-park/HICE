2810186,0,t1_cnmmbat,I hadnt ever used ClashCaller before but testing seems to have all of the features I want  an optional timeout feature that doesnt start until war actually starts support for multiple attackers on the same base and quick to set up none of this entering all the names manually nonsense. Ill set up for our next few wars and well see if people like ituse it. I can see where the extra step of getting on the internets before every war attack might be a pain for some people. Ill also try to generate a tinyurl or something with Paragonltwar start dategt as well as the ID since on Android at least you cant copypaste the URL. Hopefully we dont have assholes from other clans messing this up. I think our top guys do a pretty good job of holding off attacks to see if cleanup or new stars are needed. The people it would affect also seem to really like the idea of holding the bottom  for our bottom  for the beginning of war so well implement that. Again base   is just a guideline. If you notice your mirror has poorly located ADs and can be dragged or the guy above you is too spread out and super weak to loons etc go for the stars! We had a recurring issue where people would attack bases way out of their range for the phat  star.  Yes this is hedging a bit since a lot of us guilty are constantly readjusting how to maximize war attacks. ,redditparagon,cnnickj,1,t5_31qxq
