10851723,0,t1_ddyr34r,At many tracks such a fence wouldnt be an issue.  Late models modifieds and stock cars just dont get airborne the way sprints do and thus need a lot less fencing to maintain crowd safety.Given how frequently sprint cars get airborne requiring tracks that host them to have extra fence strength and either added height or a catch curve seems pretty reasonable.In my twentyish years of watching dirt racing Ive seen maybe five cars hit a boundary fence.  Despite sprints being only a visiting division at my mostfrequented tracks two of the incidents involve them.   Even the places that didnt typically host sprints still had either very tall fences or a catch fence plus a large space between the race surface and the fence line.  ,WorldofOutlaws,ddza161,2,t5_31vz8
