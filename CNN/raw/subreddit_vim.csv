Ive had far too many arguments with developersIm a sysadmin about nonexistent lines at the end of files or file encoding caused by Notepad.Notepad actually adds an empty line at the end of every file when you open it. It doesnt modify the file. It just shows an empty line at the end. For no reason. Because of this dozens of developers have gone to me with complaints about empty lines in data files that mess with their EKHUshitEKHYcode parsing them.Even after Ive shown them a hexdump of the file with only one a at the end they still insisted that there is an empty line there.,vim,cfj4zlu,17,t5_2qhqx

This lets me generate comments based on the arguments I enter and it updates in realtime. I use something similar to autoassign arguments to member variables in my init.All of which is really cool but I switched because it fixed a bunch of bugs I was experiencing with garbasvimsnipmate I think the response to bug reports was that it was hard to deal with this stuff in vimscript.If you really wanted to ensure your snippets work without python you could use both and only load snipmate if theres no python.

1124856,0,t3_26z00g,On the file manager  Vim works differently from most text editors. I suggest you learn about buffers windows and tabs. Vim comes with Netrw which works very well with the Vim concept of buffers tabs and windows.I suggest that you do not go down the rabbit hole of plugins to start with. Plugins change the behavior of Vim which isnt a great thing when youre trying to learn. I suggest starting with a minimal vimrc and only add to it that which you understand.vimcasts.org is useful. The book Practical Vim is well worth your time.Learn incrementally. Learn something new put it in to practice for a week or so until it becomes default behavior. Then learn something else. If you feel youve nothing left to learn youre likely mistaken ,vim,chw5lf5,5,t5_2qhqx
1130010,0,t1_chwlqt1,I use that and youre right that does usually work. The weirdness here is that I want those powers for Autodesk Mayas cmds module which doesnt really exist. It was converted over from the original MEL commands through some conversion tool and the commands exist in compiled binary .so files. When you start up Maya it dynamically builds some sort of connection from the empty cmds module through to the C things in the .so libraries. Also even when you go into Maya and import maya.cmds as cmds doing e.g. helpcmds.move will just output    Help on builtin function move in module maya.cmds        move...If youre thinking Thats no way to build a Python module then we agree There are a ton of commands in Maya so Id also have to scrape the data which isnt really formatted nicely for scraping. Ive tried it a few times and found it an uphill battle. Still Ive been using Maya for  years since it was called PowerAnimator and owned by Alias|Wavefront and using Vim for  years and for most of a decade Ive dreamed of being able to K on a Maya command like floatFieldGrp to see its many many flags. Ive actually memorized a good portion of this after all these years but I managed to forget whole bits now and again depending on the day.Ive played with having it check the word under cursor in an allmayacommands list and if found just launch  name here.html in the browser. Thats okay but not ideal. Ideally Id also have all relevant arguments pop up for whatever command I was typing in with hints as to what they take as I type but thats just crazy talk.Id love the usual commandinmodule completion                  makebot                   makeIdentity              makeLive                  makePaintable             makeSingleSurface         manipMoveContext              cmds.mSame for arguments                          relative                          reflection                        reflectionAboutOrigin             reflectionAboutBBox               reflectionAboutX                  reflectionAboutY                  reflectionAboutZ                  reflectionTolerance                   cmds.movereArguments should give help too                          boolean  Specifies the X as reflection plane                 cmds.movereflectionAboutXYou know... the usual noncrazyMaya things.,vim,chwqhy5,2,t5_2qhqx

It is good practice to have your code compile under different compilers as they have different levels of standard compliancy and as I mentioned differents level of diagnostics. Of course Im talking about sanemature compilers such as GCC and clang.Trying to compile under clang e.g. on the nightly build machine or just periodically on the devs machine doesnt introduce any new dependencies. Im not talking about shipping a binary thats compiled with clang just compiling the project and if possible running the unitacceptance tests.All it does is give you more information about the state of your code.

1178906,0,t3_27m0ep,Im a big fan of vimipython which basically allows vim to communicate with an iPython kernel. So you can start up iPython however you run it and execute the IPython command in vim. Then you can use a key command default ctrls to send text to IPython and a small window is opened at the top of your vim to show you the results of entering that text in case of syntax errors this is helpful. I use a tiling WM and I typically have vim and IPythonqtconsole next to each other. My workflow for this is something like write function in vim gt send to ipython gt try it out and poke around in the ipython window gt go back to vim and fix whatever I messed up.

We can search GitHub for all VimScript repositories sorted by stars. ycm is not in that list because GitHub classifies it as a Python project most ycm code is Python. The only two Vim plugins that can be considered popular enough to be in the top  and are not mainly written in VimScript are ycm and UltiSnips great plugin! which has  stars.Makes no sense to me. For me personally I consider stars as a way to express gratefulness or expressing appreciation of some elses code. For the question of popularity I prefer to look at the number of users that are using the plugin. That is what popularity is to me in my opinion. For example Tim Popes Fugitive have currently  users.

I went nude sublime. No hjkling around. No dd or yy. No vim bindings.where the extent of no vim bindings was summed up to no hjkling and no dd or yy.

1894381,0,t1_ckhg2ds,Background Started getting really bad wrist pain from being at my keyboard all day. Got an ergo keyboard and decided to try either Dvorak or Colemak. Ive been typing Colemak for about a year and a half and am still hovering around  wpm whereas I used to be in the s. But thats mostly because I stopped trying to get faster.  is fine for my purposes.The Colemak choice was kind of arbitrary in the sense that Dvorak and Colemak are both hundreds of times better than Qwerty but kind of neck and neck with each other performance wise. But Colemak came out ahead in some analyses kept a lot of keys the same including the all so important zxcv sequence for copy paste etc so it seemed like it would feel more natural and easy to learn. I was worried at first that it was too similar to Qwerty and so would be harder to learn but I didnt find that to be the case. Colemak comes stock on OS X my home computers Android my phone and tablet and there is a very handy portable app for Windows work where I move from computer to computer frequently throughout the day so its handily available everywhere I go. Of the two only Colemak was designed with modern computer keyboards in mind. Dvorak and Qwerty are both from the typewriter era.Plus Dvorak looks weird PVimming was awkward in Colemak for a little bit because of hjki but I quickly learned to just hynu instead and its fine. hynu in qwerty  hjkl in colemak.The most awkward thing in Colemak is gaming. wasd in Colemak is kind of awful. If I cant remap movement keys I usually just switch back to qwerty.Do you make good use of Dvoraks punctuation placement in your programming job? If so I can see that being the decision maker.,vim,ckhgor1,1,t5_2qhqx

I have a feeling theyve realised that their products are really being threatened by their often free oss or at least considerably cheaper competitors.Perhaps I just have a tinfoil hat but I think the free full version visual studio is actually fear of the knock on effects of developers being more interested in open source software. Projects like omnisharp are putting free software in a position that makes them nearly as powerful as a Visual Studio. Perhaps not through an individual plugin but when you combine a few together you can get  or more of your day to day programming requirements.This also has the knockon effect in that more and more developers are starting to use Linux as their primary OS. If your development workflow is cross platform and as a natural tinkerer linux gives you a lot more freedom and ironically an easier time developing things due to a lot of OSS being made primarily for linux then windows starts becoming more of a chore. And what would scare the pants off the developers of the most popular operating system in the world more than people who make applications making them primarily for another operating system?Im by no means predicting the death of windows or that linux is an immediate threat to their immediate profits. But if in  years time linux does have a decent day to day desktop market share it will likely be due to their negligence of developers needs.

2939864,0,t1_cnpzi6m,is that all popular plugin managers are in pure VimScript so you dont need anythingyou can not download and unpack anything with pure vim. you can not update the plugins coz that needs downloading you can not search for plugins coz that needs downloading.  pathogen does not manage anything in regards to plugins except that does the one job it does perfect setup the rtp. nothing more its a perfect companion for vopher as it is right now. vundle search requires that curl be available on the system.  GetScript needs wget or curl vimplug needs ruby or curl neobundle.vim recommends vimproc which itself is a .dll  .soto extract the files from .vba .vba.gz .tar.gz .zip etc all the forementioned managers need extra tools unzip.exe the vimballplugin .. which is delivered via tar.gz for which you would need tar.exe. all of this is included in vopher. in one binary.howcanidoanythingwithoutgit sometimes one just needs a decent editor to process some text files you know? or the primary dvcs is mercurial. or ltinsertotherreasonheregt.gitasdependency its a mb dependency. i do not want this. end of story.installing x on a system i do not have any control over is a pretty tedious task. you should try it. the same is true for situations when youre limited by bandwidth and can not effort to download mb of things to collect just mb.havingpluginreposaround i use plugins mostly since i am a user. not a developer for the vimplugins i use. i do not want this. end of story. it is not my workflow to have the gitrepository of lets say the chromebrowser around in order to quickly fix bugs. nothing prevents you from having gitrepos around with vopher. but a dependency on git enforces a workflow on me that i do not want. its trivial to even add an explicit gitretriever instead of plain  just to make others happy who want to live on the edge.if your workflow includes to have lots of gitsubmodules around then there is no point in having a pluginmanager for vim anyway other than for setting up rtp.to sum it up you workflow is different than mine. dont assume you workflow fit others.,vim,co29x6i,1,t5_2qhqx

3029633,0,t1_cob6wen,Rather than taking two positions drop or adopt I encourage you to take a middle ground.I am also the second type. I learned to type long before I had a course or information that taught me the proper finger positions. I have some bad habits with key reach on certain fingers. Its mostly not a problem but there are certain keys that I tend to make more typos with. Those keys are typically the ones where I am deviating from correct position. My enemy is mostly cvb. Except I type Dvorak which makes that jkx. You can imagine that making typos with jk is a big deal for vim. Im having a hard time unlearning my bad habit.A secondary issue. When you use split keyboards or ergonomic keyboards like the Kinesis the physical key positions are optimized for correct finger placement. So on those keyboards I find myself hitting hard plastic instead of a key now and then or much more frequently pressing the wrong key due to simple mechanics of how the fingers bend. Especially with the Kinesis since it has a bowl design and the key is exactly positioned where its supposed to be for people who type correctly.A tertiary issue proper typing also emphasizes oppositehand shift coordination. Learning that will really help keep your error rate down and your output up because if you shift with the same hand you likely have to move offposition.As for typing symbols  I usually move my whole hand instead of reaching. The pinky reaches are crazy if youre typing them constantly. The rules were put in place for prose after all.In sum I agree that typingwithoutlooking is the most important aspect. However reducing errors is one of the most important aspects to having a good typing rate and some aspects of traditional touch typing were invented to address that very concern. Dont throw those parts out! I have coworkers that must look at the keyboard and its painful to watch them. Theyll type a long sentence look reread what they typed discover their typos then use combo keyboardmouse to navigate back and correct them. Its downright unbearable if theyre using an improperly configured terminal that doesnt support mouse arrow keys or backspace...Oh and just as an aside I also heartily recommend Colemak or Dvorak.,vim,coc0p1o,2,t5_2qhqx

I can see how you can easily run into frustration when trying to do anything complex abstraction is obtuse hope you dont need to be object oriented or even to have defined structs capturing or passing function pointerslambdas is done with strings FuncRef map etc.If you keep it simple and switch to Pythonetc for complex stuff youre fine. I dont have time for anything complex anyway so VimLs limitations keep me from wasting too much time twiddling with my vimrc.Or you could skip VimL and just straight to snake I havent got around to this.I write a lot of C too and its great for some purposes.

My current dev box has  hardware threads and  SSDs  that would be annoying to try to carry around with me. Bonus all the hardware management is done by other people!  I lose a hard drive I put in a ticket.  I lose  hard drives I tell them to setup a new machine and just put the latest image back onto it.  Once you get used to it it is the only way to fly! gt Im thinking largeish apps in CJavaMaven?C and also pythonhaskellcobjc...What is a largeish app to you?  I suspect we might not agree on what a large app is. gt If so whats your workflow?My workflow is tried and true the good old ctagssshtmuxvimagpt combo.  Most of the time I have an autobuildautotest watcher open in a tmux pane next to my vim window that triggers on save but doesnt interrupt me.  Sometimes when tracking down a bug or build issue I fall into a makequickfix cycle.  If I am doing something a bit weird that I havent setup a quickfix pattern for yet I will often just use vimux to shunt a commandline to another tmux pane and do rudimentary control on it. gt ...I could host my projects on a server at my college. Then I can just ssh in from the various computers around campus and continue whenever in a tmux session.Beware computers you dont control they are often a PITA to work with trying to build everything into your home directory not knowing policies etc.  Also this is something that will go poof when you graduate which I know feels like forever now but will sneak up on you.  Depending on project size you can get cheap VMs at places like digital ocean or linode which wont go poof on you and you will own  control without worry or ugly restrictions you can run your personal website off them your own git server if you want etc.  Having a real box is nice. gt I wouldnt be able to install anything on the local college computers since the user sessions are wiped as soon as you log out.See prior point. gt Sshvimtmux is about as good of a development environment I could get remotely?.You might be able to export an X session depends on your schools setup.  But even with that option I prefer sshtmuxvim and friends.  On your own VM  of course you could export X or VNC or whatever you want. gt Any tips ideas thoughts? This is so common as to be profoundly boring.  You arent really blazing any new ground which is good.  This is a perfectly reasonable and simple way a lot of professional developers work everyday. gt I havent heard much of anyone doing heaver JavaC stuff in vim at all though Possibly because of the pretty strong Visual Studio Intellij vim emulation pluginsI know lots of people who use either Vim or Emacs to do JavaC and tons of other languages.  The main reason most people stick to IDEs tend to be the build tooling and specifically never taking the time to get the project building from a terminal.  Lots of Android developers have no idea how to build an Android app without Android Studio... not from a code perspective but from a build perspective. gt so Im not sure its possible to have a setup in vim in terminal that can rival an IDE right now...Vim is the editor component of Unix as an IDE.  I have yet to be able to setup an IDE to rival my current setup so different stroke for different folks.  I you have something you want from an IDE be explicit about what it is. ,vim,d3pdhxw,2,t5_2qhqx

8754837,0,t1_d6yy1au,Well one way to get a degree of codeunderstanding for syntax completion or dynamic notification of errors into the editor is to actually run a compiler on the buffer. Depending on the language and project complexity... this can take some time.You might have experienced issues with syntax highlighting on larger files  where it exceed the lookback range you have set. This lookback limit exists to keep the editor interactive on large files with complex highlighting rules  but it can fail to highlight right if there are regions which can span large parts of the file eg commenting or ifdefs.With the potential to run highlighting async you never have to wait for it  it might take a few seconds for complex fullfile highlight to resolve but at least you arent prevented from editing while this goes on.,vim,d700gih,2,t5_2qhqx

8852967,0,t1_d7bu0re,So its not vim purity.  At least not for me.  For me its having my tools being accessible at all times.  So for me its not that Im doing something hard.  Its that its hard to set things up when I want to be doing something else.  The more I have to setup the more Im doing busy work.  So I work to streamline as much as possible.  What gets added to my toolbelt is added with care.  Becoming dependant on something means if its not there things become harder.  So I avoid adding things that only occasionally make things possibly easier because they will also make things harder when I dont have them available and for me that happens frequently enough.I take that approach with everything not just vim.  And that doesnt mean I dont use things that arent stock.I have a .vimrc file and its customized to work the way I want.  tmux is customized as well.  Hell everything is customized carefully.  It all passes that one critical test do I want to be dependent on this?So I guess what Im saying is as long as you say yes to that question who cares what other people say?

This is certainly a bad idea but you could see romainls answer.Otherwise Vim already has everything we need to work simultaneously with buffers of different types Regarding syntax highlighting this is what made me switch from vi to vim  years ago regarding mappings and all this is done thanks to ftplugins since Vim !.All you have to do is to add syntax on and filetype plugin on or filetype plugin indent on if you want to use the indenting plugins accordingly to the filetype of the current buffer in your .vimrc.Regarding how a given plugin behaves when you switch from one buffer to another one well this is an issue with the plugin. It may or may not support working with different filetypes it may also or may be not be able to work on different projects.,vim,ddol519,2,t5_2qhqx
10772095,0,t1_ddol077,If it hasnt changed recently Debian has nvi linked to vi. Its not the original but its much more of a straightup clone with some bug fixes Unicode support etc. Im also pretty sure  the stock vi on FreeBSD is a similar story but I dont know anything about it. BusyBox also has its own vi implementation.vimtiny is stock vi on Ubuntu and it CANNOT be launched with vim. It is compiled from vim sources but its stuck in compatibility mode and you cant get much more out of it than other barebones vi clones.Someone already mentioned that vi on Arch is the the original vi it has some updates but its from the original codebase if I recall,vim,ddr29ms,1,t5_2qhqx

If you want to cleanup your .vimrc just for the sake of it theres no harm in that but also theres no point. Remember vim is just a tool to get your thing done so is Sublime.Still my very opinionated comment would be No its not the right way. Ive been in the exact same situation where I ended up deleting my .vimrc without backup. Then I picked a ticket to work on and added things as I required them. I still have a very cluttered .vimrc but with more sanity for my understanding. Lately Ive been finding myself replacing some plugins with vanilla vim functionality.Using vim and setting it up is just an evolving process. It is a process not a thing. You modify it as you go it has its better and worse days. Ive never heard of a definitive vim setup thats the beauty of it. Or at least thats how I think about it.Just ask yourself Am I wasting time right now instead of doing some actual coding? whenever you find yourself mingling with your vim setup. If no its all okay. If yes ask yourself another question Is this going to make things easier for me in the long run?,vim,dezw4zi,16,t5_2qhqx
