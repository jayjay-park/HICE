85035,0,t3_1v05km,Skip this vendor guys.Bought several mobos that were in stock.Paid for and all.Turns out that they were backordered in actuality but i still got charged anyways. Lead time for  weeks. So in reality  weeks not counting the extra week it will take to process to get here. Nobody answers the phone called multiple times everyday and left messages on every extension they had or at least the ones that were working anyways. Yes i called during working hours. I called on opening. Nothing. Sent emails on their sites contact page and to staff members and each got returned! citing full inboxes and unavailable addresses. Now i am into these people for the tune of a few grand. Its been a week of nonstop trying to find out wtf is going on. Then just before i contact law enforcement i get a call from a dude speaking in broken english. Civil conversation ensues. I ask why on earth doesnt anyone get back to a paying customer. I am a few grand in at least just talk to me. Tell me whats going on. But to leave my funds locked up for a week? The explanation was that he doesnt know. Doesnt know about the phone not being picked up either. I am astounded. Basic stuff. Basic.I fix things get my order refunded and back to backorder status. eta on the boards doesnt know. Eta on x that were ordered or en route no clue. No clue about supply no idea about warehouse stocks not an inkling about the  ws. i want to place a downpayment on the cards. Cant do it. The guy says that he will call me when the x cards arrives to make up for the hassle. Havent heard from since. Then I come across this in reddit and theyve been in stock and sold out.Vuugo.More like vuugofuckyourself. Tldr theres a reason why people buy from newegg memory express and ncix. ,bapcsalescanada,ceo3z1h,7,t5_2tesr

485210,0,t1_cfveulo,Im not much of a laptop mod guy but the question I would ask is how comfortable are you with opening your laptop to mod it? Or would you run it a different way?SSDs require SATA for both data and power unless you have both of these connnectors on your laptop externally not normally a thing youd need some sort of USB dock for it which means youd always be limited by booting via USB to an OS and limited by the USB speed anyway a  Laptop may or may not have USB . portsIm sure someone who deals with laptops more than I can chime in and give more information but off the bat Id probably say no simply because youd be limited by a USB dock the speed increase wouldnt be enough for me to justify a purchase.

2700431,0,t1_cnaxg1v,Yeah I am not looking to get into any hardcore audiophile equipment but the problem I guess I had encountered researching my choices is that mostly youre either getting subpar hardware or paying a premium for circumaural headphones. At least that was the impression that I seemed to get.And for some reason it seems like headset combos are very sparse. I am not sure why more manufacturers arent offering midrange choices for headsets but I guess the gaming market is pretty niche and theyre happy to offer lesser products at an appropriate sales point.Anyway I had a conversation with another guy who replied to me and ended up picking up a pair of HDs for a price that Im willing to pay.But the other issue still kind of stands. Ive only got this shitty coilinear mic with the HVs that I wont really be able to use comfortably. Hate to ask too much of you but do you think you might have any suggestions for a decent mic preferably lt. I was looking at a few Blue Yetis but they still seem like a little much for me. Im not doing any streamingpodcastingrecordingetc I just want to be able to communicate with people decently and I seem to have the touch of death when it comes to microphones.

Only kinds like dt hd k etc will need. But as long as you have an amp already grab a dac or soundcard is necessary because the sounds will be terrible if you are not using loline out.

Ive built computers with various levels and brands of motherboards and typically find MSI boards to cause less issues if at all and I also find the PCB they use is generally thicker and less prone to bending. All of the Gigabyte ones as well as Asrock mobos Ive touched have been flimsy... Theyve all worked great I just feel like they would snap easier.This is just an opinion though lol.

7547755,0,t1_d2yiwjo,fyi  founders edition is just what nvidia is calling the reference cards this time around. Nothing special.Theres a couple reasons people want reference cards... One is because waterblocks are usually only made for the reference PCB. Another reason is the reference cards arent bined. The partners bin the chips they get and sell the good ones in their higher end more expensive overclocked versions. like msi lightning or evga FTW Buying a reference card means you have a chance of getting a higher end chip for cheap.Another reason is the blower fan exhausts the hot air out of the case where the aftermarket fans dont. its a preference thing,bapcsalescanada,d30563e,2,t5_2tesr

7963968,0,t3_4o6ksr,In  months Septemberish Im thinking of building a new computer. I want to build it around an rx because  US for a vr ready card sounds amazing. Since my current PC is pretty old motherboard is like  years old and the processor is an i k Im probably just going to start from scratch. I definitely want to keep it under  CAD but I also want to have it future proofed. Obviously the rx is very new but Im worried Ill end up buying a last gen processor just as the next gen is introduced. Are there new processors coming out in the next  months that will give a large performance increase?  I want to go with an intel processor because from what Ive heard AMDs processors are trash. This true? I will be using it for gaming and for university so it needs to be fast in nongaming stuff as well. Anyway to summarize Should I buy a processor in  months or wait for the next gen? How does AMD CPUs compare to Intels CPUs?How much would you expect this to cost with either a good i or whatever AMDs equivalent is?,bapcsalescanada,d4b85bp,1,t5_2tesr

What if you are in a small town or area and that is the only part close by? You cant necessarily ignore it and what if the seller doesnt budget even with mountains of evidence against his price.gt  When you are a seller always price high and someone will buy it if I can get  on rhardwareswap or other trading subreddits that means I can probably get  local because people just dont know the used market like you and I.Yes  is okay but that isnt  in the Ti example.

8741014,0,t3_4znh6h,Ive had a similar problem with NCIX. I once bought a X from their eBay store which is basically where they sell their open box stuff. It very clearly states that the products were merely opened and tested before they resell them back to the customer as open box. First of all it took nearly  weeks to arrive at house shipping from BC to ON which it quite ridiculous. So I install the X and instantly I begin to have graphic aberrations all over my screen. I reflash the BIOS remove old drivers etc. Pretty much everything I could do on my end and it still wouldnt be fixed. So now I had to RMA the card and that went fine since I explained myself well had proof and pretty much berated the company because it was pretty clear that they hadnt tested out the card at all just re boxed it and sold it.  Now for those of you that dont know the eBay site lists in CAD but charges you in USD only. I paid around  CAD for the card but when I returned it the price of CAD dropped and I was refunded about . This really upset me because I pretty much paid for the privilege of shipping and returning a broken card. I actually did risk buying another card from them later after the X came out and that went pretty well. I actually managed to pay less I think around  for that than the X which is pretty funny in hindsight. Many of the products on their outlet store are stupidly priced. ,bapcsalescanada,d6ya0yo,1,t5_2tesr

The sensor cant pick up on fast movements and have a cap at around .ms before malfunctioning. While Logitech modified the g with a gyroscope to interpolate the would be acceleration an interpolation isnt as good as raw data. The g g pro mouse  all come with the newer  sensor. It is a flawless sensor and the best on the market because its malfunctioning speed is gt.ms which is almost impossible to surpass I dont know what you would be doing to achieve such speeds.

For a TN panel is quite stunning once calibrated.  Once you apply the ICC profile its in the same ballpark as my LG mu AHIPS panel sitting beside it  which is a very good modern IPS panel. From an amateurs perspective Id say the IPS has a bit more contrast darker blacks but the colors are very close once calibrated.     Its not like a cheap  bit TN panel that most people are used to.   Id say its only a small step behind the IPS panel and well worth it for the higher refresh rate and Gsync.   Personally the fact that it has Gsync is a game changer for gaming.

But weve got new findings which definitively indicate that this is not the only cause of failure.gt Now in addition to the tests posted by Toms DE and by our later followup some users have complained that high VRM temperatures are causing black screen defects. This is not true. ... entirely unrelated to the VRM temperature. If a VRM gets too hot it will not do so with grace. There will be no black screen that can be resolved by a restart. The FETs  power stages will go up in a puff of smoke and the card will never turn on again. These are two unrelated issues.gt A few users have also indicated that VRAM contact is not sufficient between the heatsink and the VRAM thermal pads. We have not observed this on our cards.

10530211,0,t1_dd15acx,Depends on the type of game but generally the pixel transition times can be a little slow which leads to a blurry image or ghosting. Input lag isnt an issue  just the image response times can be. This is true of all current IPS displays however some are better than others. Perhaps I should clarify my position on competitive gaming. This to me means not being at a large disadvantage over other gamers. Unfortunately if you want to ensure your monitor isnt holding you back in any way  you need to look at TN panels  preferably no larger than  as larger screens can hamper your reaction time due to a larger periphery needed. If youre not this hardcore competitive about gaming  ms IPS Hz displays like the one the MGQ use will be just fine for most  just understand there are other generally cheaper  monitors that can make a difference in how well you perform competitively.,bapcsalescanada,dd1pq4z,1,t5_2tesr

If you like treble forwardbright sound youll find the HPs a little underwhelming I think. The treble is certainly not recessed by any means but since youre used to more brightness they might even sound a bit dark perhaps. Ive never noticed that myself but Ive heard a couple of others from headfi.org who like really bright sound describe them that way.So you like the audeze pads eh? Ive been tempted to order some of their pleather ones. I stay away from velour since they tend to lose seal and bass on many phones but the comfort and drier finish when warm is tempting. Not sure if theyd work on the HP due to the rectangular cups. I was able to put HM pads on the HPs but they really didnt make a good seal and therefore sounded poor to me. ,bapcsalescanada,detprvl,1,t5_2tesr

Some wont work at all some will see marginal improvements others will see performance nearing the GTX . A single card is still recommended over CF but if the price is right and your system can accomodate it CF is appealing.,bapcsalescanada,dexy9mq,1,t5_2tesr

11474471,0,t3_63dke8,Wow this deal is legitimately insane! Even though I am not looking for any replacement to my Acer vg lately I still bought one. Notice the negative reviews mainly focus on the fan noise and malfunction touch screen. Getting a laptop with such a spec even without the touch screen feature is a already fairly good deal. Nevertheless upgrading your bios can fix the fan problem. Lets not be too picky about the screen quality and sound quality. After all you get what you pay and one can hardly expect a crystal clear sound from a builtin dac on most mainstream motherboards let alone being a laptop.
