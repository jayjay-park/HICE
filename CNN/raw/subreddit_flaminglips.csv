2194130,0,t3_2k79sx,The album I keep coming back to most often is Clouds Taste Metallic. I cant seem to determine any specific reason for this its just the album I like the most the whole way through. I used to like Yoshimi the most but I found out I only liked it so much because I hadnt heard much of their other stuff yet.,flaminglips,cliq7ow,3,t5_2rni5

3851495,0,t3_34i5vv,A lot of people overlook their first few albums but One Million Billionth of a Millisecond on a Sunday Morning is easily one of their best songs from that era.IIRC in The Fearless Freaks documentary Steven Drozd said it was his favorite song from their early albums. ,flaminglips,cqvb0lb,3,t5_2rni5

6937446,0,t3_4a7a8q,Heres the studio version on youtube Theyve been playing this at shows lately which is really surprising. They never played it live before so its sort of odd and random that they all of sudden started playing a ten year old obscure Bside. Im happy they have. Great song. Should have been on the album.,flaminglips,d12oqyp,1,t5_2rni5
