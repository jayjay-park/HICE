3203969,0,t1_cotxgut, Years Older is amazing too. I think my top three are Routine Happy Returns and Ancestral or  Years Older. ,stevenwilson,cou3a0h,1,t5_2smbs

3386248,0,t3_2yy8sd,Im going to be there loving the new album and all that going to be one hell of a gig! Im hoping hell set up a small signing table after the show Ive got no idea though as its my first time seeing him. Absolutely cannot wait D,stevenwilson,cpe9c5l,2,t5_2smbs
3388193,0,t1_cpalc6i,Nothing wrong with fans wanting PT back. With the exception of The Incident their albums are much more songy and accessible than Stevens solo work. I love all of his work but I understand the sentiment ,stevenwilson,cpehbt8,2,t5_2smbs

3745208,0,t1_cq163uj,This definitely.  I had heard of Porcupine Tree on the Mike Portnoy forums but foolishly ignored the band because I didnt like the band nameI was .  Then I found Deadwing at an FYE storedont know if they still do it but back then you could listen to CDs by scanning them at listening stations.  I loved the album overall but this song is the one that cemented Steven Wilsons place as one of my favorite musicians.,stevenwilson,cqj6fzt,1,t5_2smbs

4332479,0,t3_3a6dgt,Howdy! The Seattle show was amazing! Since the show Ive been trying to figure out the song which was just vocals and snapping? Do you all recall that  know the name of that song? Thanks!,stevenwilson,csdzzz8,2,t5_2smbs

6323658,0,t3_425rys,This is just what I was thinking . Including the Nil Recurring reference.A good review thanks. And I like your current review style.To add Happiness III is Postcard and I think Postcard is million times better than Happiness III.Also I dont like the ending part of Sunday Rain Sets In that abrupt stormy feel. It ruins the flow although I do understand why he did that. ,stevenwilson,cz8fizd,3,t5_2smbs
6351940,0,t1_czbmne5,Well if it isnt too much work for you I would really appreciate it if i could have the scans too,stevenwilson,czbn8ft,1,t5_2smbs
6400678,0,t3_437rhn,I actually didnt notice that snarl in the song until I listened to this live performance than went back to the album version only to hear it there. For one thing it says a lot about how his music has such a high replay value but its also definitive of how his songs take on new life in their live renditions. When he screams that in the Get All You Deserve performance it pierces right through me.Im also a fan of the bassled instrumental interlude in Routine just before Guthrie Govans solo kicks in when played live. It has this kind of pure ringing sound to it like its being played in a church. ,stevenwilson,czh6x31,1,t5_2smbs
6440082,0,t1_czaicya,Can I have them too?,stevenwilson,czlfyug,1,t5_2smbs
6715653,0,t3_47dz98,Dont forget Colin and Chris on Metanoia. Some awesome jamming on that album. I personally think they had more chemistry than Gavin and Colin.. I feel that Gavin steals the spotlight a bit but thats just me.Beggs and Marco is a great pair too. ,stevenwilson,d0dyg2o,1,t5_2smbs
6811184,0,t3_4918lg,The show was amazing! Although I am bummed I missed Ninet especially because I dont think she was touring with them when I saw SW last year in Los Angeles the setlist tonight more than made up for it. The additions of Dark Matter and The Sound of Muzak were nice touches to it allAnd yes even with a cold Steven sung wonderfully! Contrary to what he said before Routine he did not sound like Tom Waits singing it after all lol,stevenwilson,d0ocfaf,6,t5_2smbs

8503492,0,t3_4w5pka,There are a lot of people who believe that water has a memory its a big part of why homeopathy became popular. They think water remembers what was in it and can use that to heal someone.There have also been many legends and stories about water remembering words that were whispered above it or the people who stepped foot into it. Water has been used as a tool of divination since antiquity.However water is also a source of impermanence it flows and is everchanging. Philosophers argue that bodies of water are never the same when you step into them a second time because they flow and change.Her sister represents this impermanence. Her sister flows into her life and leaves again taking all memory of herself with her despite the intense impression she left. Shes commenting on the fact that even the water will forget her.Or maybe Im reading too much into a couple of lines. ,stevenwilson,d64hnva,7,t5_2smbs

8612824,0,t1_d6hc05t,I went to a show on the first North American tour of the album and honestly I regretted it and probably wont see him again live. Its nothing to do with him or the band either  its the venue they come to here along with the type of people that like SW.For whatever reason the crowd was way older than when I first saw him  plus the venue near me is sitting only. I dont usually mind either but most of the people were just assholes seat kicking not understanding personal space creeping on my wife etc.. I dont know. In my experience prog rock attracts the worst crowds. Ive had Rush Yes and SW all sorta ruined for me live because of the people at said shows.Id much rather just go see metal these days. Way better and nicer crowds.,stevenwilson,d6i77i4,1,t5_2smbs
8701022,0,t1_d6s1shr,Wow really? This is the only song on par with the album for me. ,stevenwilson,d6t9dkj,1,t5_2smbs
9143432,0,t3_55gvje,Theres a big ego at work all right but Im not sure its Stevens. Being butthurt on social media justified or not will guarantee that you wont work with Steven again. Its that ageold drama we see in music when talent meets talent and then talent disses talent. Fragile egos get bruised. Those who cant just work it out like grownups will burn bridges unnecessarily.Edit seriously? Were downvoting people we disagree with now? First day on reddit? Thats not how those arrows work. Speaking of egos...,stevenwilson,d8azuig,6,t5_2smbs
9655472,0,t3_5d5bah,At the venue the buses are usually parked in a lot across the street which is little more than a dirt lot. I went there once and saw one of the bands that had performed earlier outside and got a picture. I wouldnt say its likely but it is possible! Super stoked for this show and first time seeing Steven!,stevenwilson,da38kw3,1,t5_2smbs

I think this announcement will come with some more stuff in the newsletter. The spaces we have to fill in are the same asked for the newsletter. Its probably coming back but urobskarin could confirm this  I guess.,stevenwilson,dglo473,1,t5_2smbs
