Now I have strong issues with idiots that expose children to these things so Im also for regulation...like alcohol amp tobacco for instance.,MAGAjuana,dd3vfjd,3,t5_3ijeh

10938988,0,t1_de85upo,Umm i like what hes doing....i also dont really have a position on the issue because i dont smoke.  He also doesnt control what everyone in the administration says in fact there have been multiple times where hes disagreed with people in his admin.  So ill say it again...until there is an ACTUAL CRACKDOWN i will take the comments with a grain of salt.  One minute all the detractors claim the administration are all lying russian puppets and the next every snide comment they make is taken as gospel.  SAD!,MAGAjuana,de8a334,1,t5_3ijeh
