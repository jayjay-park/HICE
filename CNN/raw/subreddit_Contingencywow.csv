3942720,0,t3_35frxq,lt Ravz Tank  I agree with Tobber here we had a limited group but still did the best with the group combination we had. A few tries got us further than I expected it will take some patience from everyone to get this new guild on the right start but I know that we will move past this.,Contingencywow,cr5pcg2,1,t5_3850c
4056226,0,t3_36ul1l,Hello SymphonyWhile we want to welcome anyone who is interested in to our community Im not sure how Id feel about people from other servers raiding with us for the following reasons My end goal for our guild is to have a solid tight knit group of friends anywhere from  folks who will continue on to do current content together. Something about having people from out of guild raiding with us doesnt really support that kind of longevity. If somebody wants to raid with us but doesnt feel like putting in the  hours or so to level to  in the community that would give me the impression that they probably are not committed enough to stick it out for the long term.Thank you for posting this question and bringing it to my attention!,Contingencywow,crin203,1,t5_3850c
