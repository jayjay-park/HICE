8469178,1,t1_d606dzy,There is a good reason that the science community and media ignore him. If anything he said were true and he could back it up his story wouldve already gained traction by now. If he has a secret space tunnel to Mars then he should share it because were spending billions sending RC cars up there to scoop dirt and take the temperature. If anyone credible believed him we would not be wasting money on space exploration. Like Ive said before hes an autistic man child. ,CosmicDisclosure,d606q5s,0,t5_3b3rf
8470196,0,t1_d609k4e,Read any book by Dean Radin or Rupert Sheldrake. Watch presentations by David Wilcock who presents many examples with citations especially in his book The Source Field Investigations. Peruse the articles on this website Although science is utterly moot in this discussion. This isnt a matter of science its a matter of history and fact. Coreys accounts are eyewitness testimony the kind of information that is used in a court of law and could be used as evidence to sentence people to penalties of DEATH.You are a petty fool pointlessly stirring up drama to sate you ego. Your arguments are the same brainless rationalizing pseudoskeptics use to dismiss information that hurt your pwecious fragile egobased reality bubbles that you conveniently only apply to information you dont like and would never apply to information you are biased towards. Whenever pseudoskeptics come across information they dont like they go hrurr durr but its not science. Most information in the world is not science Art isnt science mathematics isnt science history isnt science economics isnt science philosophy isnt science the list goes on an on. When you do the whole duh Bill Nye on teevee dont say its true therefore its not true it just shows how inexperienced shortsighted and brainwashed you are that you dont see in two seconds how moot and irrelevant that kind of rationale is. Unless you have something actually interesting or novel to say unless you have seen or know something besides the inside of your own tiny boxedin mind please shut up and go away.No on said you have to believe what Corey Goode says. Most people in the world would not believe what Corey Goode says so what are you so upset about? Go to some skeptic forum and bitch and whine about how stoopid people who pay attention to him are then you can get all warm in fuzzy inside having everyone pat you on the head and tell you how right you soooo are and how stooopid CG is.Seriously get a life. Calling CG an autistic manchild just make you looks like an immature idiot. You contribute absolutely nothing intelligent or useful to discussion.,CosmicDisclosure,d60bbqq,3,t5_3b3rf
9187251,0,t3_565lrx,I have a background in computer science empiricism and analytical troubleshooting. I come to Reddit to relax read and let go of my normal method of thinking to allow other ideas No matter how crazy they seem to be observed. Some skeptics or cynics might need something of the magnitude Independence Day the movie. Others might just need a fly by to change their beliefs. After watching the interaction of Bridget and CG I do question the ideology of such a lifestyle with its subsequent result of evolutionary importance rd density to th density the emphasis is too casual IMHO.Ive noticed Bridget and Bashar both defend their personality and other personalities from being ridiculed by people with different beliefs. When we defend or justify our own cause it can seem to preemptively placate the situation or seem tactical in nature.I would simply say To have the impact I assume youd like to make why hold back get us something tangible do it in a secure way or simply ask for the validation to be more than just a Drawing to the people interested. It can be public but also manageable like registering to a website. Can the validation of the existence of ETs be displayed in a way that would be undeniable or with the least possibility of shenanigans?  I hear him say people have seen the blue orbs come through the wall and this happens to many people. CG can you ask those people to join a Podcast and recount those experiences?  ,CosmicDisclosure,d8gjult,5,t5_3b3rf

I entertain many many ideas and dont invest in any of them fully.The only thing Im certain of is that total truth will not come from the MIC.As far as technocrats look at the current surveillance state. They are undermining the executive branch and who knows what else. Extrapolate that out further and it doesnt look good. We need a check on this out of control power.,CosmicDisclosure,dekn3eu,1,t5_3b3rf
11061618,0,t3_5xoipd,I understand what youre talking about and have had the same issue understanding.  Ive come across number of possible interpretations of the ascensions nature. Here are the  most plausible ones that I have heard but personally I find  way better and is a bit of a combo of Coorey Goode and law of one info.. There are multiple timelines created. One for the positive one for the negative and one for the neutral. I dont know if the positives will have a part of their soul inhabit the versions of themselves that are present in other timelines or vice versa or if each polarization would disappear from the timeline of the other ones. Basically the rapture but we really are all getting divided into  or more? timelines.. We all start feeling the effects of the energy in ways that make sense to our polarization or disposition. As Corey Goode said the good get better the bad get worse and the crazy get crazier. We would also experience the early effects of D such as having a really good bull shit detector thus preventing a partial disclosure. After someone dies post ascension they will be reincarnated on an appropriate planet decided by the specific polarization and karma of the individual or possibly the soul group they belong to. Negatives would go to a terrible d negative planet and live a mostly hellish life until they change polarization at some point d repeaters would go to another d world and continue their learninggrowing and d positive would stay here and be joined by other d positives reincarnated on this planet star seeds. I think  is most likely and that they reincarnation part in  would occur for part  as well.I hope some other people comment their fav interpretations too!Love and peace ,CosmicDisclosure,delteg7,1,t5_3b3rf

11564915,0,t1_dg3xsfx,To be fair though art imitates life. Specifically art is often sourced from deep recesses of human consciousness. This can be individual subconscious levels of collective consciousness or information from other sources beings universal consciousness Akashi records etc. Then art effortlessly displays what is dwelling beneath our conscious realities a look into what really makes us tick as a species and as a point in existence while also displaying the inner workings of existence itself... or at least our unconscious perceptions of it. Art then also can be a vessel for precognitive visions or possible realities our collective consciousness observes. Then we can look at it as art is also guiding our realities. We are fed ideas scenes emotions and perceptions which we then unconsciously absorb into the reality we are creating.  Adding this perspective then gives the chicken or the egg effect. Which is really driving which? Or is it both work in conjunction?,CosmicDisclosure,dg6vzmx,1,t5_3b3rf
