1228837,0,t3_285lfs,Youll find that many iPad apps support using Midi to send clock tempo and start stop and notes to and from other apps. I dont have cubasis but you can definitely go and find the program manual look in the midi section and give it a read. Many of the apps I use have menus where you can select which ondevice apps and which external connections you want to route midi to including hardware via the USB adapter and wireless over the network.If you use Audiobus a third party app you can route the audio output of one app into the input of another which is very powerful. When youre using Audiobus you can also use multiple apps at once to make sound. In some cases you can use background audio between apps even without but likely youll want Audiobus.Chorion is great I love it. I use it to drive reason on my PC a lot of the time but driving Thor and Sunrizer directly works well too.Lastly do try out WISt if you have a buddy with another iPad.

3744776,0,t3_33aoim,This is right in my wheelhouse. I play live with an iPad. And its rock solid amazing. The best out there is Genome just got a bitchin upgrade. There is also Modstep coming out but Genome is perfect and the dev has been awesome responsive with my non stop questions. I also use Lemur to custom control a lot of CC and the patterns. You can swap patterns and scenes in Genome but I like having the custom launch pad style scene control Ive built in Lemur. I currently drive  hardware synths  drum machine and  iOS synths with it flawlessly. Let me know if you have any questions about ipad performance.

Simplicity is definitely paramount for me since Im a newbie to recording but I figure I can start simple with the ica and graduate to some of its more complicated features later. On the other hand if the UR is that much simpler I feel like that may be a better option for a recording novice like myself.

9264141,0,t3_579z6f,In short you wont. Mastering is a pretty different skill to composing but you can do a soft master.Firstly you need to know what mastering is. Mastering is making the composition sound as good as it can without actually changing the composition itself. What defines good depends on your genre individual piece and of course you.Compression limiting etc are all tools to help you do this. They are not a part of mastering they are tools used in it when necessary. Dont think about EQ dont think about frequency bands dont think about filters or effects none of that is mastering.All youre doing is making your track sound better. Focus on that. Want to know the big secret? ths of mastering at least if youre mastering your own stuff is to get the volume balancing correct. No seriously thats like most of the work unless you want to get into some really hardcore mastering with diminishing returns a pro will of course do a LOT more than just twiddle the volume but they wont clean up your music theyll make it gleam.Listen to your piece. Listen to it over and over. Listen until youre fucking sick of it. Listen to it on different speakers different headphones listen in the car listen on your phone listen on your friends speakers. You do this as different systems will produce the piece slightly differently allowing you to spot problems that other audio gear may hide as well as giving you an idea how the song will sound out in the wildWhat youre looking for are areas that can be improved. For example lets say youve got a section where the bass becomes noticeable and detract from other elements thanks to the piece getting quieter in other sections.Solution? turn down the bass but only for that section. Congratulations youve just done some very simple mastering. This is why your DAW can record fader movements.Twiddling with the volume alone can help polish up a piece nicely. Practice that then go for using more advanced tools like compressors. You will appreciate compressors a LOT more as well as understanding how to use them more easily if you start out by manually adjusting the volume getting ahead of myself but a compressor is basically an automated volume drop.Then lock the whole thing away and come back to it after youve forgotten it and repeat the process again.But above all else listen. Listen well. Listen lots.Oh that and have a decent sound system. A pair of decent studio monitor headphones is enough to get some basic mastering in but using something like the in ears that came with your phone is a complete waste of time. Youll just pick up bad habits.For serious mastering you want to get a pro to do it for you. A fresh pair of ears will spot things you missed a fresh pair of trained and experienced ears doubly so.The role of the masterer is not dissimilar to the role of an editor on a book as they werent mired knee deep in the creation of the piece they can look at it far more objectively and see what needs fixingimproving. Plus when you get paid to hear all the tiny details even the pieces creator probably missed you get good at it.,ipadmusic,d8qanwi,12,t5_2sgbq
9267703,0,t1_d8qqg9v,The GB one is  here in Canada and then Id want the smart keyboard and probably some sort of back case to protect the finish.Add in a Focusrite i or something and Im up into decent laptop territory at that point.

10901468,0,t3_5vp1qc,The hardest part is deciding which DAW to use. They all have their benefits and flaws. Unfortunately it is expensive to try before you buy but you can return apps in the AppStore if youre in the EU.Personally I switch a lot between Auria Pro and Cubasis at the moment. When working with loops I prefer Auria for its editing cabalities. But someone else might feel about this the other way. My best advice is to try and see which one you like. If you can wait for sales then you have all iOS apps half price. I got Auria Pro on sale and dont regret it it comes with a very nice synth as well. The possibilities of that synth Twin  are greatly underestimated. You can add dozens of LFOs if you want to move the sound greatly. It reminded me of the Monomachine in the way you get all these LFOs to mess around with.Gadget is sweet but it also a bit of a walled garden. Expect all new gadgets to cost you money and expect each time they introduce new gadgets the prices go up. They did this last time around. Gadget prices went up from  to . It wouldnt surprise me if they dare to charge  for the new audio gadgets.  when you get while its on sale. Nice things can be done with gadget though. But personally I prefer audio units now. Maybe one day Korg will give us the gadgets as audio unit on iOS like on macOS.I can also recommend any of the apps from Bram Bos and Klevgrand. You really cant go wrong. Specially Brams apps are amazing. Theyre small have a small CPURAM footprint and sound simply amazing. Both of the makes use synthesisemulation only and are Audio Units.Good luck on your journey!,ipadmusic,de4eqeo,1,t5_2sgbq
