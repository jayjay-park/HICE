8175108,0,t3_4peguc,Yeah he keeps bringing up Dark Souls and yes that might be the one exception because it saves constantly well if its anything like Demons Souls. But he forgets that games have an icon on screen when they are saving and this isnt just the PS this is on PS as well and they always warn you not to turn off your system when the icon is on screen. Im guessing he turned off Dark Souls improperly one time so now every game is supposed to be this difficult to turn off?,MadcastMedia,d4zfsb3,3,t5_3ey01

8952281,0,t1_d7nj0nk,Nice attempt at mocking me but if you knew what dichotomy meant then you would know that what I said would be a false compromise and not a false dichotomy if it was false. I hope youre not proud of that because while being proud of not recognizing satire of some stupid obscure subculture youve never been exposed to in the first place is not retarded not knowing or taking  seconds to google the definition of a word everyone learns in th grade is.,MadcastMedia,d7nxip7,2,t5_3ey01

9531743,0,t3_5be9yg,If youre listening for the debates you might as well stop now because it becomes less of a focus as episodes go on. Theyre still there but I think not as much time is spent on them.The show is both top heavy and also bottom heavy with the debate sometimes sandwiched briefly in the middle.Personally I prefer it when Maddox doesnt try to force the debate format because hes just terrible at debating. The show is better off when hes chatting with guests or discussing current events. Just my personal preference though.Unfortunately for me debate is literally in the name of the show so theyre never going away.,MadcastMedia,d9nzkbc,20,t5_3ey01

10399340,0,t1_dcm4twh,The thing is Nintendo has been one of the few companies to show that they understand the markets desire for  fps. Because of this wr expected  from Zelda. Most other games shown held a steady  but oddly enough Zelda didnt. I will most probably buy the switch and in that case the new Zelda is a musthave Well theres a big collection of games that are. Due to the genre actionadventure and the series typical gameplay  fps would be a very nice feature. Its something the user really notices.I dont care too much about the graphics even though they do seem quite good and look nice. What we want from the Switch is for it to be a handheld device being powerful enough to not be a big and better DS. A console in your hands of course also being a good stationary console. The latest Nintendo systems havent been my favorites but they have some of the most grabbing games. The gameaspect of the console doesnt look to bright yet and its being launched in just over a month. Im hoping for the best.,MadcastMedia,dcmtybr,1,t5_3ey01
