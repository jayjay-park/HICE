3591129,0,t1_cpzd8ur,This proves that flying lotus is a god and can work with anything because Reason is pretty much the MS Paint of DAWs. He probably uses a ton of external instruments because reason doesnt support VSTs which is absolutely ridiculous but whatever,flyinglotus,cq1m6zn,1,t5_2u4v5
3709138,0,t3_32v4ke,Honestly even as a big fan of FlyLo I wouldnt say you need to start from the beginning. If you loved Zodiac Shit start with his album Cosmogramma all his albums are on Spotify. Thats where the song comes from and if you love that one youll likely find others you love on that album. That wont necessarily be the case if you start with  or LA. Id rather you go to an album where youll more likely find something you like than go through everything chronologically just because thats the proper way to do it.Something to keep in mind if youre newish to this type of music. Not everything is going to be as instantly catchy as Zodiac Shit. Some songs will but others will probably take a while to grow on you. The first  songs off Cosmogramma in particular are going to sound fairly abrasive to someone whos new to the music. Try not to let that scare you away because youll find shit you like on the album. Its diverse and fun as hell.,flyinglotus,cqf2ffb,11,t5_2u4v5
