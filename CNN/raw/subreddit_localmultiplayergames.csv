3363418,0,t1_cpblorb,PC is definitely the place to be in terms of breadthvariety of local multiplayer experiences right now although its difficult to convince people of that online. The Wii U has some genuinely great titles for it with a level of polish youll be hard pressed to find elsewhere and I do believe its worth owning one but if I had to choose between Wii U and PC Id definitely go with the latter.,localmultiplayergames,cpbnl2l,2,t5_37biq

3876960,0,t3_34t6k1,A few more on itch.io Ill vouch for No Brakes Valet  More an exercise in chaos than anything resembling a game of skill which is why its especially good for a party setting. Porcunipine  Fourplayer arena combat in a Towerfall meets Bomberman sort of fashion. Foiled  Free twoplayer duelling platformer. Quick to learn fun to play and watch.,localmultiplayergames,cqy7git,3,t5_37biq
3932465,0,t3_35gfmk,I played this yesterday for the first time. This game makes for a great game between friends as the games are short and its relatively fun to watch as a spectator.It worked super well when we had two Xbox controllers.,localmultiplayergames,cr4jbdd,3,t5_37biq

4618378,0,t3_3e7ygy,I was in a very similar situation when my SO saw a video of Wind Waker and showed some interest. I cleaned my Gamecube and we did a whole playthrough with her in control and only asking for my guidance on specific situations and things went great from there now we play some games together and she enjoys and get the hang of it much faster.   My point is I think everybody need some time to play something alone at its own pace and interest. We usually put people with less experience in secondary roles in coop or against more experienced players and that makes them just follow other players rhythms and line of thinking without really getting what gaming or one specific game is about.   For specific games Id add Rayman OriginsLegends and Trine she really enjoyed these. Ibb amp Obb can also be interesting it starts slow but becomes a great lets figure a plan together puzzle game. TLDR Let her be the Player . ,localmultiplayergames,ctcq2yf,1,t5_37biq

5837838,0,t1_cxkv0vy,Yeah and I agree that it is what it is plus you already included game options. Fun to brainstorm anyways,localmultiplayergames,cxkv8sv,1,t5_37biq
7057356,0,t1_d0ou2t5,yes but general conception here is the ability to use Split Tool to run two instances to control with a controller for each window weirdly BL BL PS are fine alas BL,localmultiplayergames,d1gb6z7,1,t5_37biq

7649115,0,t3_4k2hh8,Looks fun Ive been hoping for a good game like this to come out. Mario party has been missing the boat with the last few iterations and so there hasnt really been anything since the first Fusion Frenzy.,localmultiplayergames,d3bnuks,2,t5_37biq
9633896,0,t1_da0foys,Screencheat doesnt have coop the original posts topic included this narrow range.Gunscape shows up as the only game on cooptimus that has more than  players. It appears to be Minecraft with guns by the looks of the screenshots.,localmultiplayergames,da0kqz6,1,t5_37biq

11157041,0,t3_5z8vfu,Just dropping in to say that in my game nights Lance A Lot is pretty much a starter game. It always gets played its always enjoyed and it usual is the jump off for the party. Highly recommend for a local coop library. ,localmultiplayergames,dewn08u,1,t5_37biq
