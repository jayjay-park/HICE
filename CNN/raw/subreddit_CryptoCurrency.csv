18573,0,t1_cegjb80,I dont see why it couldnt be done with existing conventional coins  but maybe for simplicity sake another new coin?  As far as adding to complexity with plugins widgets... well not sure that that is the way to go.Anything other than time based rewards would give unfair advantages.It would definitely be peerpeer and open source  no centralized service to speak of.  You could build your own service on top of the peerpeer network to sell your own services of course.I hadnt thought of the vm point you bring up but I dont see why that wouldnt be allowed.  Server farms dedicated rigs etc... would be acceptable though the advantage that anyone attempting this would be in the number of virtual or real devices that they had at their disposal.  In effect no matter the device or devices  you are set to  coins max per  hours connected to the network.  ,CryptoCurrency,cegjq6w,0,t5_2wlj3

Just to take Megacoin as an example at its ATH it was around  up driven mainly through chinese exchanges. In the end it always comes down to what you determine as your base currency and when you decide to realise the PNL if you intend to grow BTC holdings without daytrading BTC trading altcoins is your best bet they tend to raise from their price at issue date and tend to experience a boost whenever they get listed on coinmarketcap or on more popular exchanges like cryptsy etc.Megacoin up .Dogecoin up Worldcoin up Litecoin up I went into them somewhere in SepOct  Not taking into account Dogecoin ofcYou can also see most performance charts when you take a look at Here is Megacoin for record.,CryptoCurrency,cez7epu,5,t5_2wlj3

What ASIC mining is doing to bitcoin is exactly what Vertcoin is trying to avoid.If you understand how coin creation works its all preset assuming good and smooth correlation between hash rates and difficulty.  Basically you cant create coins faster.  However you can increase your share of the unmined coins by increasing your share of the hash rate.Take Litecoin for example.  If everyone is using the same consumer hardware GPUs to mine everyone is on a relatively even playing field.  Now if one person or a small group of people had access to specialized hardware it would completely unbalance the playing field and allow them to take a larger share of the pie.  This is the unfair distribution that Vertcoin tries to protect.,CryptoCurrency,cfriws5,2,t5_2wlj3

The problem is that you have to extrapolate way beyond current data points to get there. Theres no one who can honestly tell you that Doge or Vert or whichever will be around.

Overflowing the Internet with various coins before any one of them is widely used might cause the wrong effect. I will be donating litecoins as I chose to invest in them. Hoping that litecoins reach more growth and a better balance in their position relative to bitcoins. To increase their value while providing a solid alternative in case bitcoin fails. I believe in duality. Night and day female and male bitcoin and litecoin.. But thats just me. Im sure donating bitcoins is just as good. Or any other coin if you prefer.

Do you want it ASIC friendly or resistant?.  Do you want Darksend technology implemented?.  Do you want me to build your wallets for Windows Mac Linux and Android?.  Do you want it to be mergemined with another currency?.  Do you want it open source or proprietary?Each of those questions will impact the difficulty of the source code and as you increase the complexity of your code the price tag will rise.That being said the actual price will vary depending ultimately on who you choose to hire. You can find top notch tech people in India for half the price it would cost here in the US. And I would highly recommend you lawyer up before you do this with anyone to guarantee that everyone in the project knows exactly what is expected of them.The most important thing however is PLANNING.

1529528,0,t1_cj7s8c6,Hmm fair points that graph is interesting. But it does illustrate that the ratio drops in both instances before it starts to really risemy take is at first ltcbtc drops in anticipation of the big rise in btc or in other wordstraders trade their litecoin back for bitcoin. Then in the midst of the run they start to switch back to ltc and ltcbtc rises as bitcoin is still risinglikely because they are anticipating btc will soon cool downso its a form of taking profits although they were wrong in reality it can be tough to predict the top. Then lastly when bitcoin actually does peak those in litecoin take profits back in the form of bitcoin thus finally crashing the ratio. I dont think my description is perfect but somewhat represents the reality. There are likely multiple factors. gtMy bet is that  of alt orders are listed vs. BTC. So that relation ALTBTC doesnt change in the listing once BTC explodes. For that to happen everyone would have to change their orders accordingly.Well yes I dont know if its instantaneous but markets are pretty quick to adjust when theres money to be made through arbitrage as you mentioned. But I do think these trading pairs do adjust when money flows into bitcoin it kind of makes sense.  flowing into bitcoin should not necessarily mean direct increase in  value with every coin these relationships are constantly changing and thats why ratios never stay constant. ,CryptoCurrency,cj804tc,1,t5_2wlj3
1537860,0,t1_cj91fl9,Very good reading. Thanks. At one point he said Here we do not discuss whether it is good or moral to make your own currency or store other peoples money.I gotta give my opinion on this Creating private money falls under personal freedoms and any attempt to suffocate such projects is repression and dictatorship. Its on the people to decide what form of money is most worthy.Futhermore he said Economically all Bitcoin clones altcoins have the same problem they all have much smaller market exposure than Bitcoin while not technically superiorWould not agree with him. Plenty of altcoins are the same as Bitcoin with maybe minor tweaks but there is one property of Bitcoin which is hugely overtaken by several alts that is anonymity. As anonymity is strong factor we do have several technically superior alts but the real question is it too lat for them. Personally I think if Bitcoin was anonymous and if was a mixture of POW and POS like Peercoin is the impact of altcoins would be much smaller. There would not be any property they could be so much better than Bitcoin...Its really hard to imagine cryptocurrency market in  years or more. Will Bitcoin still be the ruling one? How strong would be the competition. Bitcoin started as opensource but there is no serious company behind it we all know for Bitcoin Foundation flaws and scandals. They are favorizing regulation which misses the whole point of cryptocurrencies which are here to expell state and banks.I think Ethereum maybe has the strength to even overthrow Bitcoin given the quality of team and how much money theyve risen so far to finance themselves. I just hope after they make thing significantly better than Bitcoin they will realise marketing is a big part of the success. You cant have just a good product you must brainwash thats the reality.One is sure power of state is declining with wider user of cryptocoins the best scenario would be that we cook the state slowly like frog  so they are not aware until its late. If they launch allout attach on coins right now that would really slow up adoption...,CryptoCurrency,cj91njv,1,t5_2wlj3

Think about it this way if you as a man complained that another mans attire was making you uncomfortable do you imagine anyone would give a shit?

4676685,0,t3_3euy3t, Vrontis Yes you can say that we may face some issues with it and Im sure we will. We know what our ideas mean. Right now we have just introduced these features. We do know that we need to escalate a little more the entire data management system regarding the blockchain in order to ensure that we dont get a blockchain of  GB in a matter of a day. We have several concepts behind what we are doing and we are reviewing every possible architecture and every possible tool that we can use in Qora features that will make the idea more feasible and reliable to end users. Vrontis The existing architecture that we have introduced with this decentralized web can actually give us another perspective for development besides the core development which is Java we can move the development to a web development which is another plus for Qora because there are many web developers  Java developers. That will help growth as well. fuzzy One thing that I did want to ask about it seems like Qora from what I saw only has a Windows client is that correct? Vrontis No we have  kinds of clients. We have a universal one which is Java basically everything is based on Java which means it can run everywhere its Java. But we have also made our clients to be more easily compatible with several operating systems. We have a Windows client a Mac client amp a Linux client. fuzzy Do you guys have a mobile wallet out yet or are you planning on it? Vrontis No we dont have one. We have reviewed once about how to create a mobile client. There are several ideas behind a mobile client. We can easily deploy a mobile client but it needs to be centralized and be based on anothers personal blockchain in order to be fast and small. This is the lightwallet concept. fuzzy Is the idea to have ACCT using that? Vrontis ACCT and AT is a core feature of Qora. Right now one idea that we are trying to work on is to deploy an application on the web of Qora that will allow users to easily trade using the atomic crosschain transactions like a decentralized trading platform. Ok we can only trade with Burst but thats another idea that we can have. As long as we are able to take the most out of its features we can deploy several ideas backed by the blockchain.  fuzzy Where does CIYAM and ACCT from Burst work into everything here? Vrontis Im focused on a decentralized way of trading which can be made with ACCT. Our idea is to create a web interface because we already have a dedicated ACCT tab in the wallet which is pretty helpful to run your own trade with a Burst user forth and back to be the initiator or the responder. The hope we have from vbcs is to integrate more cryptocurrencies out there with automated transactions. Because once a blockchain has automated transactions it can instantly work with our blockchain. Vrontis This is our idea regarding our decentralized exchange. fuzzy Any coin that integrates with Burst will automatically be able to move in and out all of these different ecosystems? Vrontis Any coin that implements automated transactions. Atomic crosschain feature is just a smart contract use case its just a smart contract. Its just one of the thousands of use cases that AT can do. So once a blockchain has AT on it and AT is running for creating the ACCT use case is used to achieve trades. Its just a single use case of AT. Vrontis Yeah we do have. The idea of the decentralized web and the decentralized social network came up one night in a discussion I had with him in the past when he was working to introduce the arbitrary transaction. A feature of Qora in which you can host data on the blockchain. And I asked him hey what kind of data can you host in there?. And he said anything anything you want. Vrontis And thats how the idea of microblogging has been introduced and thats how the idea of a social network came up. But at that time I didnt know how it was possible to be made. Likely right now the core team of Qora is me an another great Developer named skerberus and another great Developer named agran. We also have support from vbcs CIYAM which I can tell you is a Developer which stays on a higher level. He made automated transactions I mean you can understand how good he is. Vrontis And likely our team me agran skerberus and vbcs we have found out how to make the most of arbitrary transactions and create the decentralized web and the decentralized social network decentralized blogging platform and in the future a decentralized reddit a decentralized medium like the Medium blogging platform and hopefully many more similar applications on top of Qora.,CryptoCurrency,ctk1n84,1,t5_2wlj3

The setup of Gridcoin combined with BOINC is time consuming and tricky.This bars novices from easy access. In order to provide end users with a plugnplay solution PiGrid has developed opensource softwarethat works out of the box and takes care of all related configurations and updates.PiGrid can be used on existing hardware or bundled with preinstalled systems.A graphical user interface allows choice of research projects via draganddrop monitoring of progress and tracking rewards in Gridcoin.The first generation of PiGrid solutions will be crowdfunded in this Kickstarter Below is a list of links for background information. short introduction to Gridcoin  overview of BOINC  developer board of Gridcoin  twitter  Gridcoin documentation Wed be glad to hear whether you consider to mention PiGrid in any news coverage.In case of specific questions we are happy to answer your mail to presspigrid.com.Thank you for your time!Regards PiGrid      ,CryptoCurrency,cvu0g25,0,t5_2wlj3

I went on his livestream after the album came out and it was him linking up with random people on the Internet talking about how theyre tracking Daquan and have numbered agents all across the globe who they are communicating with to go get Daquan. This doesnt disprove any asset hiding. Its possible of course that the trolling is a cover up for it. But the stunt itself seems really fake.

The second huge financial scandal of the year reveals the real international conspiracy Theres no price the big banks cant fixWhen you dont actually have access to your assets and you have to rely on a cryptic blackbox system run by people whose interests do not align with your own you cannot expect to be unharmed.   But of course the very good at theft do not harm particular people.  Much better if you just harm everyone a little bit.Quite a bit of this kind of manipulation still is possible with crypto currencies and their exchanges.  However with a global asset that can be traded anywhere in the world Bitcoin does at least allow the competition between parties.   At this small size everything even today is pretty Micky Mouse.  But with maturity the idea that only one group could manipulate world wide exchange rates for a distributed asset would be ridiculous. None the less Bitcoin has a long way to go.
