9537212,0,t3_5bgwtj,It looks like you can find a bunch here. Not sure of the quality of edit packs and doubt theyre really recent edits since I didnt go through all the pages but it looks like it has all of the DLC moves that were released at the very least like the Yokosuka Cutter and grapple superkick.,firepro,d9onryh,1,t5_2u1lq
10398775,0,t3_5ousex,I have and Im pretty sure I remember the exact match youre talking about. Unfortunately this was years ago and all I remember is it taking two and a half hours and about half a bottle of Canadian Hunter mixed with orange soda. I also missed a class think it was Latin. Stupid language anyway.Fun fact though this is what caused my roommate to see how obsessed with the game I was he tried it out that night and within a week he was hooked on FirePro and still is. He just got married in Reno last November. Beautiful ceremony.,firepro,dcmrn62,2,t5_2u1lq

11008640,0,t3_5x6ii2,I dont think there is. I was combing the options menu recently and didnt see anything like that. Unfortunate though. It would be cool to see CPU logic play out post match for heels.,firepro,defsrf7,1,t5_2u1lq
11025006,0,t1_deft1ib,In fact I think from what Ive seen just about any wrestler in a group designated heel will do a postmatch beatdown or at least a taunt. Its a good touch!,firepro,dehnlwv,2,t5_2u1lq

11803677,0,t1_dgxyw2q,No it doesnt.The square button is the ONLY button that picks up your opponent. Either youre pressing that instead of something else or your controller config is messed up.Theres only two buttons that do moves on the ground X and O Xbox Green A and Red B. That is it.Looking at your other posting you say they also only ever do submissions but never pinfalls. Theres  positions on the ground. . Opponent Face Up Near Head. Opponent Face Up Near Feet. Opponent Face Down Near Head . Opponent Face Down Near Feet.And each of those has  buttons. So you have  moves you have potentially on the ground. Its possible that a pin move might be set to one of the other sets of downed moves face down instead of up or near the feet instead of near the head. Ive done it before on some of my own edits and that was their only pinfall move on the ground Their finisher was a strike move that always put the opponent face down so making their pin be on Face Down Near Head made sense,firepro,dgxzki3,1,t5_2u1lq
