3394997,0,t1_cpelelq,I think there was a rumour about a book about one of the girls who were watching Kel tilt the dark haired ones and how she would be Kels squire. However I dont think that this book has been contracted. To be honest TP is now  and I suspect that she may be considering retirement or semiretirement and her rate of books may slow down in upcoming years. ,tamorapierce,cpf98u9,3,t5_2t9hb
3472941,0,t3_300cd8,I think Alanna would probably be a little less all powerful. I feel like SotL sometimes tries to have Alanna do everything be a warrior a healer godchosen lover of a prince perfect martial artist and she also know the king of thieves. Now that she has written other books I think she could pare down on some of these traits and then expand on them so that Alanna could be less OP and more well rounded. Also I agree with everyone else that the books would be longer. ,tamorapierce,cpo52jh,8,t5_2t9hb
6343826,0,t3_3vxgce,Another issue other then them being fairly old is that a lot of book stores dont sell them anymore. When Battle Magic came out I had the hardest time finding it and ended up having to order it online. My Barnes and Nobles said that they dont carry anything of hers anymore because they just sit on the shelves forever.Which is really disappointing. I feel like just putting them on an end cap the shelf display on the aisle side of the section would be enough to garner some interest.,tamorapierce,czaq13e,2,t5_2t9hb

I guess some of the problems like establishing myself finding a home etc. still applied despite our different ages.I still havent had the chance to read the Circle books because theyre not sold as ebooks here and I move too often to buy hard copies.,tamorapierce,dektb64,1,t5_2t9hb
