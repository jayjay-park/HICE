Many say no power steering is the best for the nsx because you have so much control of the car. Test drive both so you get a feel on what you want. First few days of ownership I wish I had power steering because turning and slow speed was bad. I got used to it though. All years are plagued with bad window pulleys so they all eventually slow down. If I could do it again Id probably go for a  for the bump in power and displacement while retaining the popup lights. ,nsx,cv4meu8,4,t5_2suvo
