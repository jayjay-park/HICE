1550643,0,t3_2c03n7,Nice! But I was hoping there would be an extra Lays Of Beleriand hardback in there so I could buy it  ,tolkienbooks,cjanagi,1,t5_2w9my

8795036,0,t1_d7519lb,The first prints of SampG  copies?? and TftPR  copies took several years to sell out. You could buy the signed TftPR fron tolkien.co.uk for quite a long time. The Hobbit first print was  yearsish I think whereas LoTR was definitely onto its second print by . Obviously they are all on reprints now but if you buy within a year of them coming out I doubt very much you would be in reprint territory. The Super Deluxe CoH  copies only just sold out a few weeks ago after nine years,tolkienbooks,d751lqs,1,t5_2w9my

9272647,0,t1_d8qrcip,Coincidentally and ironically I do also come from a family of rather successful and experienced civil engineers. But my fellow true collector there is absolutely no need or requirement to feel ashamed or embarrassed for ones career the wise and true say there is honor in all professions and crafts! Furthermore software engineering  call it software programmer if you will  is likely the profession with the most worldwide  global job openings and or postings and is generally very well andor excellently paid  I simply and honestly did not enjoy coding andor programming at all and had to switch careers in order to avoid a completely and entirely miserable and unhappy life. Does it really matter that you call yourself an engineer or not? It matters that you are happy and pleased with what you do. By the way I will try and attempt to play that Jetpac soon enough but not too soon because work.Some of my collector friends actually remove the slipcase! They still consider the slipcase part of the collectible item but they put it aside and place Brodart around the book itself to display it without exposing it too much to light. I do not think this has the desired effect as they somewhat lose their onshelf appeal. I know this sounds absurd and ridiculous but some people actually dislike the slipcases!,tolkienbooks,d8rdhyj,1,t5_2w9my

11297424,0,t1_dfcj1zf,I found it on Tolkien co uk. If you search for Beren and Luthien three editions show up. Two of them dont have a thumbnail image but if you click the most expensive one the deluxe version this is the image on the product page. ,tolkienbooks,dfcjo3q,2,t5_2w9my
