9374681,0,t3_58wocg,gt b Barrel shroud means a covering other than a slide that is attached to or that substantially or completely encircles the barrel of a firearm and that allows the bearer of the firearm to hold the barrel with the nonshooting hand while firing the firearm without burning that hand. Barrel shroud does not include an extension of the stock along the bottom of the barrel if the extension of the stock does not substantially or completely encircle the barrel.By this definition handguards on AR pattern rifles are not barrel shrouds. This is because while they substantially or completely encircle the barrel they do not allow the bearer of the firearm to hold the barrel with the nonshooting hand while firing the firearm without burning that hand. The handguard is not a magical device that prevents the barrel from heating up it just gives you something cooler to hold onto that is not the barrel. Even with a handguard installed you cannot hold the barrel with the nonshooting hand without burning that hand. Therefore handguards are not barrel shrouds. Am I reading this right?Also the text says nothing about how many rounds the shooter would have to fire before the hand is burned. So as long as the barrel does not burn the shooters hand after firing a single shot a handguard is not a barrel shroud.,NOWTTYG,d94b2jz,4,t5_3bvrr
