5707045,0,t1_cx2o5rt,Ok so Im not just missing something obvious. Regarding spreading the bars I read a recent paper that emphasized managing bar spacing first and then if necessary add or remove bars. I wasnt taught that emphasis on spacing but it makes perfect sense and fits with what youre saying.,TechRescue,cx4ij7n,1,t5_2udw6
6129856,0,t1_cyeg7bi,Thank You for the input. This is a small scale thought The Squad that acquires the drone will train a few competent Operators and keep a drone on the rescue truck always. Most of the guys in the Squad I  refer to already have great electronic skills and some already have personal drones. Most of them if not all now are Ham Radio Operators and Instructors. The Patients are Usually in a Known location upon call for help. The need for the drone is mainly to carry a payload up and over the victim and across a raging river to waiting rescuers to tie of main pick off lines. I dont know what their current budget is but I know it is not too much but for this area they are kinda on the High side of Technology.,TechRescue,cymefyu,1,t5_2udw6
