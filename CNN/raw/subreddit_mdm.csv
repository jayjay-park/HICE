3970485,0,t3_33tv8a,Hi! Im an MDM admin as well. Just wondering if youve tried or demoed any other MDMs before settling on MobileIron? If so  what led you to them as opposed to the others? Also  what is your environment like without getting too specific obivously  BYOD amp company owned or just company owned? All users in the same locationcountry  or scattered? ,mdm,cr8v9t5,2,t5_2vhv6
5125218,0,t1_cr8v9t5,We did not demo any other MDM solutions. When I started at this company MobileIron was already setup and in place.Our environment is mostly BYOD. With a few hundred or so company bought devices. We are scattered across the world.,mdm,cv3s4nv,1,t5_2vhv6
