440757,0,t3_1z4l16,Lorde now has three songs on the chart. Apparently Vikings is a big thing for it featuring Glory and Gore in a commercial to propeller it so highGampG is currently at  on iTunes. Although rumors say the Tennis Court will be the rd US single I predict a change of direction soon.She definitely has the power to stay around.,lorde,cfqg6ib,5,t5_2xpe1

696809,0,t3_222yw2,I would have to say Still Sane for now. Amazing song with an amazing perspective on how it feels to be Lorde.  LuxRibsBravadoBuzzcut SeasonGlory and GloreSwingin Party are close seconds! Pretty much all of her other songs are close seconds. I have heard No Better twice not too sure about it but I think I will get into that.,lorde,cgjh9n3,4,t5_2xpe1

1403950,0,t1_cis8hx6, Lux may or may not work but A World Alone? Radio would never play that haha. Glory and Gore actually has already been a single. It was the third single for alternative radio and unfortunately was her first to miss the top ten there. Mainly because Tennis Court kind of came in and killed it.,lorde,cis9ka2,2,t5_2xpe1
1429476,0,t1_civdl02,Every day. That doesnt change. Theres no real break where you feel differently as an adult or middle aged etc. You mostly feel the same but a little more secure and relaxed after a while. Things will still scare you. It doesnt get easier but it does get better. Someone once told me something profound about training to run. You dont hurt less but your time gets better. Also true in life. ,lorde,civgn06,7,t5_2xpe1
1442745,0,t3_2an6b5,Theres many covers or remixes by other artists of Lorde songs two of my favorites are Dominiques looping cover of Buzzcut Season and Chvrches team but Im assuming youre probably talking about covers or unreleased songs done by Lorde.In that case you have her unofficial songs and covers which now maybe includes Easy though thats official and definitely Good Fights as mentioned above and her hospital snippet I guess you also have her countless live performances which I guess are kinda different just cause theyre live I love her coachella one.Beyond all those Id love to hear more Lorde all day long so Im hoping there are some other ones here. I think there were some recordings from her old band when she was a little kid but I couldnt find them off the top of my head.Also do we have any idea when she might release any new songs? Just if we do I might want to make a paper chain or something to count down the days Edit I just realized in that unofficial songs and covers post FoxFernie mentioned Warwick Avenue by Duffy and Mama Do by Pixie Lot both when she was  years old. I couldnt find her recording of Warwick Avenue but I did find Use somebody by Kings of Leon so theres those enjoy  Even at  she was really good! That youtube person also has a snippet of Come Together by the Beatles supposedly sung by Lorde though it does sound like her so Id like to think it is.,lorde,cix4heb,8,t5_2xpe1

11114420,0,t1_depz78u,Its good to see that she can be so versatile without losing her own touch on the new songs. Although I love Pure Heroine to pieces Melodrama is so much more personal and I definitely feel like the lyrics come from her heart.
