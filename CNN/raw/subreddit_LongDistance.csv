A few months into the relationship the whole being together forever was a topic we kind of touched on but never took it seriously because it was too early. After . years and still being together we took it a lot more into consideration. And so on. In all honesty at  months into a LDR i wouldnt start talking about being together for the rest of your lives. Im not saying it wont happen or will happen. Im just saying its too early to actually be talking about it seriously. Take the time you have with eachother to bond and talk and do things a local relationship couple would do. And after a year or  if you are both together and still happy. THEN i would start talking about it.  All i know. Is that when i first started dating my SO i didnt think it was going to last long due to the distance and everything. But if you keep going and the feelings for eachother last. So will the relationship. Never doubt it.,LongDistance,cf5d7rj,3,t5_2s6ky

Also the bot framework actually predates portal so really the portal turrets are based on sexbot technology if that makes it any different.  In practice the robots are effectively invisible you get your intimacy from your partner through headphones and webcam or occulus rift if youre fancy.

Just remember that it is his choice and if he decides to make some sort of sacrifice to his career to stay with you he has chosen that path and you certainly have left the decision open to him and his choice should be respected regardless of what you think is best for him.Keep being awesome! ,LongDistance,cflegx3,1,t5_2s6ky

Its an amazing website I found and it helps give us a lot of hope as there is one job on there which will be perfect for me. I know they dont last forever typically around a year.

Itll take a bit to fall into a routine but its fine if youre always around each other etc. Youll figure out what works best for you two as a couple.

584142,0,t3_20tu8u,Im not sure if what Im about to say will make sense but please try to follow me. Its not uncommon for a female who has had a bad or abusive sexual history to be very promiscuous in spurts with strangers or people of no consequence but yet be very cold sexually  toward someone she loves. This stems from a need to take back a measure of power and feel in control and maybe even degrade a sexual partner the way she was degraded in the past. She may be having trouble with intimacy with you because it makes her feel vulnerable. She has this need to reclaim something that was taken away from her but she doesnt want to take it from you. She wants to take it from someone who can replace the object of her scorn. Affection may remind her of some false affection that someone once showed her before they hurt her deeply and so she pushes away from it. I cant say for certain but thats definitely what it sounds like to me. Unfortunately for you you have to make a choice. Do you care about her enough to love her through this and to realize that its not about you? Is she worth the pain that you may have to endure for a very long time until she stabilizes or works through her issues? Has she considered counseling or is that issue taboo? Ill stop here because I dont want to ramble on if you read this once over and think this is definitely NOT our problem. But if anything I said makes sense Id be happy to talk to you more about it. EDIT Ill also add that it may not have been an issue in the beginning of your relationship because the closer she gets to you the more vulnerable she feels and shes subconsciously afraid of being hurt andor hurting you.,LongDistance,cg6o6ap,3,t5_2s6ky

614300,0,t3_216irg,Ending any relationship should be done with the utmost care but also the utmost conviction that its the right thing to do. The point that stuck out at me from your post was about a lack of trust caused by the distance.  Its a clich that trust is a vital foundation in any relationship but I think its a clich that rings true.One thing I will say is that the trust issues that come with the long distance is something that can be worked through and understood. Its totally natural and normal to get some feelings of jealousy given that there are other people who literally get to spend more time with your SO than you do.The problem is these problems can only be worked on by talking to your partner and being open and honest with how youre feeling. These are tough conversations to have but if youre as unhappy as you say you are then it sounds like such a conversation is necessary.Either way best of luck OP.tldr  dont do anything rash think it through and talk to your partner.,LongDistance,cga3imp,1,t5_2s6ky

767705,0,t3_22xmv0,Mmm as someone who is very lowmaintenance in a relationship you can still need space in a LDR. I had this one long distance bf who used to insist that we get on Skype twice a day every day my lunch and evenings. At first it was nice because I had bronchitis for  months and was super lonely and couldnt do much besides show up for classes but once I got healthy he started to freak out if I wanted to have lunch with friends or if I went out in the evenings without giving him  days notice. After a while it got REALLY stressful because I felt so much pressure to be around for him nonstop despite my schedule. I was alway anxious that if my research ran over and I didnt get home in time or if I lost track of time at dance practice he was going to freak out at me. Im definitely not saying that youre doing that and I think its really kind of you that youre working to his schedule right now. He might be stressed out and feeling like he has a lot of demands on his time and thats where this is coming from. When Im stressed out literally the sound of a text message going off can make me angry. However its also not ok for him to completely neglect your feelings. I think its perfectly valid for you to tell him that youre ok with less contact as long as the contact you have is quality  he still needs to be taking an interest in your life and asking you how your day has been going. Breaking up with you out of the blue is not ok and the lack of trust that generates is not good in the long term. You two need to sit down and come up with a game plan. He needs to be able to tell you what stresses him out and what hes ok with as well as meet you halfway on what you need to feel loved and supported. No not everything will be fixed when he gets here but it will definitely improve because the time you spend together will be physically together  higher quality less stress. In the long run two months is not a very long time and if hes willing to have a candid and open discussion where you both are on the same team trying to find a way that works for both of you its worth it. If hes just nonstop attacking you being mean and not trying to solve the problem thats something that is not going to change when hes here and will cause more problems in the future. ,LongDistance,cgrjk3w,3,t5_2s6ky

It was stressing him out because he wanted to be able to live his life but felt like he wasnt doing enough for me. What we settled on was setting aside one night during the week that was just for us.

836399,0,t3_23nai2,Question here is this only relevant when you guys are distant? For me and my boy he said that he honestly finds it extremely frustrating to have sexy chats. Mostly because he gets all worked up but then Im not there to satisfy the need. It used to really frustrate me because I would try to initiate sexual connection from a distance but then he would get awkward and shut it down. It required a conversation about it. So we dont talk about sex whenever were distant. We have a fantastic sex life when were together but when were apart we focus on the emotional connection that keeps us together. Maybe if you just ask him WHY hes straying from sex youll be able to figure out if its rooted in your sexual compatibility or if the distance is the culprit here. ,LongDistance,cgzcne4,1,t5_2s6ky

1203504,0,t1_ci4sst2,Hmm.. Im not sure I was really unhappy that whole time.  I had another relationship during that time and I was happier with that SO.  There was always just this awareness that I wasnt over him  when I thought about him though frequently it wasnt always positively.  In fact often it was with anger or some negative emotions.  However that was just as bad as thinking about him longingly.  I still think of him from time to time now but Ive made my peace with everything that happened and found closure.Ending it... it had just gotten too broken.  We were passionately in love but both of us were ruled by jealousy and control.  It was really awful.  In some ways I still feel like it was the most passionate relationship Ive ever had  but in a bad way for a lot of it.  We fought all the time and well.. I think we were holding each other back.  Evening though I loved him so much that ending it pretty much broke me I knew wed both be better off with a chance to find a fresh start in a healthier relationship.  The first few months were the hardest emotionally.  After that even though I still thought about him every day I was sure Id made the right decision.,LongDistance,ci50gfk,1,t5_2s6ky

1253639,0,t3_28g2pw,I disagree with the other comment that dinner and a movie sounds like a date. My SO is distant from me too Ive gotten dinner and seen a movie with a male friend with whom there are no feelings involved and it wasnt a date. A date is when there is romantic interest it has nothing to do with the activity itself unless the activity is sex hah. I find that rather silly.On one hand if your SO isnt inviting or entertaining her advances then you really have nothing to worry about and you know that. Nothing can happen between them without his interest and consent. On the other if he knows it really bothers you and its something he chooses to do anyway then its up to you to decide if its worth making into a Relationship Breaking Issue. Others may see this as a lack of respect for you on his behalf but really if all they have is a platonic friendship and hes not actually doing anything untoward then why should he be limited to what friends he sees or what they do together in order to appease irrational feelings? I think that in your heart you believe this but you just have a nagging feeling that you cant get rid of. I understand. I still get that sometimes too and Ive mostly conquered my issues with jealousy from my past. I know that my SO is a happier person knowing that I dont make a big deal over his female friends and the freedom he feels in this relationship has caused him to feel greater love for me hes now talking about marriage and weddings and things hooray. Its worth containing my jealous feelings because I know in my heart he would not ever cheat on me in order to have a better relationship together. He knows I get them sometimes but Ive explained sometimes I have irrational thoughts and feelings and Im not going to punish you for them or ask you to change. Just try to be patient with me let me have my moments they wont last forever and hes completely accepted that. Ive taken responsibility for my own feelings and let him know that I trust him.So its really up to you whether or not this is something you want to make into a serious issue and a lot of that depends on how threatened you ARE vs. how threatened you FEEL. I would also suggest that venting here is a really good place to put these feelings. Good luck!,LongDistance,ciane7p,1,t5_2s6ky

The passport is only  unless expedited . Now since youre only flying to canada it wont be THAT bad. But you also have to throw in living costs.

1740906,0,t1_cjyldvz,Tell her that. Just tell her I want to be honest with you because I respect you and our relationship. I hung out with a female friend of mine quite recently. I held her hand for a few minutes and she is recently single. While this is all true I have no intentions of cheating on you and brought this to your attention because I feel guilty about it. I feel that what I did was wrong. However you and I have never discussed what we consider to be cheating. I am not trying to make an excuse for myself. I just want to be honest with you and discuss this so nothing like it happens again.something like that and move into your discussion on it. If she seems hurt not sure how you two would discuss it through text or cam let her speak about how she feels about what you just told her before you start talking about what is considered cheating.If anything consider how you would feel if you were on the other side of this conversation,LongDistance,cjylrh0,2,t5_2s6ky

1821839,0,t3_2fezxy,So I recognized you from a post last week and if I remember correctly hes in Germany? I see youve gotten some really solid rational advice from others so Ill give you a slightly different perspective to weigh .     Im sorry if Im giving you information you already know but as Im in the same boat  Ive been doing my research on the whole thing for a while now and I would have loved it if someone had shared it with me earlier. Moving to Germany as a nonEU citizen can be really complicated if you dont plan on marrying him before you do it. As an American you can only stay in the Schengen region for  days out of any given  day period without a visa. Otherwise you need to apply for permanent residence and in order to do that you must prove basic proficiency in German and be sponsored by an employer who has already hired you. The other option is to go to school in Germany in which case you would get a student visa there are plenty of Masters programs entirely in English this is quite easy actually but of course you have to be paying tuition and taking classes full time. Depending on your job and finances what Im doing could actually be a good solution for you too! Instead of jumping into a permanent move Im going to spend the full  days that I am allowed there on a tourist visa taking  hours a week of intensive German at a language school. Im going to put feelers out in the job market and the whole thing is going to essentially function as a trial run before making a commitment as huge as uprooting my entire life! It feels like a really happy medium. PM me if you have any questions! Edit There are SO many expat meet up groups in the major cities of Germany which I imagine could really ease the transition pains of finding a new support system.  ,LongDistance,ck8pwj7,5,t5_2s6ky

If you are a good candidate perhaps some employers wont mind the vacation  just let them know that its been planned a long time ago and is very important to you and that besides this trip you will be very dedicated and present at work. If that doesnt fly well with the companies you apply to you could also find a more temporary job for the next few months and start your real career after the trip.

2005807,0,t1_cktvm1p,Sorry for the late reply been busy putting the final touches on it.We were really lucky wed been pen pals and best friends for about six years before we even got together we met on a forum when I was thirteen! so we had a really strong foundation before we even started. I think thats probably whats kept us going through all this because we knew it was worth it when we started. I dont want to say its been easy because its been really really hard at times. We were young even when we got together and we had a lot to learn about being in a relationship like this. Our friendship made communication so much easier and we knew each other so well before we started and thats what weve found to be the most important thing. Without body language and touch and physical closeness theres really nothing else so you have to be able to commit to seriously open honest and frequent communication.Future goals are super important we are always looking forward to the next thing visits weekend skype sessions presents we send each other buying his one way ticket and our wedding. We love to go on Zillow and look at dream houses talk about the garden wed like to have vacations wed like to go on some day all that kind of thing. It is soooo important to keep reminding yourselves that it isnt forever and if youre committed theres nothing to stop you from going all the way. Regarding the K weve known since the beginning that wed have to do it since hes from England and Im from Oregon so we made sure to take pictures of us in really recognizable locations have loads of pictures with eachothers family keep all our boarding passes and any other document that could be useful. For example Im sending in the paperwork I got in  when I added him on to my checking account! Ive really relied on visajourney.com because their guide and checklist is fantastic. The DHS and USCIS dont tell you at all what they want to see in an application but visajourney was beyond helpful. We didnt have a lawyer put our packet together but I did have a paralegal who does a lot of immigration work just check it over to make sure I didnt miss anything. He said it was really well put together and only had a few minor corrections to make mostly thanks to those guides on visajourney. Im of the opinion and so is he that a well presented application reflects well on how important the process is to you. Also he said theyre less likely to have to go through everything with a fine tooth comb when its clear that all your ducks are in a row. The most difficult parts? Oh jeez. Well taking all those screenshots of our skype and email conversations was both time consuming mindnumbing and emotionally exhausting. We went through every. single. message. from the past two years picking out the most intimate conversations about our relationship and hopes and dreams to send to a stranger... Im a pretty private person so that was pretty hard on me. Im also a perfectionist so I really had to just get it done and stop fretting about it. My paralegals compliments on it helped though! Its also hard on the relationship sometimes because its the US petitioner who has to do nearly  of the work so I felt like Im agonizing over this thing while hes just hanging around. That was tough.

But Im a firm believer in love and if you really love each other you may find an even better way to meet in the future. I dont know what your financial situation is like but if theres no way around this situation the two of you might consider saving up money for a trip devoted to seeing each other. Its pretty scary to plan something like that I know. My SO and I saved up the money a whopping  and hes going to stay with me a week and weve never even met before.Anyway just hang in there and if you really want to keep going through with this consider alternate ways to meet that might require making him the focus of the trip or viceversa. Like I said I dont know about your situation so I dont know what is possible for you. But Ive been at the point where I kept trying to think of roundabout ways to meet my SO and none of them were going to work out so I came to the conclusion that the best way for us is just to fly to be with each other even if it costs us financially.And maybe this isnt what you want to hear right now. Maybe you just want to be mad and upset and rant. If so just get mad for a bit and then maybe come back to this and think about what can be done.

As far as your kink the idea behind cuckolding is that the jealous feelings you feel inside drive your passionemotional levels higher  the same can be accomplished say through social media him liking modelswomens pictures on IG etc and no one has to be unfaithful to the other.

If youre not married or living together  that sounds about the average amount of time couples see each other. Some weeks more  some weeks less because life just happens. It sounds to me like you have a codependency issue. The fact that you want to break up with your so because of an hour distance that is only temporary is alarming. The fact that you feel so lonely because youre not seeing your so  days a week is even more alarming. Needing your so isnt necessarily bad.

I told her I had met him before in America and she made a note on my passport concerned for my safety which was ultra annoying because they keep asking me about it every time I enter the UK not in a couple weeks though  new passport under my MARRIED name woot!Anyway seeing him for the first time was just weird but so amazing. I keep goofy smiling at him. Also the first second I saw him he was behind one of those barrier things at the airport and I ran up to him all nervous and tired and full of emotion and gave him a sweet kiss. Then I awkwardly made my way around the barrier and kissed him again. To this day whenever I see him at airports he always looks so different when I first see him its like when you see a teenager for the first time after a couple months and you swear theyve grown  inches. Its a really amazing emotional time but after awhile you get used to the hellos and goodbyes. When we said goodbye the first time I wasnt sure if I would see him again. I got scared we would break up because of the distance but now were married and waiting on visas! Good luck to you!,LongDistance,clgqt5u,2,t5_2s6ky

Almost all of my friends are people I met online through MMOs or forums.. but that is just how I am. I am one of those shutins due to a number of illnesses but that doesnt make my relationships any less meaningful. My friends and I or my bf and I watch movies and TV shows together. We hang out in a lot of the ways people do in real life the only difference is.. were not in the same room.My mom once asked me how an online relationship could be real and so I asked her If the first time you met dad was from him sending you a message on facebook instead of meeting him at a party dont you think you would still love him? and that shut her up pretty quick.

2228708,0,t1_clmupgb,Hey Im sorry about your situation. I do want to clarify that while Im not a big believer in restricting people I do think you have a right and responsibility to talk to your partner about your feelings. You ask if you have a reason to worry  Well worry is a choice and its not an action that accomplishes anything. You say you trust him so no I dont think you have cause to worry. While he probably doesnt actually desire to be with her anymore theres probably a part of him that is pleased to keep someone around who finds him attractive. This is a pretty normal feeling honestly but it would make most partners uneasy.  Id probably phrase this to him sort of like thisI dont intend to tell you what to do or with whom you can be friends but I do need to be honest that I feel really uneasy about your friendship with Stupidface. I trust that you dont have feelings for her anymore but I cant help but feel a bit threatened and undermined that shes admitted her desire to get back together. I wont tell you how to handle your friendships but its important that you know this makes me uncomfortable and I hope youll try to see it from my point of view.In the meantime think about ways you can boost your boyfriends ego. Put forth an effort to make him feel loved and wanted in ways that are meaningful to him. I ended a friendship in August with someone with whom I had brief romantic history he didnt want to let that go and I asked if we could just be friends... He said he wouldnt be able to stop himself from talking about his intentions and I responded that we shouldnt speak anymore. It was difficult because I really like his company but that was the end of it. I dont think my partner would have cared that we were speaking but it didnt feel right. Maybe your boyfriend doesnt actually see that hes doing anything wrong because he doesnt have feelings for her but I do hope that hell have a think about it. Once you state your feelings to someone the choice is up to them and its important to realise that the only real control you have over another adult is whether or not youre in a relationship with them. ,LongDistance,cln4ed6,1,t5_2s6ky

I would try Dominos or Pizza Hut since they are the pizza giants in the U.S. so theyd be more likely to accept a Canadian card than a local pizza place.

Some of our major concerns are if you are a potential health risk if you have ever previously been ordered removed from Canada if you have the financial means to support yourself if you have the proper documentation to be here and if you have a previous criminal record.  As well we always want to know that people will leave when expected to. The best way to demonstrate that is to have ties back to your home country such as a job you need to go back to family or even just proving you have a return ticket back. Assuming you satisfy all of those requirements you shouldnt have issues crossing the border! ,LongDistance,cm6igts,3,t5_2s6ky

2573630,0,t1_cmuhayl,Yeah of course it has to be a slow process step by step getting used to drinking less and less until she can control herself this sounds like a rhyme or something. Im positive that if you both do your best this problem can be solved especially since you have your own experience to put to use! Even if its different from one person to another.At least she managed to call you indeed. Its good that you were patient and that in the end she managed to get a taxi without further problems. At this point I probably wouldnt have had her use Skype but go to sleep immediately though because she wasnt in her right mind and it wasnt the right time to have a serious talk either. One step to go is maybe making sure that she goes with friends that wont get too intoxicated so you know that somebody will keep an eye on things. Obviously though nobody can be her caregiver so thats not a solution. Since she always has to rely on others afterwards and thats honestly dangerous she has to learn to take care of herself and to set boundaries which allow her to enjoy herself while mantaining a clear head. Alcohol is a serious issue but it can be overcome nonetheless. When you both have time youre calm and in your right senses have a definite talk. Explain to her once and for all what and why you think is wrong listen to her reasons try to understand each other and find a compromise. If everything else is great its just too sad to break up especially since I assume you both care about each other very much. Be honest tell her that you want this relationship to work out but this problem is undermining it at the foundation and you dont want this to happen because of some drinks and you hope she doesnt want it too. Communication is first thing first.Of course thats not just about yourself and the relationship thats caring for her health and safety too.,LongDistance,cmuif8c,1,t5_2s6ky

I never wanted to marry before  and yet here I was under  and considering it. Plus he is in the military so I knew I would be giving up a lot of personal freedoms like choosing where I live and when I leave a job to be with him.However the joy of getting to spend the rest of my life with the person who loves me and I love in return made the others things start to feel pretty inconsequential.  I dont care I got married young by my generations standards  and Im over having to have my whole life go according to my plan. I have changed a lot since I got engaged to him but I honestly think its for the better. Im more relaxed and Ive learned how to step outside my comfort zone. My personal happiness is more important to me than how society thinks I should live to be happy.So I personally recommend you try to consider what you want most out of life the freedom in your slater marriage or this guy? There is no right answer and if youre genuinely concerned you will regret being tied down early then dont.  Your SO loves you and thats why you owe him your honest feelings.  And if youre just completely not sure either way maybe making a list of pros and cons for each choice will help  good luck!,LongDistance,cn9g0q5,2,t5_2s6ky

My plane landed on time but the passport line was so long and then my luggage was temporarily misplaced... I couldnt connect to WiFi at the entry point so she was worried I somehow didnt make it!Eventually we saw each other and she skipped to me. We hugged for SO long... mainly because she knew when the hug was over wed kiss for the first time haha. Eventually we picked up my rental car and left the airport. We were super comfortable with each other within five or ten minutes of talking. It felt completely natural the years of talking made everything feel normal. There was... quite a bit of kissing in the car when we parked for lunch! We brought lunch to her house ate and then spent some amazing quality time together. We ended up going out for a steak dinner that night which was delicious then went back home and cuddled and enjoyed being close until we passed out.I was only there for six days but it was the greatest week of my life. ,LongDistance,cnbtm6e,6,t5_2s6ky

Thats called an expectation my friend. gtI just know how forward staff can be with patrons. And how aggressive guys can be. So then youre actually afraid of her being assaulted or raped? Because someone being forward with her isnt a physical threat. I understand that being far away you must feel helpless to do anything if anything happens but youre going to have to trust her judgment and RELEASE CONTROL.Instead of expecting her to text you while shes out why cant you tell her to have a good time and to get in contact if she needs something? Then go do something else. Make yourself busy. Your desire for her to text you so often is dangerously close to control.

2932289,0,t1_co1c5rf,Octopus a lot of what you said makes sense. Granted she was technically single for a month I myself know that isnt enough sometimes even when you find someone else and with that ex still in the picture its probably a reminder. She did mention in addition to the divorce for not telling her friends about me is that she didnt want them to think of me as just a rebound because she didnt view me that way although as you mentioned I may in fact be that person now. We also did research ways for her or I to become a citizen via obtaining a green card and I know the reality that she may needed to have entered into marriage with me might of frightened her although she seemed to be warming up to the idea occurring further in the future.It the last couple of days we spoke I told her that I would do anything even if it meant giving her space that we could slow the relationship down and move at her pace. She knows all this and from what Ive gathered among my friends all I can do is wait for her to contact me.In your opinion would it be okay for me to send her a text saying I miss you after a week of no contact? I just feel as though I would eventually need a resolution or time frame as to when we could speak again and even though Im in no hurry to move on I would hope that she would eventually reach out and let me know what we are if we are still anything at that point and time. These are probably questions I should have asked her in that last skype session but I didnt want to make her any more stressed or worried about the situation than she already was.Lastly thank you for your response.

Unless things have changed since I looked as an yr old looking at moving to the US education is really really REALLY expensive. And Im guessing she doesnt work now or have any savings so without the help of her parents how is she going to pay for it? How is she even going to pay for a flight let alone visas and marriage licences and lawyers to fight for her immigration because marrying at  looks very dodgy? Can she not go to uni near her parents or slightly further away using student loans to help fund it if parents say no get a job to save up some cash ready for the future and maybe look into something like BUNAC for during the summer to get closer to you?

3673918,0,t1_cqb0p42,Youre right in that it is normal for couples in ldr to run out of things to talk about or for the excitement in the relationship to fade.  It is important for both of you to try to keep the excitement alive and not to force dead air when u run out of things to talk about.Sometimes calling just to say hi or ask how she is doing is enough and if there is nothing else to say hang up and carry on your day. No sense in forcing yourselves on the phone in silence and in essence conditioning yourselves to dread the next call.Theres nothing to keep the spark alive like showing her you are earnestly trying to make it work.  Vague suggestions of dinner doesnt always go so well. Have something concrete like Im cooking you something special next time I visit you etc etc or Ive booked us for a weekend at the lake for camping and canoeing. That way she can picture is it is something concrete youve spent effort on for Ber and most of all she can look forward to it.Sometimes she may feel distant because she feels you are.  Human beings are creatures of reciprocation.  When you show up with your energy and excitement for being with her she may well reciprocate the same feeling.Also its incredibly fortunate that in your ldr you can visit her so frequently.  Make the most of it! Bring flowers or other small romantic gestures.  Or if you want it to be a surprise try sending flowers on amazon!

3758732,0,t3_33ejnk,Bit late and not sure if itll help but here are my  cents.I too find it rude when people read my text and not respond immediately even more so if its coming from my SO. However you need to realise that just because you find it weird to open a text and not bother sending a reply doesnt mean that they feel the same way. I learnt this the hard way. I have a habit of responding to text ASAP regardless of where I am. Knowing my SO always has her phone beside her it is unlikely that when I send her a text she is not notified about it so I assumed that shes intentionally choosing not to respond to it which pissed me off. A lot. We argued over this a few times and finally I decided that Im just not gonna bother too much and guess what? It worked. My problem was the fact that I kept rushing things rushing to see her rushing to text her rushing to spend time with her etc even to the extent of rushing her to respond to my texts. I have been rushing the relationship for almost a year but having decided to not bother too much made me learn something ... whats the rush? Its not like as if there is quota for number of text a day to hit etc.Not bothering  not loving not bothering just means that shell respond when shes available  convenient to respond so I shouldnt think too much about it. If shes with her friends having lunch let her enjoy her lunch. You wouldnt want to have lunch with someone who keeps texting non stop instead of talking to you would you?Having taken a step back and take things slowly has made me a lot happier. TLDR Youre probably just thinking too much into it. I would recommend you to keep yourself occupied instead of waiting and thinking about when shes going to respond when doing so just makes you feel unhappy hence the difficulty in processing this information. Like I mentioned previously your SO will reply when shes ready to reply. She might just be unavailable at the moment and by unavailable it can also mean responding to someone elses text. Some people. like my SO. need to text finish one person before replying someone else otherwise jumping from text to text might cause them to forget what they wanted to say. Sorry for the extra long TLDR S,LongDistance,cqkq1ac,1,t5_2s6ky
3768234,0,t3_33k9aj,I think that trust is your biggest barrier here. You have to trust that your girlfriend is committed to you and that if any other guys make a move which its not guaranteed that they will she will know how to handle it. The best way that Ive found to do this is to have a fulldisclosure policy. So every time either of you has something that happens with a member of the opposite sex you say full disclosure and explain the situation and how you handled it. For example Hey full disclosure XX asked me to a movie today. I asked if it would be with a group of friends XX said it would be just the two of us. I told XX no that I wouldnt be comfortable doing that because I have a SO. I just wanted you to know! A short conversation reassuring your partner that while someone did give you the opportunity to stray you handled it well and are still  committed to your partner. My biggest advice though is to focus on you. Is it too late in the semester to drop a credit or two?  credits is a lot to take in your first year at college especially if youre in a tough major. If not try asking some people in your classes to meet up as part of a study group. During the study group get to know one another. Go out for drinks with them or since youre underage go out for coffee. Get a workout buddy and take advantage of your schools rec center. Join a majorspecific club or one pertaining to your interests!. You can easily grow to resent your relationship for not letting you have the full college experience. So dont let it! Get out there! Enjoy all the things your college has to offer! If your girlfriend is right for you shell support this change in focus.,LongDistance,cqlt1ib,2,t5_2s6ky

Now Im not suggesting that you ditch the relationship you have now just because its long distance.

I would think personally because you love him that you cant let him get away with that behavior. He cant change for you but he can change for himself. Sometimes it might take losing something or someone he loves to make it hurt enough to change. However if you do decide to stay with him which is a decision no one can make for you please create boundaries and protect yourself. If nothing else if hes being hurtful in anyway you could tell him and give him a chance to stop but if not the give him a consequence for his action i.e. leaving signing off telling him you need a little time asking him to type out his feelings instead of letting him yell or shout at you. It is unhealthy for you to to be treated like this and even if you dont stay with him we naturally look for someone familiar do something about this now so it doesnt become a pattern for you.  Remind him that he didnt naturally trust you off the break that youve earned it and  youve done nothing to warrant this.

Check to see if any airline has a hub near you and look at buying tickets from their website NOT from a travel companygoogle flightsanywhere else for far in the future dates. For reference we get   way so  total flights for me to fly up to see him with Jetblue.Being in an LDR is not about looking at tomorrow unless your end date is tomorrow or you see each other tomorrow but not the point its about looking at the future. This is incredibly hard for some people to grasp and even harder to see the point of. You are living for today but youre also living for that end date how ever far in the future it may be It requires a great deal of balance and its not easy.For some people its worth it for others its not. That is something no one but you can decide. To me long distance requires more than love. It requires a level of commitment that in person relationships cant match it requires planning and forethought it requires mentalemotional endurance to live through the todays to get to the end dates it requires trust that no matter where in the world that other person is they are yours completely. If you or your partner cant handle that dont try its more heartache than its worth.,LongDistance,crne1h0,2,t5_2s6ky

For instance if you believe the statistics that idealization of and subsequent discovery of negative information about the partner maybe thats something you can be wary of. It suggests that time spent together earlier on in the relationship can make it more robust by helping to set more realistic expectations of your partner. ,LongDistance,crsgkr5,1,t5_2s6ky

4186472,0,t3_38kaew,I communicate with my boyfriend in Japanese and English. We both arent native speakers in both languages but his Japanese is close to native level while Im pretty much fluent in English. However we do sometimes run into communication issues especially when I cant express myself properly in Japanese he gets confused and I try to explain it in English and he gets more confused D  It can be frustrating sometimes. But I try to see it as a chance to work on our communication. Due to the fact that were communicating in a language that is foreign to us both we need to actually make an effort in order to get important things across. We cannot solely rely on the fact that the partner will understand. I even sometimes feel that I have a better communication with him than with any previous boyfriend with which I communicated in my native language.  Judging from your post here your English is totally fine. Dont try to see only the downside. Its a chance for you as a couple to grow. Sure you will sometimes run into communication problems but lets be honest even couples communicating in their native tongue sometimes do. A relationship is work. To me the most important thing is to talk about communication issues. In a relationship with someone from another countryculture you need to be open and understanding and sometimes force yourself to ignore cultural and social cues that you have learned your whole life.   Dont give up! Its okay to be frustrated and sad and angry when you cant express what you want to express. But you shouldnt let that hold you back from an amazing experience. Take it as a chance to grow as an individual and as a couple. Good luck D,LongDistance,crxgjs3,2,t5_2s6ky

She deliberately lied to the guy about you guys breaking up so she could date him went to prom with him and in doing so ruined something she knew you wanted to do for her and for a month lied to you and dated the guy... And thats after your last visit. Theres a difference between getting drunk and sleeping with a guy then admitting so right away thats more understandable as there was no deliberation or planning and alcohol stripped one of their inhibitions but this was an entire month of lies and she knew damn well what she was doing.

4348667,0,t1_csfg269,I agree with this. You would think since we both speak English itd be easy but its not. I being Aussie joke about a lot of things he wouldnt and he says other things I wouldnt and many of the same words we use have different meanings in our respective countries. Were forever having to explain things to each other. So when in doubt clarify.We also try to raise any tiny issues as soon as theyre bothering us rather than let it brew into a shitstorm so we never have fights. If one of us doessays something to upsetdisappointwhatever the other we say I felt X when you said Y instead of brooding quietly.I also think its important to use I statements as above  rather than you made me feel like X and being accusatory. That worsens the situation.One final thing to note is that even when Im angry or upset at my SO I make a point to mention that I love him and I still want to be with him. We both come from previous relationships with trust issues so its easy for us especially me to think a disagreement means were breaking up. Id say I love you but Im really upset with you right now.

I know guys will only put in the time to contact you if they are genuinely interested but if all the times that he contacts you are sexrelated then thats probably all he wants. I can think of two ways that I would approach this situation one to confront him directly or two to just not reply or delete his contactblock his number. With the first you can get a definite answer to your question although it might be awkward if you run into him again however you did state that he moved away. With the second you dont have to have an awkward confrontation but he may keep bothering you. Feeling youre being used is never a healthy feeling and while youre not  sure if you are or not Im pretty sure you know the answer. The fact that youre not committed to each other and that nearly every interaction youre having is sexting should be some helpful evidence.Hope this helped.,LongDistance,csmr8b1,9,t5_2s6ky

4499884,0,t3_3cojfh,Hi.  Im not sure if this will help but I can understand exactly what youre going through.  My boyfriend broke up with me last night because he couldnt do the distance and it was burning him.  He said he knows himself and needs to have someone who can love him beside him physically.  I live in Europe and I am home for two months to see my familyfriends in the States.  He was away on study abroad for five months in another part of Europe from where I live and I went to visit him twice.  I stood by him when he was telling me every day how lonely and depressed he was feeling.  I did it because I really cared about him.  Yet now that Im in the States and have opened a few old wounds by being here he cannot stand by me.  I feel betrayed and abandoned.  Its easy for people to tell you and me that these guys dont deserve us that they are using us for convenient comfort and that we should just break up with them.  But I still really love my boyfriend and care about him and I understand you may too.  Its a complete lack of respect for him to leave you like that but I also dont know the context of your relationship.  So just wanted to write you a note to say that even if youre angryhurtconfused by what he did but you still feel like you lovecare about him youre not crazy.

Then once its approved there it gets sent to the NVC and all they are is the middle person. They get the petition assign it a new number and send it off to the embassy that your SO will have their interview. However once the petition reaches the NVC it becomes unique to you guys. No one will get the same questions and people with petitions going to other countries wont be able to help you. On the plus side people who go to the same embassy as you will be able to help out some with what to expect and such. Go to visajourney if you havent already and follow their guide. I submitted a lot of things with my petition but my friend ukikibozu submitted the bare minimum. What they really look for in the petition when you send it to the lockbox and it gets transferred is proof of meeting in the past few years. I submitted the reservations he made though they are under his name my tickets to him and his to me tickets of places we had been to movies on the tube even Burger King in London to correlate with the pictures I had sent. Photos in London Thorpe park Rhossili bay the doctor who experience the biltmore iHop etc. They like pictures with recognizable landmarks. I also submitted some of the texts we had sent each other which they probably vomited over cause they were obnoxiously cute from different points in our relationship. Most of them showed that we were on FaceTime calls that lasted for hours. Also write everything on the computer and sign in blue. But only sign in blue. If you write everything out use black but definitely sign in blue. Itll stand out more as an original signature from you. Once it reaches the NVC wait a week or two and then call. Theres another post on here with the number but Ill post it here.   is the number. You may have to call multiple times which is a pain in the ass but necessary.  I called during the busiest time of day today as I had work later on and wouldnt be home until ten. I will say this if you are planning a big wedding dont set anything in stone. You never know how long things will take and you dont want to lose out on money. Look at different places and see if they will work with you on short notice no matter how short notice it could be.

Sending each other things makes it more real. Another thing would be to slowly start planning your meet with her. Even if its far and not for sure its a good way to feel close.

Others feel guilty for never being home we spend  to  hours a day at school especially around finals or have SOs who make them feel guilty for always being busystressed out. However now that I think about it... these peoples SOs are working jobs and are no longer in school so it might be different if youre both students or something. I know my husband jokes about it being so much easier to deal with my stress from a distance not being directly exposed to my stress induced bitchiness all the time but I think its kind of true. Haha. I dont know its been pretty good for the both of us. Regardless of the pros and cons were both loving the opportunity to grow together apart if that makes sense.

Putting all of your emotional eggs in one basket is never a good idea because this happens when it doesnt work out. You need to focus on your life making yourself happy and bettering yourself. If you do that love will come and itll be much better I promise you.For a successful and loving relationship to happen it has to involve two happy healthy independent people coming together after realizing their lives will be that much better as one unit rather than two separate units.

5433806,0,t3_3pehsi,I do believe that your feelings for one another are real certainly. Im also glad that you can see this may not be the easiest situation and youre still going in with an open heart and mind.Im a bit familiar with some of Moroccan culture as Ive travelled there several times and have made a couple of lasting friendships with people from Morocco. The biggest factor here is probably religion how serious he is about it and how Westernised he is. Moreover its very important to understand his relationship with his family. You are from two very different and often contradictory cultures so youre both going to have to compromise quite a lot. Moroccan culture can be VERY aggressive and masculine theres a big cultural focus on individuals getting ahead at whatever cost. At the same time community and family are of utmost importance. Love a mans family and he will love you even more if the two cant coexist the girlfriend is going to be the one to go seen this countless times. As I said though it really depends on how deeply involved he is with his faith and the Moroccan culture. Ive known Moroccans who immerse themselves in video games and American culture and would love nothing more than to live in America forever. This is going to be a serious cultural clash no matter what.So yeah compromise and respect are going to be really important for both of you. Hell have to be okay with your own autonomy and independence and youll have to embrace his culture. Not sure how far along the line youre thinking I know you havent met yet but of course eventually one of you will have to leave your family and friends.

However I dont agree that a degree is absolutely necessary with the caveat that if you have a lot of work experience great references and can demonstrate a high degree of skill in your field. Especially with regard to tech companies hiring managers understand that theres a lot of talent which may not have university degrees. That doesnt mean I think you should drop out  I dont at all I think that would be a waste and your degree will definitely have value. I just know that you DO have the possibility to get a visa based on programming experience you just need to have some coding projects under your belt a portfolio and fluency in demanded languages.

Favorite snacks that he cant get on his side of the country like Red Vines! or Cajun food things since I live in LA  seasoningspicesgumbo amp jambalaya mix etc.. I like to send him silly socks because he loves them so I just look for the most outrageous things I can find. Ive sent him tshirts for my schools sports teams magazines that I thought hed think were cool books that I thought hed like crossword puzzles etc. Ive also made him little scrapbooks of pictures of us open when letters that kind of things. When hes deployed Ill also send him useful items like socks that are within uniform regs underwear any medicine he might need ecig juices deodorantbody wash nonperishable snacks stuff like that that he may not be able to get where hes at.Because it can be pretty expensive I just take my time putting things together and mailing them. I buy things as I go get groceries and stuff so its only a few dollars here and there instead of a bunch of money all at once.

If you know you dont want to lose her then you do have feelings about it. Feelings dont have to explode to be legit nor strong. And its not entirely surprising since you also have an equal weight of concerns.Relax. Let things happen naturally be yourself let her be herself and enjoy one another. Does she know about the mental health struggles you face? It is important to be open and honest with her and I know it isnt easy to discuss but letting her know what can happen sometimes and ways of dealing with it when it happens is a good way to have a partner who can deescalate situations when a mood swing hits and whatnot. I let my SO know that I often get swings of depression and that for me the best way to help is just to be there for me and not try to force me to cheer up but rather just walk alongside me through it. Im pretty good at turning them around if Im allowed to do so but when I feel forced I have a very stubborn side that says No! I wont just be happy because you tell me too. If Id never explained this to him it wouldve been bad for me and him.Also You and Your SO are going to have a bit of a cultural gap and it may be a little hard to see past it but you two would never have been on the same page entirely even without the gap as were all unique individuals. Just because you havent done something though doesnt mean you wont one day or that you two cant still get along just as well. What you can do is learn about her culture and teach her about yours. Even if you dont experience the same things you can learn about them and share your experience. And that will bring you two closer as well.

If you dont accept that behavior from yourself why would you accept it from somebody else?Thirdly you say he usually becomes withdrawn when you leave and this is not a good sign. It indicates that at least hes happy to recharge without you being here. For most people here their partner leaving makes them miss them even more not withdraw.Im not saying you should break up.

Personally I feel that an exit ticket i.e. as long as youre travelling OUT of the UK is enough to satisfy the immigration officials. Usually they will ask how long you plan to stay for and I think they do a quick match with the duration you mentioned when you produce your exit ticket. I feel that you can never be overprepared in terms of documentation so feel free to prepare a letter from your mum since that would provide additional assurance. I think it will be beneficial considering you dont have academicjob records. You may also wish to mention youre on a gap year to substantiate why you dont have academicjob records to show. I personally feel that Singapore is not a high risk country yay for the red passport! so immigration officials would not be too harsh on us  so long as your statements appear truthful you have sufficient funds to sustain your stay as well as an exit ticket in hand you should not face any difficulty entering the UK ,LongDistance,cywdzxr,1,t5_2s6ky

At first I was upset. Then I started worrying worrying worrying. Worrying that he got hit by a car worrying that hed died worrying that some other emergency came up. It got so out of control like I went to sleep at  PM and woke up twice during the night. The first time I couldnt fall back asleep for over an hour. The second time I had a nightmare that he died and it was scary because it felt so real. He didnt seem to understand at all why Id been so worried. Even worse he said hed gotten home later than expected and just didnt feel like talking to me. All it would have taken was five seconds you know? ,LongDistance,cz29aqd,3,t5_2s6ky

Religious issues might be a big one but at least its not something that youd have to tackle just yet. It doesnt sound like you need the stress of dealing with all of that just yet since it might take a while for him to be accepted.Focus on you for a while work out a strategy for how youre going to handle working and university. Maybe if you cant live at home anymore you might be able to stay with friends and split the living costs pick up more hours working or even cut back to part time study if you need to. That last part might suck yes. But you need to look out for you first just now.How are you going? Are you feeling a bit more optimistic today? You can PM me if you need to.

That would really cripple your future.You seem to think theres some explanation that will make Erins mother understand what its like to be a teenager in love. Shes smarter and more experienced in life than you both which is why she doesnt want you grooming her CHILD for a relationship with you. You are too old for her at this point in your lives. Edited to add I had a LDR myself when I was  we never met during the time we dated. I missed opportunities to date in the real world during the time we were together.

If her general attitude toward you is one of neglect then I can see this being a problem but its likely just a difference in how you two prefer to communicate. I dont like to answer texts unless Im willing and prepared to devote some time to a conversation. Im also not the type of person to update my partner on every little thing like if Im going out for the evening unless we were already in the middle of a conversation.

Everyone has their own stories I imagine and I wont bore you with mine all I will say is that its okay to hurt. Part of losing the person is losing all your plans for the future and feeling empty. We miss the person but also what we thought the future might be like with them. The only advice I can give you is this its okay to hurt its part of what makes us human. Its normal to feel very sad I wont use depressed because I think its a clinical condition that is too mis and over used but at the end of the day you will learn from it learn more about yourself from it and hopefully find someone even better. Their is no right or wrong way to be upset just know that what youre feeling isnt going to be this way forever and that the only thing that helps is time. Keep reminding yourself that.

She has a lot of difficulties she needs to work out.Second doctors need to be consulted. Professionals. Neither of you can make any psychological decisions for her it can be very dangerous if you guys tried to make any mental decisions for her. Third she is in a really serious position if you think she would commit suicide if she left. If shes ever said that to you if you leave Ill kill myself then thats a form of abuse. Being with someone with severe mental problems is incredibly difficult. While its true that everyone deserves love including those with mental troubles you need to take care of yourself. Your health and wellbeing come first. If you feel like leaving you need to. It definitely sounds like you need to go. If you think shes in danger you need to alert authorities. You need to let professionals handle this. You may want to consider professionals helping you out as well yes Im talking therapy for you. You are very young and have your whole life ahead of you.

Theres no shame in wanting that! I really identify with where youre coming from because before this VDay Id never had a boyfriend for it and always felt so bummed out about what I was missing out on. I also get not wanting him to spend money on you like this when hes flying out to see you so soon. A card isnt expensive though and writing a heartfelt letter costs less than . If its important to you to receive some token of affection on Valentines Day in the future you can say something like Hey I know Valentines Day is really commercialized but it would mean so much to me to get something from you on that day. It doesnt have to be anything big I would really be happy with a card and a letter. The same idea goes for birthdays etc. If you like getting gifts you like getting gifts and it DOES matter so go ahead and let him know how you feel.

There will be brighter and happier places. you just have to keep going and leave this one behind.You mentioned not wanting to see a therapist because of a bad previous experience. Sometimes theres a mismatch between doctors and their patients. Theyre people too and that happens. I encourage you to look into options to try seeing a different therapist if that one didnt work out for you. Learning to cope with these thoughts and feelings is important and the right therapist can help guide you in overcoming the mental obstacles. Congratulations on your weight loss! I dont doubt that its a huge change to drop that much weight and you must have been very disciplined to drop half your weight. Keep on it and maybe you can try to channel some of your feelings into an exercise that makes you happy. Some people like to run to appreciate the beauty of the world around them and clear their head. Personally my knees hurt with the high impact and I prefer to swim for the same reasons its almost like turning my brain off when I get in the rhythm of it.

What kind of work would you be looking for her to do in the UK? If youre only planning for her to be staying for a year its unlikely to do much to advance her career it seems unfair of you to ask her to her waste that time careerwise while you advance yourself.

Think about it this way if she doesnt like you in that way whats the point in investing your emotions into a relationship with someone who doesnt feel the same way?

6787965,0,t3_48prmd,We met in my college town after we both graduated and decided to take a gap year. We were both hired to work in a childrens clinic at the same time. I was in an unhappy relationship at the time and though I was naturally attracted to his personality and character I tried to stay distant from him.When I broke up with my previous partner five months after we met he waited a few weeks and then asked me out. We proceeded very tentatively at first knowing that hed move for grad school about three months later. I was also still pretty upset about the break up. We ended up really fitting each other and after a month started taking things fastertrying to fit in dates every day until he left. Initially we agreed it wouldnt last past the summer.But by the time he was about to move we were kind of hooked on each other.  I assumed I was just infatuated and it would wear off but it didnt seem like itd be too big of a deal if I visited him in his new city once. Or twice. Maybe he could visit me. Eight months later I guess I actually love him a fair bit. I just got into his grad school for my program and pending the financials work out in my favor pray for scholarship dollars Ill be joining him in August. Im kind of scared of counting on it happening but I have a lot of hope and Im terribly glad to have met him.,LongDistance,d0lpck3,4,t5_2s6ky

6822950,0,t3_495tfr,My boyfriend  left for college out of state last fall while I was left in state F. Its definitely difficult but no where near impossible! The best advice I can give is to set a Skype day. There are people who Skype more frequently some even every day but for us setting aside Sunday to Skype was extremely helpful. It gives you something to look forward to throughout the week helps you avoid conflict if youre busy during the week which you likely will becollege is a busy time and still allows you to have your own lives and enjoy the college experience. Speaking of the college experience the other advice I would recommend is discussing what both of you want to get out of your experiences. Talk about these expectations early to avoid jealousydrama if say one of you wants to go to parties and the other isnt sure how they would handle it. The most important things I think are to make a game plan to how youre going to balance your personal lives and your relationship and talking about EVERYTHINGeven the really hard stuff. What happens if one of you cheats inevitable attraction to other people whats enough for you how you handle each situation etc. Its really hard to talk about but its SO important and will really help you down the line. Most importantly just remember that while its really hard and scary you have a person that loves you enough to take on the difficulties  and theres no better feeling than coming home and falling in love all over again. Good luck! Feel free to message me for any questions or advice always love hearing from other high school to college couples! Youre definitely not in this alone,LongDistance,d0pohso,1,t5_2s6ky

6959284,0,t3_4awg3o,Seems like people in this thread arent attempting to give you any benefit of the doubt here. I havent read any of your past posts but...As someone who has recently closed the gap with my SO from different continents I can relate to the meeting someone appealing online part and having a lot of good vibes to go along. I was inexperienced in relationships but felt I had the maturityresolve to handle anything that could come up. Which to me sounds similar to how you describe yourself.Going off what you wrote here I think youre smart enough to figure out if this guy is worth your time or not. You didnt give me any red flags as it sounds like youre wanting to be careful and respectful of everyones concerns... I think thats good for what its worth. As always communication is important in every relationship but more so in long distance as youve probably already concluded.About the age. Well its steep sounding but my parents are also  years apart and met at similar ages as you and your SO. One thing I havent seen addressed here about this is everyone is assuming this guy has exactly  years of the adult world under his belt. As I saw you mention it also appears he has been studying most of his adult life. I myself am  and am still studying but by no means feel like Im this mature  year old people think of in their heads. To me it sounds like you both are entering the next stage of your lives approximately around the same time and so maturity levels are roughly similar between you two.With all of that said... I think many of the other comments though sort of condescending in a certain angle bring up some good points as well. Take all the advice in and youll figure out what is best for you.Cheers!,LongDistance,d156461,1,t5_2s6ky

Some people need to let it out some want to get their mind off it and replace it by positive emotions so talking about it more and having to explain things just saddens them even more. Dont judge him by the way you are even if you have a lot of similarities in your habits this one is clearly different because youre still different people. If youre bothered so much by the way you communicate problems talk to him about it another time when hes in a calm mood. Tell him how you feel and what you need when youre troubled ask him how he feels. Hopefully it helps you both understand each others needs better and make you more confident when he doesnt come to you for sympathy.,LongDistance,d1a6x08,4,t5_2s6ky

7254478,0,t3_4eryro,I agree with the advice of the other poster keep yourself busy find stuff to do. A week really will fly by if youve got other stuff e.g. friends and family work and hobbies to keep you occupied. However I know you dont want to hear this but this level of dependency youre showing is quite unhealthy. Needing your partner to be there with you on skype to the point where youre considering seriously or not getting drunk to pass the timedull the pain thats unhealthy. Living in the present and future as you said doesnt require someone to be around you  it requires you to be enjoying your life. If you cant enjoy your life without them around you need to be seriously reconsidering what youre doing. Even when you close the distance they cant be around you all the time and then and especially now you need to have your own life. You may not think it would happen but god forbid something happens to ruin your relationship in the future what will you do then if youre this dependent?To be able to know a relationship will work you need to know you can also live and enjoy life independently and know that your SO is just a great addition to an otherwise great life. Using them as a crutch is just a recipe for unhappiness and masks anything that may be not ideal about the relationship amongst causing other problems like the one youre experiencing now where being unable to skype them feels like the end of the world.,LongDistance,d22s68o,6,t5_2s6ky

7278299,0,t3_4f35lb,Making money quickly is not something you can legitimately do especially at the age of . Theres a reason we all work for a living  money cant just be made at the click of a finger. Youre going to need to work whatever job youre allowed to work to make it. And its going to take a while. Put whatever youve got right now first if you have exams coming or assignments or whatever theyre your priority. Earning money will have to be done in your spare time and it will be difficult. Im a private tutor and a university student and even at the rates private tuition pays me it takes me months to save up for a trip because I only have a certain amount of time to spare to do it.To save money on trips  find your flights on matrix ita google it  its a google search engine and tends to find the cheapest flights. The other options are skyscanner often worth checking Skyscanner to look for cheap flights that may not be on matrix ita but generally theyre more expensive and kayak. Also being flexible with dates of flying out is best but I imagine youll still be in school so youll likely be flying in peak season when its the school holidays.However Id also emphasise that  is a lot of money especially at your age without trying to sound patronising. Youre young and its very likely that your age and the amount of growing you need to do will be a huge barrier to this relationship succeeding so you need to decide whether its worth it before blowing a load of money on a trip to see her. You seem to be in a rush to raise the money dont be in such a rush. This is a very mature thing youre trying to do and you need not to take the decision lightly. Its a lot of money.Also the UK can be expensive. You need to factor in costs of living here or costs of going out etc. That  on flights will quickly become well over  when adding on costs of coming here depending on what you plan on doing here.

7543888,0,t3_4imrjd,I can kinda relate. Ive been doing long distance with my bf for about a year now including the first three months when we were actually together most of the time in the same country. Im not exactly sure what problems you have or what youve done to upset her but heres my situation. When we first started dating when we were actually together we never had any fights and when he had to go back to school aka when we started doing long distance we started having fights most of them arent anything too major but I became very controlling I saw his differences as flaws and wanted him to change to become more like me. When we were finally together again winter break we were fine we were more than great actually no fights whatsoever and we were more connected than before. However once he went back to school and once I found out that he sort of cheated on me got black out drunk and kissed a girlgot a bit flirty with his past hookup via chats once it all went downhill. For the past few months we have been working on trust issues and I know that he is really trying very hard to be an open booktransparent I still have my doubts and wanted to end things with him at times. Im hoping that this summer we will get to fix everything and I can finally have more trust in him it will be our first time seeing each other again after finding out he had fucked up. SOOO perhaps she has similar fearsthinks the same? Not sure exactly what the backstory is here so yeah sorry if this is kinda random hah,LongDistance,d2zpbvv,1,t5_2s6ky

I had a best friend not my boyfriend but it was very similar lets call him John and at that time I met someone else lets call him Paul.I really cared for John but I started falling for Paul. John would text me and I would answer  minutes later because I was lost in a conversation with Paul. Truth is I WAS interested in John and I cared for him but he started to annoy me with all the texts of why are you not answering???.Obviously it didnt end well for me and John. What Im trying to say is if you were really the first priority of your girlfriend she will never make you wait like that or get mad like this. You dont deserve a relationship like this. As someone else said give her an ultimatum. She either shows you youre important to her or youre out. It is so much better to cut it now than to spend days and days thinking did I do something wrong? why is she not texting me?.Best of luck.,LongDistance,d31p5en,1,t5_2s6ky

In terms of jobs I dont plan on looking until Im closer to graduation. I know for a lot of people its probably scary to decide to move without finding a job first but its just how its working out for me. I would say my biggest piece of advice is to just figure out what is going to work best for your own relationship whether its you moving to him him moving to you or you both moving to a new place and then just go for it. Start looking at potential places to live jobs collegesuniversities etc. and after you have a good idea of what would work for you start reaching out to apartment complexes jobs and such so you can begin the process and be with your SO as soon as possible.

My now fianc and I were long distance for a year and a half met while studying abroad and then both moved back to our the US him in Boston and me in DC and then I moved up to Boston for  years where we closed the distance during the school year and were long distance for the summers. My last summer he started med school mid way through and I was at a summer job that kept me pretty busy so we both had a lot of other stuff going on. He didnt miss me as much as usual and broke up with me and then a week later realized that what he had been feeling was just a phase and it ended up fine eventually got back together and were now engaged and will hopefully be closing the distance for good next May.

When she restarts college her boss will have to decrease her hours back to her original  or so days a week so I personally didnt see the issue in her havingasking for her original hours back for those two weeks after the two weeks she took off. Health wise Ive been behind that for a while now. Ive been constantly telling her she needs to take a break and even ask for a few days off. She barely gets time for herself anymore  which isnt just straining her hip but also her mentality. Shes become less positive and vibrant and more drainedaggressive. The added stress from college and the lack of any pure breathing time I can tell is absolutely tooth grinding for her. Of course the reality to life is work  but I just feel like as shes been constantly at it over the past year with school and stress etc she really needs a solid amount of time off  and thats not just for my own personal gain.

If so this isnt her fault and you need to remember that. Its your issue to fix. Its a lot about mindfulness  has she given you a reason not to trust her? If not remind yourself of that. If its because shes given you a reason not to trust her thats her fault and will be different but Im assuming now she hasnt. Figure out what would make you feel better within reason and talk to her about it. I know that when my husband and I go out we make sure to let the other person know the general who and where and we always call each other when we get home to let the other know we made it safely. Dont try to stop her from going this will lead to resentment and when she does go dont blow up her phone or do any of those guilt trippy things that controlling boyfriends do i.e. making rules and calling them guidelines.

8466497,0,t3_4v0no6,Hi! My bf  and I  are  hours apart and headed into our second year of distance due to college. The biggest thing that helped us last year was talk about EVERYTHING even the hard stuff. How will you handle attraction to other new people? What are your boundaries for parties for making friends of the opposite sex etc. Make a plan for how you will keep in touch. My bf and I Skype every Sunday and text throughout the week sometimes calling each other on our way to class. But his roommate was on FaceTime with his girlfriend practically nonstop. Find what works best for the two of you but remember that your relationship shouldnt keep you from enjoying college as well. Theres absolutely no reason why you shouldnt be able to keep the girl you love from high school but also dont let that keep you from making new friends That being said just a tip for the coming few weeks the first few weeks of college are very very busy and will be for both of you. Youll be having a lot of information thrown at you youll be meeting more new people than you can count and youll be being tossed from orientation activity to orientation activity. Im not going to lie that part was really hard. My boyfriend was almost never around that first week or so snd it was kind of painful to see him having so much fun without me. They even gave a presentation about why students shouldnt stay with their high school sweethearts that one was a dagger haha BUT just remember that youre going through these new experience separately but still together. Youre going to grow even closer by learning more about each other and sharing so many new fun stories. Have faith in your love and your relationship and stay strong no matter what others say. As long as you can find a balance thats right for you and not let your relationship get in the way of school or school get in the way of your relationship youll be more than okay. Youre both going to be busy sometimes. Youre both going to get jealous occasionally. There are going to be ups and downs there are going to be doubts but its all okay and all part of the process. The most important thing is you have a love worth waiting for and you will always have someone looking out for you and someone to come home to.Other little things that work for us sending care packages writing letters taking a TON of selfies while were together keeping a countdown app on our phones. Were going to try to watch Netflix together this year too. There are ways to make distance fun! Enjoy your week together good luck at school and remember distance is only temporary.

8661225,0,t3_4yj02m,First Im so sorry that youre going through this. This is probably your first serious adult relationship and thats always a hard one to get over because you havent had to go through it before.In my personal opinionexperience taking a break is never a good idea in a relationship. A strong relationship is about working through things together and supporting each other. If one partners reaction to strife is to need to break up for awhile thats not a good sign that it will work out long term and how will you know theyre not going to ask for more breaks in the future? You need a partner you can count on to be there for you always. Most often people ask for a break because they want to break up but lack the courage to just do it and think theyre being kind by sort of easing you into it. In reality it puts you in the position of not having all the good things you get from a relationship while holding you back from moving on and finding those things elsewhere. Its like being stuck in limbo. She moved to the opposite side of the world to leave everything behind. That everything unfortunately included you.Advice for recovering from a break up is pretty universal. Keep yourself busy spend time with people who care about you and take care of yourself. Let yourself feel sad but dont let it totally consume you. I know its one of the worst feelings in the world but I promise it gets better with time. ,LongDistance,d6o9qqq,4,t5_2s6ky

On top of that sweeping statement most guys prefer to avoid direct conflict so it really sounds as though he was using the chain length as an excuse to not wear the necklace.The necklace isnt the key issue to me though. Im not liking the fact he didnt do anything for your birthday even when you asked. I think you should really take a few days off to gather your thoughts and not argue then have a video call and tell him that you were disappointed by his lack of effort. How you move forward would then depend on his response.Hope you feel better! Try to take your mind off things go for a walkrun to clear your head  ,LongDistance,d6p12fr,7,t5_2s6ky

She can work part time and with financial assistance she should be able to afford a single bedroom with or without roommates in  of citiestowns in the USA. Moving international right now is a bad idea. Also how long have you guys been dating?

And even my husband is deployed its one of the few things I can do to let him know Im thinking about him etc. He tends to buy me things randomly off my amazon wish list. Its just because of how we express that we love each other together and from a distance. It might be your girlfriends love language to give gifts or to do things rather than expressing her love in other ways. It may NOT be how you express your love  maybe youre more of a words person or physical affection. If she knows that and you know that I think theres nothing wrong with not sending gifts at all or not sending gifts frequently. If shes expressed that she isnt bothered by not getting things from you Id trust her on that. On the other hand if you do want to send her something it doesnt have to be some huge creative endeavor. Pay attention when she talks about things she wants or needs and just surprise her with it! Thats why my husband likes my amazon wish list haha. ,LongDistance,d758cwe,3,t5_2s6ky

Its just one visit your problem of distance putting a strain on things is still there. Also...

She obviously doesnt want me to go but she wants me to be happy and successful. There is also the idea of coming back to Canada together so there is that. but it comes down to you being an adult that doesnt really need to have your mothers permission to move though I can see why it is hard. Tell your mother you love her but you need to be with your partner. now seeing as she wants you to have a ring on your finger is that an option?

8919824,1,t3_52ek22,Any tattoo artist will tell you not to do this.Quite simply a tattoo is permanent and your relationship might not be. Yes Im sure youre very sure that this relationship is the one thats going to last forever. Maybe it even will. But everyone thinks their current serious relationship is the forever one and yet many end. Will you want a constant reminder on your body if things dont work out?Tattoo artists will even tell you that relationship tattoos are a bad idea beyond the permanency  apparently theyre actually a strong indicator that the couple will not stay together. Apparently more often than not someone who gets a relationship tattoo will eventually come back to have it covered up. Why this is the case is open to speculation but a common hypothesis is that people do it as a way to demonstrate commitment when a relationship is on shaky ground to try to preserve it.As relationship tattoos go coordinates arent too bad  its not super obvious what they mean. But youll always know and it will always be there unless you get it removed or covered up.If youre dead set on getting tattoos together Id recommend something thats mutually meaningful to both of you but that doesnt have to do with your relationship. Something like a nautical tattoo if youre both into sailing stuff like that. That way if you break up it can still be something meaningful to you without necessarily being about your exrelationship.At any rate Id recommend posting this in rtattoo or rtattoos rather than rlongdistance since it really has a lot more to do with the tattoo than the LDR itself.

Well I met many people of course but then my SO messaged me. It started off as just talking about our cultures amp then we started to snapchat. Then I downloaded a texting app so we could talk through out the day. I was so interested in her amp she clearly was with me as well. Well fast forward a few weeks amp I started texting her directly from my phone. Then we started calling then facetiming etc. etc. every night. My SO is French amp Im American both young amp in our s. Its was shocking to me because I was in a relationship for almost  years with a girl I thought I could really trust amp ended up living with her for a year before she cheated on me. I was single for almost  years after her amp I broke up. I was set on being single for a long time. I had no intentions on meeting anyone hell.. Ive never even dated online before. I found the damn needle in the haystack though. Ive never felt so great about myself amp Ive never met someone with such great intentions for me. Who finally sparked the flame in me. I feel comfortable telling her ANYTHING amp I feel comfortable just being myself with her. About about a couple weeks ago she accidentally slipped up amp told me she loved me when we were having a little disagreement. Now I would never impulsively react in a situation like this Ive only told one previous person before her that I loved them. So I dont just throw I love yous out like its trick or treat or something but I told her it back because I meant it. Its crazy to me how I feel these feelings when I have yet to actually meet her in person but I cant help how I feel. Weve never actually said hey lets just date it was more of a bond that started to form amp now we call it cheating on each other amp thats beautiful. Were not labeling ourselves but just going with our feelings amp I can honestly say.. that is my best friend. It was something small that became the world to me. The hardest part is the  hour time difference amp the  miles that separate us but......... I lucked out. I only have to wait  more months amp shell be studying abroad here in the US for  years. Shell only be about a  hour drive away so we will at least see each other every weekend!!! Its crazy how small this world is. Its even crazier to think that the person I love is  miles away yet Im closer to her than Ive been to anyone Ive talked todated. The best advice I have is.. if its meant to be amp you guys are strong enough to make it through the time gap then thats real. If you can fall for someone who you only get to have an emotional relationship with thats strong. Everything happens for a reason. Were all in a LDR for a reason. Our love just so happens to be on the other side of the world. I hope everyone the best! ,LongDistance,d7vkqwn,2,t5_2s6ky

The police and health checks should be fine as she has only lived in Vietnam and is healthy. I have kept old plane ticket stubs to show that I have been there we have lots of photos and are in contact daily with Skype and whatsapp. Hopefully its only  months of evidence needed as we will only have been together  year as of Jan  . Weve known each other a year prior but only a couple starting this year and are both comfortable moving at a faster pace than most relationships. Is much evidence needed for a prospective marriage visa? We plan to marry in October in Vietnam. Her brother coowns a wedding planning business and Id like for him organise our wedding as he seems to do a good job of it looking at his previous works. Would I just need invoices from venues and other businesses to show that the planning is legitimate and actually under way?

Chances are this wont get better especially since youve already made your feelings known and she has manipulated you and carried on with behaviour that she knows is incredibly upsetting to you.You said that she misses the spark of a new relationship. Youre making excuses for her there and what do you think will happen the longer you stay together? If shes already acting like this pretty much instantly when you can consider yourself out of the honeymoon period do you really think her behaviour will change as you get more and more settled into a relationship?Dont equate anything to age. Dont make excuses for someone based upon their age. What shes doing is immature hurtful and manipulative. My advice would be to lay out your feelings on the table.

9360014,0,t3_58oz3x,Im not sure if this might help but you can try asking him to send you some short videos of himself whenever he has the time. This might help you to miss him less as you get to see his face and secondhand experience things that are going on in his life. An added bonus is that you can keep these videos so you can view them again in the future when you severely miss him.Another idea is to ask him the next time you see him to wear a shirt lightly for a few times and give it to you when he leaves. This would impart his scent onto the shirt and you could cuddle up and sniff it when you go to sleep. It helps too if he wears a specific cologne you could buy a bottle and spray it onto the shirt after his scent is gone.

You went from a  hour difference to a  hour difference.Today your pm Sunday was your partners am Monday. The furthest your partner could possibly be from you is bang on the other side of the planet and that would be exactly  hours time difference. A larger time difference is not physically possible on this planet as it is physically impossible to be any further away.  hours is the longest possible time difference! In other words if you have circled half the planet and keep going youre getting closer to your starting point again. In that way the way the sun goes across the sky is no different from you walking the distance.

Shes very comfortable with her sexual self now as Im sure she wasnt at one point. So now she might be thinking why not.

10198593,0,t3_5m13yb,I dont think this is an LDR issue or even a relationship issue but a mental health issue.  Our selfimage affects our life very deeply and can have lasting effects on relationships sure but its not the relationships that need fixing its our view of ourselves.And you recognize that thats the issue here  its nothing to do with your relationship but how you view yourself affecting your reaction to the relationship.  So ending the relationship or altering it in any way really is not going to change that unless hes doing something directly to hinder your progress.  But if its a healthy relationship youve given no real info on this front so Im just going to move forward assuming it is he wants you to feel confident with yourself and should be willing to support you in improving this.Have you talked about it with him?  Whats his reaction?  If he reacts negatively telling you that youre right or that he would prefer if you lost weight etc. then thats a huge issue and hes not being good to you at all.  But if he shows support of you being happy and offering to help you reach your goal in a healthy manner and to support you in any way he can then utilize his support  thats one thing hes there for.But reacting to a negative self imagine by ending relationships and essentially hitting a panic button is definitely not the answer  seek help either from friends and family doctors or a mental health specialist to figure out the root of the problem and work toward feeling good about yourself setting realistic goals and making plans to stick to them.,LongDistance,dc02fkv,4,t5_2s6ky

10365741,0,t1_dci4160,Yeah we had talked about it and agreed we were just going to let it happen. Having said that our first time came around because of a misunderstanding on my half.Backstory In the weeks leading up to our first meeting my bf told me he was planning to give me a back massage as soon as we got to his place because I had to take some really long flights to get there. When we went up to his room he started taking his suit off to get more comfortable to give said massage but I got the wrong idea and thought he was getting naked for sexy time so I made a joke about him getting undressed really slowly and that Id thought he be more eager to get on with it. Two seconds later he was nude he tore my pants off and that was that.As silly as it sounds I honestly wouldnt change it for the world. It kinda helped set the tone for our sex life  I like that we dont take it too seriously and can have fun and make jokes because before him I was super uncomfortable with most sexual contact but he really helped me move past that.,LongDistance,dcj0ous,3,t5_2s6ky

10377669,0,t3_5ol6xs,gtShe cant see herself ever moving to the US to be with me and I would find it very challenging to go to South Africa to be with her.Thats really all there is to it. If youre never going to close the distance an LDR is pointless.Even if that wasnt the case your situation would be pretty improbable anyway. At your age I assume you dont have the kind of income that can actually fund international travel and relocation and probably wont for years so even if you did want to close the distance doing so wouldnt be very realistic.gtIm not sure if it was a petty decision to make.Entirely the opposite. Ending a relationship because it has no possibility of going anywhere is about as far from petty as it gets. I know it sucks but you made a mature wellreasoned decision. I would suggest not secondguessing it.gtWith that in mind is it worth trying to resurrect the relationship?No. Feelings are secondary theyre the bonus you get to enjoy when things work out. But they dont do anything to make things work out  they dont buy plane tickets they dont obtain travel visas they dont provide job opportunities at the destination. An LDR cant work without those things regardless of what the feelings are.This was never really going to work and it still wont work if you try to resurrect it.,LongDistance,dckdf7j,3,t5_2s6ky

10435841,0,t3_5pdghn,I was so nervous when my boyfriend and I were going to meet for the first time. We met in October after we started talking in January. I have really bad social anxiety and I have never been close with anyone like I had been with him. I went to pick him up at the airport ran a little late since it was in a city I had never been to and the airport wasnt  minutes away from the hotel it was  because of construction. I walked in and saw him texting on his phone and I hid at first because I was so anxious.I was very quiet at first and he understood that and he was very patient. I told him I was trying and he understood. When you go to see her or she comes to see you dont go back somewhere to be alone at first. Go do something together that makes you talk to her. Go to a zoo. Go to dinner. Dont go to a movie right away. Its going to be awkward at first since you two have never been near each other physically before. The biggest and best advice I can give you is dont focus so much on the fact that you arent saying a lot. Dont focus on that you dont have anything to say. Just start small. You will feel a lot more comfortable as you guys spend more time together. My boyfriend and I played word games when we first met because it helped break the ice. Its baby steps. It will get better as you go on I promise.,LongDistance,dcqz0j4,2,t5_2s6ky

However we do discuss the subject like what is problem and reassuring one another that we are progressing on fixing the situation together. He is asking a lot of patience from me sex is very important aspect for me and easily a deal breaker but he acknowledges this at least on some level. This mutual respect and understanding is crucial on dealing with this without growing enormous amounts of resentment. Having some heart to heart conversations might help you too as someone else said already too. I would recommend telling in the least judgemental way you can how this makes you feel.

Im like you in that the long distance hurts me but I know getting this education and working in my chosen field will be worth it.

The first  months of our LDR we would talk about NSFW constantly and Id send him saucy photos constantly.  The first couple of times I stayed with him we were averaging sex at least twice a day.  It was amazing for me because Id previously been married to someone who refused to have penetrative sex or any sex with me towards the end of our relationship.Now at ten months I honestly feel like a total pervert because I legit think about having sex with my SO constantly.  But he doesnt seem to really indulge me over text anymore aside from yeah me too or confirming that Im hotsexy.  Its pretty tame.  And last time we were together IRL he would only have sex with me if I initiated.  But I felt odd initiating more than once a day.  I dont know if Im just sensitive because of what happened in my marriage the slow death of any intimacy.  But I really need him to just have zero self control and come at me when he is here next week.

After him basically telling you multiple times that he only wants to be friends if you come at him with plans of LDR and moving to live near him youre probably going to freak him out and ruin your friendship.gtI dont know how he feels but its definitely not as deep as meThat seems painfully obvious. Everything youve said about him not wanting to be more than friends only because of distance has seems like or I assume in it. The rest just flat out is him saying he only wants friendship from you.Sometimes people just say what they mean and theyre not covering up hidden feelings. Take his words about being just friends at face value.If you go through with this visit I would quash down any hope of it turning into a long distance relationship and if you cant do that I would recommend you not go. Tell him that you know you feel stronger than him and you need some space to get over those feelings before you can continue with a friendship,LongDistance,df0vvij,7,t5_2s6ky

11245390,0,t3_60gxjv,Hi! Im f and also in a long distance relationship and I would really like to help you. First off. Youre very very young.  right into college across the country in a long distance relationship thats was a complete secret is a lot for anyone. And please dont stop reading because I called you young. Im not trying to be condescending at all. But scientifically the amount of hormones affecting your body right now at this age is against you. And her.  not matter how amazing and accomplished she is is waaaay too young to handle this kind of stress. And shes already lashing out at you. Especially considering what you wrote about spring break. And at her age with her busy life and her strict parents disapproval this relationship you have is incredibly unstable. But Im I not worried about your girlfriend since she isnt the one who wrote this post. Im worried about you. You have adjustment disorder? I have social anxiety. I can emphasize with you and whats going on in your head. I sincerely hope you are getting the help you need and continuing therapytreatment. I just started getting hell and I finally am starting to feel okish. Its a work in progress. And youll need the extra support to help cope with what could be in the future for you. You are depending on your girlfriend for happiness that she is not capable of giving you. Shes may be amazing and mature and great but shes still a  year old girl who is psychologically unable to meet your needs. Maybe when shes older and youre older but not now. You say you lavish attention on her but its onesided? She really cant give you what you need. No relationship can. The confidence security and love youre looking for comes from yourself first. A relationship helps sure. But you need to like you first. You keep assigning yourself blame that doesnt belong to you. Are you always right? No. Youre not. Is she always right? You seem to think so but she most definitely isnt. She shouldnt be cursing at you. Telling you that somethings wrong with you. No. Shes old enough to know how to speak to people. Especially someone she cares about. But since you blame yourself youve made it ok for her to blame you too.  When you remove her from the pedestal you placed her on you can have an honest heart to heart with yourself  about where this is going. And I think youre afraid of what youll find. Outside of your relationship the self blaming because I guarantee you do this in more instances than your relationship the late nights the dropping everything thats important to you  that all needs to stop. Your health physical and mental is the most important thing for you to focus on. You need to be good for yourself before youre good for anyone else. Which is harsh I know. But it took me until I was  to even consider this and I cant tell you how much I and people I love have suffered from my anxiety. I dont want you or anyone to go through that type of pain. Please feel free to message me here or pm me with any questionscommentsrants telling me where to go. Whatever you need.  ,LongDistance,df6ncf7,4,t5_2s6ky

There comes a time when future will need to be discussed and if you are ready to take the next step then it is better to share that with him now. Who knows maybe he is feeling the same way?

Ive had friends from the U.S. travel to Europe and have either zero reception or really high roaming rates. If your SO connects to WiFi instead of using data she can avoid this.

11292507,0,t3_615i2p,Hello! Im American and have traveled to London a lot.Credit cards are what I often use abroad but be aware that it can sometimes be slightly inconvenient using credit cards as you have to sign and lots of people working in shops arent really used to that since theyre used to chipandPIN cards rather than chipandsignature ones. I would check if your bank account has foreign transaction fees most seem to but some dont and if your credit card has foreign transaction fees. Discover doesnt have fees but also is not really accepted there so use a MasterCard or Visa card. I use a Capital One card and the new AmazonChase credit card because they dont have foreign transaction fees. If you decide to take cash out at an ATM try to do it all at once instead of doing many withdrawals. It asks you if you would like to withdraw in dollars or pounds. I always tell it pounds because my bank gives a better exchange rate than the ATM does but it might depend on your bank. If you do a currency exchange I think that you often get better rates by booking it online. Ive also heard that John Lewis is okay for this but havent used that myself. Another idea is to transfer money to your SOs account with Transferwise or a similar service and then just withdraw the cash from their account when youre there. Ive done this with my girlfriend because her bank has lots of fees.Make sure the things youre plugging into your travel adapter have transformers like phonelaptop chargers do or they could blow up since the voltage is different. Lots of things have transformers but dont bring a hair dryer or hair straightener or anything as itll blow up unless you get an expensive voltage converter. Depending on how long youre going to stay you may want to check if your phone is unlocked and then get a cheap payasyougo SIM card. Theyre really convenient especially for Google Maps. Get an Oyster card when you arrive as youll need it for transportation throughout your stay. Most people with UK accounts can just tap their card instead on buses but you will need an Oyster card for buses because most US cards dont work on them. It also lets you get cheaper fares on the tube and trains. I would also say that if youre looking for a cheap flight its sometimes cheaper to fly into other European cities like Copenhagen Stockholm Dublin or other travel hubs and then get a cheap Ryanair flight over to London.I hope you have fun! ,LongDistance,dfbzms2,2,t5_2s6ky

I tried to break the silence by asking him oh hey did I tell you about the news of a jogger getting shot in the butt about a week ago? Yeah. Didnt go too well that first time. But then we decided to give it another go later on that same day and it went fine. Like we were never ever awkward to begin with.You just have to expect that itll be awkward the first time around. Its good to prepare some topics to have a conversation on as well.  ,LongDistance,dfe4mqi,3,t5_2s6ky
11322408,0,t3_61l5l0,I find myself in a similar situation except I knew her for a few months but ended hooking up only a week before her academic exchange was over. We were completely different people but the connection was so intense we decided to keep in touch not in a relationship but see where things might go.We text nearly every day but she has a much busier life than I do that we dont talk enough to sustain the emotional connection. I make an effort to stimulate conversation get to know her story but she doesnt do the same and it feels one sided. All she does is say she misses me which makes me happy but the lack of deeper conversations is frustrating.Fast forward  months and shes coming back for a week not just to be with me but also to visit friendsfamily. We decided to discuss how to move forward at the end of the week so we can decide whether its worth the trouble. But during these past  months the lack of common interests or any effort on her part already makes me  sure this relationship wont work out for long and so at this point Im left wondering why bother rekindling the emotions in the first place if well probably have to get over each other at the end of the visit.Life is an unfair bitch when we seem to meet the perfect person circumstances like distance always get in the way. We feel like we may never meet someone better which makes us inclined to waste our efforts and personal savings to sustain an impossible ordeal. But if other peoples stories have taught me anything its that there are in fact people out there who are just as good if not better and stopping our lives for a couple years during our prime which to me is our s so we can hold off to maybe be with someone in the future is clearly not the way to find them. Even though I say this and can rationally see the better option is to move on Im just too afraid to do it knowing how Id feel at a loss. Well see how it goes at the end of my female friends visit.Anyway sorry for that huge block of text and for using your topic to vent. Maybe it will help you decide or at least provide some empathetic comfort. Best of luck to you and Id very much like to know how things turn out.,LongDistance,dffdjc4,1,t5_2s6ky

Dont make her feel bad for doing so not that you would do it intentionally!  My boyfriend would joke around about this and it really bothered me  he had no idea I was taking it seriously and apologized when I pointed it out to him and hasnt done it since even if maybe it means you postpone a movie night or something at least initially.As for the job yeah that stress is rough.  I was worried my SO would hate his especially because it ended up paying less than he was expecting.  If shes going to school though and does end up not liking her job focus on the prospect of the future not the current situation.  As I told my SO I think of every shitty stage in my life as an obstacle to overcome just part of getting to the next thing which cant be worse than I feel right now.  And if it is then its just another obstacle... Here is not the destination.He didnt find it super useful probably because he was bummed out at the time and it can be hard to hear something like that when youre in a bad state of mind but I really hold it close to heart.  I have had some rough times since I graduated from college and believing that there was something worth working toward has always helped me get through it.  It has always felt worse when I felt like I was in an abyss with no end in sight or sometimes even HAVING no end in sight.So really if shes working toward a degree you mentioned classes but maybe Im making assumptions? even if she does just have a survival job its just a vehicle to a better life later on.  Humans can do some pretty incredible things over short periods of time and know that theyre worth it.  So if that DOES happen I think it will be okay in the end no matter what. ,LongDistance,dgkovtf,2,t5_2s6ky

Here are some thoughts I can share with you. Have people over. Make couple friends. A house is not a home without laughter and games. It will ease the tension make everyone happy and help you break in the place.. Have your own area. I had my desk space and surrounding area which was mine and I decorated solely and she basically never went to. She had her own area like this. Living together doesnt have to mean attached . . LEARN. TO. COOK. Not only will this help with cost saving but you will bond over the activity and learn an extremely valuable life skill. . Know each others schedules. Im sure you will anyway but its great to know when they can help you because youre locked out of the place and I used this knowledge to plan surprises and gifts. . Keep on top of taxes bills rent and such. I dont know your arrangement but we pretty much split everything . Make a spreadsheet do whatever you have to do just get your shit in order. You dont want this creating stress between you two.. Lastly acknowledge that you two are kids. Hell im only  right now. I did this when I was .  You dont have to be adults just because youre living together. Get too drunk. Play stupid games in the living room. Have goofy movie nights. Enjoy yourselves.I hope you found this helpful.,LongDistance,dgvsdc4,2,t5_2s6ky
