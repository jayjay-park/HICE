5688559,0,t3_3sxjjj,It seems that you have the gift for sharpening with freehand whetstones. The skill of sharpening is a funny one. At the beginning it costs you something to develop it. You ruin the edge of knives thinking that youve got a sharp edge when youre cutting with a mashed out burr. You spend too much time with your eyebrows furrowed trying to grind out a notch and you affect the general curvature of your edge. Fortunately as you get better your knives get better and the universe rights itself.If youre already good enough to make your chef friend happy with your work maybe youve already crossed the first introductory period of bad sharpening work so the further development of your skills is all upside. If the cost of learning going forwards is a sharp knife then youre in great shape. Freehand whetstones offer some good benefits over sharpening systems if youve already got the knackThere is a larger range of grades that are economically available. Really want to see how far you can take an edge? Youre starting on a good knife. The Victorinox knife you have has good steel. It hasnt got the hardest material but it has a good fine grain structure. Ive taken my Vic up to  mesh and it actually does get sharper from my usual  mesh hone that I do on that knife. Want to see how far you can push an edge on AUS? You need the stones to do it.Whetstones offer a very large sharpening area and high thickness. This provides the obvious benefit of giving you a lot of material to wear away and sharpen but it also lets you buy stones that are more friable. Wearing faster sounds bad but it comes with one interesting benefit stones that release particles faster present fresh sharpening surfaces quickly. More loosely bonded stones can sharpen faster because they dont clog with swarf and they present more freshly sharpened grains to the knife youre sharpening. Because whetstones are so big and thick you can get faster cutting stones than you can with system stones with their thin small area strips or rods. Systems cant offer fast cutting stones because they wear out too fast.Whetstones are more versatile. Got a cleaver? It might go through the Spyderco sharpener but I dont think that the Edgepro has the necessary range of adjustment for it.,seriouseats,cx27yv2,1,t5_30sp1

6029448,0,t1_cy9utmg,Havent done one before but I would cook it like thisHot oven compatible pan on the stove. High heat. A drizzle of oil on the breast side of the chicken and straight on the hot pan. After a minute or so it should be nicely browned. Flip it on to the back and move in to a F or C oven. Cook it for thirty minutes with convection. Remove pan from oven leaving the bird on. Let it stand on the cold stove for  minutes and then try to transfer it to a cutting board. Carve and consume. The cooking time depends on the filling the size the pan the oven and the heating method. The goal is a crispy skin and moist meat. If in doubt use a thermometer. But I do think it cooks a lot quicker without the bones in. As I said. I have never tried a chicken like that but that is the method I imagine myself using.

7751928,0,t3_4lgegp,Its definitely contextual. A steak? Whatever. A  lb rib roast? Resting will make a clear difference. Then things like fresh sausage and smoked brisket dramatically change mechanically as they cool as well just breaking apart and losing the rendered fat in these cases. I was trained to cook the steak or whatever rest it and then flash it  heat it in a very hot source a hot grill broiler etc  for a minute or so such that the outside gets hot again but no cooking is done. That is not entirely practical for home use but thats what I did in a very expensive steak house.,seriouseats,d3nc4hp,8,t5_30sp1
7752786,0,t3_4lgegp,A few points on this  Rest red meat pork and whole birds always.  Red Meat  it will help it to retain its juices and not yield a dry end product but also allow it to finish carryover cooking i.e. you cook it to just a half step before medrare and it carries over to a perfect medium rare. This is every bit as valid in a striploin steak as in a full prime rib but the practical difference is how much carryover there will be. For a full rib roast estimate  degrees F. For a steak closer to  degrees F.  Flashing the meat when you go to serve it is also an option but not necessary unless it rests for too long to do this put it on the grill or in a  F oven for a minute to let the outside heat up nicely but without letting the internal temperature and therefore the doneness rise.  Poultry  Birds that are roasted whole need to rest as well for nearly identical reasons the juices will be retained rather than losing all of their moisture onto a tray and the liquid is better when it stays in the meat rather than being spooned back on when you go to eat it. Birds also need time to carryover. You roast chicken to  F but if you allow it time to carry over you can remove it from the over or spit around  F and while it is resting it is retaining its juices and also finishing cooking given  minutes it is easier to handle still piping hot inside and a much better end product.  Pork  Roasts pork loin etc should be rested for the same reasons individual pieces of meat such as sausages there is little benefit from allowing it to rest.  Everyone has an opinion on this granted do whatever you feel is right but resting meat provides innumerable benefits in the finished product.,seriouseats,d3nfmrm,2,t5_30sp1

9588699,0,t1_d9ur496,The negatives were about hardness which werent up to spec. Hardness is not really that important unless youre a knife maker or a professional. In fact softer steel is better for home cooks becsuse its a lot easier to sharpen.The negative review on Wired reminded me of people who write computer reviews based solely on performance indicators and completely ignore the things that are most important to everyday users design and feature.I have a production line Misen at home now. It has the same balance and design as the prototype I reviewed. I still stand by my review and honestly think that the review in Wired was kinda idiotic for placing so my emphasis on steel quality rather than design.Of course having both would be great. But Id take great design over great steel any day.  ,seriouseats,d9v047j,10,t5_30sp1

9697099,0,t1_da7us32,Brine it yourself buy an unbrined turkey and DIY it. Use a cooler and get enough space in your fridge to hold it and fill it with a few gallons of salt water. Thats what I do. Or you can do a dry brine as others have suggested which is basically just rubbing salt all over it and leaving it for several hours. Ive never done it that way but its supposed to be easier than using the amount of liquid necessary for a wet brine. There are recipes for brine soaks you can get online. Its basically equal parts salt  sugar with a little less sugar and then herbs andor garlic and pepper. My recipe is for every  gallon of water I use g of salt and g of sugar.  I think thats like  oz salt for  oz sugar not sure. And a  lb turkey is going to need like  gallons of water.. Then I add thyme garlic  onion powder cracked black pepper ground rosemary a few crushed cloves oregano sage... stuff like that. You want to boil some of the water and dissolve the salt and sugar into it and steep the herbs in the hot water too and then cool it down with some cold water held back. And taste it before you put it in because it shouldnt be too salty it should be like ketchup not too salty. The sugar balances the salt and the salt keeps the moisture in the meat. And the whole process takes like  hours with a thawed bird so it might be more like  hours if the bird is frozen. Also you want to stuff your bird helps keep it from going dry too I would think. I like apple raisin stuffing and you can get cheesecloth bags to make it easy to take out after its cooked too. But thats only for whole birds at Thanksgiving and Christmas.NOTE I should note however that Ive never personally done a spatchcocked turkey before Ive only done whole birds for the holidays.,seriouseats,da8dgjx,2,t5_30sp1

10682210,0,t3_5sciw3,The essence of goo is viscosity and volume.  I feel like mac and cheese could use a series of pictures demonstrating changes in viscositysauce volume.  Like the time vs. temp grids for sousvide eggs.  However I can appreciate that viscosity is difficult to capture in a photo.Basically I see this recipe as one end of the gooeydry spectrum of mac and cheese.  The Ultra Gooey end if you will.  Cooking and eating this taught me more about how gooey I like my mac and cheese not even close to this much and I learned some strategies to increase gooeyness for any future similar dishes that are not quite gooey enough.It was also difficult to reheat adding water to reemulsify the cheese eventually worked but it was nearly as much work as starting over.As a contrast for a super dry mac and cheese I modified this recipe   I omitted the butter in the panko cooked in a wider vessel and halved the recommended pasta cooking time.  This resulted in a mac and cheese without any hint of goo or sauce.  If anyone tries this  its very easy to burnstick so make sure you hover over it.  It reheated beautifully  no free water to make the pasta mushier overnight.  It was pretty cool to watch so much cheese visibly disappear.  As expected it was very dry and not super satisfying.Now I have the techniques and experience to move mac and cheese and similar anywhere on the goo spectrum and Im more knowledgeable about exactly what I do and do not like.  For those not interested in repeating this mac and cheese Odyssey Go right down the middle of the goo spectrum with the  ingredient.  Its excellent easy and just about the right amount of goo for most people.,seriouseats,ddhsf21,3,t5_30sp1
