197417,0,t1_cf0u8fz,Yeah youre right Ive heard slight variations.  Theyve probably experimented with different tempos from tour to tour to find the tastiest one.,Meshuggah,cf0xf5l,1,t5_2s5xt
1669279,0,t3_2deegm,I totally agree except I prefer the  Nothing reissue. Its what I started with and I just really love the tone on the reissue.,Meshuggah,cjpkonu,2,t5_2s5xt

8440959,0,t1_d5uj31s,gt Catch  and I are my two favorites.Ditto. That was a real purple patch for them. Then they made an album to be played live i.e. Obzen and it was a huge step back imo. I still remember hearing Combustion and wondering what the fuck they were doing. It honestly feels like Fred sees this as his day job now.,Meshuggah,d5wnpyx,2,t5_2s5xt

9065701,0,t3_548xna,I thought it was completely derivative when it first came out. Then a couple of months later I listened to it again and I have not stopped listening to it since. It is my favorite song of theirs and I wish they would perform it live. ,Meshuggah,d81ju4n,2,t5_2s5xt
9152260,0,t1_d8c3fqp,That I feel would be biased just like any random listeners opinion.Would just let this pass.,Meshuggah,d8c45na,1,t5_2s5xt
9190885,0,t3_5676js,Im on my sixth listen right now as it turns out and im still finding little things that make me feel a bit nostalgic about classic Meshuggah  in a good way. The solo in the eponymous track reminds me of Sol Niger for instance. I dig this album quite a bit. There are moments i felt it was a bit contrived perhaps a bit tryhardish maybe like they needed to make just one more track but on the whole i really enjoy it. ,Meshuggah,d8h0g1s,2,t5_2s5xt
