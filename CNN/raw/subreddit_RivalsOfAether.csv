3343371,0,t3_2ygj3v,Woooooaaah! This character is so exciting! I love the character design incorporating a dagger and smoke use. I love how the back part of his Dair spikes just like Marths. I really want to know more about the clone though Is it semiplayer controlled like a desynced Nana would be to a person playing IceClimers or more like a level nine computer that controls its own moves? How much smoke can you put on the stage?Apart from that I like how this is going to influence the Meta. Since Forsburn get a tactical advantage from putting down Smoke Screen as well as a great kill move when he absorbs it this encourages your opponent to approach you. This is definitely going to be a matchup where you dont want to give Forsburn too much space. Im looking forward to hiding and dragging my unsuspecting opponent in to the smoke with my forward smash capewhip. Bravo Dan Fornace. ,RivalsOfAether,cp9dar3,2,t5_32h5b

Ive decided to main Maypul after initially focusing on Forsburn and then playing the entire cast to get a feel for everything.I love Maypuls gameplay but one thing I was struggling with a bit is figuring out exactly what the goal with her moves is. Like you said everything seems to just push the opponent to the side which makes it seemingly difficult to extend combos compared to Forsburn whos knockback is upward and low with a ton of hitstun. But really actively forcing the edge guard game makes sense to me. I would add that early ceiling KOs with aerial juggles might be the other optimal game plan.

Why challenge it when I know Ill lose?Use your projectile to gimp his recovery if it hits the side of his pillar he will go into special fall. Not always since it depends on timingif hes standing on it.Air dodge out of his up b.When youre getting combod at low  try to DI away. hold the direction youll fly.Use your puddle to space him out. Your extended smashes and puddle side b are very good tools for punishing him when he does a jab combo or smash on nothing.Since hes a heavy character but still kinda fast you want to try to bait him into doing laggy moves and punish him for them.

I suggest going into practice mode and finding out what combos work and such and practice mechanics like teching and parrying.

5296655,0,t3_3njo1p,Okay so you need to be proactive with your puddles. Your mainly placing them down underneath you instead of poking and prodding your enemy. Also there were a lot points were you could have created bubbles when your enemy was on your puddle. You not taking your punishes to the max. If your opponent is just sitting on top of you dont sit and wait for up tilts. Go up air him nair him off the stage dair him to continue a combo. Instead of dash attacking all the time as a follow up use down tilt and jabs. Dont forget jabs can be cancelled into any of your tilts and all of Orcanes tilts all setup up nicely to continue combos or setup for kills. Dont side b or up b as an attack in the neutral its laggy and predictable. Up b should be used sparingly if you knock them into a puddle at high s otherwise just use it for recovery. Its only been a week though so your doing good so far but these are just things Ive noticed. If you really want to main Orcane I highly suggest you check out this Orcane Advanced Techniques guide that I made.

If you get mad and curse certain moves or tactics it clouds your mind from rather thinking about how you can avoid such situations.Get hit by Orcane dash into jabs a lot? Well what can you do about that? If you have a learning mindset and always ask yourself such questions what can I do about this? Your character most likely have options you can go into practice mode and learn the range on that dash attack and next time you play an Orcane try to dashdance a bit and bait out that dash attack only this time youre ready to punish the shit out of it.If you get hit by that dash attack all the time you give your opponent no reason to stop. If something works continue doing it. Stop giving him a reason to do it. You say youre reading it why arent you winning then?

I can confirm that playing on keyboard is certainly doable and although a controller is currently being shipped Ive still had a lot of success without one. Some people cough shenanigans cough can play this game on an extremely high level without the need for a controller and actually prefer keyboard after having used both. Some things will be objectively harder like wavedashing and diairdodging due to not having a full range of movement like you would with a controller stick but these things can be overlooked. In the end its all a matter of preference and how much time youre willing to put in.

5462693,0,t1_cw9tyzp,Fors tips dont rely on specials. Playing him gimmicky doesnt work out for most so I would suggest well placed aerials and tilts. Dsmash down b charged and bair are your best kill moves. His nair combos into itself really good. Upair has lots of hitstun so those connect well. His parry is the best in the game and has a disjoint. For around a character length in front of him he can parry so parry gt dsmash is a really good kill setup. Reflecting projectiles are super easy as him so that is advised just attempt to time it for when it is right behind him. If you time it right you parry with the disjoint if too late you will parry it with your hurt box instead of the disjoint. His up b teleport goes through the stage so if you are far away up b gt wall jump hold towards the stage in this game and press jump you get one per airtime and can be performed from special fall. While your opponent is recovering you have some options edgegaurd bair or dair spike preferably make a clone side b press b to make him attack or place down smokepike it up. Smoke allows you to be hidden from your opponent and picking it up gives you your down b a shine that kills. If you up b into smoke you get your double jump and up b back. You can wavedash RAR and waveland in this game the inputs are easier than both pm and melee and finally good luck I hope you get to use that top tier taunt.,RivalsOfAether,cw9wsag,5,t5_32h5b

5517080,0,t3_3qjq5c,FeatureJust read the bold at the bottom for the short description of the Feature itself if you cant handle the wall of text First I just want to say that this is probably my favorite game in the genre now and I really want to see it grow a lot. A lot of the features that I have seen requested so far are mainly to fix things like lag or just things that they see the game as lacking in theres nothing wrong with this and I think that a lot of them should be added but the feature Im requesting would be something that adds to the game and is something that I have not really seen inside any other fighting game before. The feature that I am requesting would rooms. These would basically be something where you could have a private invite only room and a random room where you could meet up with strangers. Preferably the rooms would be able to hold  or possibly more people. These rooms would basically have text chat imo voice chat could just turn it into a troll thing and kinda take away from the overall experience but that could be your choice where you can talk to everyone and if you hover the little disccursor thing the one that you use in the character select screen over someones name and press whatever you have the Accept button set as then it will bring up a list of options like add friend challenge to a match send a private message invite to voice chat or possibly even watch replay of their most recent match. In these rooms you would be able to chat with people spectate matches that are going on in the room or start vs and FFAs with multiple people from the room. This feature would be great for streamers so they could have a room of viewers where they could battle them do vFFAs with them and the viewers could battle eachother. This could also be a great way to run tourneys with the spectator option and the fact that the people fighting wouldnt need to add eachother on steam to join the room btw inviting people to the room would be by friends list and you could type in their account name and it would pull up everyone who has Rivals and the account name so you could invvite the person. Also I could just imagine posts in this subreddit or probably a new one like Hey Kraggs join my room for some FFA Castle Building Fun NOW  Anyways I feel like if this feature were in the game it would give the online experience a much more connected or enjoyable feel. Danpai pls notice me and make my dreams a reality       Also sorry about the wall of text I just really love the game...A Lot...TLDRAdd in game chatrooms that can hold up to  people where you can challenge them and other stuff.EDIT  Just saw this comment below by TAYZEgt but the problem is having  pcs link up smoothly. The online issues we already have with v would be compounded. He has said that having  ppl link through  different computer  per pc might be a thing he could do but right now were just trying to make things work well enough for v so that we dont have to SD in laggy matches...But even if this is so a lot of the things I mentioned minus the v and FFA from the chatroom would still hopefully be doable.,RivalsOfAether,cwguuqm,2,t5_32h5b

5576552,0,t3_3rew40,Can we stop comparing this to Smash its great that its based off of it part of what makes it playable but because something is like this in Melee doesnt mean that this game should follow suit. Especially since its early access too how about we get all  characters first before we bring in the nerf gun.Also leave Kragg alone. Cant deal with defense roll after a month of playing you need to reevaluate your play style instead of taking the armor away even after it hits unless I jump cancel it once the animation ends guess what you can do.....HIT HIM. Its even slow starting up and if you parry it its a dead Kragg. The biggest problem this game has is with glitches and internet connections. Hopefully by the time Absa comes out who I bet a lot of people are gonna complain about there will be improvement on the online aspect as well as less glitches.,RivalsOfAether,cwobnaq,2,t5_32h5b

6916267,0,t3_4afuaq,So the Kragg matchup is interesting. On the plus side for Kragg Etalus is so huge that Kragg can throw out all the stops and get combos he can never get. Etalus plays really aggressive which is perfect for Kragg as Kragg can stuff Etalus approaches all day with down b and rock spam. Kragg can combo like crazy due to how massive Etalus is how effective Kraggs zoning tools are currently against him and how heavy Etalus is. I can only imagine what Zetterburn can do against this guy.In Etalus defense Etalus is really strong. Kragg doesnt seem to deal to well with f special as it can interrupt his animations for his rock pick up and down special. Etalus seems to edgeguard Kragg way better than any other character. His uair off stage is a nightmare if Kragg has already used his pillar. Forward special can break Kraggs pillar and can slow down his offstage recovery. Kragg doesnt seem to deal with super armor quite as well as other characters. And finally Etalus can live for a pretty long time due to his weight.For now I put the matchup in Kraggs favor but I also said that for Absa during her release p,RivalsOfAether,d10a5mx,1,t5_32h5b

Ok back to the serious argument I was only using that example from smsh as an example I just feel like what happens in the upb gets hit by rock situation is bland. Maybe if the up b caused for fragments to be sent back to the thrower and it would also slightly shortens Up Bs length.The game is still in early release and player suggestions are still pretty important you shouldnt blow things off as trying to be more like a certain game and say that its invalid.

I think this patch was heading in the right direction with kragg. Trying to make him less spammy and think about what hes doing. Unfortunately he didnt gain any more tools or new strategies. He has to be more careful this patch.Disclaimer I have to say this otherwise someone else will. This is still in beta and Dan and the team are doing a great job with changing fighters. Dan told me that he knows Kragg isnt where he should be.  Every patch isnt meant to balance every character.  They have different focuses for each patch. They cant have huge changes each time. It would cause too much chaos.So just keep your head up and keep playing your favorite character.  I know the team wont leave him in the dust.

Zetterburn is my best character even though ive put a lot more time in etalus aswell as some other characters lately. No skill high reward kinda like smash  kirby. I dont mind losing i do mind playing  zetterburns in a row even if i beat all of them. Ive been around since the EA release and put  hours in this game.

Think of it as a Peach turnip and get one safely in order to throw it for damagelinking into a combo. Recover low with Kragg because his pillar is really easy to break. Its invincible to projectiles on startup so recover low to avoid most physical attacks.There are a lot more things but thats off of the top of my head.

9383203,0,t1_d95dkmd,I am referring to Orcane bubble damage nerf and his bair fstrong and dstrong buff. The dev notes said this change specifically aims to make Orcane less reliable on zoning and more reliable on getting in. It worked.Every fighting game or any game basically has frustrating characters and its almost a requirement for a game to be healthy. You cant make every character Fox McCloud you gotta have Peach Ice Climbers and Samus. You tried to make Samus another Fox and this made me unhappy. In one of Overwatch development videos the developer talks about how Mei was designed and how they took inspiration from Elsa and etc. and in one dialogue he said the game was lacking frustrating and gimmicky characters so they designed Mei to be exactly that. Same goes for Bastion. Notice how a developer from a huge gaming company Blizzard specifically adds an unhype character because Im assuming they know its healthy for the game and the community. Do you think if every hero was as fanfavorite or hype as Genji or Hanzo the game would be as popular or as successful?I had  hours on Rivals of Aether when I dropped Orcane and eventually slowly quit the game. I still play it time to time but I dont pick Orcane at allthe only reason why I played RoA in the first place was this character I wanted my character to work like he used to and when he stopped working there was no reason for me to continue playing.You may say Im exaggerating and maybe I am but a developer should be interested in how they made players feel with their actions not how players should feel. ,RivalsOfAether,d95dy0d,1,t5_32h5b

9824868,0,t3_5fyzpi, Depends on the character. I wouldnt say there are too many ATs to learn so much as learning to control your character. I would definitely focus on learning your recovery options and mixups  very important. But besides that yeah just focus on control timing and eliminating misinputs. Once you think youve decided on a character then learn matchups and stages.   There are characterspecific tutorials ingame. Do the ingame tutorials. They may seem simplistic at first but once you get past BeginnerIntermediate you unlock Advanced tutorials and then Character Tutorials. If youre looking to learn the game in time for Genesis I strongly recommend you get all of the tutorials done and go from there.   Its generally agreed Zetterburn and Kragg are the most beginnerfriendly.   As far as I know the Rivals area at Genesis  will only have Xbox One setups. Only XB controllers will work Im pretty sure even X controllers dont work.   Join our Discord channel This is the biggest most active hub for the RoA community. A lot of knowledgable folk here if you ask questions people are always happy to help. We even have mentors who can coach you!    Im glad you randomly decided to play Rivals with us! See you there! ,RivalsOfAether,dao78rx,3,t5_32h5b

The game is relatively new and there is still a lot of optimisation that top players have to do to get the rivals close to their max.   . Im not a melee player but in very much every competitive game i know Tier lists are not a reprensentation of who is the beststrongest. It only represents the best for a certain meta that were in influenced by which characters are played the most which are not necessarily the best. ,RivalsOfAether,dfnzbyp,6,t5_32h5b
