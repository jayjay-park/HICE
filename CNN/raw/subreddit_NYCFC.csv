2471133,0,t3_2nuoib,There is a lot to know about MLS.  rMLS has been a great resource for me as well as mlssoccer.com.   I would highly suggest watching the MLS Insider videos if you want to know more about the league.  Here is a brief summary in my own words MLS started in  as a reaction to soccer mania after the World Cup held in the states in .  Between  to  there was no official first tier league in the US due to the NASL folding so MLS started from scratch with completely new teams. The original teams in MLS were. DC United. New YorkNew Jersey Metro Stars Later to become Redbulls. New England Revolution. Columbus Crew. San Jose Clash Later to become Earthquakes them move to Houston to become Dynamo.  Current Earthquakes reformed after that.. Dallas Burn Later to become FC Dallas. LA Galaxy. Tampa Bay Mutiny Later to fold. Kansas City Wizards later to become Sporting Kansas City. Colorado RapidsA few years later in  the Chicago Fire and Miami Fusion would be added.  Fusion along with Mutiny would later fold in  due to declined attendance and other terrible management issues.  MLS went through several rule changes and flirted with Americanizing the sport.  For a while there there were no draws and games could be decided by golden goal in overtime.  Between the world cup excitement of  and the build up to  the MLS went under radical changes and tried to stay consistent with the rules around the world as opposed to strange American versions.  It is largely considered the turning point of the league when David Beckham signed on with LA Galaxy in .  Throughout the s new teams were added leading up to the  team table we have now.  The league has shuffled a bunch and Don Garber MLS Commissioner announced last season that the goal is to reach  teams by .  Expansion teams so far are us Orlando Atlanta LAFC and Miami.  There are rumors of Miami not happening while there are also debates about the next franchise being awarded to either Sacramento Minnesota San Antonio or Las Vegas.  Chivas was a failed experiment that ended in a rather dramatic fashion. rMLS crowd sourced a plane to fly a message over the stub hub center asking for Vergara Out Chivas FO after stories of racism and mistreatment surfaced last season.  I could honestly keep writing about this all day but check out the newcomers guide in rMLS and look through some of mlssoccer.coms videos and Im sure you can find a whole load of stuff.I hope this helps and welcome to MLS! Its an amazing league that I am more than grateful to follow. Edit words Edit from uswampy The only thing Id add is that MLS was actually formed as part of the  World Cup bid not so much because soccer was so popular after the World Cup. Fifa wasnt really keen on letting us host when we didnt even have a top tier soccer league.  So MLS has the  World Cup to thank which I think gives  a good legacy for the country.,NYCFC,cmh4qea,14,t5_2x3v3

Colorado  was fortunate for NYC.  Rapids just couldnt finish.Although this weekend I thought the loss was an unlucky result.  Deserved a point and could have easily won the game.

Growing pains? Sure. But growing pains dont make a team play with a complete lack of heart with theyre heads down. Someone has to be that guy to grab games by the neck and drag us back in to it when we go down. That goal went in at  minutes and I knew there was hardly a point to playing the next  it was over. Wanting to play a certain way is lovely and all but when its not working you need to be able to change the system.

As for a striker I think Nemec needs time and with Shelton and Mullins there it would be a waste to sign a DP striker.gtcenterbacks before we need an outside back. Here I agree wholeheartedly. We NEED at least one solid center back but who out there is worth signing to a DP contract? Remember we could have Onyewu on a free by this weekend to put there.As for not needing an outside back we have to remember Facey can be recalled back to Manchester at the end of the month and Calle seems to have a serious injury no one knows when he will be back. Theres no guarantee hes on the team next year as hes only here on loan. That leaves us with Brovsky Allen and Wingert as our only healthy outside backs if Calle who is a midfielder stays out for a while.

4231872,0,t3_39d9ox,Just trying to offer an outsiders perspective so dont take these points necessarily as what I think.  I went to the NYCFC homeopener and had a lot of fun and Im rooting for NYCFC to do well despite still being a RBNY fan it will be really good for MLS if NYCFC is a huge successI think a lot of the feeling is that MLS fans see NYCFC fans as Johnnycomelately or bandwagon MLS fans.  While the Red Bulls havent exactly been a NYC team I think a lot of MLS fans have the perception that NYCFC fans either switched allegiances from RBNY a big taboo or just ignored MLS until now.I also think that NYCFC fans are sometimes critical of the MLS and other fanbases whereas a lot of other fanbases have a bit of camaraderie among one another after years of fighting for the league to get attention.I think the hate will last until NYCFC have their own stadium and hopefully start to look and feel more independent from Man City and the Yankees.,NYCFC,cs2maj4,13,t5_2x3v3

4331266,0,t1_csdecqy,TFC fan here. Just came to check out the discussion. Honestly I cant say that you are on the hate list but most people in our subreddit seem to be a bit jealousupset that your team is born from the kind of money that the owners have.Yesterdays game was extremely rough and had some very aggressive defending on the NYCFC side. That paired with some inconsistent and many say poor officiating is what spurs on a sort of hate. It will pass though. If not just know that we hate Montreal more... always. I personally believe a shot to the head like the one on Perquis is inexcusable as is his conduct after the game. Both deserve some discipline. I wish your team good luck and cannot wait to see Frankie play in NA. David Villa is also a gem you are all lucky to have these two legends. ,NYCFC,csdv2ux,3,t5_2x3v3

Its a bit of an exaggeration for you guys to say that theyre a team that never shows up or even will be a team like that. Just because of one game youre talking about that happening? Give me a break. Come back if they do that the next  games in a row. One flat game doesnt describe a team. Re Mikey Lopez Nah not even going there. He just wasnt good nothing he did. Thats all. Re Lampard if you believed he was really questionable after the second or third week you may be stupid. It was clearly a fucking bullshit designation that meant nothing.

9898652,0,t3_5govvf,Im still carrying a torch for Joe Hart even though he seems very happy at Torino and I think theyre looking to sign him outright.

He covered the first thirty minutes of the SKC preseason match on Periscope because I joked that his video before that was too short only  minutes and that he should do live commentary.
