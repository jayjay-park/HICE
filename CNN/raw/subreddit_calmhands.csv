2158393,0,t1_cldo7vv,I honestly wish it was a LOT more than we had lmao. I think just being able to just stop rushing with everything calm down and relax helped a lot though. Also he just got the job hes been trying to get since May and its one step down from his dream job and pays pretty well. Knowing that our financial worries and long distance relationship are almost over are the biggest stress relieving factors in the spontaneous cessation of that horrible habit ,calmhands,cle6j8c,2,t5_2ssjn
2860152,0,t3_2sthye,I am on the same boat right now! I feel like my nails are too long but Im too lazy to cut my nails properly with a nail clipper and everything. If you are searching for a way to curb the biting you could schedule some time to do your nails or get them done. Knowing they will look pretty in the end might motivate you to finally do your nails and hopefully stop biting. At least this is what Im thinking of doing today! ,calmhands,cnt78by,1,t5_2ssjn

I have a very good oneGood idea about skin turnover. Im going to start applying vitamin C retinol and niacinamide all which have been statistically proven to promote cell turnover. It helps my acne scars so its worth a try on this scar. Especially since I already have a routine!,calmhands,cobc1kz,1,t5_2ssjn

6406607,0,t3_419ldg,Golden rule for me cut as much as you want but STOP WHEN IT HURTS. Keeping my nails short makes them less fun to play with weaken and bite. uitsmyotherface makes a good point about your nail beds being short eventually the bed will hopefully regenerate under some of the nail that was formerly whites. Learning to tolerate whites is a good goal.,calmhands,czhv704,1,t5_2ssjn

7017304,0,t3_4ax6gv,This thread is a little old but Ive heard spinner rings can help a lot. I didnt like it personally because I dont like wearing rings but it sounds like it might help you if its just needing SOMEthing to do with your hands.,calmhands,d1brcud,1,t5_2ssjn

7175489,0,t3_4drddk,Ive had a seriously bad picking habit for about  years now. It started when I was learning to write in early grade school. The pencils would give me callouses on my thumbs because of the way I held them and I would pick the callouses. That lead to picking all the callouses on hands and feet all scabs any peeling paint or finish etc. Its a relatively benign habit but I would love to quit. Glad I found this sub though. Makes me feel like less of a weirdo. ,calmhands,d1tsc5x,2,t5_2ssjn

7583117,0,t3_4j6s7z,If theres any advice I can give from experience in having those white parts for the first time. DONT TRY TO CLEAN UNDER THEM CONSTANTLYI ended up replacing one habit for another and would scrape the underside of the white part just making it thinner until it would peel off. Wash your hands theyll stay clean and good luck OP!,calmhands,d345w76,11,t5_2ssjn

8276252,0,t3_4srbfx, I know that feeling of being watched. But the honest truth is everyone is so selfconscious amp busy thinking about how they look that they are not noticing what others are doing!  As an eyebroweyelash puller I would do so in meetings while at work amp no one ever noticed! Everyone is more concerned about how they are perceived!!  It takes time amp hard work to get over the fear you describe. Just try and push yourself into these zones of uncomfortableness little by little the fear will lessen. Wishing you a future when you dont feel the need to hide. Much love A,calmhands,d5c396d,2,t5_2ssjn
8460331,0,t1_d5yyr29,Thank you so much. Ive actually had a sibling whos going into nursing look at it and apparently I drained it correctly. I just dont know how to deal with the void other than slather antibacterial on it and cover it in an industrial strength cloth bandaid.I didnt actually think of gloves thats a really good idea! Clean is the easy part fortunately.Thank you so much. You wouldnt believe how helpful a few words of encouragement can be Especially after this sort of relapse.,calmhands,d5z2rtg,2,t5_2ssjn

9919861,0,t3_5hir8g,Im not embarrassed by my hands anymore I like showing off my engagement ring without trying to hide my fingertips. Scratching feels amazing no more using my palm to ineffectively friction scratch. If I didnt work in food service I could paint my nails. My husband likes when I scratch his head too but scratching my own is nice as well. I also like that it feels more adult to not be caught with my fingers in my mouth and the overall look on my hands is more professional.,calmhands,db0l001,2,t5_2ssjn
10250191,0,t1_dc51ft6,Not OP but what helped me was looking at a lot of pictures in this sub. Ive never talked to anybody about my problem so just being able to connect with the people here helped a lot. I bit them for  years or so but with a few exceptions Ive been able to leave them alone since april or may last year. It also helped to cut them as often as possible so they dont grow too long and hard to leave alone. ,calmhands,dc5wyxm,2,t5_2ssjn
10685410,0,t3_5svb69,Ive had and have seen so much worse. This looks like amazing progress! The thing about anxiety and these kinds of compulsive habits is that usually we are the only ones to notice because we are constantly obsessing over them but other people probably never give your fingernails a second look. If we met in real life I bet your personality would immediately overshadow your healing fingertips. Youre doing wonderfully. Please keep at it! ,calmhands,ddi4b97,7,t5_2ssjn
10957761,0,t3_5whq7g,Stimtastic sells some really great and affordable spinner rings!  You can find them here  I ordered mine a few months back.

11108001,0,t3_5xkelz,These are great tips especially keeping a clear nail polish bottle to prevent more chipping and from yourself. Ive also heard putting a bandaid over your chipped fingernail until you can get home and remove it properly and it prevents you from picking off even more.  Putting gel polish on requires good application like not getting it on the cuticle or skin otherwise it will chip like regular polish.  Plus you need to soak off gel polish. My question are for those that do gel nail polish at home.  How do you prevent picking your gel polish off?  Picking off gel polish is wayyyyy more damaging than picking off regular polish. I am getting better at cleanup but I dont know if Ill try gel at home. I dont want to get it done because I like putting on my own polish now. Oh my only tip for preventing chipping away your polish is to put it on properly the first time so it doesnt chip. Especially wrapping your tips!  Follow thisAlthough Ive had times when I do this method and it still chips but I think it was because of the base coat and top coat I was using at that time. Otherwise my mani can last at least  days without chipping and thats a record for me. This website has great tips for your nails in general. Good luck!,calmhands,der2yx1,1,t5_2ssjn
