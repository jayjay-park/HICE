2539243,0,t3_2oqnzw,Please head over to rsteroids and post this topic in the Ask Anything SunTuThursday thread. They are better equipped to handle this question than we are. Also please read the wiki of that subreddit before you post because it answers literally all of your questions. Regardless my advice is that you spend a bit more time in the gym until you are back to having a good foundation. It is said that using steroids when you havent been working out enough can cause strength to increase so quickly that it can stress your tendons. ,steroidsxx,cmq0k2b,1,t5_34a5j

9007961,0,t1_d7uloys,OMG I hope your feeling better!! I trust what I have so I shouldnt have a problem but again you never know. Currently a week in and feeling good. Im at mg a day right now and feeling a real solid pump in the gym. Ill probably up my dosages in another week or so if Im feeling good and healthy.,steroidsxx,d7um6gc,1,t5_34a5j
9171893,0,t1_d8cqwbl,This is poor advice. Women have feedback loops as well. Tapering is highly effective at controlling mood swings coming off. Before pct was common and well understood men used to taper off as well. My wife is not happy stopping anything cold turkey even long estered eq compounds. htp is also very effective and recommend by many women. Tribulus works well for my wife and also helps maintain her sex drive and emotional well being until she is stable which may take months.  I agree on the squat though.  ,steroidsxx,d8elt1p,3,t5_34a5j
9501871,0,t3_5avak4,You dont need drugs to lose weight. They will only let you lift more frequently with more intensity. You can still over train easily even on high dose cycles. That said...  My wife made her quickest recomp and fastest strength gains on mg var a day and mg testprop a day. Her lifts doubled and she dropped  lbs in  months on about  calories a day.  Var is easy come easy go youll have some size gains and strength comes on rapidly but its lost fast. Test is king even for women. Shes used lots of things. Nothing beats the testvar. The water from test will keep your joints safe. Use aromasin .mg wk or soShes on testdeca right now. We added the deca for shoulder injury and it stopped bothering her  weeks after starting. Be aware nandrolone can be detected for almost  years.  You need a fast acting ester decaeq is too slowmgtest prop a week. Expect acne and voice fluctuations drop after  weeks.Maybe a new stray hair here and there. Cut hard  weeks then recomp for  more. Less sides with a lower dose for longer.    CUtting Diet around  calories a day  hr heavy weights min liss cardio min. Expect all your lifts to stall but youre focused on dropping fat. drop lbs over  months then  increase calories to  add more hit cardio and increase reps ranges into the .Metal side effects high deca low test makes her moody and miserable and agressive. Test only she feels great testdeca  right now. Very stable.  Eqvar no emotional changes. Anadrol serious rage.  ,steroidsxx,d9kb3ty,1,t5_34a5j
