Ive been working with meters for a very very long time and have never seen a meter that sells for less than a few hundred dollars have a controlable amperage while testing for resistance. Meter sense resistance using ohms law. I creates a small difference in potential  voltage  then it measure that very small current that the difference induces then is divide volts by current to get resistance.  The meter will only induce a current that is just enough to make a calculation. If you wet a couple of sponges and stuck your leads in and then pressed the sponges against your head you will read    Ohms. You will not get a phosphene flash because your meter will not increase current beyond what it needs to sence the resistance. You said your meter will put out up to  volts.  volts divided by  ohms is only  microamps not enough.

3475205,0,t3_2zzpo5,Prolonged passage of direct current current across metallic electrode where electrons from the stimulator are converted to ions carried through the body can produce undesired electrochemical products such as pH changes. The sponge pocket may act to physically separate and thus buffer the skin from electrochemical changes. Some of these metals can be very toxic if entering the body. The Jove link really should be required reading for anyone getting into tDCS. Beyond this even sponges can cause unecessary burns due to its tendency to have its charge accumulate on the edges. This can cause current densities higher than what is recommended to be safe.  Certain sponge designs have plastic rivets to promote a more even charge distribution that avoid current hot spots. Additionally the salinity of your salt solution should also be within a certain range. Too much or too little salt can cause burns as well. ,tDCS,cpoedft,3,t5_2sfqg

3831097,0,t1_cqr907c,A change in brain scan does not equal any noticeable change in consciousness either.Unfortunately you lack credibility when most of your facts are readily demonstrable as false. E.g. medical devices do not run directly off wall power. The Solterix MN HDtDCS plugs into the wall but runs off a rechargeable internal battery. There would be no big difference there anyway except the unacceptable safety risk of running directly off the electrical grid. Whether you get  mA current from a homemade device or a medical device a V battery or a lithium ion battery an Amrex electrode or sponge its the same  mA. The electrons are not somehow more powerful from the medical device. More importantly tDCS has not been dropped by researchers its quite an active field and popular interest is increasing.Downplaying benefits from electrical brain stimulation generally makes a lot of sense.

Increasing GABA an inhibitory signal that sedatives increase and decreasing Glutamate signaling the neurons primary excitatory signal for synapse formation would significantly impair speed of information processing. Increasing GABA while decreasing Glutamate would be expected to reduce anxiety reduce sadness by inhibiting the panicgrief subcortical emotional circuit help improve sleep help reduce obsessivecompulsive symptoms. It would help improve cognition if anxiety sadness and OCD impair ones ability to think.Increasing BDNF may reduce depressive symptoms while improving longterm memory. In the longrun it may improve general intelligence since it helps stimulate the growth of new nerve cells.tRNS on the other hand may improve performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Fourth Edition WAISIV since Glutamate signaling is enhanced.  Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter for forming new synapses. It is used by every neuron in the brain. When people are in a rapid thinking state  such as in hypomania or mania or when using stimulants  glutamate often is at higher levels. In hypomania or when using stimulants people are generally much more productive. Excessive glutamate signaling can be detrimental  e.g. increased anxiety OCD symptoms even psychosis. An excess of anything can be detrimental. But when optimized rather than being in excess thinking ability may improve.So I am interested in peoples experiences and the research done with tRNS.,tDCS,cr12fko,5,t5_2sfqg

5077212,0,t1_cuxa8wx,i think your confusing some things. this reddit provides lots of good background on basics of circuits relevant to tdcs.tdcs is current controlled which means the voltage on the device is adjusted to keep the current fixed at a target such as  mA when the load the body resistance is no known and can change.  you need enough voltage to push the desired current given the load. take the brainstimulator which has a v battery and not much else. now if the load of the body is  kOhm you can only get  mA. if you set the device to  mA you do not get  mA.so you see voltage is needed to provide the current. having more voltage lets you work across more loads. i think at some point you just dont need more but i assume it does not hurt. power is volts and current combined so having more voltage does mean more maximum power on a current source. hope that brief explanation helps.,tDCS,cuxzuy2,2,t5_2sfqg

7250385,0,t1_d21rzht,Very interesting. I dont know if it would be a good idea using that montage regularly though even if it was effective. The cathode which decreases activity is at T which is the biggest area regarding verbal memory and thought.What would be a great thing to try is placing  anodes assuming you have a  channel device on both T and T putting the cathodes on the contralateral shoulders and seeing what happens.,tDCS,d22bf8p,1,t5_2sfqg

7689635,0,t3_4km1ep,The training task used was a computerized adaptive versionof the visuospatial nback task used previouslyBuschkuehl HernandezGarcia Jaeggi Bernard ampJonides  Jaeggi et al.   see Figure . Aseries of blue squares was displayed each in one of eightpossible spatial locations.Stimulation was administered via a Soterix Medical   LowIntensity tDCS device Model A New York NYusing    cm sponge electrodes placed horizontally onthe head. The anode was placed over either right or leftDLPFC sites F and F in the international  EEGsystem and the cathode was placed over the contralateralsupraorbital area sites Fp or Fp.Pre and posttesting consisted of outcomes that assessedthe generalization of training gains onto untrained variantsof the nback WM span and inhibitory control tasks.Looks like the Active left group did a little better than Right with both groups doing better than the sham.Although its Jaeggi and she finds tDCS increases working memory and transfer.  If theres another Jaeggi study in the future what will her results be?  The same I would imagine.  Is it true or do they just tend to set the study up in a way that shows a positive effect?,tDCS,d3g9gbo,2,t5_2sfqg

I will stick with this one for a while though. Im mostly worried about continuing with these small pads. I can go .mv without to much discomfort but I think most of the studies used .mv.

8209054,0,t1_d514y7z,Thank you. What a great reference tool. Tried tDCS last night and again today and really do feel less like smoking as well as less cravings. That is a big deal to someone like me. But by the time someone straps an electrical box to their head that they do not know much about to reduce risk taking irony! they are more likely to get the results they are going after? I dont know... which is why I was hoping to hear from those who were successful or not. Not as active a community as I had hoped but its the only game in town right now.

8225140,0,t3_4rwldj,Loos  study positioned the anode over Fp to stimulate the ldlpfc with the cathode over Oz. Because the point of greatest stimulation is at the edge of the electrode closest to the reference electrode the F location would provide less robust stimulation to the ldlpfc.,tDCS,d55p61z,4,t5_2sfqg

9725204,0,t1_daaruco,OMG you are reporting my own experience the contrast between being eloquent confident and then ineloquent ineffective really did my self esteem in. I too enjoyed doing voiceovers in my head or out loud as a way of immersing myself more deeply in an activity or a task!  tDCS seemed to give me a window of hope that my mind was not broken by stress drugs and self consciousness. I was prompted by this hope to return to reading a lot more like I used to and find new aides like nootropics meditation and biurnal beats to ensure my mood and mind will continue to improve. I no longer think so much  about getting back to who or where or what I once was before adderall and stress as much as I am glad to not live like I was a  months ago. I might never be eloquent again or improvise like I once did but I will likely never be as down as I was before I tried tDCS. ,tDCS,dabuev3,1,t5_2sfqg

10425548,0,t1_dcp27ec,I wouldnt recommend using kratom at all with this.  A simple axiom of neuroscience is that neurons that wire togther fire together.  If I go bowling and only do so while drinking I will bowl better drunk than bowling than when sober.  This is because the neurochemical environment I learned to bowl in was different.  I dont know the Pharmacokinetics of kratom.  If you take a prescription like an SSRI it will reach a steady state level in which the concentrations of that medication will stay at a certain level and you will have a more stable neurochemical environment and will not be a major confounder like recreational drug use will.  I think .mA will work and due to the very slight hypothetical risk of seizureI really doubt it.  I thought it a better place to start.  I also have had good results at this level of stimulation but it also depends on the size of your electrode pads.,tDCS,dcpsz91,2,t5_2sfqg
