7780570,0,t1_d3pm246,Thanks for the info and trying things out!!! Really appreciate it if you wouldnt mind could you try something specific for me? Could you hold your arms like your holding a beach ball so they make a circle in front of you and then spin around on the spot pretty quickly and see how it draws. This is incredibly helpful if you could so I can continue my thoughts while I try to get the funds for my own vive. And I plan on giving a usernameor real name shoutout for the help Ive received while conceiving my idea. ,TiltBrush,d3ql466,1,t5_382cc
