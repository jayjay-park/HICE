My theory is that cars designed to be driven in inclement conditions are just a touch sturdier.

On top of that if I was sitting at mph max speed UK I wouldnt feel bad if some twat came up behind me and wanted past.

I went to retrieve him and because I was partially blocking traffic to do so some rednecks in their pickup truck yelled a few expletives at me. Ended up getting him to a vet that had a reptile specialist. The turtle had a cracked top shell and his lower lip was split in two but that didnt stop him from putting a death grip on a metal tool the vet had.

1745061,0,t1_cjyns2a,There are a variety of things at play here.  These are my own observations and reasonable people disagree but this is what Ive seen over the years.tldr bad infrastructure a culture of driving and legislative unintended consequencesFirst of all MOST roads were built in the US without any thought to cyclists whatsoever theyre large enough for cars but of course cars SUVs etc. have gotten bigger which gives even LESS space for cyclists.  Only recently have bicycles been given much thought the roads of the bigger cities in the US predate cycling as a thing and the less urban areas dont have a critical mass of cyclists yet to care.Then the laws came.  So not only are cyclists allowed on these roads a good thing which there is really not enough room for a bad thing there are laws on the books requiring drivers to give them a safe buffer area a good thing.  But because of the space thing this requires the vehicle to either enter the opposing lane to passovertake to give them the required space bad dangerous to the drivers in both directions illegal if in a nopassing zone stay in their own lane to pass crowding the cyclist bad dangerous to the cyclist not pass at all and follow the bike at bike speed in a MPH to MPH zone bad dangerous and infuriatingThe default reaction of most drivers is  there and is a source of annoyance to the driver and danger to the cyclist.Also a lot of these laws that allow cyclists on roads that were not built with affordances for them have given the cyclist community a sense of entitlement which is not necessarily bad but it can be taken to extreme.  I have seen cyclists routinely flaunt this entitlement mentality purposely riding as far into traffic as they are allowed and sometimes more daring cars to do something about it.  They also at least where I live VERY rural and pretty but cyclinghostile in road construction ride on roads that are exceedingly dangerous for them because they can.There is also a perception which is only partially untrue that cyclists routinely do not follow traffic laws.  I have witnessed this too many times to count.  I have also witnessed perfectly legal cyclists doing things legally.  I know its a pain in the ass to unclip your feet from the pedals to stop at a stop sign but ... too bad.And this is perhaps the most subjective part of this post the demographic of the cyclist at least where I am tends to be younger leftleaning and moderately well off.  All fine and good.  But this demographic tends to have a higher tendency to fight for what is right rather than what is practical.  Again not bad in and of itself but can cause ire in others.  Which in this case is the car driver.My ..  Im sure Ill be downvoted for this because it doesnt paint the cyclist community in the holy glow of the martyr but these are observations I have made.,Roadcam,cjz4jpx,3,t5_2u6os

Then only chase as safely and as short distance as possible so you can get a good look at his license plate. Any further chasing is useless since you will just call the cops to report it and give them the video evidence and let them do the investigative leg work. Continuing to chase in hopes the perp will stop especially swerving and doing crazy dangerous manuvers will only increase your own chance of causing a wreck yourself...which if it happens will basically cause this whole mess to get even more complicated.,Roadcam,ckue3j1,1,t5_2u6os

When you see the person getting out and walking off she seems to be going away from the road into the fieldyard youre first thought is to immediately apprehend them and like I said youve got adrenaline pumping through your veins prepared for the worst. They run up and grab the person then realize that its an old lady. She wasnt beaten or assaulted by the police she was apprehended quickly before they knew there wasnt any danger.

Hard brakes maybe see if you can flash them a bit without engaging them too much then coast. another option would have been to anticipate that and bust ass to get in front of the black car or go almost level with its rear bumper so other cars get the message yr only letting that one car in front of you.Ive been in something similar too and I was accidentally an asshole to the guy who got caught by my tailgater and I didnt wise up and let him in front of me. pretty sure a bit of road rage happened or a fender bender but they turned off at the next major intersection so idk.,Roadcam,co8ixiu,2,t5_2u6os

3510040,0,t1_cprssjy,Depends what a car is to you. If you live somewhere with constant stop and start traffic full of traffic lights and  degree low speed turns then its likely you dont really give a shit about driving but just like cars.Car people and driving people are two completely different camps.I dont see driving as any kind of inconvenience. If you do youre probably a car person. Theres nothing wrong with that not everyone is going to enjoy what I enjoy.My dad is a car person first and foremost. He likes big lazy soft cars with all the electronic gizmos. He specifically got an automatic with flappy paddles because theyre cool heated seats massive engine. Hes always moaned about having to change gears and hating windy undulating roads because he has to keep going up and down the box. He also likes the steering to be as light as possible.He washes the shit out of his car all the time and loves it. Hes a car person.I make my  mile commute into a  mile one deliberately so I can stretch the car out a bit and play with my car.In the middle of last year my dad for the first time ever had a go on Gran Turismo  on a wheel as I started a little competition with my much younger brothers to see how quick they could get around the Nurburgring. My dad has never had an accident in the  years hed been driving likes to drive fast on the road but was awful at it and I think it shocked him as I had been teaching my younger brothers and they were just simply quicker and safer in the game.I started giving my dad some basic tips which he took on board and saw the results and since then hes been addicted to the whole thing and now plays iRacing on the PC. Hes learned heeltoe downshifting trail braking holding a wheel in the right place with both hands PLast Autumn he also did his first ever track day in an MX me him and my older brother chipped in for after he got into driving rather than just cars.You couldnt keep him off the track. The car was louder and harder the wheel was heavier youre doing pretty much NOTHING but changing gear from am till pm and he loved it. No whinging about leg cramp. You use a clutch far more on a track than you do in any commute. He now takes the Mazda out when he goes out for breakfast with my mum rather than his big German cruiser barge that is massively quicker in a straight line.Maybe it is a circlejerk but more than that its the difference between being a driver and a car fan.Car fans turn their nose up at an underpowered Mazda. Car fans buy supercar calendars and have their desktop background set to a Ferrari. Car fans like hella flush and insane amount of camber and wheel size. Car fans that think theyre drivers love cars with massively powerful V engines with automatics that are only fast in a single direction on a single axis. Or they buy an S and make it completely impractical to drive and slower all for aesthetics. And they all suck at driving and the market is shifting focus to them.Theres a reason Lewis Hamilton got his Zonda with a manual gearbox. He has nothing to prove to anyone. He comes from a country where near enough everyone drives a manual. Young and old male and female gay and straight so theres no circlejerk or street cred to be had from it. Hes as driver as anyone gets. Its more fun a better and more involved experience. Quoting performance figures and Nurburgring lap times is completely the domain of the car fans.Classic manual layout is a dying format. But you can bet that for as long as they make internal combustion cars for drivers whether theyre completely unaffordable monsters or a cheap MX the layout will always exist.  Thats what a drivers car is.  Automatics are not drivers cars never have been never will be. Theyre for car fans and people that dont give a shit about cars alike. They share a common trait of not really giving a shit about driving to the point they quite pointlessly ask for what to do in a given situation on a reddit comment section. Or they make up completely bullshit and sometimes dangerous advice. This subreddit is full of terrible advice or incorrect analysis of what went wrong by car fans that love their cars but really dont have a clue how cars drive near the limit. Despite what theyll insist.For what its worth. I welcome electronic sports cars. Gears become obselete when you have instant and flat torque anywhere in the rev range. You dont need the finer control.Im also a fan of driverless cars as it will put the people that dont care for driving and that dont know what to do when things go wrong out of the drivers seat.

4151693,0,t1_crtcmu7,That might be true but they also do not have a carcentric culture.  In the event of an accident the burden of responsibility ie initial blame is placed on the operator of the vehicle that can cause the most damage.  In the event of a car vs cyclist then it would be the driver.  Due to this policy a ticket is automatically issued to the driver.  After the authorities do an investigation which they always do especially if a death or serious injury occurs if it was deemed that the driver was not at fault then they will revoke the issued ticket.  However further penalty could be issued if it was found that the driver was at fault.It has everything to do about culture.

Sure enough the guy did it again with the car in front of me getting nowhere as there was a ton of traffic ahead of us.  When the road split into multiple lanes I decided to put in the clutch and race the engine while I cruised past with a shit eating grin on my face essentially offering to race him to his destination in the middle of a traffic jam.  When his lane started moving again he slowly drove past with his wife and small child in the car and had apparently convinced his  year old son to flick me off along with him his wife was hiding her face.

5016066,0,t3_3jj1re,This reminds me of the time I found myself in a similar situation to the cammer.I pulled up to a stop sign controlling a Tintersection with a highway feeder road. The road I was on had a stop but the feeder did not. I came to a stop looked to the left and noticed a light green Asian compact car perhaps  years old coming down the feeder in the rightmost lane. I could have made it but I would have had to stomp it so I decided to wait until the compact passed before entering the feeder road.Behind me was a late model Chevy Camaro. The loud rumble of its idling engine made it obvious that it was performance modded. It had smoked headlights and tail lights. It had limo tinted windows and was painted jet black. Im not a Camaro fan but I had to admit it was a nice looking car. It looked similar to thisCamaro Man oblivious to the incoming compact decided that he did not have time to wait for me. The sound of a revving turbocharged V with no cat and a straight piped muffler fills the air. The guy whipped around me and attempted to make the turn. The driver on the feeder saw the imminent danger and made an emergency lane change to the left but the Camaro understeered and slammed into the poor little compact anyway.I dont think anyone was hurt. Both cars pulled into a gas station just up the road. There was a battalion chief truck at one of the gas pumps so I figured there wasnt anything I could do better than a firefighter and went about my business of course commenting to myself about the dumbassery that I had just witnessed.,Roadcam,cuqmjy2,2,t5_2u6os

Dont get me wrong I see the emphasis on safety and I understand the logic of it.

You even wrote the reason for why your first statement is untrue. Gas engines are more inefficient but their efficiency varies based on load and RPM. If in a Prius you use your gas engine to accelerate quickly you will consume more fuel than if you used the inherently more efficient electric motor for a slower acceleration recharging the batteries later with the gas engine at an ideal RPM pretty much acting as a generator.

They seemed pretty adamant that modern police forces are paramilitary organizations. The only real exceptions are unarmed police forces London being the standout.gt In a police department organized along paramilitary lines the stage is repeatedly set for a clash between the employees need for autonomy and the supervisors need for implementing and enforcing department policies and procedures.  gt Furthermore many of todays senior law enforcement managers and supervisors have a military background so it is not a coincidence that those with military experience generally appear to have less difficulty in a paramilitary organization than the younger officers who may not have had such an experience. The reason for this is simple the military experience provided intensive supervision so the transition to a paramilitary police organization is not difficult.

You are avoiding a low speed accident that is easily the most well protected and designed for safety wise and risking causing a much worse accident by blindly swerving. Other examples of where rroadcam often goes wrong is defending tailgaters He was driving slow in the fast lane so tailgating him at mph is justified and cutting the corner at turns nothing is going to happen you can totally see its clear. ,Roadcam,cyzs88r,24,t5_2u6os

6260619,0,t1_cz0tj5p,Just to give you some insight as to how this works trucks take a long time to stop. For the same reason that a train will just smash into you if youre ever stuck on the tracks its just too difficult to stop on a dime if youre a big heavy vehicle. For the physics behind it.   F  ma Where F is force m is mass and a is acceleration or in our case deceleration. Acceleration is defined as a change in speed. So lets say we go from mph to  mph.So lets compare a few things. motorcycle very light car truck heavier than a car train heavier than a truck. So the force made from deceleration is larger the heavier the vehicle is because they all are changing speed in the same way mph to mph and again force is defined as    F  m  a So now why am I talking about force? Because force is what the brakes try to negate. Not speed. So back to my original example on why a train wont stop by the time they see you flagging them down its already past the point where the brakes even could stop them in time. ABS is actually a system of letting off your brakes automatically so you slow down faster. Thats right in extreme braking your breaks ease off the rotor. Also as a point of clarification motorcycle stopping distances is usually higher than a car because they have less wheels and less braking force available but thats not the same concept as whats going on here. ,Roadcam,cz19htq,-1,t5_2u6os

But then when you get closer to the point of merging it turns out the car in front of you isnt speeding enough to actually make it. So that leaves you left with slamming the brakes and stopping at the end of the onramp hoping the car in front of you can merge or merge in it and have the guy in front of you stop at the end of the onramp.In this case both decided to merge at the same spot in between two trucks.Not knowing how big the gap between the two trucks was the cammers action wasnt nice but was totally within bounds of the law assuming there was enough room between the two trucks. The car in front of the cammer then trying to merge in would be at fault in case of a crash since at that moment he needed to yield to both the trucks and the car that first was behind him and now passing him.In similar cases judges in Belgium have decided that having to yield is absolute on such onramps and therefore you are expected to come to a stop if you run out of onramp and can not merge into traffic.,Roadcam,czi1avk,0,t5_2u6os

6424556,0,t1_czjiagu,I think the UKs system is pretty good its not very difficult like some other European countries but its not pathetic like some USA states. First you need to pass a written test which consists of  multiple choice questions. Then you have to pass a hazard perception test which involves watching dash cam footage and clicking on the screen when you see a hazard arise. Once youve passed this you have two years to complete your driving test before you have to pass the written again. It takes  minutes for a typical driving test. It consists of following the instructions of the examiner hill starts emergency stops parallel parking reversing around a corner and an independent section. For each mistake you make such as being in the wrong gear not looking at your mirrors ect you get a minor point. You can have  of these before you fail or less if you make the same mistake constantly. One major point and you fail instantly such as loosing control of the car crashing ect. You dont have to go to a driving school but most people do. If you can pass all the tests without a driving school you are capable of driving anyway as the practical tests are quite hard.,Roadcam,czju3w0,1,t5_2u6os

6451149,0,t1_czmhjvb,gt Running a red doesnt mean you werent able to completely clear the intersection before it turned red though.I live in NJ and the law here does not say exactly that. Heres what it does say relevant to this discussion N.J.S.A. gtAmber or yellow when shown alone following green means traffic to stop before entering the intersection or nearest crosswalk unless when the amber appears the vehicle or street car is so close to the intersection that with suitable brakes it cannot be stopped in safety. A distance of fifty feet from the intersection is considered a safe stopping distance for a speed of twenty miles per hour and vehicles and street cars if within that distance when the amber appears alone and which cannot be stopped with safety may proceed across the intersection or make a right or left turn unless the turning movement is specifically limited.When I learned to drive in NJ I learned that as a general rule I shouldnt be planning to be in the intersection when the light turns red if that happens I probably could have stopped at the line obvious possible exceptions for conditions like water snow or ice. Interpretating the above language there is not permission given by the law to be in the intersection when the light turns red. Conversely it is not automatically illegal to be in the intersection when the light turns red either. The critical point is that if you can safely stop on the yellow you are legally required to do so. Other states will have different laws.If this video was recorded in NJ which it was not because we dont have snowbirds in NJ this video would show the cammer running the red because the cammer could have stopped safely on the yellow. That said I would have almost certainly done the same thing as the cammer. There is no way the second car in line shouldnt get through the intersection when the light turns green.,Roadcam,czml900,-1,t5_2u6os

6882575,0,t1_d0w0q42,I think the biggest barrier for adoption is the rate at which new cars are put on the road. If you look around more than half the cars on the road are over  years old. Its going to take at least  to  years for the average drivers  arent wealthy to get cars that can drive themselves unless the cost comes down insanely. But everything Ive read says that its never going to be cost effective to retrofit existing cars with automation. So were probably going to have to wait for a full generation of cars to be replaced on the road until we see high levels of adoption.

If I see Ill have to stop for a pedestrian while turning I nervously check my rear view as I know Im at heightened risk to be rear ended as my behavior may be unexpected to other motorists.

7055424,0,t3_4c8k6j,Update from ridergt Id like to give you all an update since you seem very interested. I wrecked in March  I was initially attempting to move lane positions in the center lane to a more visible spot since there was a vehicle trying to turn left with my traffic blocking the view of the car that I eventually hit. The gamble here was that I would move myself to a more compromised location IF she did go but that position might make me more visible and give me more distance from her  hopefully enough to prevent her from going if she checked traffic. Unfortunately when she went without looking I had placed myself in a worse situation and attempted to brake with no hope of stopping in time. Yes in retrospect I should have immediately slowed  as I do now. Even a wreck would have been less severe.gtInjuries fragmented radius ulnar styloid broken off three fractured ribs a collapsed lung a concussion and secondary illness as a result of the chest and head injuries.

7321533,0,t1_d298wfw,A few more detailsAt a typical track day there are corner workers who can see the track and are watching the cars. Its the responsibility of the corner workers to call in the incident and to make sure appropriate responses are happening. Thus the other drivers would be responsible for getting out of the way of the response without causing another incident. Thats why the people behind like the camera car here would be expected to head into the pit if it were a normal track day. The people who are actually involved in the incident should stay in the car if possibleunless its on fire just in case another car hits them. If theyre in the car they have the cars safety systems to help.On the tourist days there arent corner workers. There are people who show up to watch and photograph but theres not the standard structure that exists for races and the typical track day. As a result getting word to the emergency workers can take longer and getting a good response to the people in the incident can be harder. So responses should be much more like they would be on a normal public road where the people who are already there do what they can to help. Id say the big difference between the tourist days and a normal public road is the number of people near their limit at the tourist days is much higher thus the added emphasis on warning approaching traffic.,Roadcam,d2aep3r,4,t5_2u6os

As the car straightened out he spins the wheel left so the wheels will be in the correct orientation so that you dont continue going right once youve straightened up. But since the front end swings right he turned the wheels hard left for the same reason.The key in this situation is to turn the wheel in the direction you want to go and ease up on the throttle enough that your tires have a chance to gain traction. If he was to brake the weight in the car would shift suddenly and definitely cause a wreck.

He actually couldnt park there double yellow lines but I wouldnt expect him to use that as part of his decision. That limited his ability to stop on a busy road.

In any case if he had stopped to let you go by first he could have been rear ended or caused many people to slam on their brakes.     It looks like a bad case of timing with the pair of you coming together at that intersection at poor time.     I also do not know why your having to slow down was a big deal?      From what I see your video is  seconds long the driver with blinker is in your way for less then  seconds max the amount of time it took for you to even reach where he turned is almost two seconds as well. The time it takes for you to get through the intersection lasted far longer then the time that car was in your path.

Its not exclusive to a gender even if some hormones may be more prevalent statistically but factually its not exclusive. Trying to attribute it exclusively to a gender is textbook sexism. This shouldnt even be an issue but it seems a lot of people lack even biology knowledge and thus ignorance shines in the form of sexism.

The second point is that theres no evidence to support. Time after time in events with bystanders people call for help or help out directly.

Am driver.gtThis type of driving behavior is hardly considered reckless or anywhere near the level of what we typically see on rroadcamK so what is your point?  Perhaps from your perspective where death and carnage is a norm this seems pretty light but its certainly still bad.  This type of driving is how the death and carnage starts.  Something bad happens often some place from your perspective so your goal is to try to persuade others against action and words about those bad actions?  Are you hoping to get people to not make efforts to stop reckless and irresponsible driving habits?

Strange because it seems to defeat one of the main purposes of roundabouts which is to keep traffic flowing...In my country if you are going left such as the cammer you would indicate left prior to entering the roundabout and keep indicating until your exit where you would either indicate right or not at all smaller roundabouts dont really allow for indicating on exit in any meaningful way this means that anyone else approaching the roundabout specifically someone approaching from the same entry point as that truck would know that they can either enter the roundabout safely because the nonindicating vehicle is not going to cross their path or slow down in preparation to give way to an indicating vehicle and then enter the roundabout only coming to a full stop if they absolutely have to...Having to yield because a vehicle is on the roundabout and then finding that you didnt even need to yield because they exited the roundabout before crossing your path would annoy the hell out of me...Of course you dont outright trust that a vehicle indicating or not indicating is going to do what you expect so you dont just speed straight into the roundabout but for the most part the system works and roads with roundabouts flow really well...,Roadcam,d4b8unp,1,t5_2u6os

8104835,0,t1_d4r0zcq,gtYes you are absolutely wrong and I am genuinely amazed that you stretched what I said to mean this. That is a MASSIVE bit of putting words in my mouth.Well I stand corrected then. I was not attempting to put words in your mouth. Why bring up the occupants of the vehicle then? Surely you had a point to that. I thought that point was you caring about the occupants. Since this was counter to my caring about pedestrians with no other context I assumed yes I made an assumption that you wanted to protect the occupants of vehicles more than you wanted to protect the pedestrians. Its not that much of a stretch cmon.gt... that doesnt mean that shredding the car is better for pedestrians either.Yes and Ive already said that...gtIf those pillars had been made rigid enough to withstand the impact then any pedestrians behind it would still be dead.You are still not getting it and I cant believe I have to spell this out so bluntly I think having the barrier there at all is too dangerous in incidents such as these. Oh and I dont care how fucking rare they are! If the barrier wasnt there then the shrapnel from the barrier wouldnt be there.gtAnd of course everyone in the car would have almost certainly died.If the barrier was made strong enough I should care because? When you get in a car filled with an incendiary chemical you should be aware of the risks. Should you buy the safest car you can? Sure but I honestly dont care about the occupants of a vehicle when compared to pedestrians.gtThe simple reality is almost nothing could have prevented that car from continuing on its trajectory without completely ruining the accessibility of the intersection. This is erroneous. Firstly the barrier would only have to be made of heavyduty steel and all that does is stop people walking. Guess what the barrier in the video does? Stop people walking. Secondly we are talking about is stopping a car not a truck or a train. Cars are weak in highspeed crashes and often designed with crumple zones so this contributes to absorbing a lot of the speed. They are not wrecking balls that will go through anything they can be stopped. It all comes down to money.gtHow much money are you willing to spend reinforcing every possible intersection just in case an accident like this happens to occur at that particular intersection and happens when there are pedestrians there? Ah ha! Just was I was talking about. I dont want to stop the car no matter how much you think I do. Since the barrier didnt stop the car from mounting the curb then theres no reason to have the barrier. Why? Because it turns into deadly shrapnel.I want to spend less by not having the barriers until somebody comes up with a cheap way of stopping cars from cutting the corner without that protection from turning on the people it is designed to protect.gtDesigning safety systems like this is a balance of a bunch of factors. Safety for pedestrians vs. safety for car passengers vs. effectiveness for its intended purpose vs. cost vs. accessibility vs. probably a few dozen other factors. You have to consider all these factors you cant just ignore everything else and focus on pedestrians though I am not minimizing their importance please dont strawman me again.Why not? Pedestrians have no protection from high speed crashes so they need to be of paramount.gt... you need to ask which is more important protecting  people from usually but not always nonlife threatening injuries or protecting  person from certain death?Ah we have a difference of philosophy dont we? If I had a button that inflicted nonlife threatening injuries to   but saved one persons life Id press it. I might think about it given enough time but Id press it. Its a question I answered long ago. The many can suffer for the few or the one. Call me a monster if you like but this is at the heart of our disagreement.I am a proponent of personal responsibility. When I cross the road if I didnt look and got run down I would feel terrible for the driver. It would be my fault as far as Im concerned. So if a person sees a bus turning the corner standing with their toes on the curb is dumb and I wont spend taxes to guard against natural selection.gtIts really easy to second guess a design after an accident occurs.So everything should be set and never changed... ever? No review process? Its situations like these where no pedestrians were killed that the best type of reform comes from.gtBecause this accident could but almost certainly wont have happened at just about any given intersection in any city in the world.Haha nah. There is a bend in the road and somebody could fall asleep at the wheel and recreate this accident.,Roadcam,d4r210g,1,t5_2u6os

Other places that have tried to pass these laws met with aggressive resistance against the idea claiming discrimination ageism.  Although I see merit for both sides ultimately I think the middle ground and what would probably be best for all is if this regular retesting was required for all.  Even something like retesting every  years to renew a drivers license seems extremely fair and would likely help largely with issues that many see related to senility and ignorant drivers.Personally I think the drivers test is pitiful in its current state anywhere I am familiar with.

8784632,0,t1_d739l7e,Oh yeah my  burned a fair amount of oil had to top it off every couple of fillups. The automatic transmission also got really flaky I never had the reverse issue but if you tried to put too much torque through it off the line it would slip into neutral and youd have to shift it to neutral and back to drive to reenagage it never seen an auto do that. The overheating issue was because the electric fan wouldnt engage until the temp gauge hit the red no idea what temp that actually was but it was definitely higher than normal operating temperature while in motion. Granted the thing had k miles on it when I bought it it was my first car so Im honestly surprised it was still running at all. Eventually upgraded to an  Buick Lesabre with a third of the mileage and sold the Saturn for like a hundred bucks to a buddy at work who was in desperate need of a car. It blew a head gasket several months later unfortunately but at least it kept him going for a little while I guess. When the Buick died I bought my next car a  Hyundai Sonata brand new so I was pretty spoiled for the next eight years never had anything but oil changes and routine maintenance done. Couldnt take it with me when I moved though so now Im back to owning a secondhand car an  VW Golf its had some problems with the brakes its got a few VW electrical gremlins in the secondary systems but otherwise its in decent enough shape at least. Wish I could find a proper shop manual for it though most everything Ive seen only covers the US engines or the TDIs not mines little .l petrol.

In a motorcyclecar crash its the rider not the motorcycle that gets hit. Had you been traveling at a faster speed you might be paralyzed now. Or dead. Motorcycles are very dangerous.

9387590,0,t1_d95si4g,I did a ride along with my local sheriffs department out of sheer curiosity.  They even asked why I was doing it and I explained that it wasnt really a career consideration thing as much as it was curiosity in their work.  They were more than happy to have me come along and actually let me stick around for the entire shift well past am rather than dropping me off at midnight per their policy.  I walked away from that experience with a newfound respect and understanding for the oftenthankless work that upstanding LEOs do on a daytoday basis Im not naive enough to think that all LEOs behave in the way I witnessed during my ride along.  Perhaps most enlightening of my takeaways was the understanding of just how diverse a single shift can be for those deputies drunk tankers dumpster fires fugitive tracking speed traps accident response medical assistance... all in the span of  hours.  Suffice it to say even bringing a layperson like me on a ride along can be fruitful for both sides.  I got a much clearer understanding of what law enforcement does and the sheriffs department now has one more informed citizen in the community that can potentially provide support in various ways drumming up community support voting volunteer work etc..  That said I do agree that ride alongs should be carefully structured to minimize danger to both the LEO and the ride alonger.  If a given route or patrol area is known to be particularly dangerous then perhaps it is not the best option for ride alongs.  I do think however that if the circumstances are reasonably safe for a ride along they can be very beneficial for the law enforcement agency the community as a whole and of course the individual on riding along.Edit spelling,Roadcam,d95xywo,33,t5_2u6os

The  study that the author references just shows that more people are admitted for head injuries through driving and walking than cycling which would make sense considering there are more motorists and pedestrians than cyclists in the first place. It isnt showing that you are necessarily more likely to be injured in a car just that more people experience head injuries in cars and walking than cycling. Which makes sense. Because there are more of them. Not sure how much clearer I can make this. A vague statement I admit. But you are in a much more vulnerable position on the road as a cyclist than in a car.

However because he can filter to the front of the queue he will eventually pull ahead.Exactly. Bikes move faster because when cars get stuck behind other cars the bike doesnt. The thing is those cars wont always get stuck at the next light. Sometimes they will make the next light sometimes they wont. But if you are stuck behind a slow moving bicycle your odds of making the next light drop dramatically. If you do get stuck behind the cycle you are caught in a vicious circle and get stuck at every light that the bike does.Just an aside thank you for debating politely and rationally. I think there are flaws in your argument but I appreciate you making them as you are. I genuinely do support your right to ride and to do so safely and free from harassment but at the same time I do think that there are a small percentage of cyclists who do ride passive aggressively and they make it worse for everyone whether on two wheels or four. All I am asking is for everyone on the road to stop and try to look at things through the other road users eyes.  If more people did that I think everyone would be happier. ,Roadcam,daulnck,2,t5_2u6os

10438863,0,t3_5phy3c,Laying on the horn was a retarded overreaction to a perceived slight. Cammer also overreacts to a lane change at ..At the stop you can clearly see the bus width was as wide as the lane he was up to the kerb to drop off.He was approaching a bend where he is required to use more than his lane because of the size of the vehicle. He is compensating for the swept path of the vehicle as he is not allowed to have his front or rear overhanging the kerbs so he takes both lanes to make the turn. This is standard practice for all large vehicles.The highway code states that you should give way to buses pulling out this one even has the thumbs up sign reminding you of that. He was clearly signalling.Had the cammer been a little more patient yeilded slightly instead of forcing past he wouldnt have been inconvenienced at all.    ,Roadcam,dcrbipz,1,t5_2u6os

10443063,0,t1_dcrqcuz,gt To be fair it sounds like that area was understaffed thenNo it wasnt. There is no possible way you can always have enough resources to cover every possible circumstance. In this case it was a fast moving fire so the  minute delay was enough to make the difference. gt A lot of fire houses have two trucks in them to respond with. As I recall several trucks responded. But they were all responding from stations that were further away then the closest. The issue was not one of too few resources simply where the resources that were available were located at the time. gtThey have the  ability to change what they are doing. Its not like youre for some reason tied up.Not instantly no they cant. Sure they could have left what they were doing gone back to their truck reloaded their equipment and sped off to the new scene but that would have taken even longer and left the elderly person on the floor until yet another unit responded wasting even more time and money.Besides even if this would have been faster it would only make sense if you have foreknowledge of the outcome of not making that decision. As far as I know no one in the SFD leadership is psychic so it is hard to fault them for not making this decision. gt The story you gave sounds like it is the fault of someone higher up making a poor decision of how to prioritize and dispatch.Seriously you could not be more wrong. The only way you can possibly fault the leadership is if you assume that they knew the severity of the fire before hand which of course is not possible. Until someone arrives on scene it is impossible to really know how severe the fire is. It seems like you are trying to rationalize away the cost here.

11150255,0,t1_devu1ip,I watched the video. My comment still stands. The cammer was tailgating and when traffic suddenly slowed he had to slam on his brakes hard to avoid rearending the car in front of him thus reducing the time the person that was tailgating him had to react. Basically it was an accordian with each driver in line having to brake even harder to avoid a collision. If the cammer had been maintaining a safe following distance he could have braked more gradually and the drivers behind wouldnt have had to slam on their brakes either. The person behind the tailgating cammer could have chosen to maintain an even longer following distance to compensate for the cammers tailgating so of course theyre ultimately at fault for the collision. However the cammer contributed to the situation by deliberately not giving himself enough distance to avoid having to brake so hard.Tailgating is bad for everyone anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot.Edit to add Just because you successfully avoid hitting the car in front of you does not mean you were following at a safe distance. It is universally recognized that following time is the appropriate way to measure this and it is generally recognized that two seconds is the minimum for ideal conditions and in fact three or four seconds is preferred for less than ideal conditions. ,Roadcam,devvb44,-6,t5_2u6os

11689373,0,t1_dgksge1,Thanks for taking the time to comment.In NJ my understanding is that it is legal to enter an intersection to make a turn. In practice if I were to wait behind the stop line until all other incoming lanes were clear I would have cars honking and pulling around me. This may not be how drivers would react in other places but in northern NJ staying at the stop line would be considered abnormal and most other drivers would think you werent paying attention to the green light.For this particular intersection it isnt possible to go straight so Im not sure how anyone would assume that I was going straight. The first driver to cut actually pulled forward in the oncoming lane before the stop line in order to pass so they were pretty blatantly cutting. The second driver may have just decided to follow the first cutters lead. Regardless both were doing something that is very dangerous for the person in front of them me in this case and is also quite dangerous for them as neither I or oncoming traffic would expect that.For the van Im always watching large vehicles in front of me and always leave space to be able to pull to one side or the other if necessary.,Roadcam,dgl0b7p,1,t5_2u6os

So I move to lane  to overtake and then they match my speed when Im alongside. Drives me nuts. Then after that you try to speed up a little to pass them because you cant just camp the lane and when you are passed you move back into lane  and resume driving at the speed you were at. Then that useless emptybrained spoon overtakes you and moves back in front of you and then slows down to the speed they were driving at in the first place. URGHHH. ,Roadcam,dgque22,5,t5_2u6os
