I suggest using a towel on your lap for the first few interactions as they have a tendency to defecate as a defence method. Also try keep it pretty low to the ground when handling. If it panics it may let go of you and fall. ,Chameleons,cemeb88,2,t5_2sg2w

2812190,0,t3_2sagu4,So your veiled isnt feeding on crickets?What size crickets are you trying to feed him?Well need pictures of everything... including the animal with some sort of ruler or measure so we can judge size.gt Trying to feed him carrots and blue berries isnt going to work.The idea is to feed his feeder insects those things... so they have them in their guts and when he eats them hell get the nutrition.   Veileds will eat leafy plants and will usually enjoy a grape cut in half lengthwise as a treat if hand fed.We need some pictures of the cage the lights and the setup.please include the strength of the UV light as well as the brand type and your heat source. Something is off about this .. .you should not be having problems. We need to have images of your veiled as well. Please include the brand of supplement and how youve been trying to supply this to him ... how many times per week. Force feeding isnt something you want to do with your animal. Some vets get way too eager for this.  If theyre not eating then its usually because something is really not comfortable. Are you seeing fecal droppings on the cage floor?  the flooring should be clean and empty with no wood chips or sandTake a picture of those droppings  If theres absolutely nothing to be found.. then let us know that as well. ,Chameleons,cnnqkly,1,t5_2sg2w

3042594,0,t3_2uzucf,Are you sure its not the urinates that are at the end of a fecal movement?Those are white and can resemble a oblong egg.The panther females dont turn colors like the veiled or other species doThey deepen their coral pink hues  yes how the females appear really communicates intentions regarding sex opennessSambava pair  Ambilobe pantherblue bar from yesterdays action  and the same female this morningIf I were to show her a male she would quickly go dark and gape as they female panthers dont take multiple males after a successful mating.And you kinda have to be aware of when they become more passive in their behavior. Experienced females will keep their eyes on males longer and exhibit mating posturing including straightening their tails and moving them to the side for easy accessibility. As for you Do not use peatmoss thats acceptable for something like a gecko or another ground dwelling species that lives in the leaf litter. Whoever said that was clearly not someone to listen too.. its facebook adviceWhen it comes to egg laying.. soil and sandy dirt is what is accepted.a nice trick is to have a small plant like a pothos to place inside the laying bin and a large river stone half buried along side or close to it.Thats where theyll dig.Id keep the depth around  depending on the species. We really need some pictures for this femaleIf shes carrying eggs then you should be able to feel them inside of her as a clumpy cluster of nodules. Make sure shes hydrated and fed to help with her passing them.Its that time of the year and she should be laying.Then set the calendar so that  months from now youll be ready again for her.,Chameleons,codd43y,2,t5_2sg2w

3318082,0,t3_2y5jf4,Alright this is usually do their wearing down the nails on the tips  of their grabbers aka feet on the screen.Now theres a stage in their development as sub adults when they have a urge to roam and get out of the cage.  But usually this is motivated by lacking conditions and the cham is trying to move up to get more   more heat more UV light or ... ?So they climb about trying to find a way out of the cage.That wears down the nails. When they reach the top like this and slide down the screen It not only wears the nails down further but it can take the tips of their fingers off as well. Ive seen chams with stubby feet that look like the tips of their feet have been amputated.  This is usually the underlying cause. So let try to fix this if we can. When you get home lets look at the set up and either increase the heat light or it might be as simple as letting it roam around for a bit and sleep overnight outside of the cage to help get a roaming urge out of its system. Theres a natural urge for young subadult chams in the larger species to take off and find their own territories. This is to help not only with the needs for increased food demands but to help reduce the eventual chances for inbreeding,Chameleons,cp6hmzx,2,t5_2sg2w

3756257,0,t3_33f3kd,IF thats a water glass at the bottom theyre not going to see it.It needs a lot more light on it to be spirkley and there water in their minds.Remove the rope ladder... its a waste of space and leads nowhere. set the main basking perch at an angle to the heat source and not directly under it.It should be at a  angle to the light and off to the side so that the animal can broadside the light with its full body vs being under it.  This will help prevent burns as it gives them a large basking range to walk in and out of max exposure and not be close enough to actually burn.The little sphere with the pothos in it.. thats a good cricket habitat.. theyll love it in there... as theyll love the rocks along the surface of the pot. Otherwise its pretty lush.  Most chams will like this when theyre young..but in my experience when theyre older theyll prefer more open space where they can have good line of sight as soon as theyre comfortable in their new space. Dont take what Im saying as harsh criticism what youve done is far ahead of the average first time keeper and shows the amount of thought and effort youve put into it.

4138566,0,t1_crs0iri,ampampamp Rieppeleon brevicaudatus sfw gtRieppeleon brevicaudatus commonly known as the bearded leaf chameleon or bearded pygmy chameleon  is a chameleon originating from the eastern Usambara and Uluguru Mountains in northeastern Tanzania and Kenya It is easily distinguished from others in the Rieppeleon genus by the presence of a beard below the mouth consisting of a few raised scales. At a full grown length of only  in  cm it is marked by somewhat drab coloring in comparison to other chameleons usually assuming a brown or tan coloring. It is quite capable of changing its coloration though often taking on a shade to blend into the background and becoming darker when under stress. It is also capable of compressing its body laterally and producing a stripe down its side mimicking a dead leaf. It often assumes this form when sleeping in the open. It can adopt a variety of colors including yellow green orange black and brown. A common misconception is that these chameleons use their colorchanging abilities as camouflage but they actually use their colorchanging skin to court and show stress or emotion. Males are distinguished by a longer tail more prominent dorsal crest slimmer body type and persistent patterning. Like others in the Chamaeleonidae family it is distinguished by independently rotating eye sockets and a tongue longer than its body.gtgtImage from article iInteresting Chameleon | Rieppeleon Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcrsjlz oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecrsjlz.

LettuceCabbage is no good. Nice leafy dark greens. For drinking it would be best to offer them a small cupshot glass of water they will likely not drink from this without conditioning them to it. So if you can hang a bottle of water above a big leaf poke a small hole in the bottle so it drips tiny drops of water on the leaf this will hopefully encourage them to drink but if they are already in a bay way you might have to help them drink a little but best to avoid that unless necessary.,Chameleons,cuhv2ni,1,t5_2sg2w

The w now keeps him at a toasty .  Still have yet to be able to hand feed him. Anytime Im near his cage he gets all IDFWU.

All i did was staple some fishing line to the ceiling and tie it to the rope.  Hell figure it out that he doesnt have to hold on to the fishing line with his tail every time he walks past it.

6193898,0,t3_40dozq,I have a tree That I put together for Willy so that he can get out of his cage.  Im a believer right or wrong not sure that his cage should be his domain and I only clean it and put food in it.  So he comes out of the home and onto the tree.  I can get him off the tree a lot more easily than I can get him out of his cage.  He hisses a bit head butts a bit but comes onto my hand.  this is willys play gym.  You dont really need a tree...just like a plant or something he can climb out of the cage and get onto.  Now hes out of HIS area and into yours.  It might not be right for others but it works great for me.  Gives him power of his cage and he doesnt realize that IM the one giving him the power so im still in charge.  LOLJust my opinion.

6583047,0,t3_45ojfi,And now that I have more of chance to sit down and type udexterjettster I would love some more handling tips because this b.s. of you cant hold them more then  minutes I had Waldo out tonight again this is the second time hes been out since Ive brought him home  he did great once outside the enclosure which Ive read numerous times throughout this thread that when theyre out of theyre territory theyre much more calm but I put him in a fake ficus tree by the dining room table while we ate and when I went to get him back he puffed hissed and bit. And of course I broke the Cardinal rule and pulled my hand back and afterwards he started darkening so instead of stressing him further I grabbed one of his sticks and allowed him to move over and took him back to his enclosure where he immediately showed off all his colors before falling asleep in the mass cane. Ive been bitten by everything from snakes to hogs so I think the reason I retreated is because Im more worried of how delicate he is and pulling him outta wherever hes at and dropping him so Im considering getting gloves tomorrow and if he bites then Im more prepared for not jerking my hand back. I see how small his teeth are and I know theyre not even gonna break skin but like I said my main concern is his health and I dont think a  foot or further fall will be the healthiest thing for him. I rescued this guy from a gentleman that didnt handle him more then once or twice in the six months he had him so knowing that Ive been hand feeding him crickets and meal worms  I know not the most nutritional snack but my local pet shop was out of horn worms hes been doing great with it. The first day he was a little weary of it but now is to the point where if I have my fingers closed hes looking for the snack.

7248933,0,t3_4en6pr,Very likely a developing lung infection.Stop the misting.Is the age  months from hatch or from when you got him?At this age I wouldnt recommend a screen cage but actually a transitional setup sidebar.At lest for another month.Handle your cham a lot more.Daily in fact. gt I saw him take a huge breath in and made almost a gasping sound. This is the most definitive symptom for people to catch.They are shallow breathers and for them to gasp is an indication of something going wrong.gt  Is it possible he was just hot and thirsty? No.when overheated they blanch out and go for shade.Same with being in extreme thirst.Since you have a shotglass in there  its neither of those.With a developing RI they will first try to bake themselves and bask under the heat source for an extended period of time to get their metabolism up and try to fight off the bacteria.IF youre in the USA you can go and order some baytril online or go to the vet again and get some.Theyre not going to ID a RI in its early stages and even with a mouth swab theyll miss the bacteria that have adapted to live on the saliva. But call them and discuss with them about getting a small amount.   IF not you can order online.Youll just have to figure out the dosages yourself.I can help give you some charts.,Chameleons,d225hs2,2,t5_2sg2w
