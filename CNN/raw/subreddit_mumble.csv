8566986,0,t3_4x3isr,gtNow I know at least from my experience that Mumbles voice activation is pretty shit. Ive never gotten it to work as well as Ive wanted but this is just stupid.This is actually a longstanding complaint with Mumble  there are even messages in our debug output about how hackish our VAD is. I think one of the problems is that none of the people cluey enough in digital audio have enough time to spend to fix the issues with it. Know anyone wanting to do a masters in digital audio signal processing?However have you tried using SNR instead of amplitude? If Mumbles not denoising the hum correctly in SNR or if others can audibly hear it for a prolonged time when transmitting assuming you havent disabled noise cancellation it might be something wed be interested in or punt it up to the Speex people.Amplitude only works better than SNR when you have say a loud toddler in the background that isnt as loud as your speech then you can sometimes get acceptable results with amplitude  the rest of the time SNR is usually better in my experience.I have very little to do with Mumbles audio stuff as I just dont consider myself smart enough to fix it. Digital signal processing is something Ive wanted to dabble with for a while but I havent had time to look into it.,mumble,d6cgbgl,2,t5_2tb6d
