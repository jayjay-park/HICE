You were supposed to understand the pain one goes through when a crooked institution puts men and women in prison when they need education and government support. It shows the pain in the perspective of a father who knows he will die and not see e his daughter. It shows his story. I loved this album because it showed pain it showed that were not equal. ,Jcole,del0p4l,25,t5_2vdqu
11307739,0,t3_619ras,Honestly everything. Start with Friday night lights though youll fall in love with his music. All his free shit is good even better than his albums imo. Cole summer is my favorite Cole song of all time give that listen its super chill. Being high listening to Cole is awesome too just playing it in the background while your playing like k or something ,Jcole,dfdpra3,3,t5_2vdqu
