6852067,0,t1_d0swrgz,Its kind of weird that your first point acknowledges that things are different in our respective countries but still go on to make a list of passive aggressive slightly condescending reasons of why Im wrong that dont necessarily apply where Im from anyway. Its almost as if you werent really interested in what I had to say from the beginning. Your need to tell me that people dont accidentally hit skateboarders while running red lights in your country further indicates that youre probably just trolling. Anyway thanks for playing. Enjoy your day. ,watchpeoplealmostdie,d0szne3,1,t5_2zp03
