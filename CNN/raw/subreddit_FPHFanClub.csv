3742411,0,t3_32uk10,This insipid writer has missed a few critical facts. FPH is not trying to make the world a thinner place.  It is a place for the thin to seek refuge from the endless parade of fat people and having to tiptoe around their delicate feelings.  Thin people have always known that we are the master race.  We will be enjoying a nice mornings jog for years after fat people are too decrepit to leave the bed. Cyber Bullying isnt fucking real.  If you claim to have been bullied on the internet you are a worthless weakling.  Get your head out of your ass and stand on your own two feet for once before the diabetes takes them. Imagining others as perfectly nice and decent people who were being hurt by our own destructive actions was a decent approach before we figured out what horrors lurk in the blubberencrusted hearts of the fat.  Fat people are exactly like Nice Guys.  They never expect that anyone could find a single thing wrong with their attitudes that they are utterly harmless and purely decent and every rejection is an undeserved atrocity.  But truthfully fat people are psychic ghouls who accomplish nothing other than sneering at the successes  successes!  of others while insisting that they belong on the same playing field.  They played the game of health and lost and are now sore losers.  Its not as easy as you think to imagine them as perfectly decent innocent victims.,FPHFanClub,cqiuybt,2,t5_37gpk
