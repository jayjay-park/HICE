99826,0,t1_cepsgk4,when you paste into ps cs at least it gives you the option of pasting as a smart object.  OP stated that he managed to create his artwork to his satisfaction and now moved onto placing it as a watermark.We both seem to know best practices but we still seem to be crossing wires.  at least OP has  people helping him out right?  It is just about lunchtime beer oclock so time to step away from the mouse for me.  good luck OP,illustrator,cepsnha,2,t5_2r2x2
123103,0,t3_1vghvh,I would find a high quality photo of a similar texture wood or fabric of some kind most likely and then convert it to black and white.  Then change the opacity to be low and set the blending mode to either multiply or overlay whichever works best. That should give a similar effect and while it wont be vector per se a big enough size photo should provide a high enough quality texture for whatever size you need for the logo.,illustrator,cesg6v7,1,t5_2r2x2

2095567,0,t1_cl667qk,Just because I didnt explain adequately on mobile I dont believe any of those are necessarily d files. If they are d files for some strange reason they certainly dont need to be. The results above are just stacks of layers.  You may work with .dxf files and these very well could be .dxf files but they dont have to be. Druckenmiller is just a collage of various images and I doubt its rendered because the lighting is off. All three of these have a different approach. The first is the most likely candidate for being rendered. The background looks like an old operation flashpoint environment.  The second looks like photoshop  ground light is different than blue sky is different than plants.   Third one is definitely photoshop theres a background layer and a tombstone layer. the focus difference is quite obvious and the shadow is way off. If it is rendered what theyve done is build the structure in autocadmayawhatever made uv mapped textures in photoshop then taken a still in the render view. I didnt mean for this to sound harsh in any way but if that is what youd like to present for clients all you need is photoshop and a digital camera. There is no depth to these images they are two dimensional. Essentially you could scan your catalog of tombstones magic wand them take a picture of a field put the tombstone on top of the field a little under the horizon line throw some plants on the layer between the field and the tombstone and get the same results as shown above. ,illustrator,cl66ycj,2,t5_2r2x2
2245895,0,t3_2ktphy,Nesting software is the term youre looking for. A search should bring up plenty of options. Usually the cutters software will have it built in.   If you really need to do it in Illustrator there should be some plugins or scripts that will do it. ,illustrator,clpb175,2,t5_2r2x2

2852218,0,t1_cnsa5db,EPS does not support transparency primarily. EPS files are usually bigger often much bigger than Illustrator files. There is simply no reason to use EPS files with InDesign or Illustrator.Illustrator files contain an embedded PDF file with the same settings as the default PDF when you save as PDF. All images embedded at maximum resolution with no JPEG compression all fonts embedded and the colour profile selected when you save. The PDF portion of the file is what InDesign displays and prints. ,illustrator,cnsapyr,3,t5_2r2x2

2994261,0,t1_co88bn5,Sorry if this is posted twice.  Reddit is doing weird things right now.For one thing you dont know how original the work is.  You run the risk of paying for and using a logo only to find out it was stolen from another companydesigner or that the the designer who sold it to you also sold it to several others.Lower prices from sites like Fiverr and the less expensive contests sites water down the market for the prosor even the serious amateurs.  You want how much for a logo?!  Nevermind I can go on the internet and get some guy in India to do it for ten bucks. But the big reason is that its not good for or fair to the designers.  None of the contests are.If you go to designs or a site like it you are getting umpteen designers competing for you.  Theyre all working on spec which means theres no guarantee theyll get paid.  In fact the odds are against them. So they all spend the time put the work out there where anyone can see and do a knock off of it you get to pick and choose what you like and then they get paid anywhere from a couple hundred bucks not bad to a pittance for it depending on the site and what kind of a commission they take.  Basically you have twenty people working for you but you only pay one.Hell some sites dont even guarantee a winner.  The client looks at all of them downloads the photos and then has his nephew reproduce the one he likes for free.Would you want to work that way?  Would you expect anyone else to work for you that way?,illustrator,co8cpxe,4,t5_2r2x2

3788043,0,t3_33pmeq,The quickest way would be to altdrag the new pattern swatch onto the old pattern swatch. This has the obvious problem of changing EVERY instance of the stars to the crosses in your entire document.If youre doing the distortions via distortion meshes then select all of the dmeshes and do objectgtenvelope distortgtedit contents. If the pattern fills are the only thing in the dmeshes then you can immediately click on a new pattern and change them all if not then make a rectangle with the pattern as its fill then do selectgtsamegtfill color and pick your new pattern.You could also duplicate all those distortion meshes onto a new layer or new layers lock the old layers and do this to the new copies if you wanted to have versions with both stars and crosses.It is also worth noting that if you have scaled shifted andor rotated patterns within an object hold down  while using the scale or rotate tools or dragging with the arrow  the free transform tool wont work selecting another fill pattern will retain those transformations. If you choose a nonpattern swatch itll forget them even if you apply a new pattern afterwards.,illustrator,cqo2fc0,1,t5_2r2x2

All of them have different shapes and I use Illustrator for every last one of them.I am assuming that it will either be screen or pad printed. What you need to do is figure out what the distortion will be when designing it as it will be flat. Your template should end up looking something like this Illustrator is VERY accurate to hundredth of a millimeter. The biggest question that you will need to understand is the distortion.I would recommend printing one with lines every two millimeters with a marking so you can understand where everything is going to end up on the design.,illustrator,cs1gm9r,3,t5_2r2x2

But the long shadow seems pointless. Shadows are a way of signifying depth. Its as if your icon was extruded placed veritcally and a light was pointing in that direction. But this scene doesnt make sense if the shadows just go past your text. That imablance makes this off putting IMO. Drop the long shadow and choose a typeface that matches the bold icon.
