243329,0,t1_cf3ea9p,Sorry my desktop was in pieces over the weekend so Im catching up on everything   Currently the app doesnt auto increase your weights based off of what you put in during a workout session  were working on this but  its going to have to wait until we get the new logging system deployed as currently its sloooooow and unstable going from webview htmljavascript up to the DB SQLiteJava. gt The app doesnt seem to remember my workouts when I log them. I press the Save Workout button and the Workout Complete prompt pops up but it doesnt remember any of the inputs I put in after that.Do you mean the workout log isnt saving or is this is similar issue to your first bullet point? Regarding your ICF issue it looks like its not checking the right variable  well fix this for wednesdays update  good catch!,strengthcalc,cf5z1kx,1,t5_2wlrn
