2440339,0,t1_cmd8cu5,Thank you so much it really is tough  its been a month and sometimes I think its harder now that Im mostly done with all the things that needed to be done immediately. Im back at work and that helps but at night at home its really easy for something to just set me off and make me sad. I know thats all normal... I just feel terrible that I dont get to share more time with my wife and that shes going to miss a lot of fun stuff like our debts finally being paid off and actually having money leftover each month our son growing  his birthday is in February hell be . Its hard to imagine not having her organizing his birthday party! My wife was an amazing woman Im glad she graduated nursing school going through school again starting her career over was able to give birth to my healthy son and Im glad we had a wonderful  years total of being together... its just seems weird for me to be  and not have her anymore. We had our wills drawn up so its not like we never thought about death it just never seemed like itd be something real for us for a long time. Even though its a month since she passed the fact that she got ill and then left so quickly still makes it feel like shes here sometimes it wasnt enough time for my brain to really process it I guess. There are days where I have Google Voice open and I have a text message half written about something I wanted to tell her before I remember.What was so hard this last week was that one of my cats had to be euthanized she was  adopted her when she was  and all of a sudden last Tuesday she started making painful sounds so I comforted her and get her to where she seemed OK. When I got home from my half day at work on Wednesday she was on the floor in a pool of her own urine and I knew that it wasnt going to be good  shes always been such a neat freak. I took her to the emergency veterinarian and when they tried to stabilize her her temperature and blood pressure were too low to read she died... I marked that I didnt want her resuscitated but the veterinarian hadnt read the form I filled out so my cat was intubated and revived. I knew that shed need to be euthanized so I guess at least I got to pet her a little while she looked at me before she was put to sleep. It just doesnt seem fair to lose my wife and then less than a month later to lose the sweet cat who loved to be petted and groomed for hours.Thank you again writing like this sometimes helps at least.,inmemoryof,cmdbxn6,3,t5_2s49n
