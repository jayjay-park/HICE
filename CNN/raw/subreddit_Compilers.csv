4273186,0,t3_39sp2l,Hmm its a bit tough to follow the code examples exactly. But it seems reasonable.Im a little unsure about making it use such functional syntax and mixing in imperative ideas. It seems like theres been more interest the opposite way ie elixer which puts ruby syntax on very pure functional programming.But more than anything Id say have a small handful of goals and stick to them closely  if you think adding an imperative concept to a syntactically functional language would improve writing compilers then do it. Once you can justify something new for one specific reason it can show its value in other areas.,Compilers,cs7b0lp,1,t5_2qrgl
5690003,0,t3_3ssi2o,Fwiw here are the steps to build a tiny compiler in Perl .Step  Write grammar    grammar Parser  regex TOP  Input  The grammar construct declares a type of class that contains named regexesTheyre called regexes cuz hysterical raisins but theyre capable of parsing anything eg HTML unlike the limited formal regular expressions discussed in the famous SO about regular regular expressionsExisting production grade grammars range from ones a few lines long eg the JSONTiny grammar to a few thousand lines long eg the main Perl  grammarStep  Test parse with grammar    say Parser.parseInputdisplays    InputThere are tools to assist with debugging grammarsStep  Generate AST    class Actions         method TOP              make  say AST             An action class contains methods whose names are the same as a grammars named regexes. Theyll get called when their corresponding regexes successfully match.A corresponding match object named  cuz Perl  is still a Perl a node in a tree of match objects is passed to each method.The make function is used to store the AST corresponding to the match.Existing production grade Action classes range from ones a few lines long eg the JSONTiny Actions class to ones a few thousand lines long eg the main Perl  Actions classStep  Compile program    my ast  Parser.parseInput actionsActions.astThis parses the string Input which matches which results in a call to the TOP method of the Actions class which calls the make function which stores its argument in the .ast attribute of the match object passed to the method . The overall result of the  .parse call is stored in the ast variable.In a production grade compiler the AST would typically be transformed by further passes including optimization and codegen for an execution target. In this example the stand in for an AST is already in execution target form  its the Perl  code  say AST  to be run by a Perl  compiler.Step  Run program    astdisplays    ASTStep  Write compiler    !usrbinperl    grammar Parser  regex TOP  Input      class Actions         method TOP              make  say AST                 sub MAIN sourcecodefile         Parser.parsefilesourcecodefile actionsActions    If saved in compiler provides help at shell prompt   .compiler   displays    Usage      .compiler ltsourcecodefilegt,Compilers,cx2ef0g,1,t5_2qrgl
