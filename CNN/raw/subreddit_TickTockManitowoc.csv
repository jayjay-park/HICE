7788003,0,t1_d3rf8xo,Yes it was cited in the OP. He put the girl in a barrel burned her for a day then realized it wasnt going to be that easy. He then put her into the fire pit and burned her another day while his wife went to get Smores.The problem is theres a very short timeline they tried to prove Avery was burning the body. Also the cremationlike state of THs remains. Im guessing because someone either saw Avery elsewhere or was on the scene the days after like on the rd when Coborn showed up. Or the pit appeared as it hadnt been used much especially not enough to burn the body the way it was found.Thanks for linking though. I believe I have a past thread kicking around citing this case and the hilarity that ensues when people try to burn bodies. And the fact that the evidence outside Averys does not correlate with real world burning whatsoever.gtbut he was using wood... not tires.Yes. They used wood to burn the pig too.  Million BTUs worth. More than half a cord. And there was still  lbs of bones after. The equivalent is  tires.Way to ignore everything in the OP. The funniest thing is a lot of people are open to Avery being guilty but its obvious she was not burned outside his trailer. Lets just use common sense and pretend we arent children for a second and dont believe in fairytales and just acknowledge the fact that Kratz Pagel Wiegert and Fassbender wouldve made sure the scene was photographed. Now that play time is over the reality is Avery could still be guilty and she couldve been burned elsewhere...but you arent convincing anyone pretending she was burned in that pit. MTSO already admitted she wasnt when they decided not to take pictures.I get it you want people to believe Avery is guilty. And thats fine.

7814372,0,t1_d3ucxvt,I think its an interesting theory but overly complex. What makes more sense is if the  sign is genuine. Perhaps written months before. They think it is going to lead them to TH body so they focus in on it during evidence collection. Then later when they realise it is not connected or not in a way they can work out they use it to hint that he stalked her. Writing her number down multiple times. Writing it next to an address that noone can see a connection with. A frame up  with too many players would never work. There would be a leak. I think what would be helpful is to find out if Ertl likely took the photos. He seemed keen to distance himself from the shoddy evidence collection at other areas and on the stand didnt seem to concerned about covering for his colleagues incompetence. Additionally the hand writing is a good match to Avery and it is not an AT sign. Framing surely wouldve made more sense if it was on an AT sign? ,TickTockManitowoc,d3uee8l,1,t5_3eqc9

7835034,0,t3_4ml6wu,I had a crazy thought the other day while listening to the message over and over and over what if this message WAS for the Js but had been left the st time Teresa came out to take pictures for them for Barbs husband I think. I dont necessarily think this is what happened but it could be a possibility.We obviously cant rely on the timedate stamps those have to be wrong. And I agree it is likely the power went off amp time was never reset. Barbs machine had  messages on it so they werent the type to delete messages as soon as they were received. Im not sure how long ago it had been since Teresa had taken pics for Barbs husband but maybe they had saved the message for that long. Or more accurately just never deleted it.My work messages just say the day of the week they were left not the actual date. So if I save a message and listen to it weeks later it is hard to tell how long ago it was left. Maybe their machine was similar.Since timedate is wrong on the machine the only way to narrow down when that message was left is to find out when the message before amp the message after were left.My reasoning for this is that it seems Teresa had both the Js and the Zs addresses. Even if the Zs address was incorrect it seems odd that she would say she didnt have it. Finally the big hole in my theory is that no one in the J family said hey that message has been on our machine for weeks.

Maybe this is why the prosecution never called her because they too knew it was likely not who she saw?I think she saw someone else too and she admits it was most likely another day on the stand. In her first statement says she doesnt remember if it was Mon Tues or Wed. So thats probably why prosecution did not use her.

8257266,0,t1_d59mfc1,The plea bargain system still exists here in Canada it is just referred to a little differently. Here in Vancouver prosecutors for the Crown can use joint recommendations which is essentially a plea bargain. Both here in Canada as well as in the US they are not official until reviewed and accepted by a judge. I think Wikipedia explains this well so instead of me saying it Ill quote thisgt In Canada the courts always have the final say with regard to sentencing. Nevertheless plea bargaining has become an accepted part of the criminal justice system although judges and Crown attorneys are often reluctant to refer to it as such. In most Canadian criminal proceedings the Crown has the ability to recommend a lighter sentence than it would seek following a guilty verdict in exchange for a guilty plea.gt Like other common law jurisdictions the Crown can also agree to withdraw some charges against the defendant in exchange for a guilty plea. This has become standard procedure for certain offences such as impaired driving. Note that in the case of hybrid offences the Crown must make a binding decision as to whether to proceed summarily or by indictment prior to the defendant making his or her plea. If the Crown elects to proceed summarily and the defendant then pleads not guilty the Crown cannot change its election. Therefore the Crown is not in a position to offer to proceed summarily in exchange for a guilty plea.gt Canadian judges are not bound by the Crowns sentencing recommendations and could impose harsher or more lenient penalties. Therefore the Crown and the defence will often make a joint submission with respect to sentencing. While a joint submission can entail both the Crown and defence recommending exactly the same disposition of a case this is not common except in cases that are sufficiently minor that the Crown is willing to recommend a discharge. In more serious cases a joint submission normally call for a sentence within relatively narrow range with the Crown arguing for a sentence at the upper end of the range and the defence arguing for a sentence at the lower end so as to maintain the visibility of the judges ability to exercise discretion.gt Judges are not bound to impose a sentence within the range of a joint submission and a judges disregard for a joint submission is not in itself grounds for the sentence to be altered on appeal. However if a judge routinely disregards joint submissions that judge would compromise the ability of the Crown to offer meaningful incentives for defendants to plead guilty. Defence lawyers would become reluctant to enter into joint submissions if they were thought to be of little value with a particular judge which would thus result in otherwise avoidable trials. For these reasons Canadian judges will normally impose a sentence within the range of any joint submission.gt Largely unique to the Canadian justice system is that further negotiations concerning the final disposition of a criminal case may also arise even after a sentence has been passed. This is because in Canada the Crown has by common law standards a very broad right to appeal acquittals Citation Needed and also a right to appeal for harsher sentences except in cases where the sentence imposed was maximum allowed. Therefore in Canada after sentencing the defence sometimes has an incentive to try and persuade the Crown to not appeal a case in exchange for the defence also declining to appeal. While strictly speaking this is not plea bargaining it is done for largely the same reasons.I also dont know that in the US the plea bargain system is at fault for wrongful convictions. the plea bargain system doesnt lend itself well to innocent convictions. False confessions happen sure. We seemingly see that in this debacle. But most people who are innocent would fight for their innocence rather than just accept a plea bargain. Again it is not a perfect system but plea bargains are not  the problem in the US in my eyes. ,TickTockManitowoc,d59pr5h,1,t5_3eqc9

8353919,0,t1_d5lp8y9,Yes if we go by the CASO report so early statements the first time someone claimed to get a VM full message was TP at around noon on .  Then  WeigertLeMeiux get the message when they try calling her cell at around  pm on . BC reported he tried her at  pm on  but found the mailbox was full. And finally Lt. Sippel tried to call around around  am on  and also found the mailbox was full.If you look at the trial testimony of TP he changes his story to include attempts to reach TH on  and  and says he found her mailbox was full then too but Im pretty sure he is incorrect as it wasnt in his early interviews and she received VMs right up until  am on .The fact that the state didnt provide her actual billing report seems very shady to me.  But to me one of the oddest things about the VM stuff is that MH states that when he accessed her VM at around  pm on  that he believed there were  messages which would seem accurate since the VM record presented at trial showed that as of  there were  messages.  The problem I run into is that the Cingular rep testified that the mailbox would not be full based on the  total messages that were on that record this includes the  message.  How can that be?  Well heres the only explanation I can come up with There were more than  messages when MH accessed her VMs remember by noon on  people were reporting the mailbox was full not too mention that Weigert and LeMeiux supposedly found the mailbox was full right around the time that MH claimed he accessed the VMs.  I dont think MH deleted VMs on  bc Lt. Sippel got a vm full message on the morning of  and no VMs came in after MH listened to the messages on the evening of  at least as far as we can tell from the records we have. MH was coached by KK on how many messages should have been there on .  Someone deleted VMs sometime after am on .I just dont see how else it could have happened.  So the exact question imho is who deleted VMs after am on  and why?  If my assumption about the timing of the VM deletions are correct it would have to be someone who either had the phone not sure if accessing VMs directly from the phone would show up on any of the cell reports since TH didnt retrieve her messages this way rather she called the   as we can see on the cell record or someone who did it remotely which would require a password.  Possible reasons to delete VMs that I can think of include trying to hide incriminating information about the person deleting the messages trying to protect THs reputation or getting rid of information that refutes the states timeline andor theory of the crime.Sorry Ive spent probably too much time with the cell and VM records lol,TickTockManitowoc,d5lsk2a,4,t5_3eqc9

I dont know what is going on with the trim but I dont think its a Photoshop fuck up  The light source is coming from higher up its either early morning or late afternoon.  The bucket is deeper round and taller than the door panel and will throw a longer shadow.  Additionally if they made a shadow by painting a solid color into the car interior the glass would also be more brown.

8690173,0,t1_d6rugv1,I think this line of thought is where people get lost. Sure maybe Steven did it somehow. He surely didnt do it the way the prosecution said he did and if the prosecution doesnt present enough clear evidence youve got to vote not guilty. Juries are supposed to be instructed to look at the evidence presented by the prosecution during the trial and decide if it convinces them that only the accused person could have done the crime. It doesnt matter if you think the accused is a creep if he beat his girlfriend if he COULD have done the crime. Did they prove he DID? I dont think they did. The jurors in this case used their personal feelings to vote guilty and thats not right. You nailed it the bullet and the key were both planted and that helps determine that the rest of the evidence is also questionable which is how I changed my mind. If the jury was confused about the validity of any piece of evidence they should have questioned the validity of all the evidence and voted not guilty. ,TickTockManitowoc,d6rwefb,5,t5_3eqc9

The amount of concurrent trial media coverage the infamous press conference the daily briefings to manage the public perspective is one thing then the expose in MaM and now the fallout with a HUGE international public scrutiny is important to understand when it comes to criminal justice in the US and elsewhere through compared systems in other countries.For this issue of transparency youve found a missing piece of the law compliance date limits. Your professional press organisation should put this on your lobbying list as an amendment needed to meet the intention of the original law if the gov is not living up to reasonable.

8708727,0,t3_4z8cxo,Sorry everyone but Im still sticking with my first gut instinct from way back on that other sub... It was RH and SB.  If you want to talk motive opportunity and direct connection to the victim it doesnt get any clearer than these two.  SB telling MW that TBs car wasntt anywhere to be seen on that Tuesday shows he knew something was up.  His inability to look at the camera during his first news interview.  Sketchy as hell.  Then we had RH deleting voicemails from TBs phone after guessing her username and password.  Then they both created a fake call record of her cell phone calls to hide calls they didnt want the police to know about then....if thats not enough they are the ones that directed the search and assisted POG in finding the RAV.  These two are the most logical suspects.  They planted the RAV and entered the property during the search.  Remember they were on the log sheet twice.  Signed out twice but only signed in once.   They played AC and thats why he called in the plates that night. then JL had to come up with the RAV key in order to fix the mess.  I dont think AC and JL new RH and SB were behind killing her at the time they just wanted to cover the fact the RAV was found without a search warrant.    BOOM!!!Their motive or RH motive was simple age old jealousy and rage.  SB and TH had hooked up and this set RH off.,TickTockManitowoc,d6u866c,2,t5_3eqc9

8722097,0,t1_d6vrblt,Thanks but I dont trust this information as written I think its sloppy reporting at best.  They switch back and forth between motion and brief as if the terms are synonymous or interchangeable but they arent.  They are much different in both scope and magnitude and my understanding is that they are each filed with a different court.AFAIK the brief must be filed with the Court of Appeals located in Waukesha not Manitowoc and their website says it must to be filed electronically in addition to paper filings.  I suppose its possible she may also have to file one or more copies of the brief in Manitowoc and those copies would have to be paper copies but there should also be an electronic copy filed with the Court of Appeals.  In terms of a motion to access evidence AFAIK that would indeed be filed in Manitowoc and that does need to be filed on paper.  But a motion is not the same as a brief.  The Manitowoc County Clerk of the Court can speak to how she needs to file certain types of motions but shes not the right person to ask about the brief instead they should be asking the Clerk of the Wisconsin Supreme Court and Court of Appeals about that.EDIT fixed typos,TickTockManitowoc,d6vwin8,6,t5_3eqc9
8722373,0,t3_4zgnf7,gtIve started rewatching MaM and Im just so conflicted. BD confession was bullshit and there was no DNA inside the home or garage but what about the SA cell mate Averys obsession with TH the three  calls made to TH by SA? Dassey illegal confession he talks about moving the rav and SA removing the battery didnt they find non blood DNA under the hood? How could that have been planted?Never trust anything a cell mate says. I have not read anything to indicate Steve was obsessed with her. There were two  calls made.  Lots of people did in those days. He had already made the appointment through auto trader and told everybody he had to leave early to meet her. All the  calls show is that he had her cell number and could have made the appointment privately as he did on October th without anybody knowing about it. Steve called Auto Trader again sometime after am and was told she would be coming that afternoon.  That is how he knew she was coming that day. Fassbender told Brendan they knew through Blaine that he did not see Teresa or the RAV when he got home and prompted him to say the RAV was in the garage. Later they asked him who moved the RAV  which had already been talked about dozens of times on February th and the entire state of Wisconsin knew where it was found. Fassbender asked Brendan why Steve went under the hood. Until that point Brendan had made no mention of Steve going under the hood.  And at no time did Brendan mention the battery. At trial they speculated that it was contaminated at the crime lab by a tech not changing his gloves. ,TickTockManitowoc,d6vxrda,4,t5_3eqc9

They might be able to prove that the report could be made more clear by maybe adding a field for the seizure date or being more specific about the existing date column. But Ill be surprised if any judge just looks at that report and accepts its obviously the seizure date without.... getting confirmation in some way. Its also possible I admit  that the date is correct and the car was actually seized on .  But to offer that proof Id have certainly verified that and offered explicit proof. ie car impound report etc. Im just assuming that there is more involved with seizing a car than simply tapping a code into a computer system.,TickTockManitowoc,d6zas0x,1,t5_3eqc9

8754186,0,t1_d6ztblm,His post didnt exactly feel neutral though  I think its purely a case of lessthanoptimal wording but he said he was skeptical based on the fact that she hadnt laid out supporting evidence for some of her claims. He seemed to assume he understood the legal process and to conclude that Zellner wasnt doing things correctly. That raised some emotions and some posters regrettably responded before trying to back away from the emotions. I felt the emotions too but I took a step back because I know him to be a reasonable poster. I didnt believe he had any ill intention here or even that he was assuming Avery is guilty I dont know his stance and dont care. I asked myself how two reasonable people him and me I like to think could reach such completely different interpretations of the same document. The answer I got was I think he was expecting an appeal and instead got a motion which kind of sounds like its laying out a case without foundation. I get that it read that way. However I have been around lawsuits before and Ive read some cases and Im aware that motions can be pretty speculative. Theyre arguments not cases. So I concluded Skipp was merely approaching the document with the wrong set of expectations. Its regrettable that people assumed the worst of him instead of trying to work out his thinking. ,TickTockManitowoc,d6zxiqt,22,t5_3eqc9

Either way he at least deserves a new trial.I try not to be  certain about anything even SAs innocence.

I imagine LE thinks he is whether they have stated it publicly or not.  Too many people try to interject how they think they would act if they committed a crime yet are too dense to understand no two people act the same way.

8854709,0,t3_51iatp,The current management and control in Dasseys circle troubling at best. Their appointed spokesperson and manager of the FB group was as I recall someone brand new to their circle who was pulled from one of the random protests and then became very close with them she also has a lessthanclean record from what I read at one point earlier.Rather than their Facebook page being about promoting Brendan Dassey and spreading thoughts and support to him far and wide they instead restrict content they post and explicitly forbid people from sharing the content on Twitter or other platforms. They also did numerous lengthy live stream chats that I found awkward and unnecessary with this spokesperson doing most of the talking rather than Barb or anyone else. When one of these was reposted elsewhere for those outside of the closed cricle to see those in charge got angry and deleted it from their page and said there would be no more done since it was shared.Some time back a photo was posted of all of these expensive electronics already purchased as part of the socalled homecoming for Brendan. An HDTV gaming console and much more. Brendan had also attacked CC for allegedly spending money from another fund for her own use as well. There is an ugly feud between both camps and I believe much of it stems from both sides wanting a piece of the pie and trying to capitalize off of MaM in ways that are doing nothing to benefit the two still in prison. I dont think everyone involved in Avery and Dasseys current inner circle have perfectly well intentions.,TickTockManitowoc,d7c7lhf,7,t5_3eqc9

Then they proceed to ask the witness who testified about SAs record and worked for his cell company to interpret the Cingular records.  Why not just get a proper Cingular witness.

He goes inside his trailer with the AT stuff.  She turns her car around pinging the other cell tower  she gets the call from Dawn she is talking to her.  Bobby comes out doesnt see Steve but does see her car.  Easily she could have been talking to Dawn and he did not notice she was in the car he really isnt paying attention.  While she is speaking with Dawn she drives out of the Avery drive way and heads to perhaps the Zipperers.  Mean while SA leaves his trailer thinking Bobby was home sees he is gone and heads towards his Mothers or maybe his mother delivers his mail she is on her cart he hops on and they head towards her place.  They discuss selling the front loader he tries to reach TH before she is too far away.  So this could explain the  minute difference.,TickTockManitowoc,d7ryv5n,2,t5_3eqc9

They did take groin swabs from himsans warrant. Ostensibly these were discarded but there is speculation they were used to plant that sweat DNA which really isnt a thing per se. Because it was never used to allege sexual contact and really there is NO evidence of rape whatsoever the description KK presented seems to have been lifted from his own playbook we can assume there was no evidence of the victim present. Which is consistent with the entire case really. No evidence of the victim in places where an allegedly gruesome torture for which there is also no evidence is said to have occurred.

I dont care what else Steve did he didnt kill Teresa and shouldnt be in prison for it. If he should be in prison for something else they should damn well do their job and put him in prison legitimately for the other thing.In rape cases puffed up defense attorneys try to disparage the victim as promiscuous or dressed wrong and asking for it as if such a thing exists. This is no different Steve has been raped by this system and I couldnt care less how he dresses or if he is promiscuous. The family is messy poor and often not well educated which in my mind makes them perfect targets for crooked puffed up bombastic self congratulating LE and attorneys.

9062496,0,t3_54eg1h,Theres always been proof that whatever Brendan said came directly from the investigators or it was information commonly known at the time. You just gave  examples.gt at ish there is a department video of Averys garage. There is a x area of the floor chalked off behind the tractor. Meaning sheriffs chalked that area before Brendan ever mentioned it.Its not like they washed the chalk off the floor later that day. So its very easy to know that if you walked in that garage at any time afterwards you know the police were very interested in that area. My guess is the investigators told Brendan about this area anyways but if by chance they didnt its easy to see why Brendan said something happened there.gt Because its Kratz ...bringing up perspiration..months before his sweaty press conference and Brendan supposedly telling Wiegert and Fassbender unknown details such as hood latch sweat You should go back and listen to the interview. They are asking Brendan what they did after they dropped the Rav off. Brendan starts his guessing and even says Steven forgot the gun in there and had to go back for it. Anyways its a Im just going to come out and ask you who shot her in the head moment. They flat out ask him if Steven opened the hood. Of course Brendan says yes but cant tell them why he did it he just did.

Im no Trump fan but he did a masterful job of playing up to the fears and biases of many Americans in a strategically successful way to carry the Electoral College votes necessary to win.  Part of that was being openly politically incorrect.  Part was being very unspecific in the promises he lied about keeping versus HRC being very specific about the promises she made with no real intention of following through.  Pretty much every candidate lies and promises things that they know they dont intend to provide or that they know they wont be able to provide.

9740066,0,t1_dadg73i,Replying from mobile traveling from holidays but here is the basic response Yes there were instances in which testimony was overstated however there is a major caveat that you wont hear in the public story.Standards were more lax back then and they didnt know as much as they do now in terms of research and that led to some issues. The caveat though is the review also from what I have heard included things said by the attorneys during the trial. The reason that is a major caveat is that attorneys can state or misstate whatever they like and unless called on it it goes.  For example in Forensic Document Examination one of the conclusions I can use is to the effect of It is highly probable that John Doe wrote the signature on Item . That sounds like a strong opinion and it is but it is not the strongest opinion I can use which would be John Doe has been identified as the writer of the signature on Item . So whats the difference?As a scientist I know and am bound by the limitations of the science.  Therefore I HAVE to acknowledge any limitations in my conclusion because I know the weight limitations can have.  The problem is that even if I know the limitations and temper my conclusion properly there is nothing preventing an attorney from staying in closing arguments saying something like You heard from a Forensic Document Examiner who told you that John Doe was the writer.While that may sound like semantics it is actually significant.  So how does that play into the FBI hair study? If the testimony was mischaracterized by the attorney it was counted as if the examiner overstated the conclusions. Yes there were some instances where it was an error by an examiner but the numbers are widely blown out of proportion because of this method of accounting.,TickTockManitowoc,dadocai,2,t5_3eqc9

He played an enormous role in the investigation. He helped coerce a confession that was not corroborated by any forensic evidence from the mentally limited teenaged BD. He allowed the burnpit to be demolished with heavy machinery after not properly documenting any of the remains supposedly collected from it. He allowed the burn barrels to be collected and brought to a Sheriff dept then let one be brought back to the alleged crime scene. He allowed members of the MTSO who were personally deposed in the civil lawsuit to search SAs trailer numerous times but barred the coroner from examining the burnpit. This was a state sanctioned frame job.EDIT He also supposedly found the Zander road for sale sign in SAs trailer on the th but didnt send a single officer to investigate the address until November th. He didnt investigate who was deleting TH voicemails on November nd. He didnt ask for or corroborate alibis from the men in THs personal life. He didnt record the interview with BD at the Fox Hills resort. He took THs sister to Kohls to find a pair of Daisey fuentes jeans TH may have worn and then later found rivets from DF jeans but no zipper or button or shoe eyelets.

I dont think we can honestly say that her sex life is none of our business.  I mean  while it isnt technically our business it absolutely may be a piece of the puzzle that we are trying to solve.I think OP helped to clear up the question of whether or not TH was promiscuous.  Knowing that she had a limited number of partners  and was not the type to go out on the prowl definitely reduces the pool of suspects and motives.

9940497,0,t3_5hv482,I try to avoid critiquing the Halbach family as we only see a small snippet of them. I personally dont find it odd that they didnt cry at all during the trial. Several years ago my grandmother died the week of my wedding. I didnt cry during her funeral. I sat there pretty much stone faced behind enormous sunglasses. I was afraid that if let myself cry I would start sobbing uncontrollably and I preferred not to do that publicly. That didnt mean that I didnt cry at home though. As for them not asking questions publicly we dont know what they might be thinking behind closed doors. For all we know they could have just as many questions as we do. I consider the possibility that they may not want to make a public statement either way until they see how the case unfolds out of fear of looking foolish if their opinion turned out to be wrong. What would people think if they came out publicly supporting the conviction? Or if they questioned the investigation and SA wound up being guilty? Some suggest they should be screaming from the rooftops demanding justice but why? KZ took the case shortly after MAM aired so someone is looking into it and with her reputation if there is anything to find shell find it.

That is if the air compressor was even there when they dug up the floor. Logic would dictate that the bullet would have been found during a thorough search before digging up the floor making a big mess and contaminating possible evidence.Regardless the bullet would have been covered in concrete dust just as the bottom of the tool box is IMO.,TickTockManitowoc,dd2f5kl,9,t5_3eqc9

If one piece of evidence is planted whos to say that more isnt? Police arent there to decide guilt or innocence thats what a judge and jury is for. To plant evidence is to make the planter judge jury and executioner and thats a terrifying thought especially considering how many wrongful convictions happen.Edit to expland a bit on my point about myself not being here to set him free what I meant is that we are all entitled to a fair trial and I dont think SA got one  guilty or not.,TickTockManitowoc,dda260t,32,t5_3eqc9

10656407,0,t1_ddf0l9g,There is a litany of cases where someone in law enforcement tries to do the right thing and expose wrongdoing only to find themselves shunned by their colleagues demoted or sacked.  When those at the top are corrupt promote those below them who are corrupt there is no hope.  Law enforcement has a rather peculiar ethos in that they know they can only exist if they have the consent of the people they are meant to serve.  Therefore they conclude any wrongdoing or corruption should be covered up so they dont loose that consent which in turn opens the door for wrongdoing and corruption as the perpetrators know it will be covered.  Until some kind of task force smashes up their cosy existence replacing it with one that is open honest and accountable the status quo will continue.

Thank God for latex paint.  It doesnt hold up as well but its certainly easier to clean up.  I paint a little as on canvas and I use acrylics more than oils even though they dont look nearly as good and are not as workable simply because the turpentine or mineral spirits give me a headache....and are a PITA to use.   That garage had everything under the sun in it as many garages do especially perhaps one belonging to a salvage yard owneremployee.  So no surprise they found paint thinner and gasoline.

Those look like Qtip spots because they are  from evidence collection at least where the dots are.And youre right  it looks thin not like the smear on the side of the door frame. Maybe who did it was running out of sample. Lets say they started applying at the rear passenger door then dropped onto the front passenger seat and the CD case then onto the console as the person had the last of it and had just enough to put near the ignition. See the post by Openmind from yesterday about the layout of the blood travel on the car looking from overhead.

The world was still somewhat new and I was just struggling to get my bearings.I would imagine Brendan has some fuzzy memories but when he thinks back to them with what he knows now it probably hits him in the gut and takes his breath away when it becomes crystal clear just how much he was being tricked by adults in positions of authority that he was taught to trust and obey.It would be the worst living hell to be imprisoned and to know that it might have been prevented had you not been as naive had known more about your rights and had a trusted adult who could help you assert your rights.How can he ever trust anyone again? To him all adults must be suspect. Anyone who tells him trust me this will help you. What a shitty way to lose your innocence.What they did to him was  illegal. Why is it not seen as kidnapping to take a minor child lie to his guardian that this is just an interview you dont need to be present. And then fail to tell the child he has the option to leave at any time?Kidnapping. Illegal imprisonment. Unlawful detainment.

Which I think could even be explained by I helped him pick up the yard  meaning he was taking thinks from the yard that needed to be burned. That could be deemed as cleaning up the yard.So the only thing I might add is that it conflicts with what he said at his trial because he did talk about the cleaning in more detail as cleaning the garage floor.One question I have is can we verify that Barb called steven at ? Ive never seen any confirmation of this. Anyone know of anything that verifies this?Verifying that call with both barb and phone records is significant.

He talks about SABD sex fantasies and almost all of the things he accused them of he is guilty of. The only thing that he isnt guilty of it seems is murder... or is he? He almost certainly knew of TH through her older brother. Was he her stalker? KK shows up on the crime scene WAY too early AND hes said he was involved in the search. He asserts himself into the crime scene immediately. Hes the Boss. Hes around when the evidence is planted. He OBVIOUSLY coached witnesses. He likely told FactbenderLiegert what to plant into BDs confession.In the interview where the comedian accuses him of murder? He blushes... I dont believe KK thinks SABD did it. So if he does know who did it why the hell does he blush? Shouldnt he be a bit disgusted by this accusation? AND HIS RESPONSE!?!? gt I have an alibi....Who the hell responds to that question in that manner? Its creepy as hell. And you know what? He doesnt share his alibi. And why the hell does he HAVE an alibi unless he thought he needed one?

11095769,0,t3_5yew4e,For those who do not want to click the above link here is the text sorry if this is not allowedTLDR He thinks RH could have dumped THs body in the lake if he happened to be fishing that day because well...why not? and is asking for witnesses to come forward.edited to remove full namesIf RH killed TH there is no way he burned her body and dumped her ashes and bone fragments in the back of SAs house.  There is nothing about THs bones which make any sense at all whether you believe SA killed TH or whether you believe it was someone else.  What it actually looks like is someone came along at some point and didnt quite know what they were doing and scattered her bones around all over the place without thinking it through very clearly.But actually thats not true.  They did think it through clearly enough for all expected circumstances.  It would have been plenty good enough for what would have usually happened but if whoever planted the bones had any idea that their actions were going to be the subject of intense scrutiny by a global audience ten years after the fact they might have had second thoughts.  But no one could have known this so they were no more careful than the circumstances warranted.We can get into the bones more later but the DNA found on the bones was such a slight amount and the dental records also dont seem to be standing up to closer scrutiny nowadays either.  Ill get to that one on another post.  For now Ill just say that we know they collected THs laundry from her house and all of her personal items and  all of these items had plenty of THs DNA for a millions false convictions.  What a simple thing to do to transfer it onto a few bones.More than likely KK figured this out.  He after all had unimpeded access to evidence storage and even a macabre fascination with dead bodies if the invitation he extended to one of his sexual assault victims to tour the local morgue and view an autopsy is any thing to go by.  Police evidence lockers contain evidence going back decades.  Forty fifty years.  Get a few bones chop them up but them on your backyard barbeque say and in an hour or less the sick bastard had what he needed plus some spare ribs.Why did he bother?  Because when youre trying to frame someone for murder nothing works better than having the body.  Without one youre just pissing in the wind.  All the other stuff that was planted on the Avery property wasnt necessarily enough to frame SA.  It probably would have but it wasnt a slam dunk and KK needed a slam dunk because this was going to be his ticket to glory and he was right.  After the successful convictions of SA and BD I think he won some prosecutor of the year award.  I know that MW and TF were recognized for their excellent service and of course who can forget LK who was given a judgeship for his trailblazing legal work.But how could you have a body and not really have a body at the same time? As Ive pretty much already explained.  But also KK took care to make sure that a lot of the bones were missing except conveniently that tiny fragment which has a bevel indicating a gunshot wound.  That way there would be no way to piece them all back together which they very likely might have have done.To conceive of this and pull it off successfully would take the mind of a very twisted and sick person and KK has pretty much fit the bill for that the more weve gotten to know him.  Hes all over television and radio these daysa dream come true for any narcissist worthy of the nameso we sleuths and students of human psychology can count this as a gift because it gives us more opportunities to observe him.  You may draw your own conclusions but I think he delivers with each new appearance.But who knows maybe it was TF.  MW?  Who sprinkled the bone fragments?  It doesnt matter.  Whats important however is what did happen to THs body?  Today it hit me today thinking about it as I am wont to do.A fishing trip!  Im guessing that RH also had access to a boat.  If someone asked RH where he was or what he had been doing this is what he would tell people.  The average depth of the lake Michigan the Great Lake which abuts Manitowoc is almost  feet.   meters.  This is an important consideration because disposing of a body in a lake is usually illadvised for murderers who do not wish to be caught.  In shallower bodies of water bodies will begin to float up like balloons released to the sky as they become like airfilled sacks of flesh after the gases of decomposition begin to be collect.  But the pressures at much greater depths either compress these gasses or force them out of the body thus greatly reducing the chances that they will rise to the surface at some later date.But RHs pretty smart and if he did kill TH and this is the way he disposed of her body I have a lot of faith that he took the necessary precautions to weigh the body down.I have no idea what RH ever said to people about the day in question so there is no way that I should be able to know what he said he did on October st . This post is really intended then for those people who know RH and heard him explain what he was doing that fateful day.  Its a bit of a long shot frankly but is his alibi if you could call it that that he went fishing?  If it is how the heck would you suppose that I would know such a thing?I should make it clear I realize that I dont think that RH and KK were working together.  A conspiracy of any kind between them is not actually necessary and in fact I do not believe it is likely.  As mentioned in a previous post KK wrote a letter to SA in  asking SA to come clean on the murder.  By the wording of the letter it seems fairly clear that he still believed at that time SA was the THs killer.  If he knew that RH killed TH he obviously wouldnt believe that.I know from my Google Analytics that most of my readers in the United States are in Wisconsin.  I know that some of my readers know RH and some are within his inner circle.  The public still doesnt know exactly what happened or what RH said he was doing the day TH died because the cops never bothered to ask.  But I know he still had to give an explanation.  So hey if you believed him all along no worries.  We all want to believe the best in others especially if we know them well and have given us a reason to trust them.  But if he went fishing that day you know I have to be right and if I am I am calling upon you to do the right thing.

If you are flying over a salvage yard you are looking for a vehicle right?Also its quite a common thing in missing persons cases to be looking for a car because that is far easier to identify than a person often. You find their car and you might find clues as to where they are or what happened to them. So its a key factor in a missing persons case for sure. That being said I think the flyover snipping right where wed see the location of the vehicle is extremely suspicious. The fact that someone cant simply take some high resolution photos during the fly over and analyze those after the flight is beyond me.

SC concluded that there was no blood on them and only mention of DNA results were that there wasnt enough of male DNA found to complete a full STRprofiling though male DNA was apparently found on them.Ah thanks for that. So there was a partial on the plates. When I scanned her reports I didnt spot it. I was looking for codes A where  were numbers. These were AJ and AK. They do show up in her Exhibit  document.I wonder how much that partial MALE DNA was? She managed to make determinations with partials in other circumstances or at least reported on them.gt gt gt gt Why the blinker wasnt tested is beyond me though or even the lug wrench just to be sure. Only someone connected to the murder could have placed the blinked under that seat. The only reason as to why not test it would be that they feared it would implicate someone else than SA imho.The blinker position is less of an issue for me because I think weve suspected it was put under the seats by the crime lab people to look under them.

But Im surprised there hasnt been more discussion about the actual wording of the warning such a pervasive part of culture now in the US and even abroad through media. Because Fifty years later the Miranda decision hasnt accomplished what the Supreme Court intended It clearly didnt protect Brendan does anyone know offhand where the transcript or audio is of the Miranda process with Brendan?I just found another article by Wisconsin lawyer Michael Cicchini who recently posted here uWIScrimDEFENSE on this issue in  whether the Miranda warning conveys those rights accurately completely and in a way that suspects can easily understand. also available here He concludesgtMiranda already has one foot in the grave. Not only have Mirandas underlying rights been decimatedfor example a suspect now waives his right to remain silent by remaining silentbut the Miranda warning is an unmitigated disaster. First there is no standardization as courts have rubberstamped nearly every set of words cobbled together by law enforcement no matter howdefective they are in conveying Mirandas message ... Second and more significantly even the best versions of the Miranda warning are incomprehensible fail to accurately and completely convey Mirandas underlying rights and offer no way of actually invoking those rights.

11691767,0,t1_dgl9920,I reread the report  and since Wiegert was talking about the bullet and the gun in the first paragraph  it is possible and even likely that he was referring to the gun when he said   ... received this evidence . He should have specified received the gun  not this evidence  because it is confusing after talking about both items in the first paragraph. But it still begs the question  Why the need to specify when WSCL received the gun ?Every time I see one of them use the phrase It should be noted  I get the sense someone told them to add a certain piece of information to avoid suspicion. In this case  in case someone accused them of firing the gun after BDs confession  they can say  It wasnt in our possession after . But .... As LE  they know what key evidence in a murder is. And a found bullet would be key evidence. Did the results on the bones come back before  ? If they knew the skull fragment showed a bullet wound  they could have easily planned ahead  fired the gun  and kept the bullet in their hip pocket ... hoping that they could get BD to confess to shooting TH since Im certain they knew they were gonna come back to BD at some point to coerce a confession. Its entirely possible that they planned ahead  fired the gun before turning it over to WSCL  and had the bullet as the ace up their sleeve. ,TickTockManitowoc,dgla35d,11,t5_3eqc9

11712698,0,t3_6720l4,Is this really just about Reddit politics of wanting to prevent vote brigading by linking to other posts?Or is this more along the lines of hiding all personal information of the subjects involved in the case and not about hiding Reddit user names? These are quite different things so are they concerned about usernames being seen or information about the case being seen?Ask the admins if you can share more with us and what kind of reports theyre getting? I honestly dont want to give people so inclined more reason to keep reporting trivial stuff in hopes of getting this subreddit into trouble.,TickTockManitowoc,dgnnwm0,7,t5_3eqc9
