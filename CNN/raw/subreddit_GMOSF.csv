246390,0,t1_cf69ayf,Look this is the type of evidence that is anecdotalI am personally saying that from my parents produce which they purchase mostly bulk made in rd world type vegetables and sometimes local produce on occasion.  I see mostly nonorganic farming practices with seed stock from GE.   My personal experience has been more food less nutrition and more cost.  Organic food on average from the vendors at markets when I buy from the terminals and farmers is less expensive to me as well it is less.,GMOSF,cf6ahnp,-2,t5_2zbl9
