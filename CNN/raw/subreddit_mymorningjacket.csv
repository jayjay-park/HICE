4919363,0,t1_cubmdp7,I seriously considered doing the Atlanta shows over Red Rocks partly because New Madrid was doing an aftershow show on the first night. I have heard so many good things about those Atlanta shows and the recording from the Athens show early in the tour was pretty damn awesome. I missed out big time I think.I regret not seeing them way back in the day because I missed out on the proms shows. All this has taught me that I have to see MMJ in Georgia at some point. Apparently theres something special about The Peach State. ,mymorningjacket,cuemh98,1,t5_2s9aa

7724053,0,t3_4l18y3,Ive never heard anything about early entry with a roll call membership. But I doubt it would work with someone elses pass. Just show up well before doors and hangout in line. I think the entrance at the stairs by the lower south lot leads to stage right is the closest to the GA seating. Its where I always go when I show up early and want to get close. ,mymorningjacket,d3k66l8,2,t5_2s9aa

11163078,0,t3_5zd2pp,Ive had a lot of success with Roll Call. It is not a scam.Generally speaking the roll call tickets are sold the day before they go on sale to the public I am not sure when Roll Call sales were for Nashville couldve easily been today.That being said you are buying a fan club subscription to a band and expecting that to count for something with a venue which holds very little allegiances to said band.One final slightly off topic point. We as fans and consumers need to do something about all these people who buy tickets to concertsshowsevents purely out of greed to force themselves between the fans and the artistsperformers in order to garner a few extra dollars for themselves. I am all in favor of having a platform for fans to sell their unusedunwanted tickets to other fans and recoup their initial costs but to make a profit off the fact that you bought tickets is just wrong.,mymorningjacket,dexbn4i,4,t5_2s9aa
