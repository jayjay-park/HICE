Not really but then again when you look at how she handles kicking which is an instant kick or with an antagonizing response such as Unseats greatsword proceeded with a kick or a ban usually. I feel that people need to be warned. She has yet to warn anyone of their wrong doings. Shes also kicked people for being mean to other people even though that was on her own discretion and she does not get the joking around that usually happens in the group and either takes it seriously or just wants to annoy people. Even reasonable discussions without any threats were abruptly stopped by her saying byeee  or with a similar demeaning emoticon then kicking the person.

Firstly as I said the game has massive balance problems such as priest being flat out the best hero when I played at least  of the people I played against were using priest because its op. People who have shitloads of cards will just annihilate anyone who doesnt because they can build the perfect deck the arena mode would be a solution to this but it costs gold. the soecond massive problem I have is that the mechanics arent as good as in some other card games such as MtG or Pokemon Hearthstone is just too simple it would have been better if they just made a digital version of the WoW TCG.,nerdcubed,cfzwuxw,1,t5_2thfq

562391,0,t1_cg44o8b,Ill drop the user name topic but just know that announcing your abandonment of someone with their name taped across your forehead is pretty fucking ironic.Also what I have here is the review of someone who is not only a decent reviewer is a fan of South Park but also points out the problems that Dan does about the game the games got bugs and youre not gonna like it if youre not a fan of South Park. Since Dan encountered a game breaking bug and isnt a fan of South Park you cant expect him to look at the game so lightly. It doesnt help that Dan likes to state his opinion as fact but if you have a problem with that deal with it I guess.Also Dan says that games should be finished before being released into the public. Ideally hes right and we shouldnt have to be the guinea pigs for the company but realistically they have to get the game out as quickly and as polished as possible so its understandable so many bugs got past. Also Obsidiannot Ubisoft Obsidian. Ubisoft just publish it from what I know they have no influence over the code whatsoever so thats another point have a history of terrible bug testing so theres that as well.So its justified that the game will have problems and its justified that Dan can be allowed to criticise the game but what isnt justified that he gets shit on just because of his opinion.,nerdcubed,cg477by,1,t5_2thfq

A lot of PC gamers complained about this on AC as well I dont recall noticing it but then again Ive tried everything in my power to purge that game from my memory.  AC really hurt the AC series story in my eyes and AC while doing the story much better has killed it in hardware.  This is why Im neither excited for nor going to buy Assassins Creed unity.If you look at most of Ubisofts games reviews on the steam store youll see a ton of people saying Its a great game but a horrible port  Beyond Good and Evil is a prime example.

739097,0,t3_22mci6,A thing that I really like about games  especially horror games  is making the player do something that they dont want to do. I dont think the tape itself is unethical because I am not procensorship either but the way it is presented is horrid. Theres no buildup to your listening of the tape and the way you get the tape is very split off from the tape itself. So its like the writer just said Oh you went and found a secret? Cool heres a tape of sexual abuse! which doesnt work at all and wont do any more than disturb players and put them off the game entirely  which it has for me thanks to this news. I havent played or seen footage of any other Metal Gear games so I dont know if this sort of thing is out of place but I do know for sure is that the writer for this game may be completely off his trolley.,nerdcubed,cgoafqt,0,t5_2thfq

Its discontinued now but I can assure you the new cables sold there were that price even before that so it isnt even an oh theres only one left thing. At least with audiovideo cable there is actually some advanced electical theory backing up good cables to do with signal decay times effecting edge detection causing jitter timing errors due to the signal being in the wrong place. With ethernet cables you cant claim to gain anything! It can only ever matter when using the timing of pulses as an extra dimension to the data.N.B To pevent a flame war I make it clear that the theory with the auidovideo backs up using a  impedance matched cable over a  cable.

Because rotation  acceleration there will be a virtual force in this rotating reference frame and that force contributes to make the potential zero at the lagrangian. If you were to look at it from a normal perspective  where the earth orbits the sun then the Lagrangian points would have potential energy at any given time but their movement and the gravitational pull would balance out in such a way as to allow semi stable orbit.,nerdcubed,ch4x1ym,3,t5_2thfq

I would say that this is a pretty big feat considering how large Wikipedia is.Wikipedia has been having issues throughout the day.  Also wikipedia serves over  million pages per hour and thats just for the English articles.  The traffic generated by us fans is tiny compared to what Wikipedia deals with.gt How could you say that we dont have plenty of sources to back up claims on his Wikipedia page? His several hundred videos can easily show much of his life. Videos such as Desert Bus and his vlogs describe things he is passionate about and give a nice history to him. What better place to get information than from the horses mouth himself?Because its not nessisarily true. Anyone can say anything they want about themselves that doesnt make it fact.  Sources outside of his control are needed to verify any of it.gt If Dans current Wikipedia page is being neglected I am pretty sure that any number of people just on this Reddit right know wouldnt mind working on his Wiki.

1151593,0,t3_26jh45,Nerd Challenges Far Cry Big Game HunterObjective Your job is to bag and tag one of each large animal in one go Example Shark Tiger Bear Crocodile etc. This list can be subjective Example Only predators so ox dont count but the more dangerous trophies you get the more kudos in my opinion.  It may sound simple but there is a catch!Rules . If you die you have to start over. Think of it like a permadeath.  This can be optional to save on video time but I personally think it makes it much more challenging.. Once you have killed a target with a particular weapon you can no longer use that weapon for any other target Example If you kill a tiger with a land mine which kudos by the way you cant use a land mine on any other animal. Again this can be subjective depending on how easy you want the challenge to be on yourself.  I personally go by the type of weapon rule example Pistol mine molotov machine gun etc. so that you cant just use a bunch of different machine guns to mow down all the predators.. One weapon per animal. You cant just weaken it with one weapon and use your planned kill weapon to finish it off. If youre using that mine you are just going to be using mines until that tiger is dead.,nerdcubed,chz62tf,3,t5_2thfq

1386545,0,t1_cipo9l9,No its not very dark at least as much as i can remember. I watched season  then started  gave up on  around episode  then got back into it. Has a lot of tieins like Deadshot and Deathstroke also Harley Quinn did a voice cameo. The way they do it is they have two story lines the present and Oliver Queens past. The present focuses on Oliver trying to stop what his father helped do. While the past is about  what happened to him and how he aquired the skill set of the Green Arrow.Season  is IMO darker then season  because he is willing to kill to get what he wants but by season  he made a promise that he would try not to kill. Season  had a better sense of direction of what it wanted to do but season  had another villain in my wonderful collectionI forgot to mention him in my comment a while back about Oswald Danes,nerdcubed,ciq336n,0,t5_2thfq

Also in the driving simulator video even though it did drag on a bit the part where he was doing the street race and the car ramped off him was almost as good as when the wings flew off his plane and then to top it off his car got mounted by another and his little this is how Minis are made made me laugh a lot and I usually am incapable of laughing until am I watched it at am when I just woke up.All in all i think all that is needed is a bit of fat trimming from the videos in the editing  They tend to be good  minute videos rather than great  minute videos as of now in my humble yet godly opinion.  just my . pence.,nerdcubed,cj885c0,7,t5_2thfq

1584231,0,t3_2cd5x6,Im just massively pissed off at Codemasters at the moment. It was only a couple of years ago when every game they made was the best in its field and the best it could be. They made the best racing games of anyone bar none  The original McRae Series Toca the F games when they took over from EA in  etc. were all the best in their respective genres but now all of their games are confused and frankly lazy. Although I did enjoy DiRT  and  and am a fan of Ken Block they moved away from the actual rally driving which was what the original McRae games were great for. And then they made Showdown which was one of the worst driving games I have played.The F games meanwhile started well but with the exception of the  classic edition havent significantly changed anything since  and are beginning to become a bit FIFAish repetitive and similarly with GRID the first one was great but  failed to deliver.As for the other stuff F Challenge Boom Tanks and F Race Stars are you fucking kidding me?!?! Two microtransaction filled ripoffs and Mario Kart? No thanks Codemasters.As for this sacrilegious pile of shite I too was tricked into buying it by the false claims of being McRae . in HD and how wrong I was. Codemasters have already lost the backing of Ken Block to EA for shit like this Showdown Im looking at you and they really need to pull their collective fingers out before they lose anything else F rights anyone?.,nerdcubed,cjev53s,2,t5_2thfq

And the GTA Online crew and well am technically in the top  of crew rankings in terms of the hierachy as I worked hard for the crew and did many things relating to it. So yeah I am and without trying to brag I believe quite a lot of people respect and am happy with my existence. Just because you dont doesnt mean everybody doesnt.. Well I dont technically but Dan doesnt make the maps on Xbox and Im the only one here who actually has bothered for the last  episodes to make technically a remake the maps for Xbox .. Where did I do that? If youre talking about my YouTube channel that is a different font and many people use that kind of endscreen concept with a name mystery video series and all that stuff it isnt copied but used by many people.. How is a piece of punctuation copied by Dan? Many before and after him use the smilies and punctuation that Dan does if thats what you mean.. If you dont like me ignore me and my comments.

1757013,0,t1_ck0bmca,A message that easily could be conveyed in a quick  minute video or less.

Shit engine shit game. Tra. cue outro music and then  of sneaky filler or something.

1783316,0,t3_2cbvc9,Nerdcubed Challenges  Mini Metro Mayhem I have a bunch of challenge ideas one was already mentioned below so Ill up vote it but here are some others I thought of.. Only use the three lines youre given AND you cant have anymore tunnels. If you have to choose between tunnels and a new line you have to pick new line and you cant use it. You can use carriages but thats it.. You can make as many new lines as you can you can add carriages you can have tunnels but you cant add any new locomotives on a line. You get one locomotive with carriages per line.. Youre not allowed to use tunnels. The two sides of the river are separate you cant join the lines together via a tunnel. I feel like I had a bunch more but they are gone now. Anyway those are three ideas for Mini Metro. Id like to say thank you for introducing it to me I am in love with it,nerdcubed,ck3xvsg,1,t5_2thfq

1917698,0,t1_ckk8my8,I understand I get in bad moods and am rude at times as well.  No worries.The main thing with other open world games is that there are other things to do.  In Arkham if you get bored gliding around you can go beat people up although honestly I have to say that I agree with Dan that City would have been better had it not been open world.  GTA you can do your own thing as you drive from place to place you can shoot people for no reason ect.  Same with Just Cause .  The problem I have with SotC is that its huge its a massive world and its empty.  IF it were a small world with short travel times no problem or if it was big but had other things to do smaller monsters to fight secrets to find minigames anything at all thatd be fine but the game is both massive and empty.  I also got the PS remastered version which Ive heard from other people that theyd done something to the horse controls which just makes Argo the worst horse Ive ever ridden in a video game.  He gets stuck on fucking everything.  After killing each colossus and getting sent back to the alter Ill call argo and  of the time hell come right up to me the other times I have to run around the complex to find him running against a  foot high wall.  Its just as bad while riding him.  There were  different instances where I had to climb off Argo run down the path run far enough away from him so hed despawn and then call him so hed come running at me from another direction.  Epona was easier to control.,nerdcubed,ckk9pq1,1,t5_2thfq

2881731,0,t3_2rp0ry,Plays Game Dev TycoonId love to see Dans opinions of this game and watch him play with it.This is probably not what you think it is it is a game about playing as a game developer starting from coding in your basement to owning your own company with many employees. You have to perfectly balance the time you spend on what parts of the games you develop to appeal to the audience based on the genre age group and platform. You even start at the beginning of gaming where there is only DOS computers and D gaming all the way to steam. I love how it follows the history of gaming accurately as it does.,nerdcubed,cnvnlsg,7,t5_2thfq

2897068,0,t3_2tb13c,I understand where Dans coming from. Steam is for all intents and purposes a monopoly and it shows. I really want EA to get around to making Origin great so there can be competition. Valve needs that more than anything IMHO.,nerdcubed,cnxegkd,1,t5_2thfq
2897448,0,t1_cnxf22h,gt Another problem on steam is quality control. It just doesnt exist you sell a completely broken game if you got it on steam and no one would care. And early acces just makes it worse since you cant complain about the game being broken because its not finished yet.It is not the responsibility of the store to tell you what you can and cannot buy.It is up to them to ensure that there isnt false advertisements so if they missed that with War Z then bad on them.But if someone wants to put up a SHIT game and tell you all about it and that it is unfinished and you STILL buy it not YOU but the hypothetical yous out there then that onus has to lie on THEM to some degree.I dont even bother buying a game until I watch at least one youtube reviewread one review on it and its mechanics and it has been out at least a week or two.,nerdcubed,cnxg0v3,0,t5_2thfq
2897878,0,t3_2tb13c,Just a suggestion but Im always looking for cool indie games that are actually good.

2900438,0,t1_cnxeesl,I just wanted to note a couple things.One as far as  terabytes of games go I dont know but I dont think thatd be the case. Yeah  games is a lot but they arent the games theyre the installers which are much smaller.But on a related note I think you are right about that not being a good idea. Mainly because Dan noted It will be DRM free and stuff. The problem is that is some of the appeal of Steam. I know not many players like DRM but the developers love it and Steam is a DRM service for them as much as a games service for us. I mean do you expect all the big companies that release on Steam to also release on a DRM free service? Where they could have one account shared between like  friends so they get  purchase where they couldve gotten ? And theres nothing stopping that? I just dont think a DRM free service could match up with Steam just because developers wouldnt want to release it DRM free.,nerdcubed,cnxsa7f,1,t5_2thfq

3391504,0,t3_2z13n5,I personally feel Dan played it like a regular dude would play it.Regular folk who recieved this game as a gift.If youre given a vehicle and a seemingly openish region of world you are GOING to dick around in it. It is the natural gameplay that develops from the tools you are givenShow a human a mountain and they will inevitably try to climb it.Its disappointing as a game. The bits you plow cat etc only remain so for an implausibly low period of time.You can see how it could be fun and it genuinely did look fun to dick around with the physics engine. Dan even tried to play with it by using downward momentum but was foiled.The game has fun bits you can see but not access that are clearly modelled objects. That is SINFUL in a video game. Fun looking areas of the map that have fully modelled objects... Augh.Its a okayish game that could be better. It could be a snowthemed farm simulator.

The knowledge that other burnt potatoes exist and the niche for burnt potatoes is terrible doesnt change the fact that you think the burnt potato tastes horrible.

3648498,0,t1_cq84h8c,I think you actually have to split the kind of publicity that Youtubers give to these shitty gamesTotalbiscuit has already proven that negative publicity like this does not result in higher game sales. When the Youtuber takes a serious critical look at those games and keeps pointing out how shit they are then that wont make people buy it. I actually think that this is better than not telling people about those games so they know what games to avoid when they see them. And to be fair Nerd also gives much much more of positive spotlight to the really cool little Indie games at the same time. pHowever you are not entirely wrong. If a Youtuber like Pewdiepie Markiplier etc. nothing against them personally just the first ones to pop to my mind plays those kind of games and cuts the video together with funny scenes shouting in frustration and all that stuff then it may make the game look more fun than it actually is and may entice people to try it themselves. That kind of publicity is the way bigger problem in my opinion.,nerdcubed,cq85mhi,9,t5_2thfq

4457469,0,t1_cssjmd5,ampampampSection . Influence on language and writing of article  George Orwell sfw gtgtIn his essay Politics and the English Language  Orwell wrote about the importance of precise and clear language arguing that vague writing can be used as a powerful tool of political manipulation because it shapes the way we think. In that essay Orwell provides six rules for writersgtgtgtgt Never use a metaphor simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.gt Never use a long word where a short one will do.gt If it is possible to cut a word out always cut it out.gt Never use the passive where you can use the activegt Never use a foreign phrase a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.gt Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous. gtAndrew N. Rubin argues Orwell claimed that we should be attentive to how the use of language has limited our capacity for critical thought just as we should be equally concerned with the ways in which dominant modes of thinking have reshaped the very language that we use. gtThe adjective Orwellian connotes an attitude and a policy of control by propaganda surveillance misinformation denial of truth and manipulation of the past. In Nineteen EightyFour Orwell described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from Nineteen EightyFour have entered popular language. Newspeak is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. Doublethink means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The Thought Police are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. Prolefeed is homogenised manufactured superficial literature film and music used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. Big Brother is a supreme dictator who watches everyone.gtOrwell may have been the first to use the term cold war in his essay You and the Atom Bomb published in Tribune  October . He wrotegtgtgtWe may be heading not for general breakdown but for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity. James Burnham theory has been much discussed but few people have yet considered its ideological implications this is the kind of worldview the kind of beliefs and the social structure that would probably prevail in a State which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of cold war with its neighbours. gtRelevant Orwell Award | George Orwell bibliography | George Orwell A Life in Pictures | Inside the Whale and Other Essays Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcssjmzw oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecssjmzw.

4529512,0,t1_csyhqtg,No it isnt as long as youre eating enough. I cant tell you since you havent given your height.The most important thing is to eat a healthy balanced diet and exercise. Stay away from soft drinks junk food and treats have them in moderation like a few times a week or cut them out completely but do whats right for you.If you want to gain weight nuts seeds peanut butter milk and things like that are really good have fat in them which makes it easier to gain weight. Tuna and chicken are both good sources of protein. Eat a balanced diet which is usually  carbohydrates grains vegetables fruits cereals bread etc. and  fats and proteins  fat  protein.Exercise is really good for your health. I know you might not want to hear that and just sit around playing video games but  years ago when I was your age I did nothing but sit around the past  years and I have high blood pressure now as well as prediabetes basically early onset type  diabetes so I cant state enough just how important it is.

Thats a  calorie deficit per day.The reason they were able to lose that much weight was through water weight.Science time!Carbohydrates are converted into glycogen thats your short term energy store and  part glycogen is bound to  parts water so for every gram of glycogen its attached to  grams of water. When you start dieting your body goes through that energy store releasing the water which is why you lose so much water weight the first week of dieting.But even still thats a lot of fat burned for  week! So congrats! I just dont want people to be disappointed later because thats going to slow down after youre not retaining water and youre just burning fat.Now that youve gotten through the water weight even just .kg of fat is a  calorie daily deficit so thats  of what an average person eats a day so good job!,nerdcubed,ct8zs2z,1,t5_2thfq

Youll have to spend about  on the map from the unity story likely anywhere between  and  for the npc models probably about  for the playable character model in this case the hand and gun then youll likely have to put in about a half hour to and hour of work just haphazardly placing enemies around the map and doing the simplest of coding thatll be easy to find in unity tutorials.  Finally youll have to put it up on steam greenlight whichll cost another .  Then if youre fortunate enough to get enough idiots to greenlight you you can probably sell your game for about  after which I cant imagine more than  people buying it giving it negative reviews and your name living in infamy forever much like Digital Homicide the makes of this game who had to change their name to ECC just to try and actually sell their piece of shit games.

Whether the game was better than the old one or not you can debate however as a standalone game it was actually pretty good. A fun actionrpg with elements of open world exploration with a simple storyline and doesnt take  hours to complete. Not many games such as that are produced nowadays with much of the focus being on either endless multiplayer or epic  hour RPGs.There was nothing to actually dislike about the game apart from maybe quicktime events which were a bit pointless at times but didnt hurt. ,nerdcubed,cw21ulx,-1,t5_2thfq

Dan will then need to take the three things from one corner of the map to the other while keeping all of the three things attached to each other the whole journey and switching from boat to car when necessary.Also you can use any boat or car you want and start from whichever corner.Thanks for the time to read this you lovely person.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

6723504,0,t3_47ozgh,The discussion is simple Dan doesnt like a genre. Therefor he thinks the game in this genre should DIE OFF and become a different genre.I love you Dan but dude you have to accept that the fucking game isnt for you and move away from it. It was merely a fluke that you enjoyed Pokemon at all. Dont try and destroy the concept of it just because you cant personally enjoy it anymore.

6739613,0,t3_47zj07,Theres been a lot of weird suggestions of bringing back Vlogs. I find them fucking hilarious too as Dan is as genius in his videos as he is in person i watched all Demmas about  times now. I dont think it would harm too but dont make it something you would schedule. Just if some shit rolls up and everyone has left Dan alone so he just has to rambles it to the camera instead to both relieve him from the stuff he needed to share and entertain the living shit out of us the Soup video offended is a prime example.Also something id keep and thought was worth a shout Dans channel has always been like that one cool goth kid nobody likes except you because you know he has a big house with a sexy sexy SLI setup. And thats simply because he kind of does whatever the fuck he feels like doing. Keep it that say for the rest of my life plzAnd yeah i like Podcats. Rebecca as next guest. Talk about Pop! Figures...

7123648,0,t3_4d33oq,This is excellent! I think I have a new favourite NerdCubed video. D   I wasnt ready for that Adblock joke... not even slightly... xD   It almost certainly is a x multiplier the idiots are applying the change twice to the same variable which would add the value together. Thats the computer science for this comment! P   Yeah well the Garmin SatNav that came with my familys SUV has worse lag so... REALISTIC FEATURE!   Holy shit! Da grafix! Is this Earth Year ? Seriously in front of that dropoff zone that puts the fault in default ground texture.   I love the HUD in the bottom right corner Logging horse KMH n Mode Drive. I can imagine a salesman trying to sell a horse by saying it has got a fourspeed auto.   TIMBER!!!   Ugggghhhh! Another fecking game that has torch on L. I dont care which big games do thisits still stupid. L is far too far away from your left hand and your right hand is on the mouse I hope wink. For lefties its even more stoopid because it gets written over with move right. lt insert political joke here gt   Dan noticed the Drive mode thing on the horse. Thought he might... hoped he would   Oooh yeah! I really want to buy a house from that real estate! All of the fancy.   Runnymede? But Dan you already said this was postapocalyptic so its obviously the future. In the future a GPS provider Google amirite? will have satellites situated above everybody using the service. These satellites will use highresolution cameras to show ones position. Hence the map lag. Think Google Earth crossed with a livestream. Its a savvy business decision sure in the short term the cost is astronomical literally but in the long term you dont have to keep updating graphical maps. Plus you get to spy on people... especially those having affairs when they drive up to ye olde fornication pulloff outside town.    You could even take this a step further and say that it makes sense for such a company to limit the population of the world so they dont have to build so many satellites. Perhaps the super virus they released went rogue and killed everybody except PewDiePie. What? Too dark? Still fewer plot holes than Terminator Genisys.   Dan? Youre playing a PoS game it only counted the first segment because the other segments werent in the area.   For those that dont know how to use a chainsaw you shove it into the throat of the zombie... different tutorial sorry. One does not simply drag the chainsaw through a tree trunk that would end poorly with a pinched chain bar and a possible chain whippin. You make three cuts to the trunk. The first cut is a diagonal downwards cut on the side you want the tree to fall. The second is a horizontal cut that meets the diagonal cut and thus removes a wedge from the tree. The tip of the wedge should just remove some of the trunks core. The third cut is on the opposite side of the tree and is a horizontal cut towards the core of the trunk. Eventually the weight of the tree will start to fall and it should fall towards the wedge. If it doesnt the trunk may roll off to one side and perhaps slip backwardsjust get out of the way. Take this advice with a pinch of salt Im not a professional but rather just a guy that read the user manual which came with his electric pansy chainsaw. P I have had success with this method on a few small trees in the yard.   Wait what? Dan had CR income and CR expenditure for the day. That correctly totals as CR in the hole. Why the fuck does his balance drop to CR? What kind of random bullshit is that?   Oh so the developer doesnt understand that the brakes on a car are far far more powerful than the engine. Good to know. Also I love how the thing stands on its nose at the end allowing me to add momentum and thermal saturation to the list of things the developer doesnt understand...   Most of those apply to GTA V first person mode too...Addendum I relayed to my mum Dans point about making more money from chopping down all the trees evah to get more experience than selling trees as you go. In doing so I had to explain roughly how the game works. She made an excellent point about planting trees to get experience as forestry isnt just about felling trees. I dont believe that is part of this game so I guess the game is going to have rather a finite and rather a dark twist at the end...,nerdcubed,d1nvjqf,9,t5_2thfq

9498273,0,t1_d9jo8p0,Yup!    ProtoFeminism is a general term for the growth of feminist ideals through the th and th centuries. The enlightenment brought about the ideas that all men were created equal and some women believed that this should apply to them too! For this reason many protofeminists were aligned with many of the social liberal reforms of the time such as Abolition Republicanism Suffrage Education Reform and the French amp American Revolutions.    st wave feminism is where it really kicked off! From around  women started to demand the right to vote. The stwavers were almost excessively violent and put themselves in incredible danger the most famous example being the  derby when a woman was killed after trying to pin a prosuffrage sign on the Kings horse.  By  most western countries had given women the right to vote.    nd wave feminism had its roots in the sexual revolution of the s and evolved through many phases until the sex wars of the s.  With greater freedoms to women such as the right to work women became financially independent  not only this but the pill was invented giving women greater sexual freedom.  This era was marked by feminists demanding cultural acknowledgement and sexual liberation.  This wave also corresponded with the civil rights movement in its beginning and the gay rights movement toward its end.  The nd wave died out as the antiporn faction that believed that all pornography was inherently patriarchal and the sexpositive faction that believed that sex was good when consensual split apart in the aforementioned sex wars    rd wave or the current wave of feminism had its roots in the sexpositive feminism of the previous generation. It is more focussed on intersectionality  that is they believe that all forms of oppression are linked.  That means that in order for women to truly be liberated sexual and racial minorities must be liberated too.    Some argue that the th wave has already begun but most feminists deny this as there is no agreedupon argument regarding what the next generation should fight for.,nerdcubed,d9jv4jk,8,t5_2thfq

Its like having a No boys allowed club that is led by a boy.gt patriarchygt petrkiSubmitgt noungt a system of society or government in which the father or eldest male is head of the family and descent is reckoned through the male line.gt the thematic relationships of the ballad are worked out according to the conventional archetypes of the patriarchygt a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.Can you say the current prime minister is largely excluded from government? Out of the top  parties Conservatives Labour SNP and Liberal Democrats  have female leaders.  and that is largely excluded?Youre doing a very good job at pointing out the differences in my arguments and ignoring the similarities.

10616643,0,t1_ddasv01,Compared to the Podcats this feels more like a generic gaming series. Theres something missing  somehow less charm to it.The focus has shifted away from the discussion and the comedy you created together. The first of the videos looks like a compilation of funny events happening in the game  there is some talk between the three of you but its mostly the game doing the work. The original series to me felt like the classic Clarkson Hammond and May trio. This new series feels different  its almost empty of the ongoing dynamic.The Podcats allowed you to take a topic and run away with it to shoot off jokes from all angles. It was like a really good panel show. The game isnt this environment where comedy can thrive it IS the comedy. The events have become the comedic focus instead of your interactions. The jokes the dynamic between the cast the draw you feel to each person just isnt there anymore. Online isnt a panel show its a video of someone falling over.At this point it might be appropriate to bring up some other series such as the GTA Heists. The heists were enjoyable for Dan to create but people didnt watch them  I didnt watch them  because they werent interesting to watch. They felt like there was no content other than what happened ingame. The same thing happened with the Demma Plays series. The regular Emma and Dan videos are hilarious because they can focus on each other because they play well off each other. When this was moved to a different context they stopped doing that. They stopped cracking everescalating jokes at each others expense and started laughing at what was happening onscreen.They werent the action any more. The game was the action. It changed how they interacted and what worked in one environment didnt work in this new one the content was fundamentally different. I fear that Online is following that same road now where trying to improve the content accidentally kills it. I dont want that to happen but I cant watch the Online series in this form. Compared to the Podcats a lot of the draw for me has disappeared. I just dont find this kind of content unique or enjoyable. Instead of refining the content youve diluted it and broken what was at the core. I really want to like it to enjoy it and look forward to it every week like I did the Podcats but its not as interesting. The same experience can be had by hopping into the game and playing for yourself.If Dan thinks that the Podcats became more about camaraderie than news I think hes right  but I also think that was the draw. I can see why he thinks a gaming environment is the better place for it but looking at the past and looking at this new series I cant possibly agree. Dan proved he can be entertaining staring out of a bus window and occasionally pushing one button  thats enough for me to realise hes what I come here for. I follow Dan because I like his character I follow you and Jon because I like your characters  never just because of the games you play  and I followed the Podcats because I enjoyed the combination of you all. I came for the camaraderie. Trying to change into a gaming series has taken the focus away from your interactions  it killed what brought me to the Podcats.,nerdcubed,ddb0ymr,23,t5_2thfq
10616910,0,t1_ddasv01,I feel like the Online misses the largest and best part of the podcats by switching from discussion to commentary. In the podcats you would talk about how you feel on a subject in the news and then progress to talking about other things like how each of you experienced an event in a game like the fallout  opening but in the Online you can only talk about whats happening in the moment and how you are experiencing the current situation. Every so often one of you will bring up a subject that could have started a long line of sharing opinions and insults in the podcats but it lasts for only a few seconds and then is gone because there are things happening in the game. The games pace cant be controlled like a list of topics can,nerdcubed,ddb1ybb,9,t5_2thfq

11604306,0,t1_dgbc79c,Agreed.  Back when RTD was the head writer Moffat made some of the best stories.  Some of my favorite episodes that Ive gone back and rewatched since becoming disillusioned with him I was shocked to learn were also written by Moffat.  I think the main problem he has is that hes TRYING to make every episode connected in some way.  If you go back to Eccleston or Tennants runs very few episodes actually linked together.  Each episode or couple of episodes was its own self contained story and that worked perfectly.  Each episode was its own little adventure that didnt need to worry about continuity.  But Moffats trying to cram everything together.And God dont get me started on the River Song circlejerk.  She was actually a really damn cool character in the Library episode and she had just enough mystery that I wanted to see what happened with her.  Then she started appearing in every episode.  You know the best way to ruin a mystery?  Explain every little detail.  Kind of like a joke.  It dies in the process and becomes just unfun.  And the end how she got her own Sonic screwdriver.  God dammit.  Was that anticlimatic or what?  Just a christmas present no further meaning beyond that.  Not a dying doctor giving him his screwdriver not her stealing it not them both needing one to complete a challenge and the doctor lets her keep it.  Nope just a christmas present.  Fuck off.  Just fuck off.  Sorry bit of a rant there.  And Im going to do another one real quick.  My moms recently been rewatching all of the Doctor Who episodes I got her into Doctor Who how cool is that? and she started watching Day of the Doctor and rewatching it along with the knowledge of Moffat being a classic who fanboy and a quote from Zero Punctuations Yahtzee made me realize why I really didnt like Day of the Doctor.  It was something I was super excited about and I felt disappointed but couldnt really point out why aside from Eccelston not being in it until now.  Its because it feels like bad fanfiction to retcon something from new who out to make it more like classic who.  It was kind of a big deal that the Doctor destroyed Galifray and for most of the series up until Day of the Doctor thats how it was.  The Doctor made a huge sacrifice and destroyed his home planet and his race killed a major location from the classic series.  Then Moffat becomes head writer and he completely undoes it.  All the weight of that event was just gone from the entire series now because the Doctor didnt actually do that he didnt actually make the ultimate sacrifice no hes way too good and smart of a guy for that tongue tongue licky licky balls balls balls.  No hes too amazing for that so actually Galifray is fine!  Yep totally fine never happened and hey now Galifray and Skarro are back just like the classic series.  Because fuck the new continuity only the classic stuff we liked when we were younger is actually good.  Fuck making new stories lets make everything exactly the way it was.  That kind of stuff infuriates me.  I hate retcons and continuity changes just so the universe falls perfectly into place for the writers fanfiction storyline.  Sorry again for the rants but I needed to get it off my chest.  Oh another thing for Capaldis introduction by which I mean when Smith regenerated into him.  Why did he make Doctor Who?  A major significant plot point?  It was a fun little joke whenever he introduced himself.  Im the Doctor  Doctor Who?  That was just a fun little thing but now its a major plot point.  The oldest question the most important question that the timelords were asking from another dimension on the still intact Galifray.  Why?  Why do that?  Alright I need to end this comment now or Im just going to keep ranting and complaining.  Kudos if you made it this far.  Youre my favorite kind of person.  Kisses for you.  ,nerdcubed,dgbcvun,3,t5_2thfq

Youll never have a perfect system but its always feasible to create one that is adequate and meets both budgetary and performance demands. ,nerdcubed,dgmrt03,5,t5_2thfq
