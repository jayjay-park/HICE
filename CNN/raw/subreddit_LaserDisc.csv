3010099,0,t3_2rdhp9,The D was just a D with an AC output and the  was a D with slightly better internal shielding gold plated connectors a D Comb Filter and a Urushi finish on the front plate. The D comb Filter made a huge difference back in the mid s when  of the TVs on the market used a much less capable chip today it is a pointless endeavor to pay more for a  as a modern TV will have a comb filter roughly as good or better than the s and the shielding and gold connectors make no visually noteworthy difference to the picture.The CLDD can be adjusted internally during a service by a technician who knows what hes doing. These adjustments reduce crosstalk improve sharpness and make picture effectively identical to the picture from a . Your best bet between   and  is to buy a  and send it to somewhere like Bayview Service in Washington State to have it fully servicedrefurbished and adjusted.The CLD was Pioneers top of the line player for a few years replacing the earlier LDS. The  was considered the s replacement although the Japanesemarket LDS was in some ways a better replacement for the  than the  was.The  has a beautifully smooth filmlike image and great color reproduction. It lacks the sharpness the more modern digital noise reduction hardware and the D comb filter of the . But the comb filter is going to be useless with a modern display or quality outboard video processor the sharpness levels can be improved on the  with internal adjustment and the DNR tended to add digital noise and an artificial feel to the image that the  doesnt display. The  had an AC output which the  lacks but its a really simple and inexpensive thing to have added to the player and it can be handled by people like the techs at Bayview while theyre making internal adjustments and servicing the rest of the player.Hope this is helpful please ask if you have follow up questions.,LaserDisc,co9ztjo,1,t5_2sr1f

4090885,0,t1_crmkwi1,Edited...So lets see if I have this right.  All in context to the CLD now...  Old discs only had an analog track but the CDLV analog out on the CLD would play them  New discs with a digital dolby track would play using the CDLV but would I still only get the analog track or would it play the digital track and downsample to dolby surround?  If I have a DTS LD my CLD as is would be stuck with the analog audio track.  My immediate concerns is my research has stated the CLD has poor sound on analog tracks so if I can play downsampled digital tracks via the CDLV outputs I am good and only have to worry about DTS LDs?,LaserDisc,crml3lh,1,t5_2sr1f

11193694,0,t1_df0q3zs,Amazon UK has the intensity for .  I imagine other retailers are charging roughly the same as that lines up with its USD pricing. Personally I think its worth every penny the only other solution Ive seen that would be workable for any less would be an old ATI AllInWonder card but the results youll get with the Intensity are better and it offers more flexibility.As far as Digital Audio youll need a soundinterface card or USBThunderbolt input device with an SPDIF optical input. Many sound cards have them some of which are under  so Id say just do a little shopping and find the one you like at a price youre willing to pay. As long as youre using software that will allow you to merge the incoming video from the Intensity with the incoming audio from the cardinput device youre golden at least in terms of getting PCM to the PC.Digitally encoded Dolby Stereo and Dolby SurroundProLogic tracks should transfer with the flags intact for correct decoding at the other end. Whether you can capture Dolby Digital or DTS will depend on your interface device and software.,LaserDisc,df0siqq,1,t5_2sr1f
