4276253,0,t3_39ynpj,If they fix the tick ratePut a great emphasis on the squad combatI know that the DLC and stuff is kind of a turn offBut I feel like the have put a great emphasis on this is Battlefront not Battlefield.I did not think Battlefield when I saw this trailer it looked to fluid and reminded me off Battlefront.I hope there will come more class customization and that we will see them focusing on the team aspect of the game more.The camera angle where you can adjust from the classic shoulder rd person view and to first person is great I liked the on rails commander overview from the ATAT where you can call down missile strikes.The class system seems to be of that of like a Battlefield game which is alright in my book because it could get kind of redundant in Battlefront after you have played it so many times to keep on playing the same classes.If they include weaponry from Star Wars Galaxies they will have tons of different weapons to choose from one could dream that it would have the same customization as in Fallout I do not know how they would balance thatBut it looks like this reboot has great potential to become a game worthy of the Star Wars name and a worthy prequel.This is just my initial thoughts.,battlefront,cs7nhk4,21,t5_2t6xr

Its stupid that a single burst of a laser rifle is enough to take down a turret.Also the Rebel hangarsnowfortress area is a death trap for the rebels which makes no sense. They should have a lot of fortifications that only they know about.

5344995,0,t3_3o7h3r,Im just not a fan of the way the power ups are set up to begin with. I think it all connects to the games arcade like feel. Battlefront has always been arcade like but it just seems like its gone too far that way now.    Im okay with the powerups being on the map but I dont want them to be these floating icons. You want to have a turret that you can place? Have the spawn locations be cargo boxes with the turrets inside and a cooldown. Instead of icons have the vehicles ACTUALLY SPAWN. Im okay with ships being the icons due to the nature of them being flying vehicles but theres no reason we couldnt actually see land vehicles like you do in almost any other shooter and like Battlefront .    I agree with the rocket launcher being a weapon card but honestly I think I would just have preferred classes and cards. With particular classes having particular cards so that there is some variety there.    This game is fun it has potential but the downside of the beta is I have yet to really get the full scope of the game. Its possible most of my complaints will go away as time goes on. ,battlefront,cvuvstt,2,t5_2t6xr
5349724,0,t1_cvvfpfy,Be careful what you wish for on that though. They may be doing that as a direct counter to traditional battlefield games where everyone is getting one shotted from across the map before they can even see the combat. Even with the current cooldownrifle scheme I can reliably get headshots and then with the sniper trait the cooldown becomes more manageable. I tihnk they want the game to be approachable and somewhat casual so if that is the case they will limit things like sniping. ,battlefront,cvvhk0i,2,t5_2t6xr

The servers base you on region and locate you towards the closest server not taking into account how many people are connected to that server. Depending on where youre located you may be running into a situation where all the games are full and youre left starting your own games even though there are lots of games open in other regions.If youre on PC my fix for this has been to turn on a VPN and switch regions to connect to servers with more people playing on them.,battlefront,cy80zp1,1,t5_2t6xr

The DL is a problem at short distances but I usually easily take care of them nbs at a safe distance with my T which has the same damage and better range but slower rate of fire. Spawning is an issue. I  KDd with  kills on two games today on Hoth supremacy. Most of these kills came from flanking the enemies spawn points. Im not sure this is a problem in other game modes. ,battlefront,cyddm5u,2,t5_2t6xr
6057891,0,t1_cydgz3y,Well I dont think its an excuse that you combine two cards to achieve that. Lets be honest the most used cards are the Thermal Detonator for the people without Bowcaster the Jetpack the Bowcaster and maybe the shield. And at least for me it seems like these actually are the only cards worth running.The other cards dont come near these cards in terms of power x required skill. Well there are seven maps playable in Drop Zone and nearly every map is an outdoor map. The ones where this combo not always usable is the snow map and Rebel Depots. The other maps are outdoor for at least  Id say.I was thinking about adding the Homing Shot here as well but decided against it. At the beginning it was getting on my nerves as well but after some time it wasnt that affective anymore as I learned to pay attention to the warning signal that comes up when you get locked. As the rocket is comperatively slow its not that big of an issue for me anymore and nowhere near the DL P Nearly everytime I get instamelted by anybody its the DL and its happening more than actually bearable.,battlefront,cydopj6,1,t5_2t6xr
6058589,0,t1_cydqxuw,At the beginning I was thinking like you are.

Ive enjoyed Battlefront very much its an awesome game in an awesome setting but after the last experiences ive stoped playing. Maybe the next DLC will bring back the joy as the gametime option doesnt include luckily the DLCs.,battlefront,d4fbwd8,1,t5_2t6xr

8516292,0,t3_4wc3am,Its a bug. The devs confirmed that you were able to use your multiplayer loadout but something went wrong and we cant choose it.,battlefront,d663gph,7,t5_2t6xr
8528748,0,t1_d67n395,Headshots dont win matches. Enemy snipers dont bother me one bit if they use pulse cannon I can see that green glare from a mile away and just pop a shield or roll into cover. If they use cycler or DLTX  of the time they will either miss a shot or not score a headshot which is enough for me to neutralize them as a threat by doing the above.To be effective they need a perch and they need to be out of easy reach of the enemy. Which means theyre not playing the objective. Just the way the game was designed and why there were NO sniper rifles in the game at launch.Look Im not telling you how to play  Im just pointing out that tastes differ and what is fun for you may not be fun for someone else. Some guns require more skill some less. CA for example requires skill to use effectively. It overheats in three shots and I had plenty of people miss all three point blank because I rolled around or they were simply not very good with it.Of course on small cramped maps a player with a shotgun has an edge. Thats what shotguns are ideally suited for. You can score cheap shots by corner camping and blasting people as they come running to you  which is what I do on Cargo I prefer to use EE for such maps which is arguably even worse than the CA since it overheats less has longer range higher rate of fire and can OHK with a headshot point blank. Why not. Gets them out of the picture. See my goal is to help my team win the match. I dont care about skill shots. Sure it feels good to headshot a jump pack user midair with a DL or to pick off people across the map with a targeting rifle and I get why you like such stuff just keep in mind that the game is not about your kind of playstyle. Sniping was always a bit tacked on an afterthought. CQC is where this game has its focus. If you roll into a CQC map with a sniper setup youre gimping yourself.,battlefront,d67nnzz,3,t5_2t6xr

I can only remember a few instances where lag was an issue on the server side. Just a couple reminders as I have gone from PC to console a few years back. Check your sensitivity settings and experiment with that. I feel I do better on shooters on console than I did on PC. Other than that play in third person and try to shoot from the hip as often as you can.,battlefront,da6gi68,2,t5_2t6xr

10154487,0,t3_5lebd7,Yes. Its cheap and you can get games on the USEU servers. A little bit of patience is required since I will often get lost connection  or  times before I actually get into the game but thats just a minor drawback. Huge drawbacks are hackers and glitch abusers. They appear less on DLC games so I suggest you buy the Ultimate Edition. Its worth it,battlefront,dbv2fvf,2,t5_2t6xr
10158725,0,t3_5lg7zr,So does everyone know about the droid run exploit? I joined a game the other day to find this happening and was shocked to see players at about  points. Didnt get to play long enough to try it but I want to at least once just to see how much I can get!To answer your question I say just play your favorite game modes and youll get there soon. Once you hit  and unlock everything like me you feel kinda empty...Ive started working more on the figurines though. ,battlefront,dbvjqm5,1,t5_2t6xr
10181957,0,t3_5lsyi1,I say if you want to play the game then go for it. Getting the bundle with all the DLC is definitely the smartest move. ,battlefront,dby6j9h,3,t5_2t6xr
10202706,0,t1_dby2yz9,Its really irrelevant at this point there are multiple videos like this or posts about this guy and still nothing.EA like every other large online FPS brand has an extensive EULA that lets them ban people for pretty vague reasons. They dont need a specific reason or proof to issue a ban. Of course they prefer to actually be able to prove that your hacking when youre banned to avoid customer service fiascos or charge backs but in an egregious circumstance like this anecdotal evidence is wayyy more than what they reasonably need to totally wipe thiss guys account out.,battlefront,dc0j855,1,t5_2t6xr

10583837,0,t1_dd7iubu,Its been explained to you by several people that by limiting the abilities of any one class so that no one class can do everything gives each class a role and gives players an actual reason to use it. Teamwork is encouraged by the actual mechanics of the game. Voice comms help by making coordination easier but theyre not needed just playing the objective with a mixture of classes naturally leads those classes to play to their individual strengths while working in a group. At least on the PC most players in most games team based or not arent even wearing a headset until you get to a fairly high level of play. And yet teamwork still happens because the game is designed so just by playing the objective and doing what your class is good at you help the team. And also because just going rambo without support from the rest of the team is a good way to die. Again this isnt or at least shouldnt be CoD.,battlefront,dd7n3id,1,t5_2t6xr

11218947,0,t3_605o87,When someone spawns in as the emperor you can spawn on him as a special class the royal guard. There can only be like two royal guards though. Theres a similar thing with Leia and Krennic. Leia gets two Rebel bodyguards and Krennic gets two of his black death troopers. But to spawn as any of them someone else has to already be that hero. The special classes typically have like two powers that are like pick ups but act like star cards and a blaster that I cant tell seems to do a bit of increased damage. The star cards are like homing rockets thermal implodes homing launchers etc. Hope that helps!,battlefront,df3njk1,14,t5_2t6xr

11699379,0,t1_dgm21mm,Theres a pretty big difference between those things. Chewbacca and the Emperor are true to Star Wars in their weapons abilities etc. The emperor is just made less powerful because if he wasnt balanced and was instead as powerful as in canon he would be able to take out battalions of soldiers just using the force. The Emperor is still done correctly and in accordance with lore hes just made balanced because balance is necessary for gameplay. Giving soldiers personal shields by contrast would be like giving the emperor laser eyes. Its not necessary its not even close to accurate and its only purpose is to add another ability to try and make the game more interesting. ,battlefront,dgm560v,1,t5_2t6xr
