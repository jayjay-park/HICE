4016298,0,t3_36ha0c,If the layers dont have time to cool they start to round out like in your example. Cooling the layers with a fan helps tremendously although abs doesnt like it on lower layers. You can also print more than one object or slow your print speed.,FixMyPrint,cre36y7,1,t5_30mvb

4508658,0,t3_3ctz92,Looks like shrinkage due to the change in temp before the ABS completely cools. Try a test print holding the bed temp steady to see if anything changes.  I usually print ABS at c for the first  layers then down to c but I print onto glass. I get some shrinkage of the first layers but not as much as you appear to be getting.  I have also noticed that printing with a thin raft eliminates the shrinkage but tends to make the bottom of the print a little rough.  edit try dropping your extrude temp slightly also. The combination of the bed heat and extruder heat may be keeping the filament soft for a longer time.,FixMyPrint,csyyrpw,1,t5_30mvb

5139572,0,t1_cv4pjbu,Wait do you mean not touching the print off the print bed? Does the grease on your fingers affect the interaction with acetone? Ive contemplated playing around with acetone some more but the first batch that I bought from an Australian home hardware type store mustve been diluted because it never dissolved my ABS and it seems to be pretty much the main brand for sale everywhere so I wonder if its part of some kind of control on the chemical.I definitely knew that vapour baths could make the part smoother but I didnt know it would make it stronger. It makes sense though. I mean the outer layer on its own is never quite as strong as it could be with all those potential fault lines in it. Flatten them out and make them rebond without the risk of cooling defects and you should see improvement!,FixMyPrint,cv5iebw,1,t5_30mvb
5409641,0,t1_cw331c9,So its going to depend a lot on your hardware. Im not experienced with deltas but assuming good control i.e. commanding it to go left or right or forward or back doesnt cause any change in Z height it should be the same as any Cartesian printer.  Heat the printer to printing temperatures Place a piece of paper under the nozzle Land the nozzle Grab the piece of paper and slide it around. You should be able to feel some resistance from the nozzle head but it shouldnt be enough resistance so that you cant push the paper.  If you try and push it and instead of moving it just wrinkles up the nozzle is too low.  If you cant feel the nozzle then its too high. Adjust the Z offset and reland the nozzle until the extruder height feels about right in the middle of the bed. Move the extruder to one corner of the bed. Check the height with your paper. If it feels wrong adjust the bed height at that corner until it feels right in that corner. Repeat this process for all four corners until they all feel the same. Double check the middle of the bed and all four corners. Sometimes adjusting one corner will affect the others so if you start with the left front corner by the time youre done with the other  then the left front might be off again.  Keep adjusting things until you are happy with how it all is.,FixMyPrint,cw353z0,1,t5_30mvb

6275297,0,t1_cz2uhll,I just came to say I think I figured it out I lowered the temp a couple degrees and need to slow down the print speed. The problem is the way the nozzle comes around like a figure . The fan cant cool down the material enough by the time it loops back around and its still flexible. It is still soft and moves a little bit while the nozzle comes back around it will hit it when it flexes making it kind of bulldoze causing a little build up on the ledge.It doesnt have to be hollow adding infill would help with the cooling too.
