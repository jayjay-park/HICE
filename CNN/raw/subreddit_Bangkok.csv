3922974,0,t1_cr3fczz,In that case Id book a room at one of the airport hotels and order room service. Get a good half nights sleep and just relax.Theres not much culturemuseum type stuff to see at the time of day youll be there unless youd like to walk around the temple district by Khao San Road or check out a night market. I assume the actual temples and museums will all be closed...If you do decide to check out the city theres tons of nonculturallyrelevant stuff to see if you just take the bts skytrain to the middle of the Sukhumvit line Siam Square or Ratchathewi or Promh Pong or Nana and start wandering around... ,Bangkok,cr3ge3g,2,t5_2qknx

6122440,0,t3_3zeirm,Just a quick note. I have some Thai friends who bought winter clothes in Thailand before traveling abroad to cold climates. As soon as they arrived they realized that their winter clothing wasnt really made to keep you warmonly to look like it would be warm. So if you are truly buying clothes to keep you warm be sure to stick with name brands and keep away from night market Thai off brands or youll be buying clothes again when you get to Japan. ,Bangkok,cylk395,3,t5_2qknx

7803095,0,t1_d3t4iit,Thanks for that bit of advice. I am currently looking at some supply chain related certs.I went to Thailand last year for a month on a university study abroad trip and fell in love with the place. Sadly most job postings require a lot of experience and an MBA. So for now Im going to get myself up to speed get some certs and see what kind of job openings my company has in BKK in a few years.,Bangkok,d3t4n88,2,t5_2qknx

9385181,0,t3_5930eg,Money At k USD a year youll be fine.  The beauty of BKK is that you can comfortably live as frugally as you need or as extravagantly as you want.Cars Depending on the time of day and area traffic can be hell in the city.  Often taxis and the skytrain are saner choices and the city is compact enough to get around fairly easily and on the cheap.  A car does offer freedom of mobility though.  Get a feel for the city without a car first to gauge how necessary one would be for you.Smoking No youre not Don Draper and lighting up in an office aint gonna fly...even in BKK.  Youll have to step out to smoke.  Most restaurants are a no. Bars are a tossup.  If you see others smoking or ashtrays scattered around its generally ok.KidsFamily Loads of parks zoos workshops amusements venues here for kids of any age.  Kinda jealous I wasnt raised here.

10919555,0,t1_de5g09r,Those are not quite it. They were a non descript generic brand sold in plastic bags. They were also seamless in that there arent any rough cut edges and sewn neatly together. Also colors and patterns were much more bold. They were also high tops and lacked firm structure. I found a better description for them to search for something similar on Google. Hmong handmade shoesThe shoes sorta look like the right kind. These are a step up in design and quality. The design should be uniform throughout. That fold over shouldnt be there and platform heel shouldnt either.
