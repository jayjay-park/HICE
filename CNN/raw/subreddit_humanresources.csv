41310,0,t3_1ukdse,To quickly answer your questions   This can take as little as a few days to as long as a few months    Youre completely within your rights to push back and request a longer lead timeI work very closely with the IT amp Recruiting departments at my company.  I would get signed offers as soon as new employees decide to join our company.  What I ended up doing was creating a list that autogenerates an email distribution based on office location that would get sent out to all relevant parties that need to know when a new employee is starting.  That way IT would get the longest possible lead time in order to have all equipment ready.  Its worked out quite well over the last year or so.  Our company uses SharePoint which is where I created the list amp scripted the workflow for auto generated email notifications.I would suggest making your HR  Recruiting departments the responsible parties when it comes to anything preemployment related.  This would obviously take some buy in from leadership to back up the IT folks.  Hopefully nonIT groups can start being a little more realistic when it comes to laptop imaging and preparation.Cheers.,humanresources,cej4u40,3,t5_2qibb
88745,0,t3_1u17da,It may depend on the state.  In my state you only need to disclose convictions if they are less than  years old.  Any conviction more than  years old does not have to be listed.   Also in my state the crime must have some sort of correlation to the job in order for it to be used as a criteria for not employing a person.  If one believes a nonrelated conviction was used against them in a hiring decision they can challenge the reason for nonhire.    Remember everything may be different in your state.EDIT  It is especially important to note that failing to list a conviction of any type is grounds for nonhire dismissal etc because its considered falsification of hiring documents.,humanresources,ceoj6hu,1,t5_2qibb

Im friendly with the local SHRM CambriaSomerset to be precise. Im not a full member but Ive attended events and am in my current position thanks to some of the members one of whom invited me to an invite after I reached out to her when I lost my last job.

Maybe give them a range based on what you need lowest number and market range higher number and hopefully it works out. Good luck!

2295505,0,t3_2lj9az,I used a  book i got on amazon. It had a link in it to download flashcards. So Id do the flashcards whenever I was on my computer instead of going to reddit or Facebook. I did have the unfair advantage because my mom is one of the  people who write the test questions for HRCI. She did not recommend the SHRM set said any of the other books you get online are fine. My tips for studying are Read through the book at least  times.Take as many online tests you can.Study more on the areas you dont do as well in. My tips for test takingUse the paper they give you to jot down things as you take the test they ask many of the same questions over again in a different way that will make you question how you answered the other one.Dont second guess yourself only review the questions that you marked at the end. Do not go through all the questions again. Use the strike out feature that the computer allows you to use. My mom says that usually two of the multiple choice questions are so totally made up that you can eliminate . Best of luck to you when you take it! ,humanresources,clvfv8s,6,t5_2qibb

3176049,0,t1_cor3zm1,Eh  probably not.  Possible I suppose but from what Ive seen the easiest pipeline is the one straight out of college.  However that includes graduate programs.  Id recommend researching the specific consulting firms youre interested in or a large number if youre not sure which those are yet and find out where they recruit entry level.  Their websites will often provide that basic level of info.A few minutes on Deloittes website for example shows that they do hire experienced hires.  However reading in between the lines based on how much time they spend talking about that versus student hires its less common.  Out of  HR experienced professional postings only  were for consulting.   required experience of  years or more though  only required  year of experience.  I would guess thats a highly competitive posting.For student recruiting  youd want to find out what campuses they recruit at for a graduate level assuming you go back for a graduate degree and in what disciplines.  Then youd be able to choose a grad school that would line up with your goal.There are also boutique consulting firms that will have a wider variety of recruiting strategies.  Personally Id recommend tapping all of the static or published sources of info before asking people questions.  That way your questions can be more focused and interesting.  It will also probably help you know better who to ask.As for your boss being a micromanager  thats your first project changing your working relationship with her.  Often thats a trust issue.,humanresources,cor72zh,3,t5_2qibb

6388569,0,t3_435rfr,I have to be honest when I see out of state resumes I hesitate. This is because the company I work for are under pretty tough time crunches due to our contract with the state and even the people who are willing to move will need some time to find a place pack move get settled etc. I will call them if they have a good resume but Im always prepared for the oh Im not moving until next month when I know they have to do fingerprinting in state and that adds another  weeks to getting them started. It helps when you put that you are willing to relocate but unfortunately a ton of people submit Indeed resumes where a lot of those say that and then when I call its not true in general I have come to really dislike Indeed resumes. A cover letter would definitely help explaining your situation the more transparent the better. ,humanresources,czftb74,2,t5_2qibb

7206321,0,t1_d1w9shd,Yes that would be great training ground. My first true generalist experience was HRM for a company of about  employees mill in revenue located across  cities. I was the entire HR department and theyd never had a full time HR person before. Got to build it from the ground up and it was totally fun. That was over  years ago and they are still doing some of the things I implemented then. If you get that role there will be some natural places to make the leap. Youll need to think about things from an ROI perspective everything in HR is an expense so how do you justify what you need to spend in terms of return on investment? Whether its benefits background checks systems candidate assessments whatever how will the money spent add value? If youre in the top HR role youll be reporting to top executive or top finance person generally hopefully top executive  I would NEVER report to the finance person  to me thats a sign they dont understand the role of HR so youll need to understand how the business makes money and how what you do will help with that. I like to think in simple terms of Attract Train Retain and make my case about how  spent will improve those things which when done well will improve business results. Better people more efficient operations less turnover. My early career was in training and then operations management which gave me a very solid foundation. In  I joined a company of about  people as its training manager. We were in significant growth mode I got my hands in lots of other things in order to try to fix things going on in my classroom venturing into recruiting comp employee relations all towards an eye of improving what I was releasing from entry level classes. My background in training development I think laid a great foundation for strategic HR later what do I want the students to be able to do by the end of the class and how will I be able to measure that? And the most effective measurement is an impact on operational results. So I had a strong background in being able to teach something and watch the business metrics improve. Thats the brass ring right there. Look up ADDIE in the instructional design arena for a great model that can be used in almost any area not just training. So Id gone from being the training manager for one operation of the business reporting to an operations VP to the training director for what was then about  employees reporting to the head of HR. Then a downsizing exercise comes. My boss pulls me into his office and says Weve got a workforce reduction coming. I dont need two directors to handle Training and HR. So Im going to put the current HR director on the list and give you the whole thing. He saw my deer in headlights expression and said I can teach you what you dont know about HR. What I need is someone who knows how to work with managers to help them get better results out of their people and youre the best Ive ever seen at that. That company folded  months later and I had a long period of unemployment before I was finally able to land the HRM job I mentioned at the top of this. That was  years ago. Been on the generalist side ever since with a detour into the employee relations specialty for about  years. Does that help?  ,humanresources,d1xauvi,2,t5_2qibb
