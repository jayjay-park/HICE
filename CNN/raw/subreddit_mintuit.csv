3003349,0,t3_2ujna8,Im pretty sure mint logs in at least a few times a week by itself. There isnt any way that I know of to schedule the log in but I have accounts that I get spending alerts for that catch transactions hours after theyre posted. This to me means that mint is logging in to download that data. Does your bank show you how many times youve logged in? If so log in yourself four times for this month and then add the account to mint. Come back in a few days and see if the number went up.,mintuit,co9amvk,1,t5_35qvn
4181856,0,t1_crwvy6v,Yes This!!! I have every transaction Ive made since  saved and categorized in Quicken. Id love to be able to smoothly migrate that  years of data into a more modern personal finance app. Considering that Mint and Quicken are both owned by Intuit this shouldnt be impossible to develop.,mintuit,crwxo4x,2,t5_35qvn
4251101,0,t1_cs3w2mf,They will collect any nonpersonally identifying information you give them access to and will use it to advertise to you and to sell to marketing and research firms.Opinion is just that an opinion  but I think its the price of a free service and is a fair tradeoff.,mintuit,cs4tauv,1,t5_35qvn
4758509,0,t3_3g2v2r,The whole premise of Mint is that it connects to different sites to keep your financial information in sync. Its probably listing all of the various sites that it can connect to. Without it Mint is useless. ,mintuit,ctucsxl,2,t5_35qvn

5830362,0,t3_3v0nhl,Yay! Have bitched about this for years!EDIT Ok  success rate. Lowes and Amazon cards connected right up Target is having Connectivity issues and HH Gregg isnt even recognized. Still better than where we were.,mintuit,cxjvx21,3,t5_35qvn
5974991,0,t3_3x4vkb,What if you marked it as closed in the account detail in Mint?,mintuit,cy2upj8,1,t5_35qvn
6430821,0,t3_43r1sh,Two things lack of customizability with accountsbudgetsgoalsetc and how poor the investments page is in just about every way.  The one thing mint has going for it is its security.  I would never give my passwords to a small time personal finance tool.,mintuit,czkhh85,8,t5_35qvn
6808045,0,t3_48yxd8,You can add manual transactions in any account look for pencil icon I have never used that feature and I assume that after clearing the transactions wont match and you may need to delete them.Give it a try.,mintuit,d0nzl2i,1,t5_35qvn

8001925,0,t1_d4f43cq,I actually accessed the feature through my mobile app first then noticed it working on the  desktop site. Really lame and difficult ,mintuit,d4fhqaf,1,t5_35qvn
9847295,0,t1_dapuxcf,no accounts are hidden from anything thank you for showing me this feature but doesnt solve my issue.,mintuit,dar4is0,1,t5_35qvn
10183869,0,t1_dbydvgs,True back to the another reply in this thread  this definitely cuts into convenience.,mintuit,dbyec1y,1,t5_35qvn
10383245,0,t3_5okeig,I cant get mint to link to my bbt auto loan anymore. Not sure what the deal is. Just one of the many frustrating bugs that has me looking for an alternative to mint. ,mintuit,dcl06v6,1,t5_35qvn
11781278,0,t1_dgvd5z8,But you can do that for the current month. Until the month is over you can adjust your budgets as much as you want. Once the months over it doesnt make sense to adjust budgets. At that point you can look and see that you overspent on groceries and underspent on entertainment and either look at other previous months and see thats a trend so for the current month you can adjust those budgets and then see if you are able to stick to the current budgets or know that you overspent on groceries because you held a dinner party in which case you should have adjusted your budget when you went shopping.,mintuit,dgvg20l,1,t5_35qvn
