3959979,0,t3_35s2w1,Interesting review and perspective but I find myself disagreeing with it. I personally prefer skirmish to campaign by a long shot and found the expansions to be worth their penny in adding to the skirmish. I initially only bought Han Chewy and IG but after incorporating their cards and playing with the minis I went out and bought the rest of the skirmish packs.Just like video game DLC though its really for people who are already big fans of the game and want more of the same and are willing to pay a little premium for it. I understand the individual packages from a marketing perspective theyll make great stocking stuffers but I do with they were sold in  box and advertised as various modular expansions like all the different things in Eclipse Rise of the Ancients for example.,boardgameindustry,cr7o5wd,2,t5_38192
4016619,0,t3_36f4ww,Theres a lot to learn when getting into any industry and hobby board games is no exception.Im a retailer so I can start to address what it takes to get in touch with retailers. I could write an entire book on the subject because when you say that you want to get in touch with retailers you really have to think about what youre trying to accomplish. Do you want to try and sell your game direct to retailers? Or are you simply trying to inform them about your game which will be available? Because each of those questions leads down related but different rabbit holes.Either way you have to be ready to show the retailer why youre game will sell. Thats right why it will sell. Not why its awesome why its super fun why you and your friends put your heart and soul into it for years but why its going to fly off their shelves and make them money.,boardgameindustry,cre4idk,2,t5_38192

5994607,0,t1_cxwnps4,Hi  Ive found that they arent super fast at replying straight away  but once theres been some communication theyre really good. Also Id imagine this time of year theyre really busy too what with companies getting all their  games printed and all their  games priced up. Sorry I cant help much more. ,boardgameindustry,cy5f9av,1,t5_38192

7680207,0,t3_4jdsox,It is daunting and not for the feint hearted. If you are not into project management or business theres no point doing it and stick to designing games and hope a publisher picks it up. Its certainly been a steep and difficult learning curve for myself. Out of curiosity whats laughable about the prices James puts on there? They are extremely accurate in my experience having dealt with many artists of varying quality and experience. ,boardgameindustry,d3f6yzn,1,t5_38192

11399959,0,t3_62lqy9,USA is best for what youre trying to do. There are smaller more personal shows available. If one is dipping their toes in and want access to publishers a concentrated experience of the industry and a really good time BGG.Con is the best show going. Its small its friendly it has a great vibe. Essen is something else but youll likely find it tough to get time with publishers as they have packed meeting schedules. Best thing for you at this point is to join some FB groups and watch and listen. ,boardgameindustry,dfo65ux,1,t5_38192
