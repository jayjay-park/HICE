2852247,0,t1_cnsa5n2,In terms of end user experience theres not much difference.  Because both DEs are tuned with Mint themes and branding for their respective Mint releases they share commonality in themes and usability so they appear to the end user to be almost the same.  In terms of underlying functionality i.e. customisation theyre both very strong in that regard.  Last I checked though because Cinnamon is a bit more bleeding edge it implements features that MATE doesnt.  Mostly eyecandy stuff where MATE would need Compiz.MATE is based on more mature code so an argument could be made that there is a performance and stability benefit.  Though frankly if performance is your goal you could look at a range of other desktop environments including XFCE or E.Keep in mind too that Cinnamon is also Mints own DE where MATE is its own separate thing that happens to be aligned very closely with Mint.They are both handsome DEs that meet the needs of those of us who prefer a clean classic desktop that gets out of the way.  So it basically comes down to personal preference.  Do you prefer Ford or GM?  Nissan or Toyota?  They all have four wheels and engines and ultimately do the same thing.  Do you prefer Coke or Pepsi?  Theyre both diabeetus juice that does the same thing.... and so on. So given no strong preference the recommendation is that you try both and make up your own mind.  If you dont want to do that I personally feel that Cinnamon has a slight edge based on relevance and features.,linuxmint,cnsau98,5,t5_2ro56

Software bugs rarely trigger the internal speaker unless the MBR is corrupted or something.If youre sure its not a mainboard warning then other things it could be are a problem with the network card which might explain the appthingy or with the power supply and some of them beep the same way you describe when having a fault which can sometimes confuse signals from things like the mouse  is the network app in the corner of the screen?

Due to some hardware quirk that I am nowhere smart enough to understand when booting from Windows to Mint and viceversa multiple cold starts are required to get the sound working. I have seen other folks with this laptop have the same problem. I am not aware of any fix action and its really too bad because the laptop its self is absolutely superb.

6231543,0,t1_cyxk49q,Thanks for the detailed reply. Id like to remark on a few things. I am not too worried about the trackpad. I usually carry a wireless mouse around with me for issues like this anyway. I read LordPineapples response below about using the . kernel. I am not so adept with Linux that I know what it would do to change kernels or if there are any downsides though.. The keyboard is unlikely to bother me. . I may need your assistance setting up xdotool if youre okay with that.. Did you have any issues with the UEFI boot? . You mentioned you were running Cinnamon. As I dont really use Linux daily some of the nuances of Window Manager and X and distribution are lost on me. You said earlier you were running Fedora Core. Does this mean youre running Cinnamon as a Window Manager on Fedora Core?The main reasons I am looking at all this is. Ability to run Windows apps in a pinch.. A daily Linuxbased driver. . Thin.. Light.. I can finally stop worrying about Apple messing with my ability to run a USBSerial adapter with each new version of OS X. EDIT I suppose I should point out that I dont know why Ive seen the implication that Cinnamon runs better than MATE. Something to do with MATE being based on an older GNOME or something? Anyway I just installed Cinnamon on MINT here and ... well its working fine. I suppose I expected something like Ubuntus lookandfeel which I really really dont like.,linuxmint,cyxyign,1,t5_2ro56

6551084,0,t1_czwplcu,Hmm. Well in my experience GRUB Repair usually breaks things more than it fixes them. So stay away from it.Not sure what exactly is wrong so lets just reinstall GRUB. Well reinstall the grub package as well as grub itself.. Grab a LiveUSB with Mint on it.. Mount the partition you installed linux to. First run lsblk. This will give you a list of your partitions. Figure out which one has your linux installation on it. The best way to do that is to look at the size of the partitions. The one with linux on it is probably the biggest unless you have a separate home partition. If you arent sure just go with the biggest you can try again if you pick the wrong one. Lets assume the partition is sda. Mount it by running mount devsda mnt You always add dev to the partition name. To check if it is the right partition cd mnt then ls. It should list folders like bin sbin usr etc among others. If you guessed wrong cd  then umount mnt to unmount the partition. Try the next biggest partition.. chroot into the partition chroot mnt. This basically means that all the commands after this are now happening to the linux installation on the partition instead of to the LiveUSB.. Remove grub packages. Run aptget remove whateverThePackagesAreCalled use dpkg l | grep grub to see your grub related packages. Since there will be more than one package you will have to run this more than once once for each package.. Run aptget update.. Install those packages again. aptget install whateverThePackagesAreCalled Note that if your are indeed installing in legacy mode than you wont need grubefi. If that was one of the packages then we may need to look again at whether your computer is EFI or not.. Run grubinstall from command line to install grub. That should be simple fingers crossed. It is just grubinstall yourHarddrive Remember the partition name from earlier? The your harddrive has the same name as your partition but without the number. So if it was named sda the harddrive would be sda. The final command would be grubinstall devsda Remember dev first.Good luck! If you need this explained in more detail feel free to ask.Edit I explained in a lot more detail.,linuxmint,czwxp9l,1,t5_2ro56

The default assumption you should make when given the keep or replace option is to keep your configuration but if you really wanna be safe just click the dropdown arrow and read what is being changed. If its trying to change something from Linux Mint to Ubuntu then refuse the change with the Keep option.,linuxmint,dfkab79,1,t5_2ro56

11532869,0,t3_5zxvv0,Late to the party but I find installing the libwacom driver on its own generally comes up somewhat short. Itll see the tablet and stylus position but thats about it. Ive found in my experience to get all the features to work full pressure sensitivity range aspect ratio and stylus buttons you also need libwacom in addition to the basic Wacom libwacom driver set. Not sure if it applies fully to the current version but Im still on .. And thats what I had to do to get my Intuos working with Gimp Krita and Blender.,linuxmint,dg3944f,2,t5_2ro56

11651525,0,t1_dggagas,I know Xorg is super old but what makes wayland better? Is it just better for devs or are there benefits to end users as well?And from what I understand middleclickpaste functionality is tied into the clipboard baked into X  does Wayland replicate this functionality or will moving to wayland free me from the subjective annoyance of middleclickpaste?,linuxmint,dggpqk1,3,t5_2ro56
11673642,0,t1_dgj59rs,Hey thanks for the quick reply. BTW Im talking about Chrome not Chromium if that makes any difference which it probably doesnt. So this has been the case for over  years? In hindsight the only reason Im noticing this now is probably because Ive recently changed from a Logitech Anywhere MX to the newer MX  the wheel spins for ages after you use it in free spinning scroll mode which is cool  of the time but a pain in the arse in this one scenario. Ah well. At least that link does explain why this is only happening in Mint. Ta very much. ,linuxmint,dgj822t,1,t5_2ro56
