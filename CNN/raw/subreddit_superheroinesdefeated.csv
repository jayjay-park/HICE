10015675,0,t3_5j1jsg,I like it it reminds me of your three older comics with Darkseid I love those ones so much. Your other comics with the OC guy are pretty good as well but I love it when theyre existing characters that have a context together. Maybe that is just me I dont even like crossovers like mixing Marvel and DC characters. I hope youll do more like this again. Thanks for sharing.,superheroinesdefeated,dbd2knm,7,t5_2tj66
