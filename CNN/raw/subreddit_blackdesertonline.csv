But considering its been advertised as primarily a PvP game so far Im not sure how many PvE fans it really has at this point in the West. Well have to wait a while before we have any concrete info on our version. But in Korea in general they dont really do the PvEPvP server idea. Most Korean MMOs have only one server type and it usually has some form of PvP some games theres not much of it happening though either due to punishing rules or the nature of the game. The separate server idea is most definitely a Western invention lol.,blackdesertonline,cnsck5g,2,t5_2w6ir

Moneys so fucking easy to earn in this game that you are able to be selfsufficient. Sure you can argue that maybe the trade system disable trading goldgold bars. BUT whats stopping gold seller from buying those cheap ass k necklace that can be vendored for  silver and sell them to the gold buyers. gtBDO is PWnice proof m  I also like talking out of my ass.Anyways the combat in BDO is way better than any mmo I have played. I do agree the lack of content and things to do in this game but we should not be talking as if the game is fully released in korea or NAEU. A good example is Archeage people praised the game in alpha etc. and it turned out shit in the release.If theres a game with BDOs fluid combat style and Archeage content for pvp incentives then I think people would enjoy it more.,blackdesertonline,cq9st8m,1,t5_2w6ir

The game came out with the notion it would have open world PvP. so why would a PvE type person come and play this game? im not saying that a PvE person cannot play this game but to come into the game which again advertised itself as having open pvp and then try to change it? then that player is in the wrong.sure it sucks to get ganked by higher levels. i remember it happening alot in Tera. but guess what? the people banded together and were able to overcome. other higher levels came down to help and protect the lower level players.i think another alternative solution to adding PvE servers is to give PvP players more incentive to PvP in other areas. Such as arenas or battlegrounds.again im not saying that PvE players shouldnt play games that are PvP oriented. its just that they should come into the mindset that they are going to get ganked and it will happen often. ,blackdesertonline,cqujwjp,4,t5_2w6ir

4443147,0,t1_csqpnwh,I disagree wholeheartedly that the game will fail. Frankly the new toggle onoff pvp system is a brilliant idea you are not stuck to a faction youre faction can change every single time you queue up.  this idea actually eliminates griefing from gankingcampinglowbie killing. While You may enjoy ganking I dont and plenty other competitive PvP enthusiast see no point in it. So I dont see a point to dont want faction based PvP amp dont want BGs in place because neither exist currently. Ive been playing this game for quite awhile I say this not to say I know more because ive been here longer so please dont interpret it that way but I make this point to say Ive been playing this game for a good while since closed betas and I continue to grow in love for this game. Yes it has flaws but the developers continue to impress me with their ideas to sophisticate the pvp systems and differentiate this system from a general mmo system. As for the market yes we have a limited market system its called competitive market vs monopoly market. Free trade doesnt work. Flat out it has too many flaws gold sellers people who monopolize items. for example Walmart has enough money to buy target kmart and pretty much every grocery story but due to laws placed it cannot become a monopoly and must stay in a competitive market which means in business terms it must compete with other companies in prices. This game uses a system very similar to a competitive market for example Carrots         I sell carrots all the time the market is always sold out of carrots so I sell at maximum price every day and guess what every day I log on the maximum price increases because quantity vs demand is low vs highlow quantity vs high demand. I actually can change the market by myself by forcing max price or low price. Yes the developers can control the market but I can create inflation and deflation based on consumer demand and outsource production. This system is very unique. I have yet to see problems with gold sellers players who monopolize items and sell at extreme prices because they are the sole player type scenarios.The Loyalists you are referring to are dedicated fans of a system that did not stick nor allowed progression. the loyalists are SELECT FEW not the many and just in case you think I dont know who the loyalists are I surely do. Most of them compare everything the game has to Lineage though. ,blackdesertonline,csqqt15,2,t5_2w6ir

4818963,0,t1_cu10qi0,Black Desert is a large scale of sandbox oriented MMORPG that provides you a variety of unique experiences with spectacular action and battle strategybased castle siege sophisticated simulation contents such as trade NPChiring and real estate management.A sandbox is a style of game in which minimal character limitations are placed on the gamer allowing the gamer to roam and change a virtual world at will. In contrast to a progressionstyle game a sandbox game emphasizes roaming and allows a gamer to select tasks. Instead of featuring segmented areas or numbered levels a sandbox game usually occurs in a world to which the gamer has full access from start to finish. A sandbox game is also known as an openworld or freeroaming game.I would say that BDO fits pretty well into the definition of sandbox. A sandbox game isnt a definition of features X Y and Z rather it is how the game allows the player to interact with the game world. Black Desert for example gives you a multitude of options for progression besides leveling. Sandbox is constantly defined by players who are focused on the features of what they have seen in previous games  and that frankly is wrong.,blackdesertonline,cu1yx9z,1,t5_2w6ir

5365478,0,t1_cvxh6k4,A better analogy would be me contemplating the purchase of a new car. I see a new and upcoming model in the works. Its been tested in foreign markets but the manufacturer told the West that changes would be made before entering our market. Before the car ever sets foot on domestic soil I want the manufacturer to be perfectly clear of what I would like the car to be and what Im personally hoping it to be.Lets use this analogy since its the one you are willing to accept even though I dont really see the difference from mine but I digress.In this scenario the car and more specifically the team producing that car have made changes to that product prior to releasing it in your market. You are unhappy with those changes and are understandably trying to make changes to that product so it doesnt continue down a path you perceive as incorrect. The problem is that those changes arent being done to your liking nor what I would assume is fast enough.Nothing I have stated above should be considered bad or unwarranted. You are consumer with every right to not be happy with the direction of the product and that includes voicing that opinion. However having said that... you seem unwilling to accept the fact that your opinion is just that your opinion. At the end of the day the car manufacturer has every right to ignore your opinion and continue down the path they have chosen. This isnt something I think you would disagree with but please do correct me if I am wrong here.What you are instead doing is attacking and bashing those people that do like the car simply for liking the car the way it was designed. Yes you wanted it another way no there is nothing wrong with wanting it another way but this isnt about you. This is their product and they will do with it as they wish. If the tables were turned and this were your product I expect you would feel the same way when someone bashes your product for not being what they wanted or expected.At the end of the day this isnt about you or your opinion. This is about the company any company producing a product as they see fit. Does that mean they made the right choices?HELL NO.For all this typing and arguing you very well may be  correct and BDO will flop... even going so far as to say its possible for this to happen due to every single issue you pointed out. Yet even giving you all of that nothing trumps the obvious this isnt your call. The only call you have to use here is to either play the game as it is which includes these changes or dont. You are feel to voice your frustrations at those lack of changes but that doesnt mean you should get those changes nor bash those people that dont want those changes. This doesnt revolve around you nor your desires for BDO. This is about selling a product to a large portion of people all of whom have different expectations desires and requests for said product and to accomplish something like that it means not everyone is going to be happy. Something I think you fully understand but are either unable or unwilling to apply it to BDO.Again this all revolves around one simple issue. If you dont like the direction of the game then voice your opinion and move on to a game that does fit your criteria which again is all the OP said to you. I dont understand why you keep trying to fight an uphill battle with development. Not usreddit as there is nothing to argue about. They are clearly not going to release the title you want so why do you keep fighting a fight that cant be won?,blackdesertonline,cvxi16k,2,t5_2w6ir

Unless youre hardcore and want to compete to be number  in an area of the game you have nothing to worry about. If you are such a person you probably already played KRJPRU version to get more knowledge and already have a solid game plan and guild group all set to rush the first couple days with.As for gear I dont think they can be that much more OP as market resources will be few at start which means everyone will be fighting to buy the same items faster. With multiple players after the same mats its not possible for one to control all. Take weapon black stones for example. First days on RU it was hard to buy the first one you saw. Couple days later the market had a steady supply. One single hardcore player cant buy every single one of them and even if he did he would be one single strong player. that wouldnt make his guild stronger or OP unless every single member of their guild got all the black stones.All hardcore possibly pw players will buy all blackstones to make  the first couple days and semi hardcorecasuals will follow. There is a cap so they wont be able to stay OP for long and anyone trying will catchup.Short version Unless your hardcore or going for Rank you dont have much to worry about.,blackdesertonline,cx9ykbw,-4,t5_2w6ir

I generally plan on the more unpopulated channels so when I go into a town it isnt flooded with people and I get good FPS. Generally speaking most MMOs really rely on CPU performance and laptop CPUs just arent too great when theyre compared to desktop CPUs.For example in RIFTs Conquests which are huge battles of like  people on the same map and my laptops FPS dips below  FPS at some points when everyone is spamming abilities. In comparison my desktop which has an iK and a Titan X stays well above  FPS in those same situations and  FPS is actually really good for Conquest.Another comparison like I said I generally get  FPS in BDO on my laptop at p while I can get over  FPS on my desktop in BDO at xp.

I guess once you have some good stream of money coming in through the production lines you spoke of youd be valuable to any group of players as a source of mats and money. Im kinda just trying out the different things you can do in the game right now. Ive done a bunch of quests of all kind grinded a bit on goblins and traded some ancient coins I got from the treasure hunt quest. Ive invested most of my time and money so far into horse riding. Ended up spending k silver on the horse equipment from the stable shop. I couldnt find those for better prices on the market. I wish the game has some good way of letting a player like me join up with someone like you for rewarding mutual benefit and without too much wasted effort. Right now I imagine if I want to join you in your trade runs I wouldnt be helping much or getting much. ,blackdesertonline,cy3tqil,2,t5_2w6ir

6003387,0,t3_3xo39p,I understand what type of combat you like tab target and dont get me wrong here you are free to enjoy whatever features you like! But thats the opposite of BDO. BDO has surely one of the BEST combat styles i ever played in a MMORPG and quite sadly iv played ALOT of them. Why you ask? PvP wise you focus more on preset key combos to execute skills instead of an action bar with keybinds you have both main resource and stamina bar that affect skill usage you cannot hit anything you are not aiming to  you can effectively dodge and get dodged by enemies humans or npcs you dont cannot magically attack behind walls therefor you can use obstacles very effectively you can build up your skills as you wish and combo as you please with the skill point build uppurchase possibilities generally skills have no CD instead you have the special skill effects on CD you can use them more then once but the effect will have its internal CD Real time Weather System that affects combat you have mounted combat the holy trinity factor is not high in the game tank  healer  DPS life is persistent for example your mount will stay where you let him so you have to take care of him and leave him in a non combat zone et cetera refer to detailed posts for more info PvE wise everything above but with soft targeting kinda like aim assist you can and should turn it off tho because you have no aim assist in PvP Its action combat oriented with combo based skills. The most fluid combat you can find is always the action oriented one. While in tab target you press the keybind and the combo follows up in action combat you have to build up the combo by using the skills one after the other imagine a combat game like soulcalibur tekken or any of that kind its  with that logic.articles for more in depth informationHope you find your game mate!

6147391,0,t3_3zpyqi,As a player from ArcheAge back to Alpha till recently... no its nothing like Archeage in terms of PW.    First off there is no player to player trading so you cant buy from gold sellers thus no bots killing mobs or running tradepacks.   The main difference is the amount of money you would get from selling shop items isnt really going to get you as much currency in game as it does in AA due to actually being able to make good money in BDO.   The reason AA was so easy to PW was how much you got from selling the shop items vs how much effort you would have to put in running packs or farming.  AA was terrible for making money especially in the last few months with how theyve basically broken the economy and made crafting far too easy.In BDO I feel no desire to spend real money to get silver because its not that hard to go and make silver... and you have many ways to do it fishing crafting packs grinding etc to get just as much if not more than dropping money into the cash shop.That said i would like to see a way for us to buy pearls with in game silver just not sure it will happen.,blackdesertonline,cyoe70q,1,t5_2w6ir

6388357,0,t3_4359zp,Apparently theyre shifting it like Russia from the way it is in Korea but camping prime spots is actually punished by the Karma system.  If DaumPA give into that prepare for the player base to be  of what it would be with the full PvE adult crowd carebears.  KR is about consensual PvP not ganking greifing campingbased adolescent PvP.  Still NA may be more like that.AFAIK GvG is channel based and the node sieges definitely are.  You cant switch channels to hunt for people because theres only one channel where its active.GvG is also consensual the guild declaring the war paying a guildsize adjusted fee then the opposing guild can just pay the fee to decline it or its game on. Theres still lots of consensual PvP and tons of GvG and weekly sieges but in KR what you envision as PvP is pretty effectively banned.Channel hopping isnt unlimited it has a a cooldown and if youre breeding a horse or having a worker take an exam you cant change channels period until either is done.  Even when you can change channels you have to be out of combat for a while and then on the new channel you cant manage the workers who had tasks assigned in the other channel until they quit.Again it sounds like NA may tilt more toward the male teenybopper PvP you seem to be interested in so dont lose hope there.BTW even premerged servers in KR each server had  channels and the official fights were all in channel .,blackdesertonline,czfsfxn,2,t5_2w6ir

6438224,0,t3_43uud5,gtI feel like although it is Open world PvP they really dont want you to PvP due to the harsh penalties. This is correct and in fact intended by the developer Daum. They do not desire to have smallscale OWPvP. Granted it is there and it is your choice to do so however there are intended effects. Daum believes PK should only happen for a reason not just because you desire to kill and PvP everyone.Daum wants BDO to be largescale PvP oriented to the likes of Castle Sieges and Guild Wars. So if you want to be Mr. Gank or Mr. Grief or what have you you may do so at the opportunity of being outcast from all towns due to negative Karma. Personally Im ok with that as it gets rid of the tom foolery so I was a bit miffed when I saw they were wanting to bring on a bounty system to enable this sort of stuff though I guess at the same time if you PK me Ill just get PK  to gank your dumbass instead or just go full Guild War. The Bounty System thankfully will not be in at launch. Valencia when it does come in  months will have the only Bandit as they labeled it town where negative Karma PKers may seek haven.edit Valencia is the desert and upon entering it you lose ticks of  HP per second. You lose about half of your abilities etc. Just in case you werent aware. If you gain negative karma traders and shops wont sell to you and there will come a point where town guards will KOS. Thus you will effectively be shut out from the world for the massive PKing.,blackdesertonline,czl91jr,6,t5_2w6ir

They can do all the balance that they want they wont fix that unless something magically happens in the korean version something good that will make koreans start playing the game again.

Depends on the definition and should be asked a russian guy because its just about how it feels and not how many players are left in RU BDO.In the end it depends which decisions DAUM is going to make and you cant really tell.

Enchants also dont scale at the same rate per enchantment take the example that was in a post from the official forumsLiverto Weapon stats   damage   damage   damageWhat the above numbers mean  Enchanting your weapon from  to  increases the damage by .  Enchanting your weapon from  increases the damage by another .  This means that almost half  of the bonus comes from  to . The  to  is also a larger jump than  to  or  to .So yeah upgrading colour rarity and enchanting gear is super important. Weapons amp armor can almost be graded according to their price World Boss drops are superior to all but priced accordingly.

The hype levels are about what youd expect from a relatively niche style of MMO being ported from Korea with very little marketing going into advertising.Honestly I am glad the hype levels are where theyre at instead of through the roof because it keeps the fans skeptical and keeps the developers in check.  With a hype level over  just before launch publishers generally feel like they can start milking people with microtransactions and founders packs because people are much more likely to throw money at something when theyre hyped.I would much rather have a game start off with mild hype which slowly grows into a mature MMO community by the time the first big expansion comes out.

I understand that a lot of people are fine with grinding their way through the game until they are finished but I think shipping it without endgame content this way in the EU is a surefire way to murder it before they send it out the door.It is a damn shame too because they seem to have spoton basic systems and graphics. However it is so filled to the brim with odd asian designprinciples that I cant help but to feel that they will alienate the western possible players.I mean they have all these wonderful systems in place where they can put rewards like peoples obsession with customizing their characters or the housing system but they dont seem to have a fun and rewarding way to aquire said rewards. Why not make the grind one way to get a boat but also make a difficult raid or dungeon to unlock it faster or at least in another way. I think I will enjoy my first  days with this game running around looking at people and stuff hopefully they make some kind of RP server.

6518665,0,t3_44xia1, Yes people who play more than you will be better than you atleast in terms of overall progress. Theyll do more damage take more damage and be further along. Thats just the nature of MMOs. There is not traditional PvE in the sense of RaidsInstanced content.  Its more like how it used to be back in the early days of MMOs. Tons of stuff to do in the world as well as world bosses summoned bosses and ingame dungeons. On top of that theres Fishing Boating Whaling Taming Breeding Crafting Housing and many other things.

6541967,0,t1_czvol53,You are just describing any KR mmorpg a grind to reach the level cap and then nothing and this is also why most of them arent very successful.  I cant agree with there are many thing to do   Quests are limited and very repetitive sometimes you get a balance the cart quest but mostly is go to talk to the npc kill the mobs some quests requires to kill mobs... retrieve the item.  Other than quests you are basically going to grind your exp up also Id like to point that most quests are really really exp inefficient rising up the point of balance but it is a beta so K.  So there are some other few things not related to properly leveling up the market mechanics and the housing while they are fun for a while I dont see many ppl spending hundreds hours of playtime on that.  Then some other side mechanics  Fishing is a loooong wait I cant see ppl do this over and over cause the minigame it is just a wait and click there is no mechanic other than that involved.  Capture the horse is kinda new and funny but you get your horse in a play time then it is over.  Gathering is farming well I consider anyone like whatever they like but farming is farming go around clicking on veins isnt really that funny also considering it takes an unexplainable amount of time to mine or gather yeah it gets lower but seriously  seconds? These are the ways devs use to make you play a game doing nothing.  Crafting is something I didnt really experience a lot cause the translation was completely broken so I wont judge but what is crafting going to be used for? is my question. You dont really need anything for pve cause the content is really easy and you dont need to do raids or dungeons so increasing your gear is mainly a pleasure more than useful.  I personally have seen many mmorpgs starting the same way as BDO but I have seen none succeeding. Atm the things I think are positive in BDO are the fight system and the gfx but the fights system is really going to get boring cause there is nothing hard to fight and the gfx alone cant make a game successful. ,blackdesertonline,czvzqh4,1,t5_2w6ir

However the aggro range and mob speed isnt much so you can access many parts of the map even at a low level. The world is worth exploring too. Lots of things in the game look flat out cool. Towns and cities show variety so its worth going from one city to another just to look at it. The scenery is cool and fairly realistic looking and the mobs inhabiting it are cool. There are also explorationrelated rewards such as discovering nodes and trade routes revealing the map  leveling up staminastrength as you travel on the roads which I predict will be very entertaining early in the games life when players on the road are friendly and open stumbling upon a world boss and getting into the fight to get some loot more applicable when you reach higher levels and Im super there are other benefits I havent though of. ,blackdesertonline,czzydqw,2,t5_2w6ir

6581500,0,t1_czzygv0,Yes it was on KR server. I found this super annoying but the problem didnt persist because he lost so much karma. Once I stopped attacking him he stopped attacking me since if he continued he couldnt return to town without the guards killing him.This problems will be less due to a gear cap at launch. But it may be worst due to lower karma penalties for ganking.  Bottom line is to avoid PvP of you dont enjoy it sometimes griefers will trick you into attacking them so they can kill you without penalty.,blackdesertonline,d002x6i,1,t5_2w6ir

The issue is that max levels are coming down to lower level zones and oneshotting everyone for whatever reason making it impossible to pvp a low level since all it takes is  max level asshole to make the entire thing unplayable if you werent among the power levelers at launch.It would have been a different matter if the power level wasnt so drastically different and you could gather a bunch of lowbies and take down the high level.

You could always check the forums for a specific build if you are feeling it but in game there will be options to skill reset full resets are still to be announced. You could not go wrong in what skills you take. Get to whatever level you can and test out the different abilities for the class of your liking that way you know what you would invest in in the full game. It really depends on how you spend your time on the Beta and even then do what you have the time for and continue your exploration for the full game.

I can argue that you are just used to playing games with cheap costumes but the pricing is definitely not anything new here. Here is thing about economy of scale it doesnt always scale linearly. just because its  dollar it doesnt mean  sets will be sold a lot of players will be happy with just one set.   I can also say that the price is most likely the most profittable choice determined after professional analysis looking over the current marketspending in Western market.

6625255,0,t3_46dmjc,The people raging and dismiss ingrefunding the game over the current prices before any kind of feedback can even be taken are fools and I can completely sympathize with this post. That said at  from what Im hearing they are  to  higher than they should be shooting for. Ultra cheap cosmetics are not an option full stop. Particularly when they can only sell what theyre given from the dev and cant just spin up new items when funds are not coming in as expected. My basis for items like this is that single purchase items anything that players will buy once and then will likely not bring in much more revenueno repeat revenue should be no more than what you would pay in for a monthly sub  but are reasonable near that price if its a bpfp title. Ultra cheap single purchase items result in companies having to resort to lots of attractive borderlineblatant pw consumablerecurring purchase items that we ultimately dont want to see. Without a sub companies are balancing windfall income from single purchase items and looking for a similar subscriptionlike trickle of funds from SOME kind of recurring item it looks like theyre trying to use dyes in this case.Tldr people are being irrational shits as usual but the prices need to come down just not too far downas far as people are demanding.,blackdesertonline,d04lwuq,6,t5_2w6ir

6673182,0,t1_d09ers7,In this day and age its pretty hard to make your launch be unstable. Ive been a part of many MMO launches over the years and the last few years theyve been fairly smooth. The worst I had was probably ArcheAge. Blade amp Soul launched quite smoothly and GW had overflow issues and the starting area bugging but I havent had anything gamebreaking since WoW patch days. ,blackdesertonline,d09kcaw,1,t5_2w6ir
6673628,0,t1_d09khml,Yeah I think the issue is youre thinking of pulling one great item as gathered or one special ingredient.  The complexity doesnt like in that direction except with whaling and a few things like Truffles and their mineral equivalents.The complexity winds up being pulling together varied ingredients that take different professions and kinds of investment with items that you actually have a hard time buying.  Some of these really require workers and reaching out to nodes where you dont care about the main item thats visible on the map but the powders theyll get.  Some are things like the Fruits of x where there are usually less than a dozen if any of any kind up for sale.  Its not that a skill level is the bar but a time and resource bar.  Even if youre the richest guy on the server and the best trained alchemist you wont be able to make more than tiny batches of some things unless youre also willing to farm the right crops.  So its less that its simple than it is based on asking you to make complex decisions about what kinds of things you can actually get done in the time and with the resources you have.  Granted the bulk of items are commodities.  Dont want to have workers get your grains to make beer dont want to pick it buy grain.  But thats just another layer thats always there of just buy the beer why craft?  Some other guy will do it.There are things though you can make that just dont get sold and where its just not worth it for you to sell because it has other value than silver.  Id never sell those damned Fruits of Magic Power because I spent too many weeks going every few hours to pick and replant.  No one else is selling theirs either.  A farmer doesnt see it as a money crop.  An alchemist sees it as the only way to make Oil of Tranquility.I guess Id rather this than see gating by level where after reaching level x you get rewarded by making this new thing of quality.  Making it simplified gating like WoW raid drops of Mace of Badassery.  Youd just put in some time and there was that simple smaller list of things all done all finished no thought but that youd reached the level where exclusivity applied.  I dont make better things because I learned how and invested in the ways to make production happen I make them because I have arbitrarily attained masterhood and quality after a set amount of leveling.  To me thats shallow and complexity is in managing formulas and resources that require you to make sacrifices take chances and spend time for results.   Maybe its opinion and perspective but being able to produce an item in whole or collect it as finished simply by virtue of producing or collecting for a longer time seems really dull.

I think the most epic part of my ride last night was when I was in a forest then the trees started to disappear and I have to stop or else I would fall and in front of me was this amazing view there was a lake hundreds of feet below me light in the sky was breathtaking AM so sunrise and far away there is a silhoutte of a castle near Calpheon castle.Some small streams of water force me to stop on my exploration and just walk out there and cast my fishing rod didnt get anythng special. There was a riot in main Calpheon city I saw the war elephant. I got lost in a massive enemy camp and had to struggle my way out after my horse failed to jump out the their barricaded fence. I like night times I only and very rarely use my lantern when Im grinding mobs  I wish there is a way to turn down intensity of the lantern else I would end up not using it at all even if it means bumping up against an elite mob I cant see.

It has veered further and further from its initial design to appeal to a different demographic and grow its player base which it did well for many years.gt Hes not demanding that WoW become a territorial PvP game.uKittimm wasnt accusing him of anything like that. He was just making it clear that you should pick the game that has what you want and the fact that a game doesnt have what you want doesnt make it a bad game. It just makes it a game that you may not enjoy.gt Its incredibly frustrating when you watch a game you love devolve into a lesser product and shifts away from its core ideology that drove you to buy it in the first place.Again it hasnt devolved into something lesser. It simply became something different that now lacks the qualities you seek. It now has qualities that other players enjoy. You dont like it now and thats ok. Its also ok to love the shit out of it as many people still do. It does suck when something you love changes. It feels bad and I totally sympathize. It happens similarly with bands as well. Some of my favorite bands have started making music that I just do not like and wont listen to. But that doesnt mean I think they suck ass now or that they should go back to making the same music they did before.

The values for the cash shop are right before you the game mechanics detailed the top guild requirements known etc.  When all factors that go into formulating a judgement are known its pretty easy to assess the right answer.  It is nigh impossible to play this game at the top end of the competitive spectrum without shelling out cash.  That in my mind equates to pay to win.  Its really as simple as that.  The most mundane and basic example of this is the headstart time differentials for how much you invest.  You are literally paying to start the race faster.  I dont understand how any of this is debatable which is why Im quite comfortable in behaving in an absolute manner.  The only other viewpoint present is from people that dont care about being competitive or efficient.  Then just pay your  and have fun.

6708892,0,t3_47h4jn,Value at least in this case should be subjective. Think before you buy people. And honestly this is really not well done.Look at the base package . You cannot put a price on the base game as this link seems to do and then add the cost of the items given with the lowest priced package because there is no way to buy this base game. Theres only the base package. As such this is your baseline to compare.Lets consider the  package by removing everything that is already included in the  package pack  house deco coupons   dye boxes   skill resets   horse whistle   pet   char slot   weapon skin   Tier  horse  h headstartSo what you get is a  value for extra  so  in extra junk if you spend  without adding in the horse not worth that much and headstart time.So what you have to consider here is if whether youre planning on spending  on on the cash shop to buy any of the items on this list. For example if you plan to buy a pet and a horse whistle then this package is a good choice. If you plan to buy a pet and a weapon skin same thing.Most of the benefits are very poor but you have to analyze this from a personal perspective.Obviously this is all based on the outrageous cash shop prices they set which are completely arbitrary. The fact these packs exist is the main reason the cash shop will not be changed before release btw.,blackdesertonline,d0d998d,2,t5_2w6ir

6723597,0,t1_d0ep73p,Wrong on both accounts.  To illustrateJohnny Donuts is a PvE player with zero interest in PvP. However he has made it a personal goal to reach level  before the Media expansion releases in  days a reasonable estimate in my opinion. To do this Johnny Donuts will have to spend roughly  hours without an exp buff complete guess exp gain was slowed for NA release. Given the  exp buff it will take him about  hours instead or exactly one hour per day.After Johnny Donuts reaches his goal on the th day he will have saved roughly  hours of grinding time. As Johnny Donuts happens to be a fulltime student this translated to an additional  hours of study. Did this matter to Johnny Donuts? You bet it did. Would it have mattered to uJimboSnipah? Who knows.  It doesnt really matter how the numbers are fudged the end result is this You will have to grind  less than someone without the buff. It doesnt matter how competitive you are or how many hours you play per day. What matters is how much you value your free time.

For the Cooler the Hyper  is fine but if you are going to overclock I would recommend at least a Corsair H. Worth the slight price increase and very reliable.Your mother board is complete overkill. Go with an AsRock Extreme  or . Both  cheaper and youll never notice any difference in performance. If you prefer Asus look for a board costing no more than . Spending over  is pointless.You do not need more than GB of ram. After GB you get next to no performance increase when I say next to know were talking less than  if youre lucky. In gaming this will amount to less than .. G.Skill has a good reputation personally I use Corsair in all my builds.I personally do not like large t drives. Id rather have  tb drives or two tb drives. Use the money you save from reducing the RAM to get two smaller drives with a total storage at or above the tb. If one fails youll still have another to use. Also get RPM drives.Do not get a ti the new Nvidia cards are coming out this year around June. While the ti is a great card if you wait a few months youll have much better options. Do yourself a favor and pick up a gb  for about  and then get an awesome Nvidia Pascal chipset card. Youll be glad you did trust me.The w power supply is over kill. Go with a corsair RM or Rm. Save yourself a little money for that sweet ass Pascal GPU.If you have any specific questions about my recommendations or want any input on any items you substitute feel free to reply.

6775686,0,t1_d0k1t81,You are mostly just restating your definition of PW but I understand how you define it. Im just trying to explain why I dont see what you are against as all that harmful.Take your concern about silver at least when someone sells items they used cash for to gain silver they are going to buy the same things you buy with the silver you spent time earning. You arent hitting a paywall on silver purchases because you opted to get silver at a slower rate. Everything the person using cash does is something you can do too as you can gain shop items through ingame work you can achieve everything he can ingame without spending a dime. Gaining silver isnt something ONLY the person using the cash shop can do so getting silver faster through a shop isnt a big deal to me as it just becomes a matter of speed like any game offering pay for convenience reductions to the time sink.. It simply comes down to reducing the time sink if you can sell shop items for currency which doesnt scare me. Not gating content is important to me especially in a BP game.I dont see how people can be okay with things that reduce the time sink like exp boosts or better energyboosting beds being cash shop exclusive unavailable through ingame work yet they are against someone reducing their currency farming sink. In the end all of it is just about reducing a players time sink. It is hypocritical to be for some of it and against the rest.,blackdesertonline,d0kb2vd,1,t5_2w6ir

To connect  cities together you need to connect the exploration nodes in between that makes a complete path. After you invest cp into the exploration nodes you can then further invest more cp into resource nodes which allows you to send workers to the exploration nodes to collect resources for you.At the moment Im currently invested in velia and hidel.

Its not simply fighting mobs to gear up youre also against other players and that i think is where the game also does a great job. Its not simply about a player nolifing all day every day he also has to be good enough to beat other players or whole guilds.. since everyone is fighting for the best spots unless youre on an empty server of course.What i mean is the player who has really high gear or the highest on server is not a weak no lifer you can safely assume they are strongexperienced players.

This allows you to move your character by clicking a spot with the cursor. Moving around with this doesnt take control of the camera and force you to look straight ahead when sprinting. You can look around wherever you like as your character runs. I realize this isnt ideal but it does bypass the issue.Something else that might help is the Adjust Vision Range setting at nearly the bottom of the Screen tab. This basically changes your FOV. Increasing or decreasing this I would imagine decreasing it but YMMV may alleviate your discomfort.,blackdesertonline,d0rqgu9,3,t5_2w6ir

While other MMOs may allow PP trading BDO does not. It really isnt about giving freedom to the players but rather the system is already set in place when the game is developed whether you like it or not.

6861665,0,t3_49ood8,I dont know why its so hard to just fix the dye system BDO is an amazing game and its a shame to see it being held back by such a stupid system. Theres no defence for this ridiculous cashgrab dye system i want to see this game excel in every way so we can have the best mmo weve had in a long while. If they simply make dyes reusable then thats all id need to be satisfied. The idea that a dye dissapears after its been used and youll need to play RNG all over again to get a decent dye. What if I wanted an all black outfit? Would i need to spend countless dollars on dye packs until i have a collection of blackish dyes so i could somewhat get the look i want? This system is  against the consumer. Its so ridiculous that I actually visited one of those goldpear selling chinese sites just to take a look...everything is half the price of the actual item in the cash shop ofcourse i would never consider handing over my credot card to those spamming fuckers but still people who support goldsellers are dicks howeverin this case i wouldnt even blame them.  for a costume? Its clear theyre trying to push the cash shop on us with the almost identical pieces of armor you get. If you wanna look unique either drop  bucks for a costume or play the dye casino and gamble for a good set of dyes.For those arguing that bdo needs this to make money and this is how they need to do it fuck off please. Is the initial  dollars we pay not enough? Are the  costumes not enough? Are the partial skill resets we are forced to buy if we want to change our build not enough? Bdo is a great game and it doesnt need this cashgrab to make a good income.

I then chose an extreme situation to demonstrate the rather extreme difference between them where we should heartily affirm one and absolutely deny the other.

It does give one.  There is no arguing that.  The only argument is whether it crosses a pay  win boundary which is not a factual thing but decided subjectively.gtThe other bonuses are extremely negligible and really only impacting at extremely low levels.Percentage based bonuses by definition give more of a benefit when theyre working on a greater value.  Reaching level   quicker is meaningless.  Reaching level   quicker is a bigger deal.  It goes on. The flat bonuses help more at low levels and are still bonuses at high levels that shouldnt exist.

6936812,0,t1_d121vho,I have noticed that the term casual seems to have evolved a double meaning in the gaming world although the two are not necessarily mutuallyexclusiveThe most common definition is a person that just doesnt have a lot of time to play because of real life responsibilities. The other meaning is someone who isnt competitive at all and often enjoys doing their own thing ingame and taking their time. This type of player usually doesnt care about the metagame or minmaxing and just wants to have fun in their own way.My point is that the latter type of casual player can sometimes put in as much time as a hardcore player but might spend more of it collecting vanity items achievement hunting trading etc. and typically has much less of a desire to stay caught up with or ahead of everyone else.

Only at lvl  do they open up and start doing crazy damage and fun. At  there one of the better farmers in PvE if rather boring.Ranger PvP one of the best classes atm for pvp til awakens come. Can very easily hold its own in v and very good in groupsiege. Ranger is very fast and cant get away pretty easily but your a ranger why would you run? Long as you learn your animation cancels you will be golden in pvp.Sorc PvE there pretty strong from  leveling no real down side. They can pull a lot of mobs and have multiple resources to kill them very fast. You get a multi directional teleport that makes traveling around areas extremely fast allowing you to grind faster than most folk can get to the mobs. At  there still good farmers it just they have to get everything packed together st to really let loose while other classes dont really need as much grouping.Sorc PvP queen of v. She has so many tools to combat a opponent and with teleport can run circles around fools. This is were it gets hard kinda. With having so many skills its hard to remember them all let along keep the button combos going without looking like your just hitting keys. But if effort is put in then Sorc will really shine. There beasts and one of the only classes that can compete vs Rangers. Not to mention Sorc becomes a powerhouse when she gets her awaken weapon!!Hope this helped and wasnt to sloppy,blackdesertonline,d156zzs,3,t5_2w6ir

If you reach a threshold the breeding grade doesnt matter anymore see point .. The only thing that happens with different tiersleveldeaths is that you can reach or miss thresholds.If youre using the tool you can see your breeding grade and the table below.

7005899,0,t3_4bmhy4,You first need to check what materials it needs.Find nodes that give the needed materials if possible.And purchase houses that is needed to craft needed materials if necessary.If any material cant be gathered by workers you need to either buy them on the market place or farm them yourselfZinc ore for example. You can also buy the materials on the market place but I only recommend this if the materials are cheap or rare.Take note that when buying rarer materials or materials with high demand on the market place there may be competition on the material you want and so people camp the market place and buy it when it becomes available.As for what city it should be where you can craft the item you want and if possible the city where most of your workers are gathering materials for the item so you dont need to travel around just to move items to the city where you are making the item.Sometimes you will need to send items from other cities or manually travel with the items to the city to fill up on materials.Workers needed are equal to gathering nodes  some needed for the crafting houses.Take note that your contribution points might not be enough for this yet. But you should start with the gathering nodes so you can start to amass allsome of the needed materials.Could also be good to gather potato or wheat with a worker or more and start making beer with a cooking utensil in a residence so you dont need to buy beer all the time.,blackdesertonline,d1agoty,1,t5_2w6ir

Even just idle NPC banter mentioning a lot of fish caught somewhere off the coast of  place would help. As it stands right now the coastal cave spot is well known so people just go there. It definitely beats the shotgun approach of trying to find your own.

The exploit is nowhere near  safe  reports that the field bosses getting perma stunlocked are false since they can still attack and one shot you  and deaths still happen often when using this mechanic. If anything the exploit just makes it possible to kill the field boss in a reasonable amount of time and effort.

And do the reverse with my workers in Epheria making the crates in Altinova. The extra time it takes per crate wont bother me.

Nothing changes everyone started as a lvl and some people chose to get to  in a week some people chose to build a fucking boat and sail for a month. Either way you had a level playing field a month ago people pissed it away on other aspects of the game which isnt wrong and now they are behind. Same thing will happen in Mediah some people will spend a few days just exploring it and setting up zinc nodes or some shit and BAM just like that they are behind again because the hardcore pvpgrinders will be taking vacation or calling in to work if they have jobs and already hit the soft cap before you have set up your new little trade route. ,blackdesertonline,d1hvvu1,0,t5_2w6ir

It FEELS alive and thats something I always wished that GW had achieved but they didnt.I definitely dont agree though that  is the weak point. After raising three classes on the KR version to cap I believe that secret to really enjoying the game is not not worry about the levels at all and just enjoy it all the way up and beyond.

7237635,0,t1_d20v4md,In what way?  To me it seems that having fishing and grinding as better money makers than gatheringcrafting  which are very deep and interesting systems in the game  that the former is undermining all of the gameplay involved in them.  Whats the point of gatheringfarmingcrafting if its not a money maker. For example currently its not really even a bit profitable to craft horse gear. I think this is fine in the sense that I still like crafting it for my own horses but its a bit silly that I cant turn a slight profit on doing it for others no?,blackdesertonline,d20v7nd,2,t5_2w6ir
7238114,0,t1_d20r171,gtBut People want black desert to be something its not... A pvp game.Theres a lot of things wrong with this statement.Black desert is a PVP game.  Its also a PVE game an interior design simulator a fishing game a tradingcrafting game an exploration game a social game a horsetamingbreeding game a stalkpeoplewithyouruglycharacterandmakethemuncomfortable game...and more.  Because its a Sandbox.  Its all of these things at the same time.Youre doing the same thing I said everyone always does in the beginning of my post  youre derisive towards a playstyle that clashes with yours and attempting to invalidate it.  Youre attempting to say Its not a game for people that enjoy X because you can do so much Y and Z.Sandboxes really mean giving players freedom and that includes the freedom to be dicks to each other.  This can go really badly when there arent disincentives against it but BDO does better than some games in the past have.  Its very easy to avoid being PKed in BDO if you are careful and use good judgement.  The penalty for dying as a red is appropriate for how little there is to gain from killing people and typically how little those people lose from dying.  If youre really salty about the open pvp though you might want to consider your practices learn how to sweep your camera while watching the minimap for white squares and be ready to V out whenever someone attacks.  Its astonishingly easy to avoid dying in world PVP in BDO.  I dont think its happened to me more than once outside of guild wars and Im now lvl .gtWhile pvpers moan that they dont wanna be forced into content they find boring PVE They are doing the exact same thing to pveplayers by forcing pvp onto them.The only people moaning are people that moan.  As a whole the class of people who are moaners exist all across the spectrum of playstyles and those people are going to moan no matter what because thats what they do.gtIn a Sandbox a player should be free to do what they want right? so why should this only apply to the best geared amp highest lvl?This is a very good point.  In a sandbox gear and raw playtime should not provide the kind of advantages that it does in BDO.  This aspect of BDO is heavily rooted in the parts of its design that originate from themepark MMOs and its one of the things that brings the game down.gt I just wished BDOs pvp was more like Dark Souls where skill mattered more. So that even the most high lvl player can get slaughtered by a fresh undergeared lvl  with better skills. If pvpers want danger amp intense fights thats the way it should go. now its just GRIND GRIND GRIND followed by killing lowbies once they get bored.I agree mostly.  Good sandboxes arent all about grinding and gearing.  BDO is only really halfway there and the design choices it borrows from themepark MMOs largely hurt the experience and may reduce its longevity... of course thats just my opinion and speculation well see how its doing another year from now!,blackdesertonline,d20x60m,4,t5_2w6ir

Combat is very quick to complete so you can farm for a few minutes or a few hours with relative ease and back out to safe territory just as quickly.With crafting trading managing workers etc you can do stuff in short bursts  in fact the game rewards you for taking timeouts!

7311902,0,t1_d28ttzp,Sadly this is quite the common practice. A few years ago I was looking into buying a coop pc game for myself and a friend on Steam. Steam wanted  per copy. So I ponied up the cash and we put a couple hours into the game. Next day I find out that Amazons digital download service offered the same game for  a copy regular price no special sale or anything. Keep in mind this was before Steam officially offered refunds but I put in a ticket to support asking if I could be refunded we barely put any time into the game and I could literally afford to buy a third copy of the game for another friend if I simply went with Amazon. Steam Support got back to me sternly said no not possible and they also didnt price match so either way I was gonna be screwed out of the higher price. So I said thats fine I would like to simply do a chargeback with Paypal. Steams response? They said I was within my rights to dispute the charges but if Paypal ruled in my favor Steam would close my entire account which Ive had since  worth a ton in game sales over the years. Wanting to keep my account..I had to just suck it up and eat the price. I could understand if they didnt want to do a refund but they could have at least price matched or given me a slight discount when a competitor offers the same thing but over fifty percent off... ,blackdesertonline,d29baq5,-3,t5_2w6ir

Then youd end up with EU players that claimed the NA players that took advantage of it expected it and prepared for it. Then youd have NA players that were even more mad they didnt get a heads and boohoo on the forums because a lack of response was misleading... damn your solutions are so flawless.Even if they were as butthurt as EU players are  that would be treating the entire playerbase fairly amp not differentiate them. The rest is just hypothetical situations that may or may have happened which I wont bother with since we wouldnt be able to ascertain how likely those events are.gt You started by bitching I explained the situation to you and now that you actually understand it youre desperately trying to spin your position into anything that you hope sticks. Unfortunately you dont have the foresight to think more than one step ahead and have yet to provide a viable solution... and quite frankly most of your solutions are absolutely fucking absurd. Sorry for throwing additional language in there to emphasize just how ridiculous your solutions are. From this point on you can stop making ridiculous solutions or refer to  to cope.This was my original comment...I was not bitching at all I was merely stating facts. Just because youre so secluded amp closeminded not having seen the world outside of your little cube doesnt meat everyone is exactly like you  my point originally was that there are people who missed out amp it should not have been rectified by providing a solution that was completely the opposite of what EU players faced.This is what you then repliedgtThere are people playing NA that didnt know about the buff until it had started. Wtf do you want? Should Daum log your character in and play it for you because you cant be bothered to listen?You were so blinded by your bias you didnt realise the difference  EU players werent notified prior to the weekend while NA were because it was a bug but you think the fix to that would be to toss the failed pancake EU amp get it right the nd time with NA? Is the whole EU region just a failed pancake exercise for Daum? Either both pancakes should be thrown away or rolled back.gt Keep suggesting idiotic ideas and Im going to keep calling them fucking idiotic. You can refer to the first response about how stupid this idea is.Keep running to that little profanity comfort bag of yours when you cant back up your argument without using additional language youre as plain as day every time you do.gtI had to hold your hand and explain the situation to you. You didnt even provide one of these completely thoughtless solutions until I challenged you... and you still havent provided a viable one. The only suggestions you can muster clearly have EU gaining more but thats perfectly acceptable to you while feebly trying to insult my ability to develop amp evolve. Again Im not so sure you understand the words youre typing.Of course I didnt offer solutions I didnt set out to be Bob the builder for Daum I started off by merely stating the facts of what EU players actually thought amp to make aware to your isolated self that there are people other than hardcore gamers who play this game that competitively.gtYoure a sensitive boy aint ya Tommy?When you have nothing to say about your use of profanity to ignite your fake argument its evident that its true even more so haha.,blackdesertonline,d29nozb,0,t5_2w6ir

Not a single soiled ogre ring not ogre ring... soiled ogre ringMy Yuria weapon flew past its  stone force probability to  weapon stones.. so based on your odds I hit .  times in a row.My Liverto weapon flew its its  stone force probability to  weapon stones.My Grunil Shoes really hit home how unlucky I am in this game.  After getting up to  failstacks on the Shoes I used the  failstacks to TRI a Bares Necklace.   The necklace blew up.  Afterwards I forceenhanced the Shoes because clearly RNG hates me.Back to the Grunil Shoes.  RNG is the primary driving force to go from Green gt Blue gt Ultimate via reform stones.  My Grunil Shoes took  reform stones where my armor helm and gloves took  stones to succeed.Sorry for the rant.

If I had the same amount of CP energy as well as the same needswants as you do but Im farming sunflowers and youre running an empire I dont think I would need to wait for someone either. Pretty much everything is available on the market now and are becoming cheaper and cheaper over time. Granted there are items that run out of stock such as platinum but I have enough spare CP to invest in the nodes.  What Im trying to say is that all the nonrare nodes are not worth investing in from a profit perspective as they could be better put to use in fences. As per the energy comment I am referring to processing the things for sale not for the things you and I need as everyone needs to use energy for things that dont appear on the MP. ,blackdesertonline,d2hohdt,1,t5_2w6ir

Ill be honest while Im having a blast I can see why this game wouldnt appeal to a massive audience as immersion takes precedence over convenience every. single. time. As was outlined above there are no taxis or fast travel warps storage places are not quantum entangled and mounts are not summoned from the aether when needed and returned when not. But what these design choices do is facilitate a world where noncombat features can have a lot of weight. And believe me there are a lot of non combat features each of them with as much depth as the combat. Off the top of my headHorse tamingbreedingraising.Gardening.Trading as in transporting goods between two places a la caravanCookingAlchemyand all the crafting disciplines youd expect from a fantasy mmo which are played out more akin to work force managementShip buildingHouse buildingdecoratingConversation you have to play a conversational minigame with NPCs to actually get them to open up and offer things to you. This minigame is based on the knowledge that your character has obtained.These are just things Ive seen in the first few hours to say nothing of guild property management or the node system in general. The game does not go to great lengths to explain how everything works either there is some explanation and the game will frequently open up the wiki in a browser right in game which can be a turn off for some and a boon to others. I personally like experimenting and figuring out how the systems work and after a decade of MMOs serving  their best secrets and rewards to you on a silver platter it feels good to have to do some legwork again.,blackdesertonline,d2q0vj7,5,t5_2w6ir

7469556,0,t3_4hhfuk,gt World bosses They are very glitchy. I know that Wiggles reported this as early as  or  weeks after release. Its truly sad that it havent been fixed already. They fade in and out of combat and when they reappear theyre somewhere else and their abilities are very glitchy. Examples when red nose jumps sometimes he does damage to those around where he jumped from and not where he lands also his pulsating ability can kill people not even close to it.Its not a glitch. I notice Field bosses only teleports if people block his path on the person that has agro since body blocking exists in this game you can body block enemies or path them onto rocks that they cant get down from. The only one I know that will intentionally TP is Dim Tree Spirit he has an animation cloud showing his teleportation could be based on mutant tree spirits and like them only have a short leash range it literally  steps. So DONT STAND IN FRONT OF FIELD BOSSES WHEN HE CHASES SOMEONE WHO HAS AGRO. It will get you killed either by person agro or the boss TPing to the person that has agro and you die cause of it.I will say Time stamps will be excellent to have would be nice to know what time Kzarka message goes up or when people shout in channel chat about Field bosses going up.,blackdesertonline,d2r8rau,1,t5_2w6ir

7478983,0,t3_4hu51i,The calculator ignores color values which is probably an OK thing to do since we are supposed to have ALL the T breeds meaning that breeding two T horses should give you a chance at any T.  Heres the issue though. In our current version we only have  T horses available. They are what are known as purebreeds because they have a color value of   and .  The theory currently shows that when you breed two horses the game takes into consideration the parents color values then generates a list of possible outcomes then RNGs it from there.  Lets say you breed two horses with color values of  and . Add those together. You get  meaning that your possible foal will have a color value of  or less so you could also end up with a  but not a  because XX gt XX  Since we only have the purebreed  value horses if your colors dont add up to  then your chance at the T goes away.  However it has been datamined from client data that there are indeed other T breeds but we just dont have them in the game yet. Its possible they will be available with the next major update but people will need to test it to find out or datamine the client if Im correct in assuming it contains that data  So once that happens we will have for example Ts with  making it much easier for you to breed one.  gt  my female has  death not sure how much it will impact the breeding overall  It has very little effect.

BUT all those steps make me weaker and since the top DPS get the loot I miss out on a chance of that.For example as a warrior when I switch out my Liverto with  AP gems or my offhand with  AP  I lose Dmg my ultimate armor with DPhealth  I die more often ergo less time to do Dmg I switch to an alt which I have to level up equip and still dont stay competitive. .. thats a bad trade off. Not to mention the immense hours between  and  where  xp loss equals an hour of time loss.Now besides that I like world bosses and for example Kzarka and Dim tree is just fine because I can dodge and block all Dmg and its my own fault when I die. On the other hand  red nose and bheg are just awful.  Lags blocking random one shots   of the time you die without being able to do sth. Thats bad mechanic and till now you could stay away from it  but with Bheg gloves you need him to stay competitive. Thats bad.And if you never played a melee class at world bosses  please dont say its all fine. The problems are real. Even though I dont want them removed or their penalties just make them a bit more doable. Getting  shot with  DP and .k health meaning no AP accessories makes no sense to me.,blackdesertonline,d2uytto,2,t5_2w6ir

These will give you two tokens for each time you complete them and these tokens may be turned in for accessories which you can eventually trade up for  AP accessories considering you dont get any while doing the hourlys. Also to get your weapons and armor to  do your daily scrolls and weekly scroll with a group of  as everytime a boss is defeated everyone gets loots but more importantly Hunter Seals regardless of whose scroll it was. This will give you a lot of black stone weapon and armor from doing so. Also you can trade in the hunter seals to get more. Also once you have gotten  weapons and armor look for the corresponding forge to upgrade the weapon to a blue level item at minimum for a stat bonus increase. Which is done so by using a Grade  Weapon or Armor Reform Stone to guarantee the upgrade.

In LoL well  last time i played at least  a few years back you need Lvl  a substantial amounts of games for a standard runepage. And runepages make a few hundred gold of difference in a game. And you probably still need more time to get a few key techniques right LH Zoning Master a Champ before entering this beautiful place called hell. Other than that Yes  due to the constant matchmaking to your level of play it is more accessible or more precise feels a bit fairer. Though there could be something like a APDP scaled Battlefield. Or brackets of gear. Or matchmaking of any sort. Or your MMRKarma scaling your APDP vs enemies. Sidenote GW has an accessible PvP mode.

7622309,0,t1_d37w1e2,Good PvE is a fun way to fight the NPC environment. Could be bosses could be trash mobs which drop stuff in a satisfying fashion. I played so many games that have a good PvE system. WoW I only played until BC was one of them. Playing dungeons with friends that required some level of communication and were somewhat challenging was definitely a fun experience.Not fun in BDO is world bosses. Im doing well on the loot so I am not complaining out of frustration. Yesterday I did Bheg and I died around  times my PC is not the best thus laggy. I felt like I am contributing nothing. Just take part in the mindless resurrect  walk to the boss  get off some hits until you die   chore over and over again.  In the end I got a liverto. And I wasnt sure if I should be happy or not... the process was awful and  fun. Dying  times and being in the upper loot bracket liverto shows that many people are having a even worse time than I did.Not fun is grinding I spent many many hours at Sausan and I cannot stand the grind unless I am watching a movie or show to keep my mind sane during the grind. In Ultima Online I grinded mobs and was entertained like  of the time. It felt good. The combat how your actions determine the outcome. Sausan Pirates and such is exactly the opposite. You feel like your head is exploding after some time because as long as I land my heavy hitters in the center of the mobs nothing matters. I hate the grind but I want the result thats why I am doing it right now. Not sure though how much longer I can do it.Crafting fishing taming building ships exploring is just fine. Its a decent system and doesnt need big changes from my perspective. I dont really count this to PvE.,blackdesertonline,d38m75q,1,t5_2w6ir

This is often offset by the fact you end up with  turnin drops.A place like Helms might earn you a smaller average per mail but then give you the opportunity to earn more because of rare drops like Scarla. Doing the Abandoned Iron Mine tends to earn me more per mail since the elites drop rare gems books etc but earns less than Sausans due to turn ins not to mention lower experience.

7689041,0,t1_d3g6etb,Its funny how in every game a good chunk of ranged players tend to be horrible. Ive mained hunter on WoW for years and the huntard joke never ends. Its too bad that it rings true in a lot of ways considering that the class can sometimes be more forgiving than most and sometimes prevents people from actually improving due to how easy it can be to face roll through content when youre ranged.Im hoping that they improve in future patches and actually take a more vigorous stance on approaching community concerns. I know it is a lot to ask from a company that hasnt had the most stellar record so far but Im hoping they at least do enough to maintain a strong enough player base to keep the world from feeling dead. Im sure Im going to find things that drive me batshit that seem broken as I progress further through the game... But Im hoping to stay optimistic about it and just try and seek enjoyment out of whats already available. ,blackdesertonline,d3g713x,2,t5_2w6ir
7689151,0,t1_d3g71ei,gt Dp does not equal damage reduction.DP does function as damage reduction this was demonstrably tested by members of the community like Hihey in his accuracy tests etc. Directly from the accuracy docgt DP defense pointspower affect your damage taken the higher your DP the lower the damage you are going to suffer after receiving a hit. You gain DP by enchanting your Armor and by using other specific itemsbuffs. It does not affect your dodge rate but it does contribute to your EHP.The enhancement effects on Vangertz are accuracy DP and evasion as evidenced by the fact that Vangertz begins at  DP and ends with  DP  more than Axion. The  DP and  damage reduction on the Axion dont even come close to matching  DP in EHP. At best the Axion is decent for grinding mobs lower level than you and is terrible in PvP.,blackdesertonline,d3g7h85,1,t5_2w6ir

I do think its unnecessary generally to say things like there is no new content drop so no need to expect anything every single time a maintenance is announced. These maintenances are pretty regular. But I wouldnt say for Daum in this because they did make exceptions and created ambiguity so people are not unreasonable to expect content drop or at least rumour about new content when it is just about regular maintenance.Going back to your point its very true but I fully understand this. Its tired to repeatedly see people saying why Im quitting blah blah blah. Its the emotion that triggers the responses like leave it we dont care. I do care at least. The game is like a baby who is growing. The game needs time to adapt to the western player base. Anyone loved it might want to give it some time.

7779455,1,t3_4lv2tz,My experience as an  zerker You will lose nearly all duels agains equally geared players when your enemys know what they are doing.You will be helpfull in group pvp with debuffs and chain graps if and thats a big if server desync and enemy grap resists dont screw you over. Group with good people its frustrating if you cc a witchranger but instead of killing him your teammates blow their load against an warrior shield.pve sucks big time especially from lvl  till you get your heal on hit awaken on spin to win. From then you wont die but it will still take forever to kill enemys. You can group to improve xp but be prepared to be skill point starved  just forget to use more than  to  different skills graps dodge frenzy destroyer spin to win unless you want to farm for days with your slow ass kill speedmy advice dont do it. zerker is one of if not THE most gimped classes right now,blackdesertonline,d3qgk68,0,t5_2w6ir

7820239,0,t1_d3ur78e,By participating in a game you are implicitly if not explicitly saying you will follow the rules and gameplay conduct of that game. Bdo part of that is pvp so yes you are implicitly agreeing to PvP. But at the same time your also agreeing to everything else from the guild wars going on around you the grinding the politics. This is how not only video games but everything from sports to real life functions. You agree through participation yo follow the agreed on rules. This is where the term greifing comes from it is when you reject either the inherit or implicit social game rules that have but agreed on but the majority or the creator of the thing your participating in. PvP in all forms is inheritly part of the game so you do agree to it in some capacity just by playing. So the idea of consensualnon consensual PvP is an entirely moot point. You can freely disagree with anothers choice to pk you just as they can disagree with someone pking them and visa versa. You dont have to agree with someone pking you than camping you for days on end repeatedly murdering you with the intent to make you miserable. This would cross the social agreement we as a community has or at least the majority of us. Same as real life conflicts dont have to be consensual and we have rules in place to ensure that the offending party is punished but we at the same time also have equal fines to the instigator. In the end the entire nonsense of throwing around the buzz word consensual PvP is silly. The game is as it is designed if you disagree with a core feature than you are saddly the odd man out. You should agurge for a change in the system to allow for balance of punishment and reward not for whole sale removeal or gimping of only one side.

The great benefit of x Hercules set is  LT which allows you to process more at the time processing cannot occur if you are over  weight capacity. It is important to mention that usually cooking action needs at least  empty inventory slots to occur  for byproducts  for crafted items and  extra spare for continuous production.For all those who are impatient and want to speed up the production as much as possible for a premium silver value I would suggest looking into Tool Workshop level  and making Advanced Cooking Utensil as they have  total durability and dont cause you to replace your utensil very often cheapest have only  durability.,blackdesertonline,d3zmujr,6,t5_2w6ir

7872856,0,t1_d40xc9l,Ugh.. Sorry for ever even saying anything. Youre going to be the sort that dodges the point just to trash on something.  If this is supposed to be a controlled market its already failed spectacularly.No it hasnt. Supply has nothing to do with it. Its supposed to help keep a system where prices dont get horrendously inflated for the average player which it has. If theres an oversupply of silver then solve it by nerfing the silvergrind methods out there.Again missing the point. Its not the methods its the nature of an MMO that lets you do whatever you want to do for however long you want to do it. The issue isnt regulating prices because the amount of silver you can make in  hours is a problem. Its regulating the price because the average player cant spend  hours a day grinding for an accessory or be around for every world boss for a Liverto etc etc. The Marketplace is very much a catchup system for middletolow tier players. Its about not having items be massively out of reach for the people who cant farm it because of a population that can put  hours in a day. The marketplace is a MASSIVE convenience of not having a find someone who has what you want and b actually meet ingame.Yeah sure it is but I never commented about convenience. I commented about people buying low and selling high inflating prices to something only a small portion of the community can and will pay. If you dont think this happens I question how many free market MMOs youve played and I dont really think I need to get into the philosophical discussion about how big of a deal that is when you can legitimately buy every piece of gear you need in the game from the Marketplace. Theres a reason Free Market games either use a Soulbound system on many pieces of gear or have very punishing forms of gear  item destruction. The two systems do not coexist well together.  It wont go away just because you can suddenly trade people overestimate the willingness of  of the players to actually go through all that trouble.You underestimate the willingness of players to do nothing but play the marketplace for already scarce items. Plenty of people will happily sit and attempt to buy any Livertos Boss Armors any rare accessories etc etc and flip them for a huge profit. If anything the things that wouldnt be affected would be the things of massive supply.  If theres an oversupply of silver then solve it by nerfing the silvergrind methods out there.To also revisit this section the Marketplace is also the primary silver sink existing in the game and there would need to be much much more changed in that regard. since if a single player in the current system can make that much what is stopping others from doing the same?And to top it all off because its basically what Ive been saying in all these responses Time. This isnt the sort of game that you go raid once a week and get a chance at a piece of loot. When absolutely everything meaningful is not bound you risk a very very volatile situation without systems in place. In this case its the controlled pricing on supplydemand of items by forcing it through that system in the Marketplace.. If youre not okay with that thats fine but youre being very narrow minded and naive if you think it wont affect the game at large and there are many systems that need to be addressed with it if trading were to be opened up including but not limited to  Silver Sink as the most meaningful sink is on expensive items Lack of a Soulbound system Effect on crafters as the energy system puts a lock on their income which is already subpar to grinding. Does the demand for crafted items justify it or will people turn to only crafting their crafted goods outside of the lazy with excessive funds?  Difference in silver income between the very active and the average player.  Possibility of gold selling through trading items to either be resold or for rare items to be sold on a Black Market of real money Common place in games that allow gear trading.  Increase in reason for accounts to be hacked so their fundsgoods can be shipped off. Im not saying the current system is perfect but its there for a purpose. There are several tweaks I would love to see but Im not getting into that discussion here. I just very very much hope youre not going to give another emotionfilled post because your first paragraph made it very hard to even take you seriously. ,blackdesertonline,d40zcas,9,t5_2w6ir

I agree with you. You really dont need that many to get your gear upgraded and you will never have  success rate. Its also so expensive... really nope not worth it.Yep I get so tired of seeing people say that shit.  At the same time if there was a  chance then folks would just urge getting to that.

7962088,0,t1_d4aro5q,gt Does that combo work? It is hard to tell based on the wording of the patch notes and I havent seen how KR works. Is the grab not considered a CC following a Bound?Yea the wording is tricky the thing is they said Other crowd control skills wont work after grab or bound im too lazy to get the quote. So im thinking you can still grab after a bound. I really doubt they would break that because grab is the exception to every CC change. Like how they prevented CC chaining in patch long time ago grab was the exception to it. So yea well have to see but there is a high chance this would still work.gt Shield charge cancels for Counter followed by damage Ground Smash damage Grab SoD.The problem with that is there isnt enough time for counter off of a shield charge because you need to do full charge counter if you want it to be accurate. Shield charge shouldnt last long enough for you to complete counter. Theory wise what you said should technically work but the beginning of the combo is what probably wont work unless you tried that already and it does work. I didnt test that yet i just know that stiffness effect is very short.So yea we will just have to figure out something new were not cornered at point where we can only grab into scars of dusk.

8054637,0,t1_d4l56le,So Zerkers in general comes down to what kind of style you want to play. Theres  GvG fighting styles that both work extremely well. The first one i did was full DP.  I did Taritas BootsArmor Higher DP  Extra SP and Grunil HelmGloves For the AP Bonus along with  Shrine Guardian Tokens  Ridell Earrings Rhutum Elite Belt and Talis Necklace. I was sitting around  AP DP I think. Your role in GvG was to jump in the enemy backline and throw as much CC as possible Fearsome Tyrant Stomp Predatory Hunt etc. anything to disrupt the enemies DPS. Its a super effective build and I had a lot of fun with it. You can survive for a while and be extremely useful to your team.What Im doing now is Full Grunil Mark Of Shadows Witch Earrings Bares Belt and Bares Necklace with a Liverto Weapon. This puts me at  AP DP. This is a more Bruisertype build. Lots of health to replace DP and good damage. Your role here in GvG changes. You want to go on the outskirts of the fights and look for the small skirmishes. You can stomp around spin Fierce Strike etc. This is a lot more fun for me. You definitely notice a damage difference and its hard for anyone to deal with you honestly. You take the fights you know you can win and it feels great to be John Cena. I like this style a lot because I like to be able to v people and feel like Im doing damage. Overall I really like both styles and both do extremely well in GvG. Zerkers are a very diverse class and are extremely strong at the moment. The other reason I like the AP set more is because once awakening weapons come out we turn into THEE main DPS with our Hand Cannons. So might as well get the AP set now and destroy later. I do not believe one style is better than the other it all just comes down to preference.,blackdesertonline,d4lf15w,3,t5_2w6ir

8144552,0,t1_d4vieuw,Most of the stuff you are reading is probably from launch when berserkers were very underpowered.  They have gotten steady buffs to being pretty undeniably the strongest class in the game this patch.  That being said the berserker and witch play very differently.Obviously theres the melee vs ranged aspect of the classes but BDO is a very roledriven PvP game.  Berserkers role preawakening is generally to disrupt and assuming youre starting this late that will be your primary role as well.  You have lots of HP and the ability to cc groups of people with your ult for a long time and also grab someone and hold them for your teammates to kill them.Its a very wellrounded class right now in terms of PvEPvP and it gets one of the strongest awakenings afaik.

8206030,0,t3_4rqn6o,This isnt really casual it kind of just doesnt make sense.  No one with  gear is going to be using Bares accessories other than maybe a tri neck.  All of the accesories WE MoS Gladiator Belt are SUPER easy to come by.  Hell ogre ring isnt even that big of a deal.Realistically for a casual endgame youd be looking at something more like this I used Ogre Ring as a placeholder youd actually want PRI Manos Ruby Necklace.  Even at this point youre still talking midgame.  When adressing an endgame you shouldnt be referring to something you can have tomorrow.  Realistically Id expect casuals who stick with the game for a year reasonable if they like the game to have a  weapon.Use Red Battlefield Crystals  Making them red is the easier part winning them off the market is what is hard.  Hell I made enough to do my first one off just doing to daily energy reset.This build is assuming you forego attack speed.Edit  Also I have this gear setup and Im still not sure going for Heve was worth it.  Its  HP if I never get a boss piece but only  if I do.  On the topic of boss gear what part of boss gear requires hardcore play to obtain?  It requires luck.  People do their daily scrolls.  In the case of end game youd have probably been playing the game long enough to have two pieces of boss gear or more.  There is no reason to put a limit on this.  There is also no reason to limit jewelry enchanting or crystals because that makes for illogical progression and I dont know of many casuals that wouldnt just go for the easiest upgrade first.  On top of all of this the one gear piece I really see casuals leaving out is their alchemy stone.,blackdesertonline,d53b41z,5,t5_2w6ir

8357841,0,t1_d5m96z9,Mmmh.. While I wouldnt call them bad for PvE I would certainly struggle putting them over a lot of classes. Knock ups and knock downs are nice and all but as a Maehwa main you can basically throw those bonuses out the window for most of Mediah and Valencia. Stuns are the only thing that have consistent usefulness. Its pretty much only trash mobs that get hit by them in most areas Again most not all. In Sausens it isnt bad but everything in Sausens dies extremely quickly anyway other than the Giants who cant be knocked up IIRC.Overall theyre slower than Maehwa and Tamer with more teleports survivability Ill give them definitely but without a good heal I do think this part relies on an asterik and the stealth is nice but more for PvE. You can still see a stealthed Kuno in PvP. Damage wise theyre fine if not good for PvE. It just kinda falls apart in PvP from what Ive seen. For PvE I would still put WitchWiz Musa Tamer Berserker and Ranger well above Kuno right now and just from some testing with friends  AP vs  DP and there were only a few combos that even did average damage even considering we had trouble with a lot of them.Now this is all being said from the perspective of someone who has no attachment to the class. A lot of guildies of mine do and I ran a leveling party on release to . I have no intentions of changing mains but due to a lot of guildies who do I try to do my share of research to help them. If Im not wrong from info Ive been trying to dig up. I probably will push my Kuno or Tamer to  to have a second character with an awakening weapon but I havent really decided yet.So yeah if anything theyre either good where they are or could use a buff in my opinion.

Heres another situation one that more directly challenges the baseline assumption of the post Lets say I farm Hasrah for money because I enjoy it and I have the node at level  and the mobs at S rank. The only drops here are ancient weapon cores black stones and forbidden books. Since Im not welloff and still upgrading my gear I keep the stones for failstacks and the books for more stones and memory fragments. Lets say I average  of the trash drops worth s each per hour. Maybe I get one weapon core worth capped max of m every  hours on average which I sell. Which item is more valuable for me Value Pack or Valks Cry? This isnt an out of the ordinary thing but his post makes the assumption that youll make  of your income from drops sold on the market whereas the situation above the market income is a tiny fraction of the total income and the Valks Cry would be the CLEAR winner.

8389782,0,t3_4ujkjy,Maybe youre not geared enough? Your damage is heavily gear dependant.  If they buff for the low end of players the top end becomes buffed too.With  ap using accuracy offhand maehwa definitely deals plenty of damage.  Even geared players dont take much more than  different combos to kill most fights end before I can use ascension to heaven a nd time.  And at  dp i can survive near indefinitely except against some crazy good gear players or Zerker grabs in group etc.The hit boxes you mention can get screwed by desync but its not so bad that you cant kill anyone. Against a shield learn to play you can wear then down or catch then between it.  It also is just meant to hard counter classes like maehwa which means you will not always win.Maehwa does not need any buffs or it will turn into sorc and get nothing but nerf bats to the face while they attempt to balance it.  Not all classes can do everything as they shouldnt be able to.  It works perfectly fine rushing bases getting disrupts off on repairers scouting dashing around distracting backline defenders killing rangerswizards that break away from the main group.

Say after you play for hour and counted your coins just ask yourself Am I satisfied? Did I have fun?. Not everytime it will be a yes to both. I may not have much fun but if the silver I earn or if the result of the time spent are moving me closer to one of my endgame goals then I could be very satisfied.For example theres no really much fun in afktraining horse but it is quite satisfying to see it producing T and T towards my ultimate goal of having at least  T in my stable in preparation for future content I really want that pegasus... Theres not much fun in building my workertrading empire either but seeing those silver rolling in and how I could afford all my boss gears plus costumes I am playing on BDO JP is very satisfying not to mention those photo sessions with new costumes. If you look at my post history you would see many screenshots I took though I havent update the album in a few months.I love exploring and traverse the immense world searching for wild T T horses they exists on BDO JP not sure about NAEU to tame is both fun and satisfying because eventhough the spawn locations are fixed the weather and daylight are not. You should try it out horse breeding for sale can be quite lucrative. It probably helps that I build my own wagon to afktrain my horses.Alchemy can be a chore unless you buy everything from AH which is not always possible many sells like hotcake but the reward could be huge.. It also encourage exploration and brings you to some more reclusive parts of the world where the views may pleasantly surprising. Some of the top tier gatherables are actually quite wellhidden at places where ppl just wont thought of going its like treasurehunting.I finished the awakening quests but havent finish the entire mediah and valencia quests so those are my goals whenever I have extended hours of gaming time on weekends.I dont know....too many goals too much fun to be had.

Game not being what they thought it would be? Maybe. gt The reality is the officers stopped playing and selfishly wanted to keep power for themselves. There were plenty of members who asked for more officers to be implemented questioned how the guild was ran and why the leaders werent playing. Long story short we were fed continuous bullshit about them not quitting.gt Anyone in the guild who was active knew it was coming and a there were plenty of people attempting to soften the blow by trying to get them to at least let us get accustomed to new leaders. Come the day of an emergency guild meeting that Xlore himself didnt even know about they drop that they were quitting. But heres the kickerthey wanted each and every member to blow them for two hours while they attempted to stroke themselves off about how much they put into the guild. Ask about how the guild moves forward? Sylta would scream at you for not being grateful to them. They were quitting and attempting to move to a new game with several members but still wanted a say in how the guild was run and who was going to lead it. gt Did all the propaganda have a part to play? Absolutely. Spin it however you want but it wasnt the sole reason for the fall of Gatekeeper. Leadership was extremely controlling and manipulative from the start. The toxicity they spewed about their own guild members and friends behind their backs lead to more than one bridge being burned. Its pretty ironic that some of those very same people followed them out of the guild and are playing other games with them now.The real core of the guild stayed in the game and are still playing for the time being.,blackdesertonline,d64xrol,3,t5_2w6ir

8581627,0,t1_d6e9dvl,Its a neverendingargue. Theres no clear boundries of how someone perceive PW as. Everyone will see it differently.WoW is a game where everything is capped  its a ThemePark  you can get max level max item level and so on. In  month time you can get maxed pretty much and just do the End Game. Also you cant buy any gear being close to the toptier. It helps you start but you cant get maxed and eventualy in a short time everyone is on same tier anyway.BDO on the other hand is a Sandbox with no limits. You can also buy anything in the game with silver. If you have enough money you can just buy the top tier gear considering if someone sells it or have increased number of chances to upgrade it. And since theres no caps you cant simply catch up to a person within a month or so.In other words compaing game like BDO to WoW is like compaing a car to a motorbike. It lets you transport yourself indeed but the way they do it is completely different thing.I wish people would start using facts instead of just shooting empty statements.P.S.

They have done two events that gave free pets as a reward but no way of knowing if this would happen again.The big differences I see that are important are  extra Value Package  Horse Flute  Pet The other stuff is nice but not really a huge deal.  But those  items are really nice the Pet being the biggest one.  The Horse Flute binds to one character so make sure you are sure of which character you want to main before using it.   I have my flute on my witch but main a Kunoichi which didnt come out for months after launch I thought id miss the whistle but so far I havent.

Start gathering fishing making crates until you can get that repaired...

In other words adding cash shop items does not interfere with solving bugs. Now you might wonder why they dont solve bugs faster. Thats simply because tracking down and fixing a bug has a varying degree of complexity. The amount of bugs that like bdo has is close to endless. They could hire more coders but at the end of the day its still a company that needs to make a profit. Of course you may think that the state of the cashshop or the game is not acceptable but youre simply blaming the wrong issue here. ,blackdesertonline,d7jaor7,1,t5_2w6ir

This is largely because I continue to have a gear score greater than many other players in node wars we do not participate in region wars yet. I will try the sorc awakening sometime but I feel that I will stick with tamer. It has very much suited my playstyle more and has been more adaptable for my PVElevelreflexes.

Your stats arent great but I can regularly pull my weight with  points at  with accuracy trinket. Tamer has some of the best spammable AoE CC in the game and good single target lockdown as well as well as a grab which is a requirement at this point against warriors.. Provide safe zones for your damage dealers and dont dive recklessly. Peel warriors and sorcs off from diving your rangers and wizards.

9030799,0,t3_53yp3h,gtbtw for example cooking beer yields same exp as cooking anything else?No.  Experience amount is based on the skill requirement tier of the food.  From what I can tell all Beginner recipes are worth  exp Apprentice  Skilled  etc.   I havent done much testing above skilled though but the standard meals like Balenos Meals seem to be  exp.As for what to cook...  look at your servers market.  See what is available and what is not.  Check the most recent sale time on items.   Track a few items each day to see how many are selling on average each day vs how many are usually listed at a time.   Just because something like Serendia Meals has  up at a time doesnt mean they arent a big seller they might be selling  a day.   So  is less than a days turnover.  But if there are  up and it only sells  a day... thats probably not a good item.What you have for materials also makes a difference as well as how fast you can obtain those materials back if you use them up.   Sure you could make good money selling Milk Tea but if you burn through your milk so fast that you then have  days to resupply that milk it may not be as good as making something else that you can sell at a more steady pace.I realize Im being a bit vague on what to actually cook but thats for two reasons...  I dont feel like having my market destroyed which happens anytime someone says do this to make lots of money and  if you learn to do what I said above... youll be able to adapt much easier when things change.  Which they do.  What I make now is different than what I made  weeks ago which is different than  months before that etc.,blackdesertonline,d7xcy08,3,t5_2w6ir

9045547,0,t1_d7z0zif,Its a huge change.You can send the worker out for  times now.  The worker will keep working as long as you refill his stamina before he runs out. Where the huge benefit is at is that you can refill them while they are working instead of needing to wait for them to stop working.  For someone like me with over  workers trying to have them all complete at a certain time in the morning before work so that I can feed them and send them out again is a major hassle.  With this I can simply feed the ones already working.It gets even more time savings when you consider I have a lot of workers that arent regularly working but are used when I have one out for training or I need to do some crafting with one.  These are my subs workers.   For example I have a goblin with  to Life Clothes and  to Weapons.  I dont always make life clothes or weapons so hes normally out gathering wheat.  But if I need to make either then I send a different worker to the wheat fields.  So I cant always just hit Repeat All because then the wrong guy will go out to that field.This new change also makes it so that you dont constantly have workers ending their tasks while you are out trying to grind.  I get home from work and feed the ones that stopped but there are many that havent stopped yet.  So they stop all through out the evening.  With this change I can refill all of them at once meaning I wont have them constantly stopping.,blackdesertonline,d7z4p0p,1,t5_2w6ir

9147374,0,t3_55kzhe,PVP is pretty hardcore in this game alot of combos and every class for the most part is balanced.  The big issue is risk verse reward.  You dont get much for killing people in open world other than just kicking them outta your spot for a little bit.  Most PVP rewards come from things like Node Warsguild siege pvp and Red Battlefield arena style pvp.  Another HUGE issue with the game is gearing.  If youre amazing on your class it wont matter if you dont have the gear to back it up.  Gear is prioritized highly in this game.  So people with great apdp are going to beat you out no matter your skill level.Pay to win is kinda irrelevant in this game.  Its in it but I dont find it very useful unless you have alot of money..  Their is a cap to how much you can spend a week and the total amount you can get in a week is pretty minuscule  considering the amount of gold you get for a maximum of around    a week..  In retrospect  equals about m.  Which isnt much at all.The game is very sandbox a lot to explore which if you have friends to play with its EXTREMELY enjoyable to sail around an island to island and discover all the little caves and areas to discover.   The amount of depth detail and size of the map is overwhelming at times.   So if you like exploration its definitely a good thing for you.Grinding is SO IMPORTANT.  Its one of the main income sources and the difference between levels is pretty huge.  Its  a HEAVYDRAWNOUT grind as well.  Youll spend upwards to a week to a month getting  level when you hit  and thats considering the VERY generous EXP  buffs Kakao gives us.  So make sure you like grinding and pick an enjoyable class to do it on.Their are a lot of pros to the game but a lot of cons as well.  I think the game is still young and has a lot of potential to grow into a very good MMO.    Godspeed.,blackdesertonline,d8bhv4c,11,t5_2w6ir

Awakened classes are damn nasty and if you cant pull off those combos whenever you get an opening youre likely dead in  combo or close to it.If youre short on skill points then gutting black wave line and dark flame line are a good way to scavenge some.

9240300,0,t3_56xv2a,Ineffective? It never was. Investment nodes are the most extreme example of the silver per hour vs. active time invested dichotomy that exists in the balance of this game. You make a one time investment of time to save the money necessary for the node and then the amount of silver you get back for that time investment grows infinitely.For example the Florin and NWP nodes took me about  minutes to setup with workers and ingots  but now four months later they have accumulated roughly m silver which is a whopping m per hour vs. my active time invested. Can you make more with other nodes? Absolutely. Can you make more at other nodes with less time invested managing their resultant product? Nope.Bank nodes are all about getting something in return for the minimum possible amount of effort and maintenance and for that purpose they are hands down the best activity to pursue in the game.

In fact once you get past the tutorial life skill quests in Heidel you can pretty much ignore all life skill quests permanently.  They have a green outline and can be turned off on the quest tracker.  You want to do as many quests as possible as you advance because almost no one wants to come back and do them when the mobs are grey and weak and boring.  Many of the side quests also give combat skill points and these dont count against the soft cap for skill points so you do want those.

An exception is the Al Halam Sea in Valencia waters which works differently for some reason never explain and only recently understood.The word hotspot really apart from the last remaining example from old fishing days at Velia beach and the Al Halam Sea in newer Valencia waters which works opposite to other areas and actually does have some hotspots is redundant.

9315322,0,t1_d8wptvn,Thats the thing you can muse about the idea of infinite supply of milk as much as you want there will never be an infinite supply of milk just because you say so. The totality of energy in the world is finite hence the totality of the mass of the world.Bound by what? When you write a program and define x as a variable you must declare its type in this case it is an integer it will be  or hexadecimal FFFFFFF is the maximum positive value for a bit signed binary integer in computing. Extend it to bit bit or whatever the future holds the moment you write it down in code it is finite. That is its bound. Sure in the future technology might increase it again in  years at the that moment the programmer updates the code but at that time it will still be finite. And since the totality of mass of the universe is finite it cannot contains an infinite object. So no matter how far you go into the future you can never have an infinite object whatever that means. You can muse about the idea of infinity but to say it exists without any evidence is absurd. And this is the place where differentiating between no level cap because the programmer will keep updating the codes to make sure you will never reach the finite limit that he placed vs infinite level cap because he already set it to infinite which is impossible. Hence it is correct to say there is no level cap but incorrect to say infinite level cap because the programmer could never program it so it that takes on forever expanding integer since at any moment in time the best he could do is set x to the maximum possible value that the computer let him.Sure you can play a thought experiment game where you have an infinite supply of milk which I may ask which infinity is it  do you know? but there isnt nor will ever be a video game with an infinite supply of milk.

The game is huge and overwhelming dont get scared.Theres a small thing that will give you daily rewards as a new player itll be a good accessory set  Jarettes  and about M silver. Head to Heidel as soon as possible and get the Warehouse there youll want to use Heidel as your headquarters for money and what not. Once you start getting that delicious free stuff buy yourself a Grunil set  Armor Shoes Helm Gloves   two weapons  doesnt need to be very expensive you can replace those .Youll want to enchant all armor to  and weapons to  which should last you to around level  maybe even  without difficulty. You enchant using Black Stones and up until  for armor and  for weapons theres no risk involved and you can always extract the stones if you want to focus on other armorweapons  though Grunil is best in slot until you get boss armor which is expensive and rare .If you want to earn money while AFKoffline make an alt send him to Heidel and fish at the river. I recommend investing in a good fishing rod. Balenos is for a few hours of AFK fishing and Epheria is for when youre gone for quite a bit.Fill your alt slots as soon as possible and also send them to Heidel. In this game there is a thing called Energy which allows you to fish better level up nodes  nodes are like a small zone in which you can grind and loot monsters. upgrading them increases drops.  or play the Night Vendor  the night vendor is a high risk high reward  energy a try guy that will give you random items for  of their price. If youre lucky you can net a million ring for m or a piece of armor that normally sells for hundreds of millions for as low as m.

Your main awakening form attacks dont generate stacks so if you are lazy and dont swap back and forth you have very limited ways to generate stack to regen mana grim reaper gives you full stacks but you wont gain mana that way since it cost as much as you get back and space after an attack can get you some stacks but is a much worse way to generate than swapping back to normal weapon for both damage and stacks.Some of the awakened attacks dont use mana either but enough do that you will eventually run out of mana.,blackdesertonline,d9bw41b,1,t5_2w6ir

9583052,0,t1_d9u9qos,Awesome reply thank you man. At the current rate of patch content that is not awakening related it feels really hard to draw any predictions on when they may introduce the Valencia update. I assume it will come with Nouver which is already overdue so likely either a surprise patch bonus before the end of the year all awakenings or very soon after WizardWitch awakening maybe?Also I am aware that they have already given us a chunk of the Valencia update namely the new rare items alongside if I recall small density changes to a few mob types but not all of them yet. I believe the KR update will increase density all around alongside most importantly making the junk silver drops go from their standard k to k.k but I have not looked it up yet. That being said good sir are you aware at all of the best spots in Valencia for KR since we eventually end up on that path? I would think Fogans since even right now they arent horrible if you REALLY need the xp and factor in the Seraps Necklace drop to the silver  hr still very much inferior to SausansPirates but I imagine all they need is that consistent silver buff and they would be awesome.,blackdesertonline,d9ub1sm,1,t5_2w6ir

9728351,0,t1_dac8dbt,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,blackdesertonline,dac8ddu,-1,t5_2w6ir

9820280,0,t3_5fwqg8,Hi I just wanted to share some of my experience as I played BDO since April.Firstly before buying BDO I was frustrated with genderlocked classes but then I found the class I really liked and Action Combat made my MMO RPG experience so much more delicious. This has been very well explained in this post gt ive been watching some really bad reviewsMyth BDO is a PW grindfestAfter spending more than half a year playing the game I would like to debunk this myth. It might seem like the game is a grindfest or it actually requires you to spend real dollars to progress anywhere but I wanted to point out that the game is actually very complex and having the knowledge is power.Yesterday they merged servers by simply combining  separate servers with  channels each into one megaserver with  channels and you can switch channels with a minute cooldown at will. It not a problem to find a comfortable location to play the game as you wish. Before server merge I wanted to create new characters on the second and third server that I never played on and attempt to reach level  to complete very valuable quest in city of Altinova.Reaching level  on my first character clean account in my first BDO adventure took me  month. I was paying extra attention to understand the crafting and I was actually browsing  DB Website more than actually playing the game. But after all this time spent I understood the mechanics and I was able to reach level  on clean second and third server in under  hours of gameplay each.Right now I know some methods like following this path this is the route I used to level my clean alts  to reach  quickly and if you have some friend killing monsters for you you can be level  in under  hours. This kunoichi player achieved level   in  days   hours of active gameplay. Something that took me  months...Right now there is an event that gives new players access to Olvia channels that have constant  bonus XP running. So I would say having a level  player could take only  hours max.In short This game is called a PW grindfest only by players who never took an effort to understand this game indepth.,blackdesertonline,danln9n,4,t5_2w6ir

The pearl shop outfits are often ridiculous but there are a couple good ones definitely wish we could reskin stuff. I think the monster models and designs are really great and with effects turned down the attack animations and animations in general are mostly very well done as well. The towns have great designs and are all quite different and memorable and npcs in general have a decent amount of thought put into them. I also really like the random slice of life objects scattered throughout the world especially details in the markets public squares and alleys of big cities like Valencia that have no reason to be there other than make the world feel believable and intricate.

MMAs animation is super short and its easily spammable.. MMA autofocuses in on the enemy and has a long range.The awakening has no such skill but you are still able to dish out good damage with pure awakening spells.Waterball could have been a better replacement of MMA if it wasnt so slow animationwise if it would hit more than up to x and if it would also always crit.Therefore you are better off replacing MMAspam with a rotation of awakening skills which I am yet to find the perfect one hence I am asking OP to put insight into this.,blackdesertonline,dbpzv47,1,t5_2w6ir

You can then buy base materials off the market process them to ingotsplywood then sell the processed goods. If you make the things needed for trade crates i.e. brass bronze ash maple birch pine fir cedar white cedar and acacia and list it for then minimum allowed so that its proffitable for traders to buy it they will sell pretty quick. Once you hit artisan you can make decent passive money like this.Alternatively you can get more CP and master  trading to do the trading yourself but this is far more active and in my opinion unless you are doing huge amounts of materials and investing literally billions of silver in to it like i and other high level traders are youre wasting your time and would be more efficient doing something else with your cp and time.

10214778,0,t3_5m7zif,Level  Tamer here. It is quite fun to play in PvE even more after awakening. With decent gear you can deal a good amount of damage and farm effectively. Very fun to play in PvE but meh in PvP.Also have a  Ranger and I dont enjoy playing it that much. Ive had a more classic Ranger in my mind when starting to play. For me it was a little disappointing that youre like an iceskating dagger stabber whos jumping around like stung by a bee. Cant tell anything more about it  I personally dont like the class.I also did like playing the Valkyrie up to . It is a little time consuming in the early levels until you get certain skills but then it is fun. PvE aspect after awakening  is fine. You do have a good grinding speed and are very burst heavy. PvP is hard since youre more of a counter class. You dont engage the fight you wait for the enemy to use his abilities and punish him for being immobile or missing his skills.Warrior is monotonous pre and after awakening. Hes much like the Valkyrie but in a more offensive way.  If you like fancy looking skills this isnt the class for you. PvE is fine with his great sword PvP very strong. Good class.WitchWizard became very strong with their awakenings. They arent the usual mages you might know from other games grinding with them is very fun. You got lots of AoE selfheal mana absorption. You have a very good sustain in every way. Even got better with awakening. Would recommend if you like playing ranged.Trying out a Musa right now. Deals good amount of damage has a good sustain. Very fun to play in PvE. Cant say anything more since I dont have awakening yet and didnt PvP for now.This is just my personal opinion about these things. Can only tell you what I experienced  just to give you a little insight from my perspective. Cant write more right now since Im on mobile now.

If you dont have a kzarka you cant have  cast speed without elixirs if you have those evasion gems. That alone makes it worth it to have Kzarka.In addition to that a Kzarka has a lot more accuracy that a liverto. Damage tests show equipping a kzarka adds about  more damage. With people stacking evasion like crazy you want as much easy accuracy as you can get.Wizards have crazy high accuracy bonus on all their abilities so with a Kzarka and bhegs gloves youre generally good on accuracy.If you go liverto you may need to grab a red coral earring which is going to cost you AP. Overall Kzarka is definitely an improvement over a liverto. If you dont have a liverto again go Kzarka. Otherwise Id use a yuria get it do Duo and then save until you can afford the Kzarka. Will benefit you significantly more in the long run to go with a kzarka. ,blackdesertonline,dd2844e,2,t5_2w6ir

10554168,0,t3_5r4sas,at level ish yes you have so very few attacks its boring as hell.  Right around  you wil have most of your attacks unlocked.. HOWEVER once you get awakening you will only use a few skills the awakened ones because they do so much more damage than the old skills.The main problem imo is that there is no differentiation amongst classes the only real difference between a  witch and a  witch is the  witch will do more damage with the exact same spells.There is no way to specialize characters into a frost build for slows and stuns vs a fire build for crits and dotsCompound that with the fact that practically everyone at the higher levels have the same boss gear some have red nose and some have tree armor but thats itAsk the next  Level  players you see what bootsgloves they have.  They will probably all say bhegs and muskans.The upside of everyone using the same gear is that you can swap the gear between characters easily different gems might be needed in some cases tho.  The downside being who the hell wants to level two different characters to ?,blackdesertonline,dd4fmjf,-2,t5_2w6ir

10694622,0,t1_ddj25zl,If you dont like grinding games you shouldnt play them. You cant expect an asian styled game to change its whole game just for the west. Let me put it this way we all know this is a KR game and we all know it has a huge grind. However the game is immensely enjoyed there and is there main profitable version. They will continue to do what makes them profits.Ive played GW WoW Runescape and Rift all at endgame levels. Everything is a grind. You grind mythic dungeons in WoW to get more gear.  You grind raids in WoW to get more gear.You grind raids in GW for ascended gearlegendary rewards. You grind dungeons in GW for goldmats. At the end of the day everything becomes a grind in every MMORPG.Content is only engaging when you first complete it. After that its not engaging anymore but the problem with MMOs is they have to try and keep you engaged for long periods of time which is why themepark MMOs do quite well hereThis is why people like to do PvP also. Its constantly changing and never the same and normally always engaging. Adding dungeons or larger scale PvE things may or may not hurt. You never know. Theres people that argue that raids might have hurt GWs target demographic for example.They said that want to expand on that kamasilvia system that I linked. Thats a start for something meaningful in PvE that you may like. If they could make a rift styled system with difficulty scaling that would be fun. Hell they could make non instanced raids that spawn like world bosses and that would be fun too. Ive always like Ds rift system and I honestly think something like that would work great in an MMORPG because its never the same each level is different.Also. I split up what I do every day in BDO. I dont grind hrs a day like some people do if I did id go insane xD. Yesterday I did pila ku for a couple hours then I did a aakmen group for almost hour. Then I entered RBF for about  hours and then I afk processed for about hours. I came back and then worked on gathering and crafting afterwords for my nd epheria boat and then I went to bed. ,blackdesertonline,ddj2k6h,5,t5_2w6ir

The rest of the arguments are poorly constructed.Do not reroll just because everyone else is talking that way. Ive been a ranger main since launch and ranger is extremely strong in the right hands. A lot of other classes have been buffed since the ranger nerfs that arrived just before and throughout Mediah content but were still not easy to handle. Learning your class and how to deal with other classes is paramount to a greater gaming experience no matter what youre playing. For people complaining about ranger grindspeed Get better mechanically but better gear also helps. For people complaining about ranger in sieges Acquire more patience and a more strategic approach. For people complaining about ranger in v PVP You should reroll because youre bad.The class balance in this game is fairly good and at a reasonable parity. Continue with ranger if youre resilient and know theyll continue to be good regardless of the ranting of fools.,blackdesertonline,ddtuqfi,-1,t5_2w6ir

Lots of frontal block and super armor on awakened abilities with good mobility. If your good with the bow you should be doing dps while kiting. Very strong in small scale combat. Cons squishy. Very vulnerable in bow stance with limited iframes and no true warrior style block. Once you get focused youre probably dead. Not as good v compared to sorc. Sorc pros Has the most iframes of any class so it can basically dodge anything. High burst with a lot of cc abilities. Black spirit  is one of the best in the game for node wars since it groups everyone up and sets up kills. Top  v class imo since its toolkit is huge and can respond to any situation if you know what youre doing. Cons high skillcap. Not a class you can just pick up and start doing well with. Sorcs have very little super armor and frontal blocks and need to set up a cc before going into a group of people. Basically its either attack or dodge in group pvp where as a ranger can come in and blow everyone up while being immune to damage for a few seconds.

Style Short mobile attacks with a focus on consistent forward moving damage.  Strengths Significantly tanky moveable guard form stronk counter attack.  black rage ultimate ability hits like a truck.  Weaknesses  Black rage ultimate in both nonawake and awakening form are a liability due to a Very long cast time and short distance. i.e. plenty of time for someone to superarmor up to you can grab you out of it or straight up kill you while you cast  Requirements A significant amount of time searching and learning how to play the class as there is a lot of hidden interactions or anim cancels. Check sj y Youtube channel for content help on this matter.  Conclusion Valkyrie is a stronk class but requires dedication and learning to perform well. Its not a pickup and play character unless you like playing defensive. Valkyrie also has the best skill for sheep mountain and  bonus to lifeskill minigame chances and pvp.

If you are cranking out as many processed materials as I am you need those things to sell quickly or you are just losing money. Any item that sits on the market for even a day without selling is something you want to stay away from. The market is inundated with plywood and it does not sell fast or well at all. The current recommendation for timber would be to process to planks and sell or just market the timber. The current money is all in ingots which pretty much sell immediately.

But your laptop chip actually does outperform his desktop chip Which just goes to show even further how out of date his rig is. And your single thread performance is practically the same.      I see these kinds of comparisons a lot but games like Crysis battlefield and the like are NOT MMOs. They use different engines with a lot less going on in them. If you actually consider the size and complexity of Black Desert online shooters pale in comparison.        And like i said...an ssd would help a bit.

11063999,0,t3_5xzml7,Every class is viable for  of the games content. When people say something is good or bad you HAVE to have the context for what theyre good and bad at. Tamers arent the top tier grinder but that does not mean theyre bad. They actually have some unique advantages. Their awakening might not have the most AOE but it does have AOE. Their pet allows them to pull above the  mob limit players normally have since it counts as another player bumping the limit to  mobs per pull. This can allow the tamer to grab bigger packs.Comparing it to a witchwizard in terms of grinding will make it seem bad but there are classes that are worse off even awakened like say Valkyries Or Maehwa. Every other aspect of Tamer is in a good position. v PVP theyre really good. Small scale PVP lt People they still do good. Large scale PVP such as high tier Node Wars or weekend Castle Siege Wars they arent that great at doing but they still can perform a role in them and only the top  of guilds would tell you to reroll to something else.

11090413,0,t3_5yc5ll,My most important advice for new players in BDO NEVER let others tell you what to do. you should try the different aspects of the game and decide yourself what to do and when to do it. its okay to ask for help and get advice from others but dont just do something just because someone else did it that way. I really love grinding in BDO and could do it for days. And i really like playing different classes. I was told to take it easy on the leveling side and focus on one character to not get burned out. so i started to force myself to level lifeskills and got really bored really fast and even considered to quit.,blackdesertonline,dep37g6,5,t5_2w6ir

11094142,0,t3_5yf1iy,Youre missing the point if asking about experience I think. The point of quests is to give you contribution which you can use to invest into AI workers that do stuff for you. The game really likes to give you alternative ways of gaining power aside from level. The way Ive heard it if you powerlevel your way up to high level ignoring all the side activities you can do then you may well end up quite underpowered compared to other players if thats something which matters to you.I am also quite new and I found youtube to be a good source of information. However I found that this information only started making sense when I saw the actual systems in the game. For example many NPCs in the game have a conversation button which starts up a really confusing minigame and while I had read about it in this guide beforehand the guide only really started making sense after I had played around with the minigame a little bit myself.I do think that this youtube guide is pretty good though ,blackdesertonline,depierf,2,t5_2w6ir

11143490,0,t3_5z4092,Imo go blue awakening to duo most wont agree with me here they will say to go green and then straight to Dandelion but thats bs. Youre not gonna get Dandelion quickly and the difference between green and blue awakening is huge if grinding human mobs. And lets be real all viable mobs are humans currently elrics sausans pirates Gahaz then save up for Bhegs. Once you have Bhegs you can go two ways try to get Muskans amazing defense upgrade or Kutum or Nouver Im a Kutum lover tho. Also Nouver is more expensive and Kutum seems to have additional hidden monster AP which is also amazing for grinding. Dont go Axion its imo worse than Vangertz Kutum gives a little bit of accuracy almost the same AP as Axion and DP on top of that with warriors DP scaling thats absolutely great. After that go the other way Muskans if got Kutum Kutum if went Muskans. After that you can go Kzarka and Dande no need to rush Hebe and Giath yet you got the best upgrades already. Why Kzarka so late? Well if you already have Liverto its only a minor accuracy upgrade and  AS. Sure its still big but all the items mentioned above give more than that imo and will simply make your grind faster and itll be easier to reach other goals in that order. If you dont have liverto though go for that. The accuracy and AP is amazing trust me on that youll feel it. ,blackdesertonline,dev3pul,5,t5_2w6ir

11254426,0,t3_60j1by,Well first of all you cant exactly call yourself the same kind of RPer as the RPers youre killing because you yell DEATH TO RPERS.  That would be like yelling DEATH TO WHITES when you yourself are white. But it does happen and those people think they are on some higher plane of existence than other whites or RPers or whatever.  So to justify and explain how youre RPing as an RP killer you have to place the RPers youre killing into a subset world within your own world of RP.  In other words youre an RPer within the BDO world. Your character has an issue with RPers but these RPers are RPing in a subset world within BDO. They are basically fantasizing about things that you cant comprehend because those things dont exist in the world of BDO. Its like a cult to your character and your character thinks such cults should be eliminated because its far worse than any witch craft youve experience. These people talk about weird foreign things like star wars or attack helicopters or anime  I mean just what is this anime these cultists speak of? Sounds like devils play. Purge them.  Perhaps your backstory is that your characters parents joined one of these roleplaying cults when your character was a child. They wanted so badly to become the things they were roleplaying that they infused your body with the black spirit and now the black spirit is whispering to you to kill all RPers because thats what they do  they infuse their children with black spirits in hopes the black spirit will make them into actual anime characters or whatever the hell they are roleplaying as.  This actually fits because the black spirit DOES whisper some pretty genocidal things to us.,blackdesertonline,df7o7l1,3,t5_2w6ir

Responsible Guilds offer guild payments that are increasing based on your activity.

The buffs Kuno received in KR will help a bit but nothing that will change the reality that Kuno is a bottom  class in this game outside of v.Ultimately the most important part is to play a class you enjoy.  But be aware of the reality.  v and small scale Kuno is excellent.  But in large scale conflicts we are pretty worthless.

I quit PoE for a year after burning through over  fuses without L a lightning coil. Its bad luck sure and the irony is that I had so many fuses to burn  because two of the people I played with both managed to L their chests in under  and fed me their fuses.

Or writeups for having my cell phone at my desk in case my kids call with an emergency.

11578286,0,t3_655usy,This is what I thinkLoot for field bosses and world bosses have their own calculations.World bossesKaranda Kzarka Kutum Nouver only a certain amount of people can get loot  and you need to do enough damage to get loot or else you wont get anything. Everyone who gets loot gets random loot regardless of dps and has a chance of rolling the box. However field bosses have a top and bottom damage bracket. Theres a fixed number of people that can enter the top bracket and it is determined by hunters seals  and bottom loot you get . If theres less people on the boss the higher the chance you will get top tier loot. I believe only top tier loot can roll the good items liverto awakening box boss armor drops etc while low tier only gets a small amount of stones gold seals and crystals. Therefore low ap boss alts who get boxes from world bosses that try to do field bosses on a crowded channel may have a harder time getting better loot on field bosses while world boss loot is completely random.,blackdesertonline,dg8elam,1,t5_2w6ir

11586499,0,t1_dg8qlvm,Its a form of lowering the power level of a class and adding counter play without defanging or gutting the class.  Lets look at your example warrior existed first and is generally more powerful than musa while being particularly strong against musas. If warriors were suddenly removed from the game musas would be relatively stronger because they wouldnt have to deal with a class that counters them.Buffing everyone except class x is a relative nerf to class x.  Introducing a class that exploits all of a classs weaknesses is a nerf.  Its just a much better way of doing it as long as they do it well than gutting damage numbers especially for a class that has limited defensive utility and mobility compared to others.If anything Im worried that dk awakening essentially does the same thing as wizwitch but with  times the mobility and at better range.

But if you do the relics you can push your numbers up to mhr over  hours. I would say that most fish botters would do the relics so they can get even more money in a shorter amount of time.Not sure why you cant understand this.
