However your characters will only be as strong as your weapon grid allows them to be. If you absolutely need to land debuffs master dark fencer and superstar and put zenith points into their debuff chances. Your debuffs will have  chances. Youre asking for too much progress. I started dark and I went for a month or two without a single SSR drop.  million damage is not too difficult once you get a grid like this It took me  months to get only  max weapons and most of those are after the addition of emblems. Ive been in over  Celeste raids no joke. The rest of the weapons that filled my pool were from events or element changed weapons. Even now Im still working to make my grid better.

7978562,0,t1_d4ctz5w,So I just finished Chapter . The LeviMithra fight was ridiculous...I barely managed to beat it without boosts.I ended up using a  Bahamut as my Support Summon. My main summon is an MLB Celeste Omega. My party setup was Superstar with Miserable Mist Narmaya Vania and Vira in the main party and Vaseraga and Lady Grey as subs. Weapon grid consists of a GW Harp as the main hand element changed to Dark  MLB Celeste Axe  LB Celeste Axe  MLB Dark Unknown Katanas SR Bahamut Axe and SR Bahamut Sword.Against Leviathan Malice I basically used all my skills against him on Turn . From then on it was just auto attacks delays when needed and Narmayas ODA once he went into OD. Autoattacks were enough to kill him though Narmayas ODA auto attacking  times really helped a lot. Unfortunately I had to use both green potions from my crew bonuses to kill him.With Mithra Malice I have no idea how his mechanics work. Id just like to say I probably got extremely lucky in beating him because I was one turn away from dying before dealing the final blow. But basically I used all debuffs I had up and then focused my ougi chain against the Mithra Circle. I was told to only do this if I could one shot it but that doing so also opens the possibility of having Mithra Malice become invulnerable at  with no feasible way to remove it? Fortunately I didnt run into that issue. However I did not have my ougis back up once he hit  health. Nothing happened once he passed the  threshold but my next set of attacks got him close to  at which he healed back up to around . I think normally he would heal back to full but I had a healing debuff on him from when I summoned Celeste Omega. From then on I tried to save ougis for chains but would end up using them if I thought the character could possibly die before the next turn. Eventually got to a point where it was just Vaseraga and Lady Grey left and when they were both one hit away from dying Lady Greys ougi was thankfully enough to finish it off.If I had to do it again I would probably try to bring an MLB Wind Carbuncle to mitigate a lot of the damage it would deal anywhere from  damage to my entire party several turns in a row. Id probably look more into the mechanics of the boss since the Mithra Circle gives both of them resistance to all types of damage like Lumineria Omega but I have no idea what triggers it nor how to trigger the reset. Then again had I kept losing and decided to stack the bonuses up to  it probably wouldve been a lot easier.,Granblue_en,d4cv672,2,t5_3e3se

Youre not going to be able to get all that many extra.Assuming Im wrong and you can get more nuggets than are needed for the gold bricks its not necessarily going to be a waste. Theyre not likely to refresh the shop per se but Cygames will no doubt add additional gold bricks in the shop. They did so this very event in fact. Before this Celestial event it was only possible to get  gold bricks from the shop in total. That said it will probably be a long time before they do so again.As far as the Maniac level bosses go yeah. The Ifrit events and his ilk are what I was referring to. I believe that anything labeled as maniac will have a small chance for a gold brick drop. EDIT I forgot. HellHL raids also have a chance of dropping them. I believe these are labeled as Impossible level in the English translation.

8127519,0,t1_d4tkj6i,Well the thing that makes GBF stand out is that it is unlike the other mobage out there but a watered down traditional JRPG with MMO elements. Combat is entirely turn based with the exception of certain skills that runs on timers and using the correct combination of skillsbuffs is essential for survival. In some cases the complexity renders the game unplayable on a small screen because there are too many things to keep tabs on. The game makes heavy use of elemental rockpaperscissors to scale its difficulty and TBH they are not created equal. While its possible to focus on a couple of strong elements most comitted players will have to invest in a couple other elements to be able to get through certain hard raids. This also has the effect of pigeonholing characters and equipment into six categories each element has its own grind which can take months on its own and tough luck if you just pulled something offelement from gacha that you will probably never use. Cost will depend on the playstyle. Pure FP is possible but can get quite painful light players will usually pick up the monthly star gacha one guaranteed SSR and the bimonthly surprise ticket  pull plus one SSR charactersummon of your choice so they are looking to drop about  yen per month heavy users can spend anywhere between K to K per month depending on their luck with the new releases but this does not absolve them from the grind since PW will require a much larger investment before it s viable. Paying a moderate amount into the game however will make the grind more enjoyable. P.S.

At first I thought I had made a mistake since Korwas buffs felt a bit lackluster compared to Rosettas  stack buff. The DATA increase seems to trigger less often and the lack of a fullparty defensive buff means that I didnt feel invincible anymore.After using both for a while though in the end I dont regret my decision to ticket Korwa. Rosettas use is more situational like you mentioned she shines in solo battles especially against enemies that DATA often. Shes also great in raids like Grande Order where there are multiple enemies. But shes very much a dead weight in most large raids or HL battles where people are charmingblindingparalyzing stuff left and right and thats where Korwa comes in. So eventually youll want to have Korwa on your team if you play wind and even if you dont!. Dont worry too much about not having a defensive boost because in those raids youll have support from other players with max debuffs and damage cuts to help you live through it.Btw its also possible to use Rosetta and Korwa together in some especially long fights such as Titan.

For most elements this combination is not practical as lately unknown weapons tend to have inferior stats compared to omega weapons yet in case of fire it is the other way around with unknown weapons actually coming on top against a preHL omega staff.

8753375,0,t3_4zyqku,Red chests from CeletseLumi have lower rates compared to the other  elements so they wont help you that much in making a pool fast.Personally if youre really concerned about making fast progress Id advice to switch to another element or play around with a Grande lineup and get a decent team going with things like ATKup SR weapons. After a while you should have some resources that allow you to brute force weapons for Dark if you really want to play that element. Both renown pendants and a stockpile of EPseeds can be turned into Dark Weapons after all. But at the end of the day progress on DarkLight is just based on luck and a strong determination you shouldnt expect big progress in just a week after playing especially if you dont have any resources to force some luck out of Celeste.Farm Celeste until the end of Magnafest and afterwards or during the event if Celeste is super stingy just decide based on your drops. Its not totally impossible to get a strong DarkLight team going but theres nothing wrong with a solid foundation in another element to make the grind more efficint its what I did personally and I dont regret it.In general basic questions ought to be posted in the Stickied thread at the top.

Most likely youll quickly realize you dont have nearly enough of the nonHL mats for more than  or  anyway.Id also try to start getting in on some Baha HLs to fully upgrade your weapon. Id only do the baha gun if its good for the races your team uses. Its not worth using a lousy baha weapon just for the cosmo benefits especially when you already have  guns on the grid.If your GW weapon is wind it will severely delay your star weapons because of all the whorls you need for it which star unlocks also use.

Guaranteed SR or SSR is misleading because it implies that the chance is equal between the two items being advertised.It absolutely matters what the chance is because knowing the chance will affect whether the person whose question youre answering will use the ticket right now or not. Its precisely the reason why the rate isnt actually listed in the Draw screen but you have to click to view it they want people to see guaranteed SRSSR and think oh I can get a SSR I should buy this!Its further misleading because an advertisement of guaranteed SRSSR implies that the chance of getting a SSR is higher than the normal draw when actually it is the exact same rate.,Granblue_en,d7r49iw,-1,t5_3e3se

9393432,0,t1_d96nmbi,. Pick dagger or harp for your weapon just in case you draw it those tend to be useful no matter what you end up doing later on. You really dont need to worry about it much right now though Unite and Fight happens pretty much every month and the GW weapons wont do anything for you other than be a stat stick for a while.. The candies drop from different fights and then when you have enough of them for some loot the loot tab will have an exclamation mark. You then just hit the blue pick up all button to get your stuff. The cookie drops from the solo fight the biscuit drops from the pumpkins and the JackOLanterns and I believe the snickerdoodle only drops from the JackOLanterns. Yes its possible to get them without MVPing but it takes a lot more AP.If you started  days ago you shouldnt worry about GW much. Just try to clear each one for the crystals. You can go over your max AP with a halfelixer so you can host everything. Just start them and immediately request reinforcements. The weapons and summon arent anything special and there are events constantly and basically all of them will give you SR weapons most of them contain SSR summons. In other drawbox events summons are the main goal of the drawbox and its easier to MLB the event summon. The event summons are usually only worth using as a stat stick until you get better ones from the gacha anyway.. If youre willing to reroll then reroll. If you keep the account dont use your start dash until you have some other characters are maybe a really good summon for that element like Lucifer or Bahamut. Unless you get one of those and maybe even if you do characters are the real determiner of what element you choose to go with.,Granblue_en,d96omvs,1,t5_3e3se

Any other element and I doubt Id be able to even finish the story.In past events the story was fairly managable and the harder battles that you had to grind were all raids so I could grind up quite a bit.

Not sure if the drop rate changed during the balance patch but only ended up getting  Celeste and  Chev selfies after using about  BP. Last MagnaFest where I fared much better I got  Celeste claws  Celeste axes and  Celeste spears. Pulled a lot of new SSR characters though. Got Izmir and Clarisse on a paid  pull during Izmirs premiere banner. This was coming after pulling Yngwee on a single from the free Dailies they were giving out a month or so back. On the free  crystals from the new producer I got Hallenessa then Beatrix and Forte from this Legendfest from the other free crystals given out. Finally I got lucky and pulled Anthuria on a single from the crystals earned from the current event.All in all progress on my grid slowed down due to bad luck whereas my character pool expanded greatly due to some great luck. It generally alternates between this and a month or so of no character pulls and some decent grid pulls. During SummerFest I got lucky and pulled S. Zooey and S. Narumaya but got nothing during HalloweenFest. With my luck that will probably mean Ill get nothing for ChristmasFest and maybe lucky for New Years.,Granblue_en,daoq1sq,1,t5_3e3se

Do not get them if your plan is to protect Yoda and play water.Korwa is known for her offensive buffs. While she does have defensive ones they are not worth getting her to protect Yoda. She also needs ougi gauge to maintain. Ferry guarantees  turns of triple attack for the team but Yoda already guarantees triple attacks. Ferry is worthless protecting him.Unless you can define exactly what you want to do with them do not even consider Korwa or Ferry offelement until you hit rank . An example of someone who would actually help Yoda off element is Petra. She gives him mirror images to ignore his weak turns. After Ouging  times Yoda has a stretch of  turns of unprotected uselessness. Petra could actually make him get through it as long as he is not targeted once out of the  turns and the boss doesnt ougi. But again ticketing characters JUST to protect Yoda is a bad idea.Lilele helps Yoda survive immensely. Her atkdef buff helps his vulnerable turns her charge boost is largely irrelevant to yoda until after your nd ougi and he starts attacking stackless and her healshield saves lives but do not expect this to guarantee anything. They are all on longer cooldowns than Yoda would like. It increases the chances of his rd mil by a substantial margin but no guarantees. th mil is probably out of the question still.

Only Earth and Wind are easier to build. And Earth has the same issues as Fire in HL hard man bosses for Urns limits  progression. Seriously Canes arent the limiting factor on Twin Elements HL.  Doesnt matter what your first team is by the time you hit HL you can fairly trivially solo farm all Omega bosses.

10243072,0,t1_dc51t60,I would guess early transitioning to mid. You should be around the point of trying to consistently mvp your own leviathan hosts if possible and if not maybe Silva can give you the extra push you need. Keep in mind though that critical works only for the element you are good against so her skill that gives her crit is particuilarly good at killing fire but does not work for other elements. She peaks around this point because she can deal high ougi damage while your other members are dealing much less ougi damage compared to her. Eventually other members will catch up to her but as your grid develops and completes around rank  she will feel less impactful. Moving forward lancelot will deal more overall damage and provide utility as well with his atk and def down which is good and stacks with your miserable mist ability from Dark Fencer. This lets you do harder content assuming your debuffs land.,Granblue_en,dc53xrg,1,t5_3e3se

Maybe if we get more members well try to shoot for  victories.As of the the th Guild Wars most recent we qualified at th place with  honors. We also managed to pick up two wins with only  members as well as SSS grade. This isnt a display of our strength but rather a sense of our cohesion and teamwork. Most of the time were very casual. Were not looking for insanely powerful people just people that are rank  and are willing to put in time and effort when Guild Wars preliminaries comes around.I want to stress that this guild is only for people that want to do HL activitieschill not go  in guild wars. Its for people who are just starting out in HL or people that are burned out from going  too much in guild wars.There are no expectations and no quotas needed to be met. If youre looking for the maximum underachiever guild that can barely squeak past prelims thats us.If youre interested and fulfill the requirements feel free to PM me or post on my profile board if you can speak Japanese.

You cant trade pendants for these until you hit  but once you do you should try to get as many hl gold pendants as you can and trade them in for distinctions everyday. You are limited to one of each class distinction per day. The coop drops for the distinctions are rare and very unreliable.  Grande horns should be traded in for a centrum.  Its limited to one per month and you need three. You could get lucky with your own grande hosts or other HL but thats reliant on rng.

Each baha weapon provides different boosts to different races with humans and unknown getting boosts from every weapon. If your team is mostly erunes then you will get the dagger and if mostly draphs you get sword.etc mind you that each weapon provides buffs to humans and another race only when it has been changed to a coda weapon  I think thats what they are called otherwise only humans wil gain boosts.

Echos are incredible when it comes to breaking the damage cap. I can give my opinions on other elements too but take it with a grain of salt. Orchids legfest limited so you cant ticket her.Light  Sophia for clear since you already have Juliet and Amira for attackers. Wind You have all the best ticketable wind units. Earth idk anything about earth teams.Fire idk much about fire but I do see fire potato and Magisa getting used.Water Altair. ,Granblue_en,det7ccd,1,t5_3e3se

11210879,0,t3_5xpbhk,Hi there! Im a lurker but now Im finally gonna open up and make a post. At the moment I need help with troubleshooting whats wrong with my version of GBF.Heres the deal  I just bought a new tablet today and I wanted to set up GBF on it so that I can use my account while Im at school. My phone has the game on it as well but it drains it too much so I figured getting a tablet would be nice to have for both school and being able to play some games while Im bored. I transferred Qooapp and GBF over from my phone both Samsung and I booted it up... note this is a Tab A . T  far stronger specs than my Galaxy S and its getting some weird things happening.First up to state all of my settings are the same across browser phone and tablet Normal animation high quality skip animation fast battle speed. The second I loaded the game up the music is extremely quiet even at  in the settings and when I opened the game through the browser on my tablet the music was just fine  full volume.Next up the combat is... insanely laggy. Every single time I tap the screen to try and use skills the game chunks up which absolutely should not be happening if my phone has minimal lag running on high settings. This tablet should be running flawlessly in comparison!Another thing is that menus load in weird chunks  buttons will appear before the rest of the window does the quest map loads in chunks one by one instead of quickly... and after a fight theres a great deal of lag before the game gets to the battle results and then the same delayed loading happens... even text in cutscenes lags along and the voices jump in later than the text starting to scroll.Does anyone know if theres anything I can do to remedy this at all? EDIT Downloaded and set up my second account for Fire Emblem Heroes  music is just right absolutely no lag at all everything runs flawlessly. Its just GBF.,Granblue_en,df2qnzt,3,t5_3e3se

11393507,0,t3_62j1v6,My thoughts on the KatapillaAwesome character and pretty fun to use and great lines. All around A april fools character. Not very useful for anything unfortunately I see people touting the m skill damage combo but they seem to forget silva also does a m burst and without the  second long skill animations by the time you finish using the first rocket barrage most raids are finished but still lots of fun to use. Her cooldowns are also massive so outside of the burst she does nothing.EDIT For people who dont have her each rocket fires one at a time. Sixteen rockets.The most important part about the character is that it counts as Vira so you can use Vira costumes when you get tired of the tank silliness to have Vira and Kat in the party together onelement. Vira also looks funny waving her sword and firing rockets at monsters. The fate episode also gives a funny whatif conclusion to the Lets Hang event.,Granblue_en,dfnfrxr,2,t5_3e3se

11399647,0,t1_dfnz0rg,O your strongest is wind for sure. Nez is very good character that you would keep in party pretty much till end of game try to get him to  as fast as possible since it helps a lot once he doesnt inflict def down to himself. And whats good for you is that wind is easiest element to build.  So just play tiamat omega. You want to use guns in your build. But fists are pretty nice early too. Solo all hard raids as soon as you can per elemenet daily.  Tiamat is easiest to solo so you will be able to MVPdeal  of its hp pretty fast to secure easier farming for weapons.  Level up every class in t t and t. They give nice bonuses. Either use EMP you get on Dark Fencer or save for t classes.  Any questions? ,Granblue_en,dfo4vzl,1,t5_3e3se

Most subs allow questions with more substance to be posted outside megathreads. I apologized for my mistake and promised to post additional questions in the megathread.Well the bot does tell you that a mod will review the thread to see if the removal was a mistake. If it is something that is actually discussion worthy i.e. not just a general question we approve the post so that people can discuss it.gt Those questions with lots of responses would probably be good content for the actual sub and thats pretty much the whole point Im trying to make.

11741306,0,t1_dgqvox0,Not just weapons it also matters which characters are strong in each element.  If a particular classs niche is already filled by an SSR in that element or if another class combines well with a toptier SSR like SuperstarPercival then that changes which classes most people talk about playing in that element.,Granblue_en,dgqwnqo,2,t5_3e3se
11746358,0,t1_dgqizh7,Eh if Cygames wanted to they could just keep making new characters instead. Its one thing if a newer version of a character is exactly the same but better but thats not the case. Dark Cagliostro is NOT interchangeable with Earth Cagliostro. Although a cheaper legacy gatcha would be nice I dont think itd ever happen as financially Cygames doesnt have much reason to do something like that.,Granblue_en,dgrh9om,1,t5_3e3se

11771215,0,t1_dgu9lj0,If youre invested in the game as you said in your other post you should probably ticket a limited character from another element.  Dont waste your precious beginner draw for Percival or Yuel both of whom you can ticket with normal surprise picks.    You may not think it now but limited characters are very rare and you will most likely build other element teams if you keep playing the game.  If nothing else dont buy the ticket yet and wait and see how your normal draws shape up first.  Getting Yuel or Percival earlier is not worth giving up a limited character.,Granblue_en,dguarid,4,t5_3e3se
