5560186,0,t3_3r2wtm,I think the most likely way for this theory to make it on the big screen is actually not have JJ in the movies at all. Its a much more convincing story if JJs body was being controlled by a Sith rather than an actual Gungan being the end all Sith Lord. Another route they could take is making him just another Sith.

5576675,0,t1_cwobrv7,I havent watched the PT in a long time so I dont remember everything she does  when she does them but part of what made palpatine so effective was that he pulled all the strings from a safe distance like how he controlled the separatists almost completely through holograms. Padme being an evil mastermind didnt want to even be in the same room as her plan unfurled because she was smarter than her powerhungry sith peers.Theorizing motives in retrospect is easy. Putting malice and intent behind actions is easy. Why did she leave to do meaningless stuff? Because she was evil and smart and distanced herself. How did she lose then? Anakin almost killed her then Palpatine sensing weakness from her fight and then childbirth kills her.None of these theories will ever make complete sense  thats why theyre theories.

5643246,0,t3_3sesx0,I think there are some helpful hints from looking at the details of Andys character Andy Serkis is some kind of alien Sith exempt from the Rule of Two.  He is implied to have existed for a long time be very powerful and is the speaker in the teaser.  Serkis is implied to have trained or used Palpatine for some obscure purpose.  Adam Driver receives or builds a new lightsaber after meeting with Serkis. The Sith are not aligned with the Empire.  Serkis goals differ from Palpatines.  Serkis does not play or replace Darth Plagueis.  Also further details from the SpoilerMan leak are that the Sith are not directly aligned with Empire building that was all Palpatine.  edit In my personal opinion this goes in line with my thoughts on Jar Jar and Palpatine both being trained by Plagueis. Jar Jar controlling much behind the scenes of Episode  in order to gain power and secure a place in Coruscant. This then may lead to the idea if Jar Jar is MORE POWERFUL than Sidius and did not care of ruling an Empire then he could have easily kept behind the emperor as the most powerful Sith. Had the rewrites not occured I bet the Civil War would have been between these two but due to those rewrites we got a stealthier villian thats been waiting to come out of hiding.,DarthJarJar,cwwlkvl,8,t5_3akza

I finished all of season  of the clone wars last night and found that Jar Jar maintains the same hints.

5717858,0,t1_cx50wb5,Im still thinking that DJJ is Darth Plagueis it all fits really cleanly. The senate was Plagueiss plan and while Sidious thought hed cut him out if hed survived using the Sith secrets that he knew then of course hes going to lay low and wait for a moment of weakness from his former apprentice. What better place than in plain sight and playing the bumbling fool.The issue though is that while that is completely and utterly awesome. It doesnt really contribute to where the story was going. I mean it is a prequel so we know that Sidious has to win the only way to have a good twist would be for it to go convoluted and have  Plagueis steal his body so that Sidious would never have been Sidious outside of the prequels and again that doesnt really advance the story.,DarthJarJar,cx5uu8l,2,t5_3akza

The age connection is a big factor and the mention of menace leads me to believe that even if GL didnt consciously use this info he subconsciously pulled from his mixed bag of memories to make a Froglike sea creatures who coinhabit a watery planet that may have originally wanted to kill the airbreathers by destroying the atmosphere.Boss Nass hated the people in Theed. He had the army and the organic tech to attack. Maybe the galactic civil war hit Naboo right before the Naboo civil war was gonna happen altering history. Lets face it Darth Jar Jar would benefit more from infiltrating Jedi in a galactic quest rather than eventually ruling overenslaving one lone planet.,DarthJarJar,d8x5s77,6,t5_3akza

In the bongo sub in Naboo after the Jedi rescue him from his life debt but before he summons the opee. OK Ill resume this search later when I can actually watch videos.
