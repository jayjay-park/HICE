4324736,0,t3_3aj8tl,Some rules of thumb for building encounters Trash enemies like risen thralls aside you want your bad guys to have either a mixture of high defense and high armor or very occasionally a strong skew towards one or the other. When doing that sort of skew make sure you plan the encounter so each player can still do something to be combat effective even if they have a hard time hitting dodgy targets or a hard time damaging tanky enemies. Adding at least one extra defensive ability either through a supporting spellcaster who stays in the back or through innate abilities is also recommended. I always give powerful specters the Ashen Veil ability for exampleLastly dont be afraid to give your bad guys feat points. Nontrash characters can often have one encounter leaders can generally have two and big bad guys can have three easily and dont be afraid to give them ways to gain more.,ikrpg,csd4kew,2,t5_2wi8t

7329857,0,t3_4fjlpg,Youve gotten some good advice here and I think treating the attack as a slam was right on the money.One thing to be careful of is not to step on the toes of existing player abilities though. The pugilist I think gets some interesting knockdown actions and Im sure some other careers do too but Im too tired to check at the moment.Consider having someone who doesnt have an ability to perform the action they want to accomplish take a  to the check such as when using a moderatelydifficult weapon. You could even try  but that seems like it would discourage players from trying new things. That way youre at least nodding your head at balance as you let your players buckle some swashes.,ikrpg,d2bcsky,1,t5_2wi8t

7778158,0,t3_4lnpjq,For jacks my group changed the fuel type from coal to dieselpetrol. This meant armorjacks would run for about a weekfull tank. They mostly decided this because no one wanted to keep track of coal especially the logistics.To balance this a bit the GM ruled that heavy jacks require  bond slots from the ability not double the rune power to run like this.Weapons would be difficult to balance between ranged and melee characters. Though you could upgrade armors as well at which point the rules stay the same you just added some flavor text so we did not change anything about that.,ikrpg,d3qb9ek,2,t5_2wi8t
7963037,0,t3_4o8i9h,The Unleashed GM kit comes with a bunch of great stuff aside from just the screen itself which is good on its own.    You get the  tiles that match perfectly with the Unleashed Adventure Kit if you have one of those. You get a scenario designed for a party of  with xp that uses those Tiles. Then you also get  Character Health Trackers as well as  Initiative Trackers which are all laminated cards so that you can use drywet erase on them.    The Character Health Trackers have Spirals as well as Grids so you can use them for a jack or a character that has... well... Grids. ,ikrpg,d4b4dn5,2,t5_2wi8t

11047006,0,t3_5xoa3o,Believe me if the designers meant for a pugilist to get double strength youd have an ability that did it not in some wishy washy wording about attack rolls. Plus when in doubt defer to the main rules.If you want to be a strong unarmed character play a Pugilist or an Allegiant of the Order of the Fist.Alternatively a fun houserule that myself and some of my friends use is that warcasters can boost unarmed attack and damage rolls with their warcaster armor and warlocks could easily have some kind of gauntlets they bond with.,ikrpg,dek5qi8,1,t5_2wi8t
