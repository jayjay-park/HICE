3863745,0,t1_cqwjhxm,You make a good point and Im glad you got that in before the six month lockdown on comments. I agree that pizza isnt a sandwich not even with a New York fold. Now youve got me considering the subtle differences of the totally unimportant problem of what is or isnt a sandwich. Maybe it depends on whether the toppings are added before or after the bread is baked. That would also keep beef wellington for one out of the category of sandwiches which I think is a good thing. ,eatsandwiches,cqwp9lj,2,t5_2s643
