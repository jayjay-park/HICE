5214214,0,t1_cve1o6c,So a physical server with Windows Storage Server  R Standard Edition comes with data duplication will suffice?How will I be able to hotadd the local data store for backup? Or I will need to use a LANbased backup? ,Veeam,cvei87f,1,t5_2ut1c

6910347,0,t1_d0z9s5y,I cant be sure of the specifics only what Id learned through using FreeNAS which run FreeBSD..which does not support the agent. Let me say it like this if its a Windows repository Veeam will install a agent on that machine ditto for a Linux share if supported. Im fairly certain other Veeam certified NAS devices either come preinstalled with the Veeam agent or the agent is deployed when chosen  setup as a repo. ,Veeam,d0zlwq0,2,t5_2ut1c
7008636,0,t3_4bk1a2,With free or standard edition you can use file to tape jobs to place your disk backups to tape. Keep in mind that VBR follow the disk to disk to tape approach so you should have a backup to disk job which is then followed by a file to tape job.,Veeam,d1arw8t,2,t5_2ut1c
7105361,0,t1_d1grtjs,cdcj is right here. Mapped drives are specific to user. Meaning they are available only when an user is actually logged on to the computer. Thus the requirement to use UNC path instead.  ,Veeam,d1lrlcf,1,t5_2ut1c
7220184,0,t1_d1yqktp,Does that old data to be deduped run as an afterhours  scheduled background process? Do you know how hard it hits the disk while its running?,Veeam,d1yvolf,2,t5_2ut1c

7943625,0,t3_4ndx9g,. Compression is automatic and not able to be changed.  i just checked one of mine and my used data on the PC is  GB and a full veeam backup is  GB..  Backups are incremental.  It automatically handles all chain management and you decide how many versions you keep.  If you keep  versions the oldest is your full and everything after is incremental.  It will auto create synthetic fulls to keep your chain moving forward after  days.  .  The backup is baremetal and not file based.  If you delete it from the server it will still live in the full backup and prior incremental but not in new incrementals.  A backup program wouldnt be worth anything if it deleted a deleted file from the backup as well.  ,Veeam,d48xrgu,1,t5_2ut1c
9178770,0,t1_d8f3vtl,Were aiming at the end of this year. No one knows the actual date regardless of paycheck size because we only release When QC thinks Its Ready because the quality is most important.,Veeam,d8fh5hf,1,t5_2ut1c
9866747,0,t1_datne8u,Yes. Sidenote FreeNAS drives me nuts by using the term CIFS and not SMB.,Veeam,datnrlh,2,t5_2ut1c
9866962,0,t1_datnrlh,Ha! I can think of a few people I know who have the same bad attitude towards CIFS!Cool let us know how it goes in the long run SMB . support is currently experimental.,Veeam,datorwf,2,t5_2ut1c
9979463,0,t3_5ii49a,I would recommend having one BampR server that oversees all the sites and reinstalling the other sites as just a repositorybackup proxy.  We tried using a nd BampR server a proxy for the first it doesnt play well because the two instances cant be made aware of each other.,Veeam,db8cp29,2,t5_2ut1c

10530897,0,t3_5qr3rw,We run our Veeam BampR server as a VM  vCPU GB memory as well as two Veeam proxy VMs with the same specs.Only physical Veeam servers are for the backup storage repository.  ,Veeam,dd1sj99,1,t5_2ut1c
11108354,0,t1_der1b5p,Thank you for sharing these news sounds interesting.,Veeam,der4erk,4,t5_2ut1c
11306469,0,t1_dfcru3b,This is our experience as well. We dont often have to restore or recover items where Veeam is deployed.,Veeam,dfdkkq0,1,t5_2ut1c
11624798,0,t1_dgdod6t,Yeah. I realize this isnt on you. Pretty bad form on VEEAMs part to be honest...I assume most people here have full time gigs and taking off for a week takes planning andor approvals. Now that were less than a month before the conference starts thats going to be harder and harder to do.,Veeam,dgdol0p,2,t5_2ut1c
