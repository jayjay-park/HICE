8777673,0,t1_d72obx6,I think there are a couple of issues at play. . A contiguous CC was already shot down so while not ideal the new stadium may very well be our best chance to keep it.

8900550,0,t1_d7hntyb,gtWell. Lets say I have a company right now and my employees union wants to start a pension for their workers. Sure. Note Im pro Unions and for the idea pensions. However today I have no idea how a small or even medium company could even prepare for it. I dont think you realize how safe pensions were designed. Safer than you suggest and they failed.gtWe would sit down at the table and talk about how many employees there are right now and how much they all have to equally put in to make sure theres enough to cover them after retirement. Of course this is covering interest assuming youre putting the money into a market that isnt risky etc etc. First off which market is not risky? Im serious I want to invest. I seriously do want to invest in a zero risk market. All markets are risky. There are less risky options than markets. Traditionally pensions invested not in markets. You are already more risky than real life pensions! Bonds are not the markets. To over simplify stocks are the market. Stocks are ownership of companies. Bonds are how countrys borrow. When USA issues debt it does so with bonds. If stocks are companies then bonds are governments. Needless to say countrys like usa safer than the markets. gtRight now scientists have a good estimate at what our life expectancy should be in years the typical term of a employee who works for the company their entire career. Lets say they predict the average male will go from yrs old to yrs old in years. Okay.  Fucking plan for him to live to  and change the rate of contribution to that. I mean maybe Im looking at this wrong you might know more about this than me. Im just assuming this is how it works.Well what if your wrong? What then? You might want to be more conservative. Remember for every year employee are more expensive.gt Another issue the these government pensions face is that there are more employees retiring than they are hiring because they are getting cheap as fuck as far as correctly staffing departments. This is why our infrastructure is crumpling they refuse to staff more people. Of course this may be a chicken and a egg thing they cant staff more people because of the pension issue. Now this is the real issue. Did you hear that Apple only payed . tax least year? Of course they cant hire more! ,SanDiegan,d7hpviq,1,t5_3f157
9025249,0,t1_d7od22j,Agreed. Native as well and am really considering moving even though family is here.

9099069,0,t1_d85j8er,gtWho do you think is voting for the union leaders?Union leaders.  They dont have check and balance systems in place like our government does for its voting system.  Every union Ive ever had the displeasure of being associated with has been entirely self serving for those at the top.Why would those at the bottom vote for someone who shafts them regularly?gtIf the majority of cops were honest then the blue wall of silence wouldnt be a thingI think peer pressure and fear from how the top members of their union would react.  The first cops who call out for these cameras risk being martyrs.   gtThe fact that it is proven to happen in police departments across the country suggests that its a systemic problem.I disagree.  There are  sworn personnel across the entire country.  If just  of them are corrupt A terrifyingly high number in my opinion then that is  sworn personnel across the country that are corrupt.  Considering that bad cops have been the medias new thing these past few years it makes perfect sense that that many corrupt officers would produce stories across the nation.Seriously though.  How many unjust police shootings have happened across the nation this year?  Considering the media is gobbling them up I doubt many that meet their criteria have been missed.  At least the ones with a potential racist flair.,SanDiegan,d85k7ku,0,t5_3f157

This is a place for San Diegan related content and while they may have fans here they are no longer directly related to San Diego.

10797927,0,t1_ddtmm4c,gtI dont think were talking about someone open to listening to the people she has spent her life and money deriding.This is the crux of my issue with her opposition.  Its based on assumptions and defending them with what she hasnt done yet.  Shes been in office what a week now?  Less?I can write a smear campaign and cherry pick quotes from everyone I know in order to make them look bad.  If theyre a major focal point that smear campaign turns into ad revenue.The one thing I have seen lacking from DeVos is statements as the Secretary of Education.  I have not seen her make a claim to push religious agenda in her position and more importantly I havent seen her act in that role.Instead Ive seen her being bared from public schools or attempts to block her from entering them.  Usually via union backing.gtBecause her entire life and world view has been dedicated to decimating public schools.I am utterly for destroying public school unions and have been since I started high school  years ago.gtInstead of being able to go to a website and see your districts budget incomeexpendituressalaries elected school boards and the ability to have an input in your childs education she wants to privatize education.Have you ever been to a charter school?  The ones I am personally familiar with do exactly what you want but to a much more intimate degree.  They realize you have options and strive to be better than their free competition. They do this because if they dont...  well their competition is free.  They have to be more involved by sheer necessity.gtThat means the tax money that you and I pay would go to places where a CEO who intends to make a profit will be able to determine where the funds go.These CEOs make their money by competing with free competition.  If they do a better job thab public schools then by all means they can take my tax dollars.  If they dont then no one will go to their schools and they get no compensation for vouchers.That is the power of choice.  That is the power of competition.gtBut these are private schools including religious schools that would now be funded by our tax dollars.It also includes schools that have zero religious teaching compared to the partial religious teaching taught in public schools.If a parent wants to send their kids to a religious school thats their choice.  Meanwhile Ill have a choice to not send my kids to said schools.  If my kids education is better than the kid whk went tk the religious that schools they will get better jobs.Seriously.  This is exactly what colleges have been doing since their inception.gtBeing openminded or even accepting the fact that public schools work is nowhere in thereI can not stress this enough.  This is a good thing in my opinion.,SanDiegan,ddtq94z,1,t5_3f157
