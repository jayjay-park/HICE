332311,0,t3_1xgqig,I had a Prince difficulty game on the ring map where the only conflict I had was one I escalated myself.  Russia and I were the only civs that had any real power.  I was peaceful throughout the game and was going for a culture win while Russia opted for Science.  It came down to Russia being the only civ I had not completely influenced and they had  of  pieces built.  I opted to sneak attack their capital so I could hamper their resistance to my tourism and be sure that I would succeed in influencing them before they completed their shuttle.  Were it not for that I suspect I may still have won without conflict but I didnt want to take the chance.,civ5,cff7qjf,2,t5_2s48d

2138464,0,t3_2jawio,Ive had good luck with this strategy. There is a bit of an art to it but the idea is to build  big cities with the tradition tree while focusing on science.  Ideally you want to get your nd and rd cities around turn  so that you can have the national college by .  Its a little hard to do but if I can have nc finished by  I usually do pretty well.  After that work towards public schools and eventually research labs.  Once I enter renaissance I start saving all great scientists until  turns after completing my last research lab and then bulb it all at once on your way to hubble.  The art is to stay focused on your science goals while picking up necessities such as your luxury techs and defensive military tech while you get science up.  ,civ5,clbn9l3,1,t5_2s48d

2243091,0,t3_2kuua1,Given that youre building zoos... have other civs in the game adopted ideologies?If so... and if your influence over them is low... and if your ideology is different then you can take some huge happiness penalties.I play tall with cultural victories with Freedom ideology. Happiness is usually only a problem in the early game of course its critical there and have hit numbers around  happiness in the endgame.Religious buildings are a great help keeping things positive early. Of course youre balancing them off against other tenets.Make sure you dont trade away all your luxes. The basic interface is really confusing about it. What usually happens is you set up an agreement with Civ A. It expires. Civ B says Id like to trade for this. You go ok and then in the same turn Civ A says I want to renew this agreement. Oops there went your last lux.  happiness.Not sure what level youre playing at but some key wonders are Forbidden Palace Notre Dame and Eiffel Tower. Taj Mahal is a stopgap. The AI loooooves Notre Dame so its hard to get unless you beeline. But Forbidden Palace and Taj Mahal arent hard for me to get on . And as for Eiffel Tower generally by the Modern Era Im outteching the opponents.Freedoms half unhappiness from specialists is great.I do like to play games with amazing startsrcivsaves. turns for a zoo sounds long... you might have some production issues with your settles. You mentioned tropical paradise. Yah jungles  Basically with jungles youre working them for a good science boost and youll try to get an economy going so that you can just buy your critical buildings there. Building things in jungles and improving tiles there is just pain. I reroll jungle startsIve never been able to catch up except with Brazil.EDIT Yah per uplayboywillis Circus Maximus is a great national wonder... youll have to build colisseums in each city with is a fair amount of maintenance. Circuses are great for cities with horses. No maintenance. Save that gold to win over mercantile city states.Also explore. Uncovering natural wonders keeps your happiness afloat and exposes more city states. Discovering city states causes a snowball effect. Youll inadvertently complete a CS quest which gives you a lux which other cities quested you for which gets you influence with them... etc.,civ5,cloy7c0,2,t5_2s48d

3292521,0,t3_2xfvgi,One thought...dont bother building warriors to combat barbarians. Maybe one extra if you have barbs raging all over. I usually build a few Archers instead because the can hit from range are more likely to live and are more useful down the road as they upgrade to Comp Bows and and Crossbows. Warriors upgrading to Swordsmen and Longswordsmen are hardly worth it.I build Wonders all the time usually without marble. But yes the AI will often get them before you on higher difficulties. It depends which ones you prioritize.As for everyone turning on you thats expected. The AI plays against you and at some point if they think youre even remotely close to winning they will turn on you. I played a game yesterday as Inca and Japan forwardsettled me with TWO cities on either side of my Cap both exactly FOUR tiles away from my Cap. Seriously? So I built up a small army with about  Chariots and a couple Pikemen and a few Comp Bows and wiped him off the map...I razed those two cities first and then I upgraded to Crossbows and took his Cap and razed his other city he had just north of me.

3576260,0,t1_cpzvgfz,There is a very justifiable reason and Ive explained it already. If it wasnt for this penalty you could just spawn cities continuously and win because of that. It was possible in Civ III and that made any other strategy less viable. It was easy in Civ IV and that made tall empires harder to make. Its penalized in Civ V and you have the choice to either play with many cities with the challenge being in finding the right time and plan to make it worth it or you can play tall and have the challenge of managing to compete with empires that decided to go wide instead. Blaming it on the game is a very common strategy when one is not willing to find the real reasons behind things.There was once a player posting in rciv with a screenshot of him obtaining the  happiness achievement with a screenshot of an empire that spanned the entire Earth map in what was either a large or huge world size and he still had positive gold in the thousands. I myself have played and won games when playing wide at Immortal difficulty and many others have. It seems obvious to me that its not the game having a problem but you.Moreover you havent mentioned anything specific in your whole rant across the entire discussion you just keep mentioning nebulous penalties while refusing to even consider why theyre there as if the developers put them into the game just to piss you off out of all the players most of which arent having problems. More than ResonantOne Id describe you more as RedundantOne.,civ5,cpzx60f,6,t5_2s48d

Here are a couple of points to help ease yourself in all just opinions base on my VERY limited experience DONT feel like you have to kill everyone you run into. DONT worry about micromanaging where your citizens work at least not at first. DONT ignore the bonuses that can be had from giving money to city states. Theyre not all great in every case. Find ones that work for what you want to do. DONT be in a rush lol. DO realize there are multiple paths to victory. DO realize that you can in fact save the game and walk away. DO save the game and walk away. Thats the hardest part of the game right there.It is so easy to get sucked in to this game once you get a feel for it. Im too embarrassed to post the number of hours Ive put into it over the last three days. Im even more embarrassed to think about how many hours Ill probably pour into it this weekend. I did manage a Science victory yesterday so that was cool I didnt trade much with the other civilizations early on. I suggest you experiment with it. You can get some good deals!

It might help you learn the game without the pressure of actually winning.,civ5,ddfguvt,8,t5_2s48d

10831152,0,t1_ddrnai2,The issue with that is that most civs arent able to deal out multiple intercontinental sieges and have the happiness to keep them all puppetedannexed remember theres no razing citystates.  You have to keep them and take the happiness penalty.  And dont forget that while youre doing that youre likely neglecting your science tourism andor culture while you try to remove a couple citystates.More effective than sieging the citystates would be sieging Alexander the Dick himself.  Wipe him out of the game and he cant win the world congress.  Or just cripple him early so he wont have the funds to keep his alliances with his citystates.,civ5,ddx5nyv,1,t5_2s48d

11242132,0,t3_60gj9x,When you buy land there are no special rules over how you use that tile. You can only buy tiles out to a certain distance. No other civ can take those tiles away unless they capture your city or place down a citadel which will take that  tile and all surrounding tiles.As for religion since it is their capital it is likely the holy city for that religion. Because of this the city naturally has a very high rate of religious influence particularly if all of the religious buildings have been built. Additionally their neighboring cities have religious influence as well both due to their proximity and any internal trade routes they have.,civ5,df6a25i,3,t5_2s48d
11404345,0,t1_df7wmba,I dont understand what you dont get about the buying land part. Like  people have told you the answer. Once you have a tile within your borders another Civ cannot take that tile except with  exceptions. . They can use a great general to create a citadel. This citadel will claim all unowned tiles that are adjacent to it. . If they take your city through conquest   ,civ5,dfoo27u,2,t5_2s48d

11429324,0,t3_63363o,If you are running Freedom short games will hurt your chances at a diplomatic victory since you have fewer turns to build up citystate influence with the third tier ability.,civ5,dfri2j4,1,t5_2s48d

11760522,0,t1_dgsgwim,Correct me if Im wrong it looks like you went to war with attilla took over a city state on the west end of his continent and a city from him on the south side liberated India above your southernmost city and then liberated the celts above them and the celts have  city but a shit ton of land because of attilla usinf great generals?  Oh and attilla seems to have razed the  Moroccan cities on the northernmost end of his continent as well as the morrocan island city next to the easternmost morrocan city on what I am dubbing Attiland. He also probably nuked the shit out of amerixa because America lost its westernmost city.,civ5,dgt32c7,6,t5_2s48d

11802971,0,t1_dgxwhrk,I guess the best thing to do is to play a tutorial match or two preferably where she can have some fun besides empire building like destroying the other civ in the game and answer her questions when she has some and then let her watch some videos once she learned the most basic things.Its also really fun to play a coop game where you are in the same team but everyone has their own civ and together you take over the lowlevel ai civs or something.,civ5,dgxwoud,1,t5_2s48d
