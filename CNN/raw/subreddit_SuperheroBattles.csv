56249,0,t1_cektv0o,Green Arrow is somewhat like Batman with a bow and is willing to kill as well. I think there was a quote by him which basically said he was a hunter first hero second. Hed go the lengths to keep himself alive and finish his enemy. ,SuperheroBattles,ceku18b,1,t5_2y23y
171937,0,t3_1myty9,So many hellboy fans. Thor regularly fights Mephisto and Hela basically Marvels equivalent of the Devil. You think hell have a problem with a demon? Thor is a warrior God anywhere from a couple thousand to a couple million years old. He whipes the floor with the boy. Hes stood up to Celestials and actually hurt Galactus with his hammer. Fuck outta here with your demon detective.,SuperheroBattles,cey0ldh,1,t5_2y23y
283141,0,t1_cf9wlub,Well Batman did interfere. And Darkseid hadnt even used Omega beams. I think its safe to say in a brawl possibly Superman would win.,SuperheroBattles,cfa40xs,2,t5_2y23y
529880,0,t1_cg0huvz,Venom is fast and cunning. Even though GL Im going by Hal Jordan just for reference knows how to fight a creature like this will he do it fast enough or will Venom strike a blow even faster? My money is on GL too but Venom does have a chance.,SuperheroBattles,cg0i62v,1,t5_2y23y
