265604,0,t1_cf8afrx,ampampamp Redskin slang gtgtRedskin is a racial descriptor of disputed origin for Native Americans Although by some accounts not originally having negative intent the term is defined in current dictionaries of American English as usually offensive disparaging insulting taboo  and is avoided in public usage with the exception of its continued use as a name for sports teams.gtThe term derives from the use of red as a color metaphor for race following European colonization of the Western Hemisphere although initial explorers and later AngloAmericans termed Native Americans lightskinned brown tawny or russet. According to historian Alden T. Vaughan Not until the middle of the eighteenth century did most AngloAmericans view Indians as significantly different in color from themselves and not until the nineteenth century did red become the universally accepted color label for American Indians. Slang identifiers for ethnic groups based upon physical characteristics including skin color are almost universally slurs or derogatory emphasizing the difference between the speaker and the target.gtgtImage iInteresting Native American mascot controversy | Redskin subculture uWhyYouThinkThat can reply with delete.
