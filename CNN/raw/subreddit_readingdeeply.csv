3478942,0,t3_2z9aru,so some serious changes have happened in the history of the Arab people the leadership system has changed weve gone from caliphs chosen by the people with a role that is mostly religious jurisprudence and  guide to a new kind of hereditary caliphae with a much more secular dynastic and empirial role. the changes happened after the Umayyads took power and started a hereditary process of caliphship.  meanwhile the empire of the muslims expanded into the atlantic coast of morroco and northeast india and the caliph started emulating the neighboring emperors in terms of his role and his interactions with his neighbors. the other major shift was geographical from the arabs homelands into the more densly populated fertile crescent .There was some move by the Ummayads to keep cities run by locals locals loyal to them but locals nonetheless rather than sending family members or tribal memebers or even arabs to run forign cities.  This transition from being an Arab only religion also expanded the religion and the empire by allowing locals greeks persians pahlavi etc to continue to remain in power in their local lands.  There was a transition from various local languages to Arabic as the main language of government and many government officials became muslims as well. but for the most part day to day reality didnt change much for the populace.  The New arab government kept up agricultural and civic structures like roads baths and irrigation systems.In this way the new arab rulers were similar to barbarian chiefs taking over roman lands. but while the barbarian chiefs usually became christian the force of Islamic monotheism a unifying Arab language with a formal and developed script and cultural history that they retained.   This unifying culture and historic and religious ties brought with it an identifiable and empirewide currency a unifying empire wide bureaucratic language and a movement to build monumental buildings as placed of community and communal prayers and public buildings and business.The muslim rulers were fascinated by religious buildings of the Jews and Christians and build similar structures for their own community The caliphs visited Jerusalem as soon as it was captured and Muawiya was proclaimed caliph in jerusalem.  In  they build the dome of the rock in Jerusalem at the site of the old Jewish temple and inside inscribed it with Islamic sayings.  this was a clear departure and differentiation of Islam from Christianity and Judaism with inscriptions calling Christians to Islam and calling on muslims to recognize Jesus as apostle but not son of god.  A similar archiectural style spread accross the empire as great mosques where build from Spain to medina.  As the empire spread we still havent gone  years since the initial birth of islam he people under the new rulers began accepting Islam.  At first most Arab groups in other empires joined the new rulers religion  with an exception being noted of the arabs of a tribe called ghassan and beaurocrats and city officials began accepting the religion of their superiors The deafeated empires soldiers accepted the new religion and the Zoroastarians who had previously had their religion as a state supported system by the Sassanians didnt have an independant enough church to survive wihtout the support of their religious leaders who did not funciton without the support of the Sassanian emperors.The sassanian empire became weak and the zorastareans largely became muslim without their own religion having a firm foundation to survive independantly.  The Christians in the East did not have a seperate problem as their churches had already gotten used to functioning as independant from their own rulers and from the main roman church.  Some things that made the conversion of ruled peoples easier was the simple theology of islam and the simple process of conversion which only required he saying of a few words rather than an elaborate ritual.  As arab merchants governors rulers soldiers and land owners spread day to day use of Arabic as a language became more prevalent and this also facilitated conversion.  But especially during the Umayyad years the vast majority of civilians under the Arab rule were neither arab nor muslim.  The Arab empire was still seated in Syria but Syria was weaker than its surrounding lands especially those from the Sassanian empire in the east.  Byzantium was still frequently at was with the Arab nation and this caused the eastern more peaceful cities to become more powerful within the empire itself. The persians who immigrated or who had already lived in those regions became prosperous and powerful in their own rights. Arabs who moved into the new frontiers of the empire found a Persian ruling class they functioned well together as arabs became drawn to Iranian society and Iranians continued to be the ruling people in those cities.    The Iranians resented the new arrivals especially those who came with power from the rulers in distant syria The tribal aspect of the empire became more signifiant as more arabs moved east. Here issues of rulership came to a head once again.  One group started to claim no one  deserves precedence in Islam except by virtue meaning arab tribal leaders have no right to rule over non arabs.  Only virtuous Muslims should lead muslims.  They went back to when Ali agreed to compromise with the other claimant for Caliphate that this made Ali the more virtuous and pious of the two.  So the ruling family was not fit to rule.  There was a second group against the current caliphate who claimed that only the prophets family was fit to rule.  and his descendants should be the ruling imams of the muslim world.  Again Ali was the closer in terms of descent than the Umayyads. Alis son Husayn moved to Karbala in Iraq to seek support for his own rulership but he died in a fight in iraq. This lead his supporters to resent the caliphate even more Husayn became a martyr and the Shiat Ali particians of Ali or ShiiShia where born as a movement.The Umayyad family managed to hold power despite signifiacnt resentment and revolts until   when a combination of opposition caused their power to collapse.  he movements in the east were supported by Arabs and Iranian groups who had assimilated into one anothers cultures.  those in the east rose against the Ummayad and a series of battles broke out until the last Ummayad caliph was pursued and killed in Egypt  At this point Abdul Abbas a decendant of an uncle of the prophet rather than a decendant of ali claimed the title of caliph. The caliphate shifted from syria to Iraq. the power of this caliphate rested in Persian and the lands of the old Sassanid empire. This left a power vaccuum in Morrocco as it was too far to be effectively administered from Iraq.Baghdad became the capital a land irrigated by major rivers and canals it lay along strategic routes into Iran and had fertile land that could support a large population.  The caliphate became opulent the palaces were build along Sassanid style with the kind being seperate from his people unlike the previous Caliphs.  Elaborate court rituals and extreme splendor was a new addition to the Arab ruler culture.   Taxation and levies on imports and citizens inlcuding a Jizya tax on wealth of nonmuslims graded on a progressive system of increased taxes on wealthier individuals. this was another break from the early caliphs who survived and ran the state on voluntary contributions. The Caliph had difficulty maintaining the loyalty of his army and at the death of Harun his two sons fought a war in which in which the elder was defeated  Seeing the difficulty in maintaining the loyalty of his solders the new caliph brought in mercenary armies from Turkish speaking people.  the army had no loyalty to tribes or other rulers othr than the caliph and this started a tradition that gave a distinct shape to the political world of the muslims and the arabic empire.  ,readingdeeply,cpotpk9,1,t5_37f7w
