975810,0,t3_259gw8,Do it! I was afraid at first. I talked it over with my boyfriend whos not black and explained the process. He told me there is nothing I could do to make myself not beautiful so the next day I went for the big chop. I didnt do braids and weave because I havent ever really been a fan but it does work wonders for keeping your hair low maintenance. I wanted to learn my hairs likes and dislikes as I got reacquainted with my natural hair. Its been over a year and I regret nothing. Ive gotten more compliments on my hair now than Ive ever had with relaxed hair. Its gonna be hard. Some days you will hate it but keep going! The end results are worth the issues. ,blackgirls,chf7imx,6,t5_2snvh
