Her body had been dismembered and left in plastic bags that were found on two occasions  July and  August one kilometer apart.

2533505,0,t3_2opddm,infoMiss Hales murder  which took place in front of her monthold daughter Emily  shocked and repulsed the town in equal measure.The fact that noone was ever brought to justice only serves to deepen the pain felt by her parents Graham and Geraldine Emily and Miss Hales sisters Angela and Jacqui.This despite a huge manhunt by police an ongoing open investigation national television appeals rewards and heartwrenching pleas from her family.Although they recognise their hopes are slim Miss Hales relatives continue to seek a breakthrough in the case.Her mother Geraldine said We have lived with the torment of Karens murder for  years.We still feel the terrible loss of Karen and want answers.If anyone has information no matter how small or seemingly insignificant which could help find who killed Karen we would ask them to get in touch with police.Suffolk detectives have also asked people who might have crucial information to search their consciences.Advances in technology linked to the increasing number of historic murders which are now being solved years later give them encouragement.Detective Chief Inspector Andy Smith from the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team said Despite the fact that  years have now passed since Karen Hales was brutally murdered I would stress that we will not give up trying to find her killer.Periodically we review our unsolved cases to see if new information or advances in technology and forensic science can provide opportunities to progress these investigations.We were encouraged by the fact that we received  calls in response to the year anniversary appeal last year.Some of the information received was similar to calls made previously but we also received fresh information which has involved our utilising our resources to actively pursue lines of enquiry.We are keeping Karens family informed of our progress as we go forward and continue to appeal to anyone who has information to make contact with us.Someone close to Karens killer a friend or relative must have noticed a change in their behaviour after the event.This is a sickening crime not least because it was committed in the presence of Karens monthold daughter.If you have any information that for whatever reason you have not provided previously please make contact with us. We need the publics help to solve this crime and to try to bring closure for Karens familyIf you can help the inquiry telephone the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major investigation Team on  or Crimestoppers anonymously on  .,UnsolvedMurders,cmp9ke8,2,t5_2x1lf

5051511,0,t3_3k5b32,Seven years after Louis Buonacores body was found bludgeoned to death in the park his family is still searching for answers in the unsolved case.Its very sad Buonacores mother told the Advance Tuesday. You make yourself not think about it but its so hard.While police say the investigation is ongoing the victims sisters Mary Renny and Donna Buonacore say they are hoping the lead detective in the case focuses more resources on the investigation.Renny says she calls the detective twice a year on her brothers birthday and the date of his passing to see if there have been any new developments but says her calls have been fruitless.I dont feel like theyre working on it Renny said. It makes us feel like nobody cares.Then this past December she says the officer  called and informed the family that they had a suspect but they could not talk to this particular person until they had a reason to.The new information they say only frustrated the family more.I dont understand why they cant just go talk to this person Renny said. Hes not doing anything. He doesnt care.On July   the yearold auto mechanic from Florida was fatally struck with a tree branch as he was resting near a path in the park not far from the wroughtiron fence that separates it from Victory Boulevard.His body was found at about  p.m. and police believe someone attacked him between  and  p.m. Sources said at the time that he had been struck hard with a massive tree branch and the assailant hit him again after the killing blow.Investigators believe Buonacore had been at the park since  p.m. that day. His sister Donna said he had dropped by for an unexpected visit  he called her on her cell phone at  p.m.She told him she wouldnt be home until  p.m. and asked him to call back later when shed be able to talkHe had stopped by on his way to New Jersey to see his children that day the family said.Hes missed a lot Ms. Buonacore said. It was a tragedy. Theres been an uneasiness that never goes away.The family feels the investigation was not handled adequately from the onset. They say the police failed to do a series of things that couldve potentially solved the case.,UnsolvedMurders,cuuwcwr,1,t5_2x1lf

7164382,0,t3_4dkbxb,Is Esperanza perhaps trying to insert herself into the story to use as leverage against another crime?  Maybe she is trying to become a CI in order to get out of something else that she did.  Hey I helped this family out so be lenient with me.  Removed Facebook link as it wasnt her.Have faith in your police.  From the press I see online it sure looks like they are doing everything that they can.  If shes taunting them using Facebook and doesnt have the support of her mother then it wont be long until she has to surface.  Keep us posted please! ,UnsolvedMurders,d1sisko,2,t5_2x1lf

11401559,0,t1_df4skr0,My moms bipolar and Ive never seen her behave even close to like this while manic. Not all bipolar people are they same and she stated on her blog she can do impulsive things like telling a guy I just met I like him which really isnt that impulsive or unusual and her family has denied her being bipolar. I feel like her bipolar wasnt so severe it would cause an episode like this. ,UnsolvedMurders,dfocp9l,3,t5_2x1lf
