4833819,0,t3_3h354y,Ive lived along Connecticut between DuPont and Woodley Park The Kalorama Area and loved it.  Its a  minute walk to either the Woodley or DuPont Metro and  minute walk to Adams Morgan restaurants.  The building are a little nicer and the streets much quieter just that  minute walk away though.  And if you have a car the parking is relatively easy with all the Embassies around. ,RockvilleMD,cu3ubfn,1,t5_2vohf
