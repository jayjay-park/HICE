The phone doesnt multitask anymore.examplesBrowsing facebook click a link come back to facebook its loading for the first time.orBrowsing the web switch to mp player to change the track switch back the page is loading for the first time.orRadio players will just randomly quit where its freeing up memory for something  else.Also Go Launcher often reloads as well all problems i didnt have before .. and the same problems a friend with a Z had until he just got ..  all is well for him now so its obviously fixed now probably be ages for ZC owners though.  Doesnt sound much but its very irritating with daily use.Oh and Lollipop damaged my battery the charge capicity dropped loads and it would go from  to  and turn off.  I had to send the phone to sony to be fixed to sort that one out.,Z1Compact,cu865ir,1,t5_2zqte
