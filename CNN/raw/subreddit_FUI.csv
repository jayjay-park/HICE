1066730,0,t1_chph582,Im kinda old school so I use photoshop mostly but I try and use Illustrator for icons and dials and such things. I use AE to animate and CD for D. When making graphics for production we use Director because we make the screen interactive in the most basic sense of the word.. i.e. speed upslow down.. drag elements around turn things onoff. I think most people use Flash for that now but like I said before Im old school. The time it takes to make a screen kind of depends on when its being made. The first one is always the longest then it takes less time the more the screens you make for a set. For something like Captain America Id usually spend a day designing and then another day animating and putting it into Director... of course that all depends on what the screen is. Sometimes its a long sequence and has very specific beats to cover in a screen in which case it can take way longer. It also depends on the client sometimes they just let you go at it and it takes less time.. sometime they wanna see stuff all along the process so it takes longer.Whoa! long reply. I got a roll there!,FUI,chpjiir,2,t5_2tzrc
