1578431,0,t3_2bau6g,Aberdeen isnt the cheapest due to the oil here we have to pay a bit more cry. I live with three other students in a semidetached house which costs around  a month more if we use more heating. For where Im living with a room the size I have its actually extremely reasonable but I have friends who werent so lucky and live in heatless flats which cost a fortune. It kind of depends.I would say Aberdeen is more of a mix between urban and rural the city is small at least compared to Glasgow where Im from but you pretty much have everything you need. Its not exactly urban in its inhabitants anyway coming from the big city where people from all walks of life congregate I noticed a massive difference when I moved here  particularly since Im a makeup artist on the side and have to sport some pretty extreme makeup when Im working  people can be quite judgemental.  But I dont care Ive built up a thick skin none of my more conventional friends have had any sort of issue with this.  Also I wouldnt feel right without mentioning some of the men here are absolute pervs. Seriously if youre a girl youll need to stay on your toes! I have no clue about the computer science classes but we do have excellent facilities. Since Im doing a more scientific degree I spend a lot of time in the computer labs we have great tech support. RGU also have great facilities in the name of full disclosure shakes fistThere is a theatre society. Since Im about as good at acting as the laptop Im typing on I really cant comment on that. I have a friend in Centre Stage the main drama one and he adores it they have members from outside the uni too so it must be good. While were talking about societies it might be relevant to mention InterSoc  the international student society. I was treasurer last year and the society is absolutely huge and organises events for students from everywhere including balls and trips around Scotland. Although Im Scottish my flatmate is Finnish and its through her that I joined. I know its a real comfort to many of the students to have such an active society like that and the ones in Glasgow and Dundee are not nearly as good. Theres a wifi service called The Cloud that operates at the uni in addition to Resnet at the halls and Eduroam everywhere else and around the main shopping centres in Aberdeen. Its free and very fast its brilliant! The nightlife is actually pretty brilliant. Taxis are cheaper here than in Glasgow and Edinburgh not sure about Dundee and thats something youll really appreciate come the end of the month. The great size of the city means that its not small enough that you wont be stuck for places to go and things to do but will still quickly get to know people just from being out all the time which is pretty amazing.  There are some really nice pubs bars and coffee shops if youre not into going out as such.On the uni side of things the university is fantastic. I have friends at Strathclyde Glasgow Dundee and Edinburgh who have told me stories of unfair marking being locked out of their courses and general admin horrors looking at you Glasgow and Strathclyde!.  The lecturers are brilliant and student feedback is encouraged. Its extremely easy to switch courses and contact your tutors who are helpful and really know their subjects.  The online portal is extremely user friendly I actually havent seen one as good from any of the other unis.  Unlike Stratchclyde everything is located on the same campus which makes it so easy to get between classes and its a short walk from town so thats brilliant too. Its a beautiful old uni with an impressive history.  The university is also extremely understanding about missed deadlines due to medical reasons far more than G amp S for example I know I keep bringing them up but my two best friends go there so I have heard all the horror stories!.  I honestly dont think I could have pulled through my first year if I didnt have the level of support offered at AU.Hope this helps Ive tried to keep it as honest as possible. Also to the person who said the climate in Glasgow is better ARE YOU ACTUALLY HIGH? Coming from Glasgow to Aberdeen is a big change from me its a bit colder but there is basically more rain. If you want to smell like a wet dog for four years then of course go to Glasgow. I literally hate being home and having to take an umbrella everywhere. ,UniversityOfAberdeen,cje4ufo,1,t5_2tim4
