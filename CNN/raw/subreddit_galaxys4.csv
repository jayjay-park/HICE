333685,0,t3_1xws09,I second this. First it was my friend who repaired mine so I have a bit of insight into the process. Basically the glass on top usually what cracks is glued to the actual screen. What you can do if you have the tools is heat the top glass peel it off and put a new one on and glue it back. The problem is that when you glue it back its VERY hard to get it to reseal perfectly so it looks and works like shit. The middle of my screen was sealed but only about a inch diameter in the middle. The rest of it had seperated. Id very highly recommend taking it to samsung or ATampT or whoever. The glass itself costs around  dollars. Thats what my friend made me pay. If you replace the whole screen the parts cost around  or  or thats what my friend was paying. Id say go to a local repair shop explain this to them ask them if they can repair it like new and if they will pay for a full replacement if it doesnt turn out right. If not then just go to samsung. It sucks but you really get what you pay for. Also consider if you still want the s. The Moto G is  for a  gig and the Moto X is on sale for . and the Nexus  is . Honestly I cracked my screen again and Im debating between a Moto X and a Moto G. And on the Moto X they will replace the phone up to  times for any accidental damage for free and the Moto G has a back shell that you can buy that has a rubber band around it and they also are a lot more resillient than the s. Ive watched drop tests on all three and the s is a joke compared to almost any other phone.,galaxys4,cffcuwc,1,t5_2u4bh

873665,0,t3_243oi0,With Tmobile you can install custom recoveries and ROMs quite easily. There are tools and files on XDA Forums that you can use to do this.However doing this voids your KNOX security and Samsung warranty.Which as per your info youve already done. You just need to use the proper files to get past that Warranty Void screen you know its voided just let me continue on my way.You might have changed your partitions or groups on your storage memory where files are separated into protected system files and modifiable user files when you installed recovery or tried to install a ROM.Thats why ODIN failed. You need a full stock OS package and a PIT file. Download them and check F. Reset Time Autoreboot Repartition and NAND Erase on ODIN. This will completely wipe all files and remake the partitions the way they are supposed to be.Then go on XDA on the S Tmobile section and get your recovery root and ROMs.,galaxys4,ch3l8jy,1,t5_2u4bh

I didnt use any of Samsungs preinstalled apps and I couldnt uninstall them without rooting. I never thought I would buy a phablet but its comfortable to hold even in my average girl hands and isnt too big to look weird when I place calls. Im downloading apps left and right and I still have so much space available. My download speeds are faster as well. I owned the Nexus   and upgraded to the Nexus .  Ive loved both and the  isnt a disappointment by any means. Oddly enough my favorite feature so far is the indent on the back of the phone.

The best option that you have is to run a battery monitor for maybe up to a week to help you discern what the issue is. If Bluetooth is taking up a high percentage of battery that its definitely something close to my example youd most likely be unable to discern what the real issue is though.
