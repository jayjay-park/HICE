627899,0,t1_cgbimxq,Catalyst is as good as youre going to get for Punk Rock shows unless you want to drive to SF. Every once in a while there is something going on in Salinas but within the last  years Punk rock got put on hiatus and the metal scene has taken over there IMO. East Village is probably your closest and best bet. Like previously mentioned there is no music scene here anymore.  years ago you could go downtown Alvarado Street and see Mohawks but no mo.Check out the facebook page WE are the  MetalCorePunk scene. Although its mostly geared towards the hardcorekids,MontereyBay,cgbn5xd,2,t5_2s9f6
635397,0,t1_cgccnq6,I think the issue is a lot of these folks are lifers to the peninsula and basically anything outside of a bigcity scene is too small  nonexistent to them I think. But Im from a SMALL town  Im talking maybe  local bands tops?  so Monterey isnt as bad as people seem to think. Its not SF obviously but there is a scene here for sure.You can literally go to a local artist show every Friday and Saturday in Monterey cover bands every day of the week and if youre really paying attention your trouble is going to be which show you should go to.,MontereyBay,cgchtxy,2,t5_2s9f6

1307520,0,t3_29278t,I work right next to the airport.  I can see planes taxi from my office window.   of the traffic is prop planes and personal jet planes.  There is not a lot of big commercial traffic.  I usually dont even notice unless I am outside.  This might be more a function of the construction of the building then the proximity of the air port.I do believe the runway runs westish so the planes will be taking off going away from you.  I would be willing to bet that Monterey proper will hear more planes than you will.,MontereyBay,cigpnt6,8,t5_2s9f6

1755833,0,t3_2ekiad,You can walk around the Fishermans Wharf area or around the Aquarium which is probably more popular.  Carmel is also a nice town to stop in.  There is a nice beach at the end of the town. You should also stop and take pictures of the waterfall in Big Sur at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park.  Its right on HWY  and wont take too long.  Ventura to SF drive though will take  hrs if you go all the way along .  Monterey area is great place for a longer stay maybe  full days to enjoy it more.  SF of course could be a week or longer vacation to see it all. ,MontereyBay,ck0hb3t,2,t5_2s9f6

9525450,0,t3_5bbfpj,Thanks for the heads up.I swear Im not trying to start a fight but why are you against it? I know nothing is this just a zoning thing or is there some consideration of using public money to support a private enterprise that will make some company lots of money and cater to just a few of the public? If so fuck em.The City of Santa Clara is having major second thoughts after the concessions they gave to the FortyNiners football team to build Levis stadium. They are fighting with the team to complete commits like restoring the local soccer fields after destroying them for the superbowl.The niners suck as a football team but guess which team is the second most profitable in the league off the backs of the public that subsidized their new stadium?Government has no business in sports. If a monopoly like the NFL NBA MLB cant make money from a stadium via private financing why should taxpayers carry the burden?,MontereyBay,d9n7oq9,3,t5_2s9f6
