3921189,0,t3_358myw,Just get as far away as possible. This city blows. Super depressing and overall poor class structure in my opinion. Bad vibes all around. Im getting out as soon as I can. There are some great hiking spots though,Utica,cr392nh,0,t5_2sjdr
6067660,0,t1_cyan7w8,gt Im guessing Scurve isnt a bad person but hes probably the most absentee mod Ive seen on Reddit.Then you dont get around much. Over in rUSMC we went like a year without hearing from Khrist when he was the only mod and the sub ran fine  and thats a pretty active sub with over k subscribers. Subreddits dont NEED much moderation  thats what the upvote and downvote arrows are for. Im confused about what you think uScurve is supposed to be doing? As far as starting your own sub GO NUTS! Thats whats great about Reddit. ,Utica,cyeyldh,1,t5_2sjdr
