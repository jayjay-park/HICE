6448907,0,t3_43wnsl,I dont really have a game I go back to since there are still a lot of SMS games that I havent gotten to play still havent played Phantasy Star or the Wonder Boy series and I honestly dont seem to have a lot of spare gaming time nowadays...so if I play something I try to find something I never played before and try it out right now Im playing Power Strike II off and on.However the games I probably nostalgia over and have replayed the most are Double Dragon and Miracle Warriors.  Double Dragon was great fun with friends when I was growing up and being a huge RPG nerd I loved Miracle Warriors which was the only RPG I had for the system at the time.,SMSGG,czmcve5,1,t5_2s7x1
