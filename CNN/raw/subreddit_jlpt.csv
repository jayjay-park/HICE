I wasnt able to find score distributions by section they available for each level of the test in terms of total score however but I did find averages and standard deviations from the July test  and .  Based on all of this and assuming there is nothing about the current test that is an outlier Id guess that your language knowledge score of  places you somewhere around the th percentile range.  Wherever you fell on that distribution happens to be at a point where raw scores exceeded .As an aside your overall score places you at around the th percentile among all test takers.  Your listening brought you way up! ,jlpt,ddeetuc,1,t5_2s1e4
