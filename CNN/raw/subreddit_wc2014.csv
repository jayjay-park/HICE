Reading Portuguese such as on menus or reading directions or something along those lines shouldnt be an issue assuming you can read well in Spanish. As for speaking if both parties speak slowly it shouldnt be too bad. You might not understand  but you should be able to understand most of what theyre saying and get the gist of it. ,wc2014,cfxop09,2,t5_2smvu

584272,0,t3_20tktm,At least in the US the various Brazilian consulates have wildly different requirements for this so your best bet would be to call your consulate directly and ask them. For example in the US the Washington DC Brazilian consulate requires proof of purchase of flights in addition to ticket confirmation difficult for those of us on a charter the Los Angeles consulate accepted the online ticket confirmation page the Atlanta consulate wants a printout of the email and the Miami consulate will only accept the actual physical tickets. ,wc2014,cg6opf9,3,t5_2smvu

1078055,0,t1_chq2mk2,Its really hard to give you specific examples because price disparity in Brazil is huge and finding something expensive is relative. Example for a chilled fresh coconut Im talking the actual fruit with a straw stuck into it you can pay anywhere from R to R sometimes in neighbouring beaches. A bottle of beer can cost R to R.For the beer example youre paying between US and US for a bottle of beer. Is that expensive for Americans Canadians Europeans? Probably not but it is expensive relatively speaking to the prices in Brazilian grocery stores and what Brazilians are used to.,wc2014,chqttpm,2,t5_2smvu
1140490,0,t1_chxw3uc,I would assume that it is almost definite that you will get put into a queue. The only thing that could help the situation is if they spread the release of tickets but they havent claimed that they will do this. Though keep in mind that  divided by  is only  per game. There are games that will have more tickets than others. Hence you dont want to leave it too late.,wc2014,chxwzfc,1,t5_2smvu
