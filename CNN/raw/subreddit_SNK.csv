8554085,0,t1_d6akkat,So could that mean that SNK is being honest about making new games for those franchises barring KOF? I hope so. And personally I see the MS series status as more like on life support.,SNK,d6au2dv,1,t5_2xeuv

11750457,0,t1_dgqdyq8,Iirc SNK had Tonko do some art for the big Japanese Last Blade MOTW tournament last year. So they definitely seem to be on good terms.As for Shinkiro the problem with him is that he is actually a Capcom employee and has been one for years now. Doubt they would want him associating with SNK.,SNK,dgrxzib,2,t5_2xeuv
