Ive been trying to use up The Body Shop hemp hand protector GWP item I love the way it feels on my hands but hate the smell. I cant imagine repurchasing it due to the insane earthy musky choking smell. Using Alchimia Apothecary Dangerous Dream peachy fruity smell helps compensate but doesnt cover it up entirely.

8558110,0,t3_4wy1su,Hey my friend asked me to breakdown the differences between topbox and ipsy for her. Heres a copy of what I sent her...sorry if its too much textPrice Ipsy is  a month but charges an extra  for Canadian shipping it is charged in USD resulting in a total monthly cost of about CAD a month depending on how strong the Canadian dollar is.  Topbox is  a month plus applicable taxes there is no shipping charge and no extra fees.  Customization Ipsy is great in this sense. They have a relatively indepth survey for you to take that determines what type of samples are best suited for your interests. If you arent loving your productsyou can edit your survey to try to get different ones in the future...however I have heard some people say that they still receive a lot of the items they have mentioned they do not like. Topbox  does not let you customize your box. Samples Topbox provides you with  samples a month in a cardboard tube or organza bag while Ipsy sends  samples that come in a reusable makeup bag. I have received amazing products from both boxes and kind of shit products from both boxes. Lately Ive been getting awesome stuff from topbox a lot of big brand names.Bonus Perks both boxes offer coupons and promo codes for featured brands. every month for ipsy you can review the products you received and earn points there are other ways to earn points such as through social media and recruiting friends. these points can be cashed in for products. Topbox doesnt have a point system.Customer Service Havnt had much personal experience here but a few months back under the threat of a Canada Post strike Topbox decided to include an extra bonus full sized item to apologize for the potential delay in shippingeven though it obviously wasnt their faultthere ended up being no strike but Topbox included the extra item for everyone anyways. I havent any experiences with Ipsys customer service although Ive heard they are pretty good and pretty fast when it comes to replacing broken items etc.,MakeupAddictionCanada,d6bc8zf,4,t5_32rtl

11115331,0,t1_deq8y1e,Thank you for the quilt love!! It has been such a great hobby to discover and good for my mental health I think. Im hoping to maybe even start an etsy shop!  And thank you for the kind offer of listening. Sooooo much easier to work out with an internet friend how to broach things IRL sometimes! lt,MakeupAddictionCanada,derwwc0,1,t5_32rtl

11292662,0,t3_615dwq,I have  liquid lipsticks and the Beauty Killer palette. I purposely bought the lipsticks Mannequin Rose Matter Gemini but the BK was in my Beautylish lucky bag. I wouldnt have gone out of my way to choose it because it has a pretty ugly selection of shades IMO. The gold shade is rock hard and has no pigment it just flakes glitter everywhere. I cant wrap my brain around how to use it. But the rest are good quality. I love the neutrals which kind of defeats the purpose of a palette with some other bright shades in it neutrals can be found in any palette. I really like to use Princess as a highlight its a shimmery silvery lavender. But I really dont like the two palettes hes put out because the packaging is huge and the colours arent cohesive to me. Id never go out of my way to get the new Androgeny palette either.My lipsticks have the root beer scent and honestly I love it. I dont have a sensitivity to fragrance at all though and love all the smelly cosmetics like TF food scented palettes. I love the colours and formulas and packaging the lid clicks shut! And the doefoot applicator is the best Ive seen and used. Im pretty much a convert I dont buy directly from his site and I understand that somehow people will find a way to get mad about someone liking a product.. eh whatever. They work great for me and the colour selection is amazing. ,MakeupAddictionCanada,dfc09iy,5,t5_32rtl

11683106,0,t3_66n8k4,I was subscribed to Topbox several years ago but unsubbed due to lack of variation of productsbrands. It is certainly is a good box to start off with. Ive been to subscribed to Ipsy for probably about  years. Great customer service and lots of variation. Im also subscribed to Boxycharm  where you get a lot of full sized products but they tend to repeat product types frequently  since November Ive received  highlighters. The value is definitely there. Ive been keeping an eye on BeautyBox. They seem to really have been stepping up their game. I had subscribed for a year but didnt renew as I found the boxes ended up being of lower value  but the last  months or so have looked really good. ,MakeupAddictionCanada,dgkapdv,1,t5_32rtl

11721825,0,t1_dgojrcj,Its a new brand for The Bay and for Canada prior to this the only hint of an authorized dealer that sold to Canadians was Sephora and the MUA mob took it down before Sephora could even get stock up on to their website.,MakeupAddictionCanada,dgop68w,4,t5_32rtl
