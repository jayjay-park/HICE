4747094,0,t3_3fwbs9,Something about Karate Joe is super charming to me hes  one of my favorite video game characters. I couldnt tell you why though.  The Karate Man mini games are always my favorites.  I dont think any one character can represent rhythm heaven really well though the chorus kids are alright but some of the fun of rhythm heaven is making music based mini games out of stuff youd never think of. Might as well be Karate Joe. ,rhythmheaven,ctswzt3,3,t5_2twoc

Getting  or more on Karate Man is exceptionally hard because the inputs are quite a few so lilbitoffbeats are not considered sparingly compared to other games that press a lot more buttons.
