2077644,0,t3_2ilqgj,Sound effect  OK !But original music  I think its a bad Idea. Lots of runners like stream with their playlist and music is not a problem to spice a run.For exemple look that video I made one year ago just for fun Music montage  lots of segments for exemple between  and ok you can see a big mistake at  starting and other levels. xD But it was not cheating vido so I dont careIts easy to segment vido with or without music... ,MeatBoyRuns,cl3wwmg,1,t5_3174f
2087346,0,t3_2issvf,I have absolutely no idea about why things are as they are now so ill just give my opinion on the subject. To me this comes down to the spirit behind speedrunning a game. The whole idea about it in my mind is that I want to be able to finish the game as fast as possible. This sounds trivial but I actually mean that if I went to a friends house and he got meatboy and a controller I want to be able to show him how fast i can do it. Which means I want to be able to speedrun the game exactly as it comes in a natural state without the use of anything that I wouldnt find on a friends setup.So in practice in our case if I went to a friends place I wouldnt ask him to install a larry script or a tool to remap pause somewhere else or anything of the sort. Id just show how much better I am with the same conditions as him. Of course thats a bit hypocritical of me because I use joytokey but if I was really honest with my beliefs I wouldnt.Now when it comes down to races I think it depends on what you expect of them. If you consider races as a way to rank people according to their pure technical skills in fair conditions then I couldnt agree more that a Larry script would be a good thing and if that was done I wouldnt mind.As far as I am concerned I like these unfair races because I dont care about winning a race its just a way for me to run in conditions where I am not tempted to reset and to share my game experience with other people in a game that is in the end quite lonely.,MeatBoyRuns,cl55bww,1,t5_3174f
