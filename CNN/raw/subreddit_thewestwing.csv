217294,0,t1_cf2xud5,Well for me the important piece of information is that we have a trans subject who has remained deep stealth and is offering to show valid credentials in exchange for an embargo on her personal life which is what shed tried to establish in every contact with Hannan. Theres every reason to think that she had the aforementioned credentials because all that she gains and all her partner gains if shes lying is more bad ink especially the partner who has now established herself as an accomplice to fraud...Turning down that NDA to be signed after presentation of the credentials makes it clear which story Caleb Hannan wanted to write especially since he cant seem to find the keyboard to insert sic every time he uses one of his interview subjects to degender Essay Vanderbilt so that by the time he does the same its lost in the shuffle.  word piece has a lot of room for chump bait.Heres a good piece that focuses more on the journalism more than the predictable rage of you dont out anybody ever. To which Id agree its pretty easy to establish something approaching negligence regarding Dr. Vanderbilts trans status in this piece but deep stealth is an incredibly stupid strategy and one that leaves harm to others to a degree Id call dereliction of ones duty as a citizen. That said part of the reason for this behavior is stealths history as a precondition for treatment by some of the more nakedly cissexist doctors meaning most of the doctors providing transition medicine at the time.,thewestwing,cf370cz,0,t5_2sgqa

256707,0,t3_1x1jkb,The These Women speech was about praise. There is a line something like in a world that tells women to shut up or something like that. Leo and Jed are in awe of the fact that women have a more difficult path to the room they are all standing in but there are some impressive ones that made it right in front of them.How often was Donna the victim of ditzy blonde jokes? Im gonna need examples to even acknowledge that point.Donna was used as the foil because she was an assistant...not because she was a woman. At that she was most prominent assistant that would not be in the know of inner workings of politics and policy and wanted to know more. As the show evolves she learns and knows things and gets job offers from people that see that...it was great realistic character growth.Then who was viewed as most capable and intelligent in crunch time?? CJ...the only female senior staffer was named CoS.The sexism argument in TWW is a very tired topic. CJ Abby Nancy were incredibly strong characters. Ainsley was crazy smart Donna grew the most outside of maybe Charlie Kate Harper was strong Amy was one of the most powerful women in the city.Even Jeds daughters were all written as smart strong women.,thewestwing,cf7d3lj,35,t5_2sgqa

The film was directed by George Clooney in his feature film directorial debut It was written by Charlie Kaufman and starred Sam Rockwell Julia Roberts Drew Barrymore and Clooney.gtColumbia Pictures had planned to produce a film adaptation of Barriss memoir of the same name in the late s. When the film rights were purchased by producer Andrew Lazar Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to write a new script which attracted various Alist actors and filmmakers to the project. Bryan Singer at one point planned to direct the film with Johnny Depp in the lead role but the production was canceled. The production resumed when Clooney took over directing duties.gtBarris remained heavily involved in production in an attempt to portray the film from his point of view. To accommodate the  million budget Clooney convinced actresses Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts to lower their asking prices Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was released with respectful reviews from critics but bombed at the box office Rockwell in particular was praised for his acting and won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the  Berlin International Film FestivalgtgtImage iInteresting George Clooney | Sam Rockwell | Chuck Barris | Steven Soderbergh uNightMgr can reply with delete.

261203,0,t3_1x3pag,The first half of season  can be described as bleak. I dont know if it was intentional or not but it actually kind of works as a transition from the Sorkin to postSorkin era. The show kind of does a soft reboot in the first part of season  and definitely takes on a slightly different tone than previous seasons. All that being said I think  finishes strong and seasons  and  while not quite the same as the Sorkin era are still really good. Some really really cool stuff happens. ,thewestwing,cf7tzle,12,t5_2sgqa

Im an alum of Oberlin. Not only has Oberlin prohibited Greek Life since the s we have a long tradition of being at the forefront of equality movements. There is even historical evidence that suggests that the actions of Oberlin students to free a jailed fugitive slave was a major factor in the start of the Civil War.

1682510,0,t1_cjr1kvc,My only regret as much as I have always loved John Spencers portrayal of Leo was that Leo should not have been tabbed for anything beyond where he was after the character had his first heart attack.I cannot imagine a world where a VP candidate who was an alcoholic had problems with pills and then had a massive heart attack would have been a benefit to Santos ticket.Contractually Im assuming that Wells had to do something with Spencer and decided to go the route he did. I think it was a mistake. I would have had Leo be a senior strategist on the campaign and found someone to be the VP candidate like Ed ONeill as the Governor of Pennsylvania. It would have been JoshLeo vs. Gianelli. I would have liked to see that more.Of course that would have required not pulling the stunt at the convention but it would have made the rest of the Santos arc stronger IMO. And it might have undermined Josh running the campaign but I feel like Leo would have let Josh have his moment.,thewestwing,cjr8rpu,2,t5_2sgqa

1832069,0,t1_ck9xyib,Thanks for the compliments! I love the show and am glad there are still folks around passionate about a show that debuted  years ago.My understanding was that Rob was cast as the star which is why he had first billing and was expecting a certain amount of camera time as the focal point of the show. But very quickly Sorkin realized that Martin Sheen needed to be in the mix far more often than he first envisioned. So that changed the dynamic.Then Janel Moloney was retained as a series regular because her dynamic with Josh resonated with the audience. So every minute shes on camera is potentially time that Lowe wasnt. Dule Hill began to take on a bigger role and suddenly its not the Rob Lowe Show anymore my conjecture.I think the show morphed into an ensemble full of strong characters and great acting which changed what Lowe thought were the dynamics during the run up to the pilot. He continued to ask for money as the star of the show and the producers and studio felt that they couldnt afford to keep paying raises to Schiff Hill Janney etc and pay Rob more than everyone else.So Rob announced he was leaving the show and Sorkin wrote him out early in season .Sorkin was caught with crack in April of  just looked it up and continued on the show through  so I dont think thats why he left. I think it was money and artistic control within the production company. I think thats why he and Schlamme left.Looking back Im surprised that Sorkin lasted four seasons. He doesnt seem to be the kind of guy that really likes doing long term things. I think he wants to flitter in bang out a script and then go do something else. Which is why The Newsroom has been such a disappointment. He commits to something gets bored with it or whatever he wants to call it and then quits.,thewestwing,ck9yi6l,4,t5_2sgqa

You picked Russell. Him to serve as Vice President to a President with a serious health condition. You were aware you were picking a potential successor. On some level Ive just trusted that....I always thought it was pretty standup of Leo not to come out and say that was stupid you knew the guy was a dud and we had no choice. It was a poignant moment where Will truly realized Russell wasnt anything particularly special. Just the safest and last possible option theyd had. True Russell showed a lot of ambition once he took the VP spot but he wasnt any less of a tool or puppet than Will and Toby had made fun of in their accidental announcement speech.

All other episodes had credits to one side while NBC promotions occupied most of the screen and all of the audio.  The credits you see today were added for syndication and DVD releases.

7455062,0,t3_4hgnel,Ah...Isaac and Ishmael. Probably my favorite episode of the entire series and the one episode that I watch if Im in the mood for some West Wing and only have time for one show.I havent checked it out on Netflix but Im assuming youre saying it doesnt have the intro where the cast explains that its not a part of the timeline of the show but a oneoff if youll allow? Thats unfortunate and certainly would be confusing to any first time viewers.Whats always amazed me about that episode is that they shot it in just a few days and right after the attacks had occurred. IIRC The West Wing was the first prime time show to resume after the attacks and that episode was not only amazing to watch but very brave of the writers and actors to air. At a time when anger towards Muslims was off the charts they went with a story that not only showed a Muslim being wrongly accused but one of the mainstay characters showing cracks in his character. And the banter back and forth in the mess between Josh Toby CJ Donna Charlie and Sam and their interactions with the kids was awesome writing not to mention Abigails reciting of the story of Isaac and Ishmael was perfect.I always thought they picked the perfect song to close the episode too...For What Its Worth by Buffalo Springfield. ,thewestwing,d2pld95,18,t5_2sgqa

8373927,0,t1_d5nj6j5,Ive commented about this before in the past but it appears to be a mess unless you try to pick up on the threads they weave through the season. After Zoes kidnapping President Bartlet loses his mojo and is no longer sure of himself as president and everybody feels it Leo feels like hes barely holding the administration together Josh fails to maintain his influence Republicans capitalize on the weakness and get their VP in place etc. Even in the side stories like the pianist from North Korea we see the overarching theme of what it means to be powerless as President of the United States and how that affects everybody in the administration. Not only that but once we get past the episode with Lassiters death we begin to see how Bartlet starts to grasp the powerlessness and difficulty of shaping his legacy in issues like the Supreme Court and the Middle East Crisis.When you watch the season through that lens of powerlessness in a position of power the actions of the characters seem a lot more comprehensible and sensible. At least to me anyways. ,thewestwing,d5oah65,3,t5_2sgqa

Id also heard its why he eventually left he felt like his character wasnt getting sufficient story time. Also the president was only supposed to appear ever  episodes or so.

11346811,0,t3_61p01z,I know that a lot of people are into this it just doesnt really appeal to me as much.  What I think would be great would be a short reunion type of show like Love Actually just did.  Its years later and President Bartlet has passed.  After his funeral the whole gang gets together similar to after Leos funeral.  During their meeting Sam proudly tells everyone the story of when the president told him he would run for president one day.  His happiness slowly fades though as one by one he finds out that President Bartlet said the exact same thing to everybody else.  Toby Josh CJ Donna Margaret Ainsley Charlie Will Carol Bonnie Ron Butterfield Dr Keyworth Ed Larry Bernard Joey Lucas Kenny Dale Bracket Ryan Pierce and Elsie Snuffin. ,thewestwing,dfi52s2,11,t5_2sgqa

Hes usually only a dick to people who are actually saying something stupid or insulting him. Also if he insults you you can fire back and tell him he looks like a chubby less funny Danny Tanner. Insult or insult all in good fun. ,thewestwing,dg8amnw,31,t5_2sgqa
11609598,0,t3_65olw3,I am extremely picky about what television I watch. On the whole I prefer television as a medium for story telling to movies because with a proper budget you can get great production value and enough time to let the content breath. I dont watch just anything and I think  of TV is absolute shit but all that being said The West Wing is the second best TV show of all time. The story telling character development production value writing acting directing music all of it is a home run. My parents had been telling me for years that I needed to watch it then in January of  I started it and wound up watching the whole series seven times that year. The West Wing is one that will be taught in college classes in the future and Im sure is even taught here and there already. So when you ask if you should watch The West Wing I can only answer with a question how to you feel about sudden arboreal stops while riding very expensive custom mountain bikes? Duh watch the show!For anyone thats interested here are my top  TV shows ever True Detective The West Wing Lost The Simpsons Seinfeld,thewestwing,dgbyi56,2,t5_2sgqa
11692601,0,t3_66u7az,I for one think Tobys argument was pretty ridiculous. Tossing away constitutional provisions because theyre arcane is... a serious problem. You know what? The Emoluments Clause is pretty arcane but it exists for a reason. Claiming the meaning of the Constitution changes over time is one thing. Ripping out clauses for funsies is another thing entirely.,thewestwing,dgldht7,1,t5_2sgqa
