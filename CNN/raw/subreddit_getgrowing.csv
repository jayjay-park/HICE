4606709,0,t3_3e3ncj,Seems like a good business certainly an industry that makes a lot of money but its always hard to tell how popular it really is. Anyone can pay for twitter followers and facebook likes. It would be good to see more detailed sales data on some of these offers.,getgrowing,ctb9dkg,2,t5_38ssv
5082484,0,t1_cuyl78g,Ive realized you take investing on Kickfurther as a business partnership more so than I do and youre being very lenient on getting your money back. But not everyone has the same perspective as you when investing on Kickfurther. Stock holders ask tough questions on quarterly earning conferences they dont care about if tough questions would make companies look bad. They just want to make sure their stock will go up. So people hold different perspectives when making investment on Kickfurther too.For my experience so far every company that has payment due made several announcements as to their first payouts and replies to backers comments except for Max Axe. It was labor day weekend but that didnt stop other companies from making some simple announcement. Is that so hard to do? Small businesses like them at this stage where they are trying to grow should be all their lives are about. I just dont get why a business can ignore tenths of comments from concerned backers if there wasnt a problem.Youre right backers shouldnt be the ones who demand a company to respond. Its that companys responsibility to be communicative and Kickfurthers responsibility to oversee. People were concerned about their investments and frustrated by Max Axes non responsiveness on the comments section so they went on to asked them on Facebook. They only simply asked them to respond not demanding a payment or really leaving negative feedbacks. Are they really so bad that you need to prosecute them like this? Plus nobody will really see those guest posts on Facebook. Max Axe can even delete them if they want. Youre making it way too big of a deal.After  days we finally heard from Kickfurther about Max Axes situation. Whether the offer will go ok or bad in the end their ignoring backers comments is inexcusable.,getgrowing,cuyms4u,0,t5_38ssv
5227313,0,t3_3m5q1v,I would really like to find a way to make investment IN KF available to all users.  That is completely in line with our philosophy at KF but right now the rules around nonaccredited seed stage investment are being worked out.If the SEC actually issues rules on Title  in October and doesnt delay again then we will have a path to move forward.Even if I have to pay some legal fees for a full PPM I think that would be worthwhile to get the community involved.  In the end I want to give all our users as many opportunities to get involved as possible.tldr I want you to be part of our growth as well and if I can make it happen I will!,getgrowing,cvg2z4c,2,t5_38ssv

Yes we received a phone call confirming a march filming dateThen why say this?Im not saying you dont have a point but it sounds like a pretty scummy loophole to me  if the offer is sitting there promoting getting inventory specifically for their premiere on Shark Tank  I want to see their premiere on shark tank,getgrowing,d3876wr,1,t5_38ssv

8771034,0,t3_4zik8w,I dont think another preview period within the preview period makes sense. I think preview period filling up too fast because too many people have KF keys. Granting one KF key every month makes everyone have it so that many can contribute in the preview window. If KF keys can only be gifted with lower frequency say every  months or only obtained by getting referrals and other ways that require real effort not many people will have them all the time so preview window wont always be filled up fast.,getgrowing,d721m6f,1,t5_38ssv
8795375,0,t1_d74mxp3,I dont think using a key is the way to go.  That would mean you might use your entire months key allocation and only get one  pack at the end of it leaving you unable to participate in any other offer reservations for the entire rest of the month.  If anything this proposed system replaces the KF Key system with a better fairer solution.  Having said that I realize you will not want to scrap the keys as they are already built into incentive programs etc.    As for the cartwaitlist when the offer goes live  if KF also used the proposed reservation system for live offers I believe it would be the fairest solution.  It is almost impossible to get into a decent offer for the past  weeks even offers which are quite large.  Clearly there was a large and immediate change back then.  Maybe some new script?  Anyway the reservations system would ensure that those of us who do not believe in using unfairdishonest practices would get a share at least some of the time.,getgrowing,d7532e9,1,t5_38ssv
9011304,0,t1_d7uv247,Thanks for copying this over for me.gt   It seems seems KF is very REACTIVE vs. proactive.Youve put your finger on the communication issue exactly.  The new position were hiring is expected to be proactive in facilitating communication.gt  I would like to see stats on failed offers and the loss rate on failed offers.We coded up the below page for that purpose.gt  Too many companies not understanding PSC. I suggest KF put a stat in the profile for example if offer raising  and PSC is  state that means the company will have to sell  or whatever to fully pay back offer. Make it numerically relevant as there is such mass confusion on both sides and obviously high PSC are riskier for investors.See this post.Were planning on getting this information in a more digestible video format for users and businesses.  The key element is that PSC is a contractual relationship between the option price and the revenue share price.  The contract states the business needs to pay the revenue share price for each piece of inventory that is sold or rendered unsalable sent as a commercial sample for instance.  This means if a company funded  pieces and has an  PSC if  pieces are sent as samples and no revenue is earned the business is still responsible for the revenue share price and the coop should complete.The  amount to sell therefore doesnt really translate but its a good thought.gt  Make it clear in offer where the KF inventory stands for tracking sales in PSC especially since these companies have inventory and buy more inventory that is not KF. I emailed JacksonJessica as well as posted in Watchitude as Watchitude appears to be paying back as loan and NOT ON SALES. They are not tracking KF inventory sold which is ahead of expections but payments like loan at th. This is risky for us and is a violation of the contact as I understand you have. No response from Jackson or Jessica in about two weeks.If company sells all the inventory KF financed and has not paid back the loan as they are funding other parts of their business that is not per the contact and is risky for investors especially if company fails. KF should have the investors report sales with every payment and show the calculation when requested. Even a little accountability by KF will go a long way to making them more honest about it. This is a part of the current updatepayout methodology with that exact thought in mind.  That being said its still self reporting sales so this is still very trust based.gt  Please post a copy of the standard contract you ask the company to sign.Let me see about this.  We put a lot of work into our contract so Im somewhat reticent to release it to the public.  That being said I understand its important information so... let me see I have to run to do an inventory inspection but Ill be back to answer more questions later.,getgrowing,d7v0o2r,1,t5_38ssv
