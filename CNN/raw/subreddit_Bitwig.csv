7699303,0,t3_4kqwns,They do have their uses hybrid tracks. But heres how I would do it   Create two tracks   Original audio on track    Stutter Edit on track    Route audio from track  to track  through general routing or by using the Audio Receiver on track    Track  is now playing the audio from track  with an empty lane ready for recording MIDI ,Bitwig,d3hczcb,2,t5_2tcsm

10316486,0,t3_5njzpg,Pricing is absolutely DiSGUSTING .  for  Bitwig  is bad enough considering most of the features we bought bitwig  for never worked and we have basically been beta testing all through Bitwig . Should be a free upgrade for Bitwig  users or at least  euros as a thanks for their loyalty.But whats WORSE is they expect you to pay the  again every  months if you want to receive upgrades to their bugladen software??? Guess its back to Ableton  what a joke,Bitwig,dcdfh7z,2,t5_2tcsm
10350419,0,t3_5o3jlt,Theres an easy way to fix your scale problem.Theres a device in Bitwig called the Diatonic Transposer. Set your scale and your mode and any note you play will be in that scale! ,Bitwig,dcha3ck,2,t5_2tcsm

11054371,0,t3_5xofra,might be a long shot but my maudio device wasnt working properly with the script provided until I turned off midi in jack. in qjackctl the midi dropdown for nonerawseq choose none. so if you are using jack try that. ,Bitwig,dekzsxl,1,t5_2tcsm
