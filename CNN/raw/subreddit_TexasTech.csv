I would also suggest taking a look at Energy Commerce in the business school with an wind energy certificate.

6410086,0,t1_czi8lj0,Youll wantneed one eventually. Youll also likely need to purchase a car in the next  years. Having that bill go to collections on your credit tells lenders that youre a higher risk borrower. Your credit score is basically how attractive are you as a person to hold debt. Do you pay on time? Do you have a long history of doing that? What is your debt to credit ratio? All of these things factor in when you go to finance something. Your credit score is the very similar to your GPA easy to screw up hard to repair. Pay that . If you cant do it all at once get a payment plan set up with SBS. Theyll work with you if you of they know youre going to pay them back. They wont penalize you for being on a payment plan either. It seems like you need to read up more on money stuff.
