37604,0,t3_1ujabg,Your offer should not be as arbitrary as you made it sound.  You need a system by which you can evaluate deals and your offer price should be determined by that system.  That will save you a ton of headache because you can put in a solid offer that works with you numbers and if you get a counter that is outside the parameters of your system you can just reject it without having to bring emotion into the picture.  Either a deal works or it doesnt.  Sellers opinionsdesires are not relevant... they will either sell you the property at a number that works for you or you will not be doing business with them dont take this as carte blanche to be rude... explain if you can that you have a specific set of numbers you need to meet in order to ensure you dont lose money and that if the sellers circumstances change and they decide to reevaluate your offer that you are always looking to buy properties for numbers that work for you.Dealing with investors is always harder than dealing with noninvestors they know the market they know what their properties are worth and they are going to value them at the HIGHER of their market value based on comps and their market value based on cashflow especially for duplexesplexes... comparable sales approach may not be relevant to a seller if their k place is netting kyr.

Whether prices will rise are dependent on other factors as well.That being said by looking at foreclosures over the last few years which increased supply and put a downward pressure on prices I think that there is potential the increased pressure of those buyers back in the market will have a similar albeit much less dramatic increase in prices due to the sheer number of individuals in the year freeze category.,RealEstate,cemdmn9,1,t5_2qipl

232065,0,t1_cf4lcf8,I think the key part youre missing is the total expense of owning a house.  It is a lot more than just the monthly payments.  You have to be prepared to deal with all kinds of stuff happening.  Your water heater could break and you suddenly have to pay  to get a new one.  Or your furnace or AC could break and those can easily cost a couple thousand dollars to replace.  Your roof can gets leaks several thousand dollars if you have to replace the whole roof you could accidentally break a window stuff can happen to your kitchen appliances etc.  If you can rent a place for  but the PITI would be  youre likely better off financially to rent for a while.  This is especially true if youre getting a place that needs more work to begin with.   If youre spending about  of your monthly income just on your PITI youre just not going to be able to have enough leftover to cover the rest of your expenses plus save enough to deal with house crap.  I dont know what special low income programs youre looking at but any of the regular loans conventional FHA VA USDA would not let you have a mortgage with monthly payments that high for your income.  I also really doubt that there is a program out there that would allow a family of  making year to buy a  house with only  saved.  Its just not smart because you cant afford it.  Those programs are designed to help give lower income families a little boost toward home affordability and you guys are in need of a lot more than a boost.There is nothing wrong with renting and it is not throwing away money.

248408,0,t3_1wy73x,I would talk to the realtor  like now  and find out why the lease for you to rent back wasnt in the contract.  Is it possible that while the buyers plan on leasing out they will do renovations first  or maybe have other plans that maybe you wouldnt have been comfortable with.  idk developers who will raze everything and sell to some bad corporation...But more importantly demand that your realtor get information on a lease or give you contact information so you can either move or sign a lease but can make a plan now.I recently bought an investment property and was thrilled the previous owner wanted to rent back from me for  months.  Instant tenant who had an emotional investment in the property he took good care of it and instant income.  Paid my taxes and had money to renovate one bathroom for the new tenants when he moved out.It could just be laziness on the realtors part.  I knew right away when I made the offer that the seller was interested in renting but took until the week before the closing for the realtor dual agent to pass on the lease information.  But Id push for an answer so you know for sure.edit I was worried because we hadnt settled on an amount for the lease so I didnt know until the last minute if he had been given the amount I wanted or would balk right before closing.,RealEstate,cf6i21j,2,t5_2qipl

Seasoned capital with a paper trail is also usually a requirement now so if you get the downpayment gifted from a private loan or an investorfamily member they would have to be able to see that and may not lend since its not really your money.That being said you can look into creative financing with the seller such as owner financing with a certain amount down with a  year balloon payment total amount due in  years. Once you have the deed with the seller as the lienholder you can look into getting a refinance over the next few years to pay your loan before the balloon payment.Again creative financing has undergone some restrictions as well so please speak to a real estate attorney and an experienced agent about legality of these sorts of deals in your area.,RealEstate,cfx7qa7,3,t5_2qipl

Please note I have owned multiple multiunit and SFHs and still own one quad in a college town as they made me an offer I couldnt refuse. My reasons for ultimately moving away from small multiunit duplexquadtri.SFH Pros You can sellliquidate to investors OR retail residents typically stay longer and you can just as easily buy  SFHs as you can  Quad and reap the same benefits...and technically more.SFHs Cons Typically more challenging to get  SFHs right next to each other.Quad Pros All  units in one location if you bought correct it can be half empty and you will still break even.Quad Negs You have one building asset residents tend not to stay as long . of the time you can only sell to other investors.There are more advanced reasons why a SFH could be a better investment but it might be challenging for newer investors to understand so I just stuck with the basics.As long as you are cash flowing a net positive good for. I cringe when someone makes a completely false blanket statement such as multi unit is the only good investment. That is like saying blondes are better than brunettes or imports are better than domestics.There are pros and cons to all and after all this time Ive made my decision as to which is preferable.

I came back and offered cash and as is and got it for just a bit more than I had offered before. And yes they were a little nasty about it but they still could have refused to sell for that price.  I think I paid a reasonable price not the deal of a lifetime they were just overpriced to start with.

If the market considers the comparables view inferior to the subject there should be a positive adjustment to the sale.  If the comparable is much older there should be a positive adjustment.  Et cetera each significant feature square footage location quality amenities should be compared and adjusted. But an appraiser with a lot of experience will have seen thousands of sales enough to learn exactly how much an extra bedroom is worth how much a kitchen remodel is worth how much a view is worth.  If the appraiser is objective and knowledgeable its hard for a homeowner with limited market experience and understandable bias toward their own home to read any appraisal without thinking its a lowball.  You mentioned a realtors CMA.  Did the appraiser and the realtor use the same comps?

Yes.Would your buyers agent have asked the listing agent if they were in a highest and best? Yes.Im a full time Realtor and I do this for a living.  I do this every day sometimes  days a week.  When a home buyer is reluctant to hire a buyers agent I cannot understand why at all. Buyers agents are typically not paid any commission by the home buyers.  Its free to hire a professional who handles real estate sales every day and yet people like you go it alone for no reason.  That is why you lost the house. IMO of course.If Im working with a buyer and were at a multiple offer situation I ask them to go highest and best with the maximum down payment and deposit they can comfortably afford.  I also know how to negotiate with listing agents in ways home buyers simply do not.EDIT  The listing agent may not have wanted to work directly with you for who knows why.  I feel she should have let you know she needed your highest and best  but she was under no obligation to do so.  In my state the seller dictates whether or not I can discuss offers with other interest parties or their buyers agents.

752973,0,t1_cgptcnw,gt Renting is dead moneyNot even close. You pay for a roof over your head and freedom from the responsibilities associated with maintaining it. Youre also protected from taking on massive amounts of debt that could ruin your life should your financial situation worsen and you arent tied down to one location like you would be if you owned.gtYou can either pay Joe Schmoe mo. to live there and after a year have nothing to show for the  you just spent or you can pay a mortgage of mo. to have your own home that you will eventually own and can do whatever you want with. Would you rather give someone yr. just to sleep at their house  or would you rather pay yr. to say This is my house  I do what I want  paint it how I want etc.This is seriously flawed logic. First of all even if you do manage to find a mortgage with a monthly payment equal to rent you still have to pay taxes insurance utilities which are more expensive in a house vs. apartment and maintenance. That shit adds up and none of it goes into home equity. And should we also talk about all the money you have to pay to actually buy a house? Title fees escrow fees origination fees etc. Now if you rent Joe Schmoe is on the hook for all of those extra expenses. Not you. If a pipe bursts in an apartment guess whos paying? What about a roof leak? Broken water heater? Dead fridge? Pest problem? Joe Schmoe pays. In your house... its all you.And what if the housing market takes a downturn? Do you really want to owe more money to the bank than your house is worth? Then youre stuck in a house worth less than what youre paying for it... and theres nothing you can do about it. Want to sell it? Ok... then either be prepared to pay the difference out of pocket to the bank or have your credit sent to shit.gt Now  I see that you cannot afford to buy but can afford to pay rent. I would still recommend seeing if there are loans you can get to purchase.Do you want a financial crisis? Because this is how you get a financial crisis. If you think you cant afford to buy you cant afford to buy. Houses are expensive maintenance is expensive taxes are expensive insurance is expensive. Dont take on more than you can afford. Thats how people end up in foreclosure. And then youve spent tons of money on a house and all you have to show for it is a shitty credit score.OP please dont buy into the false notion that renting is dead money. Renting is very often the right financial decision and it looks to me like it is the obvious choice in your scenario. Dont be pressured into buying a house before you can afford it by flawed logic like this.,RealEstate,cgpvbf0,10,t5_2qipl

827740,0,t1_cgycga1,Im not sure either.  I read this article and got this quotegtRelocation sales assistance is done in two stages. For the first few months the home is on the market the house usually remains in the employees name with the relocation company providing advice on pricing and marketing. If the home isnt sold during that period the employees company may totally or partially buy out the property freeing the employee to buy a home in the new location. After the employer buys the house the relocation company becomes the chief party in sale negotiations.What I think happens is that since the house is new to the market I am dealing with the owners themselves.  If the owners do not accept an offer in the first few months the relocation company buys them out for a set price.  This price is usually the average of two appraisals that are down by the relocation company. Therefore it would be in the best interest of the sellers to NOT take any offer that is lower than their buy out number.I think relocation packages vary from situation to situation but what I explained above is average.,RealEstate,cgyd6by,1,t5_2qipl

840872,0,t3_23qup1,Check on zoning rules about maximum number of households at a single property. I recently found out that my town does not permit more than two households in a single family home. So that limits me to having only one roommate or renting to a married couple. YMMV of course. I rented out the bonus room in my house earlier this year. It was the first time and wasnt too bad. My bonus room is like a separate wing of the house so that helped feel like I had my space and roommate had his. We tried to keep everything separate as much as possible  one chunk of cabinets for roommate one shelf in the frig plus we provided a mini frig in the room one drawer in the laundry room for soap etc.One thing we struggled to keep separate was temperature in the house and minimizing utility costs. Assuming you are splitting utilities with your tenant their utility usage may be subsidized by you if they do not live as energy efficiently as you. Or vice versa. Example my former roommate kept a window open in his room practically all the time including when he went to work. The room has its own programmable thermostat and Im not sure he made use of it. Thats totally fine if living alone do what you want. Long story short the downstairs common area of the house was always too hot or too cold and utility bills were higher than I expected with an extra person in the house. The hardest part for me was letting go of concerns about damaging stuff. A tenant probably wont give TLC to your house the same way you do because they are just renting. So a wall gets scuffed theres nail holes carpet gets dirty... Its just stuff. It can be cleaned or repaired or replaced. ,RealEstate,cgzuyl2,1,t5_2qipl

908047,0,t1_ch7b8yc,This is very good advice. Thank you.As it stands right now and since homes in my area are expected to lose  of their value this year my plan is as follows List house for sale and accept nothing less than breaking even. While its on the market Ill look into the possibility of renting and will speak with a few property management companies to get their take. If Im unable to sell or unable to rent Ill likely walk away from it via strategic default. Quite frankly Im losing money every day on this house on top of pouring mo into it for the mortgage. The fact that Ive already invested MORE than its worth shows me its a bad investment and one that Im not willing to be bound with. After doing some research Ive found that I will be subject to recourse by my lender for the deficiency after the house sells. Why not do a short sale you ask? Because I my lender will not approve of one since I have not fallen on hard times a general requirement for a lender to grant a short sell. And from everything Ive experienced and have gathered from other sources my lender is rather strict about it.And since my credit is already rather low  and I since I dont plan on buying a house for a VERY long time I dont see much of a downside other than a deficiency judgment of maybe k at VERY most Id imagine. And Ive practically thrown away over three times that amount by paying on this house already thats a drop in the bucket.Also I thought this was interesting I pulled up some data on the housing market in my area. Within a halfmile radius there are  homes for sell and  that are being auctioned from foreclosures. That gives you a scope of just how bad my area has been affected by the recession.

It requires me to hire great people learn the important details so I can judge how effectively my team is working and then frees me up to focus on the tasks that make me a lot of money finding deals raising capital etc.And yes my other book on flipping houses goes into stepbystep details on how I recommend new investors do that...,RealEstate,chen097,2,t5_2qipl

The tenant may also repair the appliance but in all cases it remains the property of the landlord.I dont know exactly how its best to word it in the lease but something like this maybeLANDLORD has gratuitously provided a washer and dryer make model color Serial to TENANT for use during the tenancy for no extra charge or rent.

Check with a local RE Attorney regarding how strong your local Land Trust Laws are.One property per entity. Every now and then someone posts that they keep multiple properties in one entity. I consider that insanity. Speak to a competent accountant in your state regarding entity selection.A property management LLC is never a bad thing. Income should pass through a ScheduleK directly to you accountants double check me on this and there are no legal ramifications that I can think of check with your attorney in having a property management company that manages a building your SO owns. I invest out of selfdirected IRAs for a number of people. My personal suggestion is to NOT hold real estate in your IRA. It can be subject to litigation. Holding notes and options in my opinion is much better suited for selfdirected IRAs.In your proposed scenario if I am understanding it correctly you would be self dealing which would lead to your IRA being declared null and void by the IRS and result in a penalty please confirm with a competent accountant.I strongly suggest On their website they have plenty of free seminars they have recorded that will teach you a bit more.

The answer is that you really should be using your own. Your agents job is to represent your interests pointing out faults suggesting inspectors youll need on the property in question etc. The listing agents job is to represent the sellers interests downplaying faults bringing attention only to good aspects. The only way that doesnt cause them a conflict of interest is if youve already reached an agreement with the seller with both parties agentless and youre just needing an agent to formalize it and help you process the transaction. ,RealEstate,chxww2p,6,t5_2qipl

I really want to take a closer look at it because there are some good concepts I just think that they have been followed to conclusions that are either wrong or wildly different for different market segments.The thing about rental prices is not so terribly inaccurate.  Its true that your rent better be at least  of the purchase price or its not viable to rent.  You need a small cashflow just to cover maintenance.  Around here you can rent out an average size house for about  to  depending on the size.  The house will cost around k give or take.  If the house costs k you might get the price up to  or  but the extra quality gets you very little extra rent and you will have a harder time finding tenants that wont trash the place.  At k you might get  in rent.  The numbers get worse as the price goes up.  Is it as bad as  in some areas?  It might be.  Im sure thats the extreme though.So if you do want a really nice house and youre willing to pay a mortgage of  about k or you can rent a really nice place for .  The rental is probably only k but still nice.  How much can you save with those kinds of bills depends on who you are.  If I just kept living in my apartment I could maybe save  grand a year and Im reasonable well off.  In a house costing  a month practically the minimum rent for any house in my area Id be saving a fair bit less.  Probably more like .  So after  years Id have  grand saved up.  However I could also get a much cheaper house around k with bills no more than my current apartment and save just as much.  So if the author makes any successful argument it is this  stay the hell away from the really expensive and overinflated realestate in any area.,RealEstate,cia0dum,1,t5_2qipl

1394475,0,t1_cir25bn,We dont get rid of the loan and the loan isnt passed on. All loans are written to Fannie Mae guidelines because the loans are packaged called Mortgage Backed Securities and sold as investments just like a stock. Investors need a guarantee of the underwriting guidelines that the loans are written to. This creates some certainty that the borrower is qualified and will repay their loan. Multiple loans are packaged in each MBS so if one borrower defaults the investment is still good. We run into trouble when a lot of borrowers default which is what happened in  because underwriting guidelines were weak. Essentially the investors that purchases the Mortgage Backed Securities are different than the loan servicers that you make your payment to. ,RealEstate,cir2ty9,1,t5_2qipl

1408064,0,t3_2a99el,In the past that may be true but now most buyers do a lot of their own research and searching online so if a buyer sees your condo they are going to tell their agent to setup a time to see it the buyer will not see the MLS cobroker commission.  Their agent may see the lower commission and try to steer their client away but that they would have to be pretty shady to do that as it is not in their clients best interest. Why not list on Zillow or someplace like that first and note that you will not pay buyers agent?  If the market is really hot then you may be able to snag someone without an agent or perhaps work out a deal where you will split the commission at . each or whatever is standard.  ,RealEstate,ciss3qb,3,t5_2qipl

1540698,0,t1_cixvh7x,Howdy. Ive been off on adventures so apologies for the slow reply.gtDo you have any bank issued loans??I have no bank issued loans.gtWhen you see a house for sale you simply begin looking for the home owner to negotiate?I dont contact the owner until I know what the house will rent for and know about the neighborhood.gtHow do you get in touch with the homeowner and avoid their real estate agent?While I dont find realtors very useful I also dont believe in going behind their back unless Im positive they arent making my offer. Honestly I avoid realtors like the plague so it is a nonissue for me. A  realtors commission is another  I could negotiate the price down. Difficult to work around that.Everything is a sliding scale. Im a lot less worried about price than I am about cash flow since Im a buy and hold guy. If I was a flipper or rehabber then of course I would want the lowest price.Now that doesnt mean I dont want a good price... I aim to pay  or less than market value. However cash flow is more important...Ill overpay for a house on terms because if Im holding onto a house for  years the tenants are paying the mortgage down...not me. Im just looking for my  net profit each month.Down payment I typically keep this k or under for middle class SFH homes. Would I pay more if the deal was good enough? Yes.Length of Terms As long as I can get. Minimum of five years.Once a deal is good enough I stop negotiating and get a contract signed. I believe once you get what you are looking for there is no reason to beat someone up for an extra . I receive referrals from people Ive bought from in the past specifically because they never felt like I was trying to take advantage of them and that I was being fair to both sides.In regards to capital partners Look for self directed IRA groups in your area and make a list of people you think might have kk in the bank that you could borrow.

1572462,0,t3_2c8nyw,I have a small staging business that developed after years of staging my own listings and doing a few jobs here and there for other agents.  At this point we stage about  houses a year and the business is selfsustaining but is just side work.  Im primarily a Realtor.  Our staging jobs average between  friends amp family discount on small jobs to  for really big jobs for  days of staging we charge a monthly fee after  days but we RARELY have to charge them and its usu. about month.  Our furniture is a little beat up  I wont lie  but our stats are out of this world in terms of sales.   of the houses we stage sell  in the last year the only one that didnt was with a builder who really did a crappy job of finishing his work and cleaning.  We actually pulled our furniture after he ruined the upholstered pieces and the rugs because of sheetrock dust mud and paint speckles ruined them.Anyway my tips are this.  Use transitional furniture or slightly more modern pieces.  Doesnt matter where the house is although were in an urbanmetrosuburban area  we dont do anything in the country so who knows out there?.  Most people arent very good at decorating traditional and its too specific for todays buyers..  Keep all the big pieces neutral with no busy patterns..  Use accessories for punches of color..  If a room isnt working EDIT.  Removing one piece almost always fixes it..  Do the main living areas and any awkward bedrooms.  You do not have to do the master bedroom if its clear that it will accommodate the appropriate furniture but you DO need to do very small bedrooms to show people that furniture will fit..  Do not get fancy with the layout.  You want the rooms to look big not artistic forget angling furniture and all that jazz  most people are not skilled enough to pull this off and the scale is almost always wrong..  Try to use fullsize furniture.  Small pieces look weird.I could write about  pages on this crap but the bottom line is do not overdo it.  You do not need to create a model home.  You just want to place a few pieces around strategically to show scale and to suggest layouts.  If theres an awkward or confusing space  stage it  buyers have a hard time figuring that shit out so spell it out for them and make it easy on them.And it is  worth it in my opinion but Ive been staging my own listings for  years and staging for other people for about  years so Im biased.,RealEstate,cjddr8d,9,t5_2qipl

1742107,0,t3_2eej7u,First while you should research and get the gist of things definitely schedule a meeting soon with a loan officer at a bank with a commercial lending department. Then later an appointment with an attorney. I work in residential so a lot of this is second hand from clients and friends who have done this and the docs Ive seen doing their residential deals. . It would be a commercial loan to your corporation secured by the property. You would be a personal guarantor basically theres no corporate shield  the bank could come after you if you default or go deliquent and if Im not mistaken put liens on your other propertiescorporations. Really I think the big safety factor it affords you is liability coverage. If someone wins a  million lawsuit for their child who ate lead paint chips on your property the most the lawsuit would award is the LLCCorps assets ie. your equity in the property. The corporate shield protects you from this type of liability the most you can lose is your investment.. Most common thing I see in this situation is partnership LLC or an SCorp. As far as I know the big difference between the two is taxation. Both offer your the corporate shield.. If you sign as a personal guarantor which I cant see any bank not requiring.. Shop around to a few banks. The two in my area are portfolio that is they use their own funds to make the loans so they do it case by case. Its usually at least  if not  down depending on the risk. Its used to offset more risky factors such as the type and condition of property being purchased your credit your experience the stability and longevity of your income stream and the assets income stream. They also increase the interest rate accordingly  so the riskier you are you could be looking at .,RealEstate,cjyr70s,3,t5_2qipl

The explanation of what my realtor told me was that I get a loan for more than the purchase price and the seller gives me a check back. So last night my specific question to the realtor was in regards to the order in which money changes hands. Specifically if I needed to have money in my account temporarily to cover closing costs until I got the check back from the seller.So on my loan application I put the total purchase price for purchase price  estimated closing costs. The screw up is going to cost me an extra . in interest costs over the life of the loan.Someone else mentioned talking to the attorney involved in the deal. Though all of this was verbal. We always met in person at the unit to do inspectionsview unit etc and talked about details there. So...hard to prove.edit Now that I think of it when she explained it she said that it was doable but tricky and to avoid the lender. And that she would talk to the developer about an agreement of getting a check back and purchasing for more than contract price. And thats why I never told the loan officer about it.

We knew the ac was about to go...lucky for us it worked for the appraisal and capped out not long after we closed which is what we expected. Unit was almost  years old but husband does hvac and we got the unit at cost and he installed. The roof is also old missed by the appraiser. We knew it going in and plan on replacing. Though it is holding in there for now! We got a conventional loan. Ive seen a  couple decent properties put up by freddieFannie that could most likely qualify for conventional. I think it also depends on the bank. The different offers I got where VERY different. Some were  down and still needing to bring like k to closing. We settled on a credit union and did an incentive program with using their agents. Ended up no money down and paid a whopping  bucks at closing.As someone else mentioned...renovations can be rough.

2429084,0,t1_cmbwtab,Im going to chime in and say a couple things.  First of all I specialize in one school district and I know thats rare. But in my area I see on average  homes with every buyer.  So its not like we only see the homes we list. I Frequently go into homes that are listed for which I dont currently have a buyer we call it an agent preview.  I would highly recommend to sellers that you encourage agents to do this.  They could get a call the next day from a client who is looking for a similar house and yours could be the first one they think of.   Given all of that and some other reasons I have been in probably half the homes in my area at one time or another.  Most people are happy to show their homes.  People who are not realtors simply do not have the interest or access to view as many homes as we do.  Lets face it homes are only interesting to most people within a month or two of when they are buying or selling.  Most realtors will tell you that a large part of why they are into it is that they just love homes any home.  Most car guys would tell you something similar.I dont know about other realtors but I could tell you in detail the floor plan the amenities the yard and probably even tell type of heating  likely the brand of the furnace of a house I was in last year and most definitely the condition on a scale of . Most buyers I work with start mixing things up after  houses or so.  I know it is an acquired talent and I knowthe majority of realtors have it in some way or another.  So there is value there.  The data the online pictures do not even come close to compensating for firsthand knowledge and we havent even talked about location yet.  Real estate is extremely local pick a local agent and you will find that they have great knowledge over the big name guygal from two towns over.  I just got crapped on by a buyer who wanted to see a local home and one an hour away because I told him I wouldnt go that far and why it would not be of benefit to either of us but mostly him.  He didnt get it and he found someone who convinced him they were an expert in a two hour radius.  Maybe he will do ok or maybe he will get screwed as you put it.

2592071,0,t3_2pi771,As a buyer you dont really have the option of cutting the agent out of a deal.The most common type of listing is an Exclusive Right to Sell which means the agent gets the commission regardless of who sells the home.  This right likely extends after the listing ends to prevent the owner from waiting until the contract expires to close on a deal.  If it is an Exclusive Agency Listing then the homeowner has the right to sell the home without paying a commission as long as the agent was not the Procuring Cause of the buyer but no other agent can collect the commission.  If it is an Open Listing any agent can bring in a buyer or a buyer can approach the owner themselves to avoid the commission.  These listings are not particularly common and seems unlikely considering how much the agent seemed to know about the owner.  Considering that youve already spoken with the agent he wouldnt have a particularly hard time in court demonstrating that he is owed a commission if the deal closes. Also the owner has chosen an agent to handle the sale of the home for a reason.  The agent has in good faith put in the time to list and market the home taking photos handling paperwork and helping determine the market valuelisting price with the owner.  You could still contact the owner if you like who may or may not tell you to talk to his agent but either way the agent will get the commission.  Its cute that you think you can get a better deal by trying to find a stranger in the alps like that but there are legal and contractual protections to prevent that sort of thing.  ,RealEstate,cmwx5un,15,t5_2qipl

Legitimate mold testing is done by collecting air samples sending those to a lab amp creating cultures to see if anything grows. Airborne mold spores vs the stuff in just about everyones shower are two very different things amp the former is much more rare.

3064788,0,t3_2v7whb,I own a cabin on forest service land in Tahoe National Forest. The main drawbacks are the limitations on modifications cant significantly change the buildings footprint can add stories cant use colors or materials that depart from forest earth tone look etc and the annual fee the USFS charges. The fee is the big unknown because it gets recalculated every  years and is susceptible to political pressures for closing budget gaps and such. In the last round our fee went up about x to around  which aint nothing for a small rustic forest cabin that we use a dozen times a year. The fact that you have no control over this tends to significantly depress the appreciation of the property compared to comparable houses nearby that are not on forest service land. In Tahoe at least where things are quite pricey Id estimate that our cabin would be worth about four times as much as it is if it were on private land. All that said dealing with the forest service has not been a problem at all. We recently built a new deck and working with our USFS liaison to ensure it met all the appropriate criteria and had all the approvals was actually totally easy.

3115360,0,t1_cokvcc4,Well I think thats an issue with particular agents and Im certainly not going to defend agents as a whole.  I honestly think pretty many of them shouldnt be in this industry.  I also see others that have no problem doing things like charging retainers because they are so busy they wont work with anyone who wont guarantee they will get paid.  Keep in mind Im commercial so some of this may not apply to residential but I assume they have similar examples but I will answer your question from my experience.  Recently these are all my listings  Ive met with a prospect maybe  times over the last two weeks with their contractors to design space connected them with lawyers to get a liquor license drafted LOIs on their behalf helped them submit zoning applications exposed them to new business and grants to help them get this done.  another one where I rep the seller.  I helped the tenant engage architectural help again zoning amp city stuff I drafted all documents chased them down to sign stuff.  Another which is a piece of land.  Buyer wants to put a hotel on it.  I verified zoning no hotels allowed met with the city planning department and discussed it with them figured out the zoning change process the timelines etc so I could again draft a contract around this helped them find a flag etc.  Another against list side I connected the buyer with primary financing and secondary bridge lending helped them fill out applications arranged qualified contractors to help them in their inspections and physically gave access of course provided fiscal analysis provided comparative analysis both in terms of sales and projected rents provided research on near by industries and developments etc.  Not to say some of that wouldnt be things Id do as a part of marketing but in those specific situations Id have done NONE of that if they had an agent.  Let me give you another real example that happened.  I had a land listing a guy wanted to put a banquet center on.  Do you know what I did?  I met with him showed him the land and chatted a bit.  He told me he liked it and wanted to submit an offer.  I said great!  Then he said he was kind of working with an agent but he could not use them if I reduced commission.  I asked him how much he was thinking.  We were at  and he said like ..  I told him no way Id do like .or maybe  if my client was ok with it Id have to talk to them first.  He said . was the best hed do or hed just use his agent.  I thought about it for a second and told him to go ahead.  Do you know what happened?  His agent delt with negotiating it including drawing up all docs he was a fucking nightmare at one point he went behind her back and told me he wanted an answer in like minutes or it was off then when we reached an agreement she connected him with a developer and was involved with designing a site plan and have a topography review.  They worked it through zoning and because this always fucking happens we had a planning issue which required additional meetings etc.  Because Im not his agent I go to none of them and have nothing to do with any of this besides getting updates and passing them on to my clients.  She helps him get connected with multiple lenders to fund this etc.  This entire thing actually dies and doesnt close.  Do you know how much time I spent on this after contract?  A few hours maybe.  DO you know how much time his agent did?  Me either but I bet its like .  That would all be on me otherwise.  I had another transaction recently where I repped the buyer.  The building had code issues a shit roof water damage was vacant had title issues and I dont even remember what else.  I figured all of that out.  I arranged for contractors who were qualified to assess all that met with the city about the code stuff projected rents to come up with a valid valuation worked with his lawyer on a number of issues even beyond title.  Do you know what the sellers agent did?  He waited for me to send updates so he could let his client know where we were in the process and when closing would be.  Just a few examples but its crazy to think buyers reps just collect a commission and dont do shit.  Seller rep honestly you get paid for the listing the valuation and the marketing.  The buyer rep really does most of the work after contract while you just monitor it and make sure its progressing.  Thats not to degrade listing brokerage it has its own nuances and when big issues pop up they fall on your side to fix as the buyer just walks but everyone pulls their weight with two agents.  When there is one most people dont know how to do all that so it falls on the other side.  And honestly its tough to do a lot of that stuff when you dont have confidentiality and are trying to only protect your client.,RealEstate,cokwn9c,3,t5_2qipl

3351109,0,t1_cp9z737,Just from my perspective depending on property I list on MLS CoStar Loopnet XCeligent and had some guy that posted all my stuff on craigs list twice a week for maybe  months a bit ago.  MLS does very well for smaller property sales particularly if they have a residential unit or two.  Small time investors look here and the residential brokers have access so if its in the size range they can dabble you get bites.  Loopnet By far most of my unrepped inquiries come from Loopnet.  Whether its investment office buildings apartments retail etc.  Loopnet is where consumers go to look period.  CoStarXceligent This is where brokers find listings and look.Craigslist  My failed experiment there wound up with like  leads that were all horrible.  Your shit just get buried to fuck and back and no one who is half ass serious is looking there in the first place.Overall if I had to generalize where I get inquiries on my listings  lt MLS probably like  Loopnet XCeligentCoStar signs actually averaging but with retail sign calls are a significant amount of traffic.

3351299,0,t3_2yk4gc,Havent used the home style program but am currently under contract with a home path property which is a sister program. Main difference as far as I can tell is that in HomePath FM renovates the property to addresses major issues before listing whereas with home style youre expected to do all the renovations.The only advice I have is to make sure you have a REALLY good agent. The amount of paperwork FM throws on their sales is enormous. My binder of docs and contracts just to get the offer submitted and accepted is more than  pages of tiny single spaced text.As a first time buyer I would have been completely lost without a good buyers agent acting as a catchall to collect all the paperwork and just provide me with the prepared docs to review and sign.The turnaround time is very dependent on the selling agent as well. We got Lucky and the selling agent for the property deals with lots of FM sales another friend went after a property with a selling agent who had never completed a HomePath sale and he said that it was a constant stream of repeated and incorrect paperwork.Good luck!,RealEstate,cpa9u7d,3,t5_2qipl

3354094,0,t3_2yl9ov,Many flavors of this. Basically you rent a place and have a contract to purchase it at some point in the future. Typically this means the seller cannot sell it out from under you. Sometimes you pay a higher rent and the seller agrees to count X percentage of that toward your down payment or take it off the purchase price. Sometimes youre paying market rent and the seller is just agreeing to sell it to no one else until you are in a position to get a mortgage. This is all negotiable so its certainly something worth engaging an attorney to review. As an appraiser some of the worst litigious cases I was involved in were these deals although I saw plenty go smoothly as well. Be leery of establishing a sales price now because you dont know what the market will do this is where Ive seen litigation. Make sure you clearly spell out how you will establish market value at the time you want to pull the trigger. Make sure you spell out clearly your window or deadline for pulling the trigger. Make sure you spell out clearly how the money you pay the seller is being calculated if any of your rent is now supposed to apply toward the purchase. Make sure you spell out what happens to any improvements you install in the place saw a guy once put in a K kitchen then the seller didnt want to let him buy it.TLDR Do lots of homework use an attorney. ,RealEstate,cpalau7,5,t5_2qipl

3357352,0,t1_cpap9jp,Im just not understanding this side... Thats all.  Im curious and want to wrap my head around it.  I dont see why someone would forgo a buying agent if theyre paying the same amount for the house but maybe more in a dual agency situation.  Im looking at this solely at the buyers perspective.I work at a land title office and RE interests me as do other peoples perspectives as I am not right all the time.  Im genuinely interested in your thoughts.For dual agency say I am a realtor I am not.  I have a listing and an existing relationship with my seller.  If a represented buyer comes Im going to negotiate the hell out of the price to get the best pricedeal for my seller.  The buying agent agent will be negotiating hard for the buyers  they know the game have experience and may see a glaring red flag about the house and advise to walk.  Presumably the buying agent has more experience with homes and negotiations than a regular person doing this on their own behalf would they may get a better pricedeal.  Alternatively buying agent may notice due the home is k over market value and save the client from overpaying.Now an unrepresented buyer comes in and wants me as a dual agent.  I now get . cool. The higher price I get the more commission I get.  I have no reason other than my fiduciary duty to the buyer to sell at a lower price and as you stated Realtors are a shady bunch I disagree.  I could also unintentionally favor the seller more due to longer relationship time.  There is no one telling the buyers the house is over priced nor negotiating hard for a lower price.  If I tell them best and final counter offer is XXX they have no way of finding if Im lying or the seller is wiling to go much lower.  I feel the buyer is likely to pay more in this situation.Lastly say you are the seller.  If an unrepresented buyer buys your home and youre only paying . commission would you actually share that money with them or would you say the seller pays the commission so youre keeping it?The one and only way I can see a buyer benefiting in this situation is if the Realtor is  honest somehow pulls off a totally fair on both side negotiation and the seller gives some of saved commission to the buyer which I do not see happening.,RealEstate,cpayoa9,1,t5_2qipl

When my client tells me they are pre approved with shittybank.com I tend to cringe a bit because I have had deals fall through with them before and I know they make the process very hard for my past clients and or have had deals fall through strictly because of them. The second reason I give names of other lenders is because buyers should be shopping around for the best rates.If your Realtor gave you a shitty referral than dont use his recommendation or just ask himher why they referred you to such a crappy lender. The incentives free coffee or magnets!!!! Yay I would love to lay my reputation and career on the line for a damn coffee great deal all around!Inspectors I recommend a few choice inspectors that I have worked with in prior transactions because I know they are thorough not going to breeze over a home and give it an A because I Want them to. Again their reputation and my reputation are on the line. We arent going to jeopardize this over one deal. Countless times the inspector will find things that are terrible with the home and it pushes the buyer away so we find a different home that suits their needs it is not the end of the world. Shit happens. Hell in January I had a listing go under contract with an unrepresented buyer and I recommended a few inspectors the buyer chose one of them and the inspector failed the house. The buyers went on their merry way and that was that. My sellers were pissed I recommended this super strict inspector but they are the people I trust. So the sellers fixed their home house went back under contract and it will close next Friday.edit Realtors live by their reputation good agents will never risk it.

I only really agreed to this because both agents were in the same office and my agent could badger the other agent pretty easily.On the buy end I made a written offer and then we went back and forth verbally until we came to an agreed price then we wrote one final offer based on the agreed upon terms.Worked out OK you just have to have an agent that you know is looking out for your interests.

The realtor is probably just looking for referrals. But I also know realtors who get gifts regularly from lenders and title companies that while not terribly valuable can add up to hundreds of dollars over time.

Youre going to deal with some great people and have fun working but there will also be plenty of annoying and unreasonable ones. I have realtor friends who have been cheated out of commissions they worked hard for. Others get called and asked for rides to places since youre not really working. I think this can be a great career for someone who is independent patient and can stick it out in tough times. Not a bad idea to have another source of income for a while. But if you have lots of friends in the Bay area things are booming there so you may have a couple stellar years and make more money than you know what to do with.

3719261,0,t3_32z67c,The banks in our area are offering a  loan  down with pretty low closing costs for a first mortgage. I would avoid encumbering your primary dwelling if you can help it even with a HELOC. Since this would be a first mortgage again for you and new primary residence there would be no need. A local lender can give you more details on this.What you need to do right away IMHO. Contact a local agentfriend of yours and have them put you on an alert that will send you an email notification when one of your dream properties goes on the market. Our MLS software has this capability and it is very helpful in these instances. Also ask himher to give you a CMA comparative market analysis for your current property to see what it would sell for. Ask or average DOM days on market and LPSP List Price to Sale Price Ratios with common seller concessions do sellers cover closing costs there on average? Have a title company to calculate your net after taxes real estate fees concessions etc. This is just for your information and is usually completely free.. Visit with a local lender right away and hear your options and see what you are preapproved for. There may be a few things you need to do to be ready and they can tell you what those are.. Contact a local attorney and get a copy of a Right of First Refusal that you can change to fill in the addresses. A RFR will allow you to have the right to buy or refuse to buy if the owners get an offer. Your right to buyrefuse would be at the same terms of the offer to purchase. If they got an offer for K to close in  days and not paying the buyers closing costs you would have the right to refuse that offer or take that offer. Ask the attorney what the customary timelines are in your area How many hoursdays do you have to respond if they were to get an offer? etc. This RFR would apply even if the home was listed. More than likely they would just come to you before they decided to put it on the market to see if they could sell it to you and save money.. Carefully approach the property owners of your dream property and let them know that you are not ready to purchase yet and stress that you know they arent ready to sell at this time but if they ever decided to down the road you would love to be contacted officially first.  Most owners take this as a pretty high compliment and many will sign.,RealEstate,cqg80gq,1,t5_2qipl

She was constantly pushing us to make an offer on the house and when we suggested one that we were comfortable with she told us it wasnt worth her time.As she was a broker when we put in the second offer which we had originally asked her to put in and she said no that particular agent was there and was aghast that someone else was bringing in an offer for the people that she had shown the house to...The very offer that she refused to put in.  She made a big deal about it and our new agent was actually concerned that because our old agent was friends with the seller it could have a negative effect on the sale.Livid is a bit hyperbolicbut the whole situation did feel pointedly personal.

In March of  on a Sunday night after my wife took a bath upstairs I noticed the sound of water coming from one of the downstairs toilets.  I walk around the corner and see sewage backing up into the floor.  I clean the mess up grossest thing Ive ever seen in my life and take a plunger to the toilet.  It gets no suction just a whistley sucking sound.  I know that the problem is with a sewage line.  We get up the next morning and call a plumber.  He says that he can be there around AM.  At about AM I notice a crew tearing the street up in front of my house and working their way into my yard.  I go out to talk to them and they say that a neighbor of mine a couple of houses down called because shes been having a sink in her house back up.  Shes called multiple plumbers out and the last one finally used a camera to determine that her house my house and the neighbor between us all shared a sewage line rather than having individual home runs to the sewage.  They were there to fix that.  About this time the plumber shows up and says Yep its a sewage problem lets go talk to this crew out by the street.  When we get back outside the foreman calls us over and says Youre having sewage problems arent you?  I nod and he says Well heres the problem.  They uncovered where the gas company had bored through my sewage line more than a year ago before we bought the house and my sewage line was shattered in the ground and just letting our sewage seep into the ground.Long story short the foreman said theyd dig back towards my house to find where the pipe wasnt cracked join onto it and run a new pipe to fix my problem since they were there to run a new homerun for me anyway.Crisis adverted.  Had we experienced the sewage backing up even a week earlier we wouldve paid someone many thousands of dollars to fix the problem and wouldve probably never recovered our money from the gas company...Point of the story is that itll be expensive to fix if you have to pay for it.,RealEstate,cqz3wrw,1,t5_2qipl

You definitely have a good handle on things thus far but a couple things to pay attention to are your towns setback requirements and making sure you have the ability to build. You already noted this and are pretty much on track. My office is out of Watertown and many of the lots are actually  square feet. But like you said you may now need more square footage to build a single family at this point because these rules constantly change and vary by community. Depending on your municipality a variance to separate a lot and having a building lot can be two very different things just make sure its kosher with the town. I would also talk to a preferred builder first to make sure you know what can be built.Secondly it doesnt sound like money is an issue but when receiving a gift you and your Father just need to pay attention to the cost because you will have to pay taxes on it.

3985070,0,t3_363owh,Either you have misunderstood what your agent said or your agent is an idiot. I am guessing that you are in an area where housing is expensive and FHA limits go up to k the limits are far lower in most places. Further I am going to assume that you already have a preapproval letter that says a lender agrees you can get an FHA mortgage on a home with a purchase price up to k if not get that ASAP dont even go looking at property without this. So here are some things that are true A large downpayment telegraphs financial security suggesting you have good odds of completing the transaction. Sure its just for show. FHA has higher property condition requirements than conventional mortgages which makes them slightly less attractive to some sellers especially if the property is not in tiptop shape. You cant buy a fixerupper with an FHA mortgage unless you also get a rehab loan but thats another story. As mentioned earlier FHA does have a limit on how expensive a property you can buy. Its not designed to put you in a mansion. If you are looking at homes that are expensive for your area you will not be able to use FHA financing. Its entirely possible this is what your agent meant. Before you step foot in a single available property make sure you have discussed your situation and the proscons of your various financing options with your mortgage expert.  RealEmpire had some good things to say about making offers.Good luck.,RealEstate,craj7vj,8,t5_2qipl

4161541,0,t3_38f8xi,First of all and not to sound too negative but I wouldnt get my hopes up. You cant be confident of how it will appraise as an appraisers opinion varies and are usually not very similar. I dont understand what you meant but I wouldnt make additional demands in a listing. It could make someone offer less or you may receive less offers. Appraisal contingencies are required if theres a mortgage involved if not  of the time most of the time and if you dont accept the appraised value the banklender wont finance it. Dont worry about secret plans expect everyone is doing their part fine as most of the time youll detect bad intentions or whatever as they come. Dont go searching for them cause you may find them regardless of their existence. Open houses welcome everyone and at the same time happen less and less. Its no longer a staple in selling and its rarely going to translate into a sale or further business. Id say the only benefit would be if a buyer came in and you end up representing him in buying some other property but the chances are low. Youll more likely get curious neighbors and people who wont qualify. Up to you really. List asap. No reason to wait unless there was one. I would usually wait for the photos to be ready before listing. Dont wait to respond to offers like that. Also sometimes theyll have like a two day window where itd be withdrawn if you dont accept or counteroffer. Reject offers you feel are too low and if you get in a multiple offer situation tell the agents of it and to make their highest and best offer. This would in turn reject said offer but youd probably get some high offers. Always inform the other agent that you have received other offers if you have or if an offer is too low. Accept the price youre comfortable with or reject everything if you think youll get a better one later waiting or not responding could be the same as rejecting and not responding could be seen as unprofessional and keep you from getting a higher offer from the offeror to reiterate what I meant.,RealEstate,crumj0t,4,t5_2qipl

As you probably know HUD properties are foreclosures. In fact theyre foreclosures of properties that had FHA loans. HUD wasnt the original lender but it has to do with the mortgage insurance. There is a  chance that a problem came up having to do with clean title to the property a dispute over who had the right to foreclose part of the foreclosure not done properly a lien that has to be cleared up. These problems usually go unnoticed until the title company starts digging into records which doesnt happen until a property is under contract.

4275548,0,t3_39wvte,Do you know how much your closing costs are going to be if you close with Buyer B? Ive seen people accept offers that are more favorable in price but once they realize how much closing costs theyre paying for the buyer it would have turned out to be more reasonable taking the lower offer since they would have netted more because of the closing costs.The main question here is really what your intentions are. If you want to close quick and potentially make less money for the sake of moving and selling your home then obviously Buyer A makes the most sense. If youre looking for more money then assuming the closing costs arent cutting too deep into your pockets then Buyer B makes more sense.Since you have multiple offers you could ask both of the buyers to submit their best and final  regardless of what has been negotiated before so long as there has been no agreement to any of these terms. You may be surprised to find that there is still wiggle room. But even if you are getting more money be careful since you certainly want your home to appraise for the purchase price so your buyers can obtain financing. You may also want to consider accepting an offer with a kickout clause allowing you to continue marketing the home. If you receive a more favorable offer the buyer with the kickout clause will have to remove hisher contingencies or in some other way beat the terms of the new offer if they still want to buy your home.On that note Im not sure what is standard in your locale or what youre using for a contract I would like to hope youre using something that was drafted andor reviewed by a licensed attorney in your state but anyone financing a home should have a financing loan commitment and inspection contingency in the contract. Even if they are preapproved the underwriting process could reveal something that wasnt made clear in the beginning and the entire deal could fall through. If your buyer signs a contract with you but doesnt plan on closing until October I would personally prefer that they receive a loan commitment as soon as possible and not wait until September to apply for financing. If something were to go wrong you would be out several months of exposure and potentially receiving another offer that were more favorable than these terms.Regardless of whether or not your wife knows this man and you trust him keep in mind that when it comes to a real estate deal what you should trust the most is the contract that is on paper. You should try to stay objective in the terms and conditions the sale and not put too much weight on whether or not you trust the person based on how he acts at work. Im not insinuating that he may turn out to be a horrid person but that there are standard concerns and considerations in a real estate deal that need to be given to someone regardless of your relationship with them.Hopefully some of this provides some useful insight.

4281927,0,t3_3a0hiq,You might THINK you could get a better rate with someone else but you havent been through underwriting with them. Your credit score and your wifes is only one part of the equation. Every lender has different requirements and these arent arbitrary things intended to screw people and increase their profits. These are marketbased penalties for risk. That broker isnt putting that money in his pocket thats the cost of doing business and finding someone for you who wants to make a loan to someone who is careless with their bills. Sure maybe it only happened once and it was a teeny amount of money but the days of lenders looking the other way at credit blemishes are behind us at least for the near future. And rightly so. Id pay it. Take responsibility for your actions.  Your wife was late. Thats unfortunate but its not the end of the world. I dont think because your broker made some statement to you that he thought he could get it worked out that this is somehow his responsibility. Its your responsibility along with your wife.

Especially a year fixed with less than  down at a high rate  PMI.But there are some advantages to what youre describing. With an investment property your tax liability will be low especially if youre not making enough to bother itemizing mortgage deductions. If you have a good deal on a rental and youre able to use that to afford a down payment on an investment property with a year fixed loan with at least  down and it is legitimately a good investment questionable these days then go for it. ,RealEstate,cs93l0j,0,t5_2qipl

If she isnt representing Peggy then you may be shit out of luck because its your job to verify everything. Also if you dont have anything in writing then its your word vs. hers. If the agent does represent Peggy and Peggy decides to move forward then see if you can get the agent to reduce her commission by a couple of grand to cover some taxes or something. Noncritical observations Also I cant figure out why you keep referring to it as earnest money. Not earnest money or earnest money. But earnest money. Why refer to her as Peggy? Is that her name? If not why change it to Peggy? ,RealEstate,csgpxqo,2,t5_2qipl

4609939,0,t3_3e57j3,I flip houses. Other commenters got the basics here is a little expansion. Discount. Im buying at a discount for many reasons Property condition makes it unfinanceable and generally too scary for most people. Buying properties with title and lien issues that need to be resolved. Buying all cash though that doesnt have as much impact as you might think. . Risk. This ties in with the discount but I made it a separate point because it is important. Im taking on the risk of fixing all the unknowns with the property. Maybe it is simple and easy but just as likely it is huge and expensive. Lenders are unwilling to lend on the property because of that risk. So I buy it and take on  of the monetary risk if there are insurmountable problems. Not every property is a winner. Everyone gets burned once in a while. I  was talking with a guy last week who I hadnt seen in a long time. His last  flips were losers. Lost k on one and k on the other. Knocked him out of the game pretty much. . Value add. Often where real money is made is in the value add. Changing something substantial about the property that significantly increases value. But you have to have the experience and vision to see those possibilities and make them happen. Zoning changes land improvement major property alterations.. Construction and Design. Im not necessarily getting things done super cheap. I pay my crews very well and I dont have time to deal with cheap subs. I pay subs less than retail but not by a huge amount. Where I really save money is making smart and efficient design decisions. I do a little customer retail work here and there and you wouldnt believe how massively inefficient it is. Everything takes  times as long and  times the cost. Homeowners are making very personal decisions about their home. Not necessarily smart decisions. They make expensive construction and finish material choices. I make calculated construction choices and buy finishes that are warehouse available and look nice but not massively expensive. . GC Profit. Remember when you hire a GC to remodel your house he is making a profit on that job. Similarly I go in and flip a house and sell it. The money I make on the sale can be seen as my GC profit for doing that remodel.As for flippers making big money. It depends. Some do some dont.

4724212,0,t3_3fm5j4,So the deal with closing costs is that the overwhelming bulk of them have nothing to do with the lender but the lender is expected to be the bearer of news.It is not unusual to send GFEs out with slightly overestimated rd party closing costs to ensure you dont come up short cash to close at the last minute. A consequence of this is that some other lenders will send out underestimated rd party closing costs to make it look like they have less closing costs. Or they maybe assume  days of prorated interest early on knowing full well that the deal will close early in the month meaning that  days is more likely. The reality is that you will not improve taxes title fees escrow fees bla bla bla by picking a new lender. You shop for taxes when you pick where you want to buy. Your realtor probably picked the title and escrow companies. You shop for homeowners insurance. If your lender has ridiculous fees by all means beat him up about it.

Ill guarantee that its a contract that you have to be out within X days of closing to get the money.  Its a cash for keys.  The bank wanted to market the property to both landlords and to private owners who wanted it as their home.  To do that they needed to be able to guarantee that they could deliver an empty property.  Thats what the paper you signed gave them.  the guarantee you would be out.  If you stay youll most likely get nothing.  Heck depending on what you signed if you stay you might end up owing them money if they stipulated a breach of contract clause.  The payment might be a graduated scale where you get k for them giving you  weeks notice k for  weeks notice etc.  It also might be that you get k if you are out at least  weeks before closing but that becomes k if you are out  week before closing and k if you are out less than  days before closing and nothing of you dont leave by closing date.It really comes down to check the contract you signed to see how and when payment will be made and what if any repercussions there are if you arent out in time.

4830300,0,t1_cu3b0yv,Yea there is a toilet it is bolted normally to the drain like like any toilet. The sump pump has an access cover that showed no activity when the toilet was flushed. So I assume its set up properly. Most of the houses that I toured were built in the early s. If a basement didnt have a bathroom there was usually a drain for it but no drain for a sink. So I imagine thats why they set up the sink that way lazy way.,RealEstate,cu3edrf,1,t5_2qipl
4835496,0,t1_cu3nsu5,gt  the sink is taking water presumably from the main house supply that is hooked up to the sewer.There are no direct connections between the water supply and the stack so as to make completely sure that any loss of water supply pressure would never ever suck gaswaterpoo from the sewage lines in the house back into the water supply lines. There is always a gap of air between a faucet and the drain that draws away wastewater from that faucet.  In any case where water might be contaminated e.g. water supply from the house going to a lawn irrigation system the water must flow through a check valve allows flow only in one direction to ensure a loss of water supply pressure cannot draw dirty water back into the house.It is possible to defeat this if you take your exterior water hose and use it to fill a bucket or pool or something and let the end of the hose dip into the water.  In that case if you happen to have a massive pressure loss in your water system its at least possible for the hose to siphon water from that container back into your house.  Which is why its important whenever using a hose to never leave it submerged in anything  if you lose water pressure you want to make sure nothing gets sucked into your system but air.Watersewer isnt a circuit like electricity theres no relationship between the amount of water coming in and the amount going back out.,RealEstate,cu41ww3,2,t5_2qipl

Id suggest you get to know the contract inside and out and ALWAYS press the buyer to release the contingencies when they expire. Thats the number one mistake FSBO sellers make and my clients tend to keep and very occasionally use those eject buttons far after they were due to expire and walk away with their earnest money. Another idea would be to hire an agent on the cheap. You can say hey I have an interested buyer so you wont have to market it just represent me and manage my transaction.

5749366,0,t3_3tw4q7,Theres two main things you do when you buy RE  both need to go into your name. The note and deed. The mortgage assumption is for the note  its going to require you signing a new note yourself. It should keep the same the interest rate terms.. basically just taking the name on the note from Joe Smith and Jane Smith to Joe Smith. It means only you promise to pay the note to Chase now. Her signature will not be on the new note therefore she is not responsible for paying it back. The assumption contingent on Chase underwriting the mortgage to just you that is do you have the income and credit to support paying this mortgage without Jane Smith contributing? is the question their underwriter is asking themselves before they allow the assumption.Title she quitclaims. Im guessing your RE attorney said that because typically the quitclaim is required as part of the divorce decree. Basically they draft a  page deed that says I Jane Smith forever quit claim my interest in xyz property to Joe Smith for  consideration. The RE attorney records it on land records amending the deed essentially to just your name. Typically I see this done at the same time the divorce papers are signed because everyones already sitting with attorneys and the wife is receiving her share of equity at the divorce closing. They file the QCD and the divorce in one swoop. Then the refinance occurs  month to  years later to sometimes foreclosureshort sale. Sometimes assumptions dont go through or the exspouse misses a payment or two during this period and isnt able to refinance. Sometimes it gets so tough the remaining spouse lets it go into foreclosure.Both of these components must occur however. If she remains on title does not quitclaim she is owed  of equity. If she remains on the note she remains liable for the mortgage  should you promise to take her off and then not and it messes up her credit that could be an issue for both of you down the road. That is she could make it your issue.,RealEstate,cx9rji2,2,t5_2qipl

5762024,0,t1_cxa9nso,gt  I go through the same emotional ride and in fact see more of what goes on in the background as the buyer.No you dont.  What a load of crap.gt Also you dont know a single thing about me so dont start saying some kind of bullshit about me just because you dont understand the real estate industry.Ive actually posted here several times about my litmus test for realtors.  If a realtor claims that their services are free then they are either one of two things.Probably they are an idiot that simply lacks experience enough that they are just regurgitating NAR BS and have not actually had a chance to think about how commissions work and how broken the system of buying and selling real estate is in the US.  This is probably not someone that you want to work with unless you like idiots.The second choice is that they are a liar they know that the buyer and seller are both getting the shaft and that the broken system for real estate is protected by one of the largest lobbying groups in the country and they are happy to perpetuate this lie since it serves them well.  Obviously this person is even worse than the idiot unless of course you enjoy being lied to or cheated.So you are correct when you say that I dont know a single thing about you I do however know that you are either an idiot or a liar and since I dont know you I decided to give you the benefit of the doubt and went with idiot.

Credit Law Center is the company I use  a law firm that specializes in credit repair and charges only for items that are actually deleted  per item per credit bureau where it has been reported. Paying your mothers medical expenses is not a good plan at all. You may want to look into having her put on medicaid if she cannot support herself.

The sellers moving equipment on the day of closing have the right to as well since its once again not your property. There isnt any damages caused to you since your property sounds fine not one complaint about your property theyre selling to you. As for the changing value thats always negotiable but most likely if they dont agree i wouldnt blame them. I really dont see anything deception here. They told you there was going to be development thats not deceptive. Theres no law saying they have to tell you what it being developed especially since it doesnt directly effect your property. You couldve always asked! If they lied to you about a living space being built and then a school or something popped up and they knew then yeah thats deceptive.If youre looking for spacious K and woodlands check out Florida.

This tells me that you did not provide your own contracts put in the blood sweat and tears to learn how to complete a HUD contract that is a challenge in itself that you would NEVER get completed on your own by the way since you CANNOT access it without that agent that didnt deserve to get paid for helping you the actual entry INTO the house that you wouldnt have had without that agent the actual contract forms that you would not have without that agent and the agents knowhow that you didnt even realize kept things on track along the way so that neither party did something illegal with or without realizing it.

At least in my market interest is generally generated through online marketing Zillow Realtor.com etc. and in relation to this a proper and complete listing in he MLS networking with other agents and your own buyer pool depending on the property targeted online marketing social media and otherwise and good old fashioned signage. Unless your agent is just not doing anything its tough to say what you can do.  Post the property to your local home buyers Facebook group. Post it on Craigslist. Be sure it is shown in the best light on all the syndicated websites. Be sure it is always in tip top show ready condition.

Another way of saying this is the market will not make up for your poor purchase decision  so if between purchase  reno you have more money in the house than youd like to get your desired profit guess what you wont be making as much profit and that could very well mean a negative profit. If you price the house higher than your current market conditions will realistically support just because thats what you NEED it to sell for  it will sit and sit and sit on the market.

The banks underwriters are the ones who will make the final decision.If you want the strongest type of preapproval possible you need to talk to a bank that offers preunderwriting.

6169337,0,t1_cyqljhc,Clients hire me for many reasons negotiation skills are one of them for some clientstransactions.  However the overwhelming majority of my clients hire me to sell or buy a house to keep an eye on the finances involved so that they dont get ripped off and to help them through the process so that we can close escrow.  Most of them do not wish to take advantage of the other party and I wont help people who do and they trust me to keep them within a reasonable margin so that all parties feel it was a winwin.  My professionalism marketing advertising amp transaction competencies and honesty are far more valued by my clients than negotiation skills which I am also very good at due to the aforementioned competencies. Even though youve been duped to think that negotiation skills are a driving force in an agents skill set you should be aware that negotiations are rarely present in a clients testimonial.  This applies to all agents.  A testimonial will frequently say heshe had my best interests in mind... but clients dont say wow they were a super negotiator... Why?  Because negotiations are  objective and  dependent on whether the client agrees with the proposed negotiation which is an incredibly complicated consideration.  It depends on the clients goals timelines financial position etc. and it is rarely the agents job to say yes or no to a proposition without presenting it to the principal.  If an agent presents a counter offer without substantiation theyre not likely to get much cooperation.  If they present it with good evidencereason theyre highly likely to get cooperation.  Hiring an agent for their negotiation skills is a joke a person is much better to hire based on professional competency.In dual agency it would be unfair to leverage one client against the other so I do not negotiate for them. In that instance Im more of a conduit for communication more of a mediator but make no mistake that each of their best interests are represented.  I do advise in order to keep them within the margins of what is customary to my area and as long as I give the same advice I would have in a single agency scenario... all is well.  As youre an appraiser I would expect that you understand the ease in which we can value a property understand the market direction and weigh in on what is and is not fair.  I feel youre acting as though real estate is highly subjective???What youre missing is that acting in one persons best interest can be done when you realize that the Buyer and Seller are not opposing interests. Quite the opposite really they both want to close escrow agreed?  Youre likely getting hung up on the financial side incorrectly thinking that maximizing seller profit or minimizing buyer purchase price is the only driving force behind acting in one persons best interest. Its not.  Most people prefer a winwin so that they can feel good walking away from it while also decreasing the chances of being sued.  Understanding the objective nature of pricing its easy to communicate to both sides of a dual agency and keep them within the small subjective margin.How do you define a clients interests?  Is it not different in every case? Youre assumption that its all about the money especially given the fact that the marginal difference is less than  is where youre missing.  I get it you think were only doing it for more commission again your cynicism should be checked.  The elimination of an agent which can remove poor competency communication ethics etc is beneficial to both Seller and Buyer if you understand that their interests are to complete the transaction.Depending on your personal financial position and philosophy you may or may not be able to understand this.  A poor college student likely wont be able to but a well established and financially solvent person will understand that it easily can be done without compromising anything.There are people out there driven by greed who want the highest and best terms when selling or the lowest and best terms when buying even at the expense of the other party and theyll ignore customary proceedings. For those people dual agency is indeed not appropriate and on a personal note those people can go to hell.  The majority of people are far from that philosophy.It is indeed challenging to sway an opinion of a person whose mind is already made up but with any luck you might understand that there are circumstances where dual agency is to the benefit of Seller Buyer and Agent.  Either way it matters not... good luck.,RealEstate,cyqw1i3,1,t5_2qipl

6509846,0,t3_44smxl,I have worked a lot of transactions where the foundation is called out in an inspection. One thing you can take a look at is how the soil slopes towardsor away the foundation. Lots of moisture in the soil can cause earth to expand when moist and contrast when dry. This can cause stress on interior and exterior walls over time. Proper drainage is the key here if you can drain water away from the soil in contact with the home you may slow down the rate of decay in the foundation. With you being a renter in this home you probably already know if the home has good drainage. If not this could be something you request before the purchase? It is rare to see a home that does not have some sort of cracks or deterioration in the foundation. I have had inspectors tell me that anything under  inch wide in most cases is not cause for alarm however I would recommend you pay to have a specialist take a look especially if there are multiple cracks.Worst I have seen was a  foundation retrofit.. It was a home in the hills that was on stilts. The foundation was reinforced with something like  anchors.

Simply call your lender and ask them to review your value. You will be given full appraisal or a less intense BPO you will pay for either but the BPO will be cheaper if they let you choose. If the value is proven to have reached the  ratio the MI will automatically drop. There is no need for a full refinance unless you can lower your rate at the same time. ,RealEstate,d06t458,4,t5_2qipl

Would this be your first investment  Ok I would do research about the following investment expenses  first to make sure you can create a positive cash flow. . What is the rent like in your area and in those high rise apartments? . What are the following monthly expenses like mortgage payment  interest taxes insurance property management if you choose to use  HOA fees  maintenance  vacancies. . If you subtract these monthly expenses from the monthly rental income do you have money left over? If yes thats a positive cash flow. If no you should keep looking for properties.In terms of the location it sounds like you have it down which is great. The other thing you want to ask yourself is do you know about becoming a landlord and are you ready to be one? Using a property management company is an option but if this is your first investment I think you should spare the cost and save the property management company later down the road when you have more properties hopefully  and have built more equity.Finally can you expect a good appreciation  years from now? Honestly it sounds like you have a really good opportunity in front of you. Ive never been to Minneapolis but if your research continues to be promising I wish you the best.

So if you find an appraiser who is clueless enough to go along with that Id wonder what else they are going along with to please the lender. Lender  is not far off from that what is done in a workmanlike manner anyway? Looks good from the outside? I have always refused to use those weasel words in my appraisals. How do I know the electrical wiring isnt being held together inside the walls with scotch tape or if they even used the right wiring? Arizona is full of workmen from south of the border who have never heard of a building code let alone read one although we also have plenty of them who do better work than some natives to be sure. If I know for sure it was not permitted it gets valued like any other nonpermitted space. Usually if one person is doing it its not hard to find a few comps with nonpermitted space. Not going to be a fun appraisal. If I suspect its not permitted but cant tell for sure and no one will admit it then I value it asif it was permitted and tell the lender to verify it or the value of my report may differ.

But its your choice. You will need to be really good at dealing with people. Not all of them nice not all of them bright. I have a good realtor friend and whenever we meet for lunch she tells me stories that make me laugh like people who think its OK to ask her for a ride etc because shes not really working. One time someone asked if shed stop by and pick up their dry cleaning as she was heading over to their house since it was on her way small town theyd give it to her. Shes very good at letting these things not get to her and with saying no with such a smile that you cant be mad. But its a skill you learn. Not everyones personality is suited for that. Id want to punch those jokers in the face no thanks. You can structure your business however you want if you are fairly disciplined and serious about it. you can create your own structure.

6752341,0,t1_d0hojzu,Thats a tough question to answer but here is my perspective as a Realtor in a orangehot market.Even if its just a little hot market conditions can fluctuate up and down quickly. Sometimes appraisers really have to take this into consideration. Last year I did  transactions that my colleagues were sure would never appraise for contract price I was criticized for not negotiating well enough.  were Buyers and  was a Seller. The  Buyers appraised for  over asking price and  over asking price. The seller appraised at contract I was told several time I was at best  over comps. These were very seasoned people saying this. My point is that pricing is ALWAYS opinion to some extent. Some Realtors like to be conservative because they know that low pricing will get a price war if its too low sell fast at asking if its just right or sell eventually for below if its too high after dealing with lots of phone calls from the sellers.,RealEstate,d0hqzjw,2,t5_2qipl

6841512,0,t1_d0rpnsx,Your argument makes the assumption that home prices will remain at k levels once mortgage interest rates begin to rise.  Its possible that wont be the case heres whyAssume in a simplified situation your local real estate market sells a lot of property via standard  mortgages.  In this market the buyers primary consideration for how much house they can buy is decided by their monthly mortgage payment.  Now in keeping with simplification lets assume yr mortgage rates will increase from  at the start of  to  by the end  thats going to cause a . increase in monthly mortgage payments thus reducing the affordability of the original sticker prices of local housing forcing them to come down.Again all of the above is a simplification of how interest rates could affect home values.  There are other factors to consider such as increasedecrease in buyer demand the presence of allcash buyers in which mortgage rates do not apply etc.  This is the sort of insight that a real estate professional may be able to provide for your specific local situation.edit my point is overall dont let the appeal of low mortgage rates drive your decision to enter the market.

This is slightly CA specific but TX likely has a similar license verification systemIdentify  Agents for Interviews  the simple act of interviewing multiple agents will help you steer clear of new incompetent or unethical agents. If your first three dont pan out find three more. Find one at an open house one through mail advertisements and one with a recent sale in your target area.ampnbspCheck Their License  visit  to verify that they have at least  years of experience and no disciplinary action.ampnbspCheck Their Productivity  Call their broker to receive a printout of recent production. Ideally you want someone who is always in escrow which typically means  transactions per year. Any less and you may be dealing with a part timer or moonlighterampnbspSchedule Interviews  set at least  minutes aside and conduct these interviews somewhere besides your home. Firmly instruct each of them that you will not be selecting an agent until a predetermined later date. If you let them know you will not be signing up or committing during the interview and they attempt to push you toward a commitment run dont walk. Boundaries and communication are very important aspects and if the agent doesnt understand this chances are theyll treat you like a number. Their value proposition either stands up on its own or it doesntampnbspInterview with These Questions  Each should be framed to cover the previous  monthsWhere is your area of expertise? They probably looked you up so dont be surprised if they mention your neighborhood. Ideally their focus area should be within a mile radius of your home and they will have to prove this.What is your approximate listing accuracy? Make sure they provide you a number comparing the sold price to the original list price. You dont want someone outside a  margin of error.  is ideal because theyre not under or over pricing their listings.How many of your listings needed a price reduction? Top agents will need price reductions on less than  of their listings and they likely have detailed explanations for these instances where they were off.How many of your listings expired? You dont really want any expired listings as it can mean the agent will take a listing solely to have their sign in your yard. Allow for  but probe for more information as to why and consider it a red flag.Do you offer a listing cancellation agreement? Ideally they will include cancellation rights in the event that youre not happy.Tell me about your marketing process The best agents will have a clear description of how they do what they do and there should be several activities beyond placing your home in the Multiple Listing Service.What services do you provide which set you apart from other agents? This will vary and should be used as a tie breaker.ampnbspTest Their Communication and Follow Up  Upon completion of the interview ask them to send you an email showing their recent production on a spreadsheet and on a map and to provide references from recent clients. Be specific on when they expect to provide this information to you. If an agent cannot meet this basic commitment it should be a red flag in regard to professionalism and communication.ampnbspGood Luck!Edit  In TX depending on the price point you might want to see someone who does  transactions per year and if you need someone good Im happy to recommend someone just PM me...  as youre probably curious I belong to a national network that offers the best agents in each area.  Itll help you steer clear of the sleezy salesperson and will increase your chances of finding someone trustworthy and honest.  As long as we cross reference their professionalism and productivity using the above methods... Itll likely be a top contender.  lmk. ,RealEstate,d1aokn0,4,t5_2qipl

This is just a quick and dirty calculation.However what you can pull and what the bank thinks you can pull are two different things since they consider debt to income ratios in the decision.The banks still think  x income  max home value you can afford.

7312407,0,t3_4fhenj,I worked evictions for the banks for years and years and I can tell you that what will happen next to your moms property will not be pretty.At sqft the task of eviction will be daunting but not impossible.  The person holding that shark loan is probably salivating at the moment.  First a notice of default will arrive. Most people at ksqft often ignore this or immediately remedy it.  Sounds like this wont be the case with your mom.Thirty days later depending on the state a notice of foreclosure will be taped to her door and mailed to her.  Thirty days after that it will most likely go to auction depending on that the lender saysdoes.Given debt to value ratio of the home someone will most likely buy it at auction if not the bank will take it back.  Either way the eviction standards will remain the same.After notice of sale will come notice of eviction.  Another  days will pass.  On that date if nothing has been done or remedied a crew like mine will take everything she owns and place it on the curb.  Everything.  If she is really lucky she will have a sheriff that will allow it to be stored inside the property for  days or so.  After that it will all belong to whomever bought the property.  Every single item in the house will belong to a third party or the bank.Most likely everything will be thrown away.  Our crews will rifle through all of her stuff gut anything of value and sell the rest.  Despite any sort of yelling or legal wrangling she will be left very much penniless. Then and only then will she realize the colossal fuck up that she just made for herself and she will turn to her children for support.  I have seen it dozens of times and I can tell you it never ends well for either party.Best sell it sooner rather than later I dont care how you have to do it. ,RealEstate,d29dd14,4,t5_2qipl

When you inherit a tenant that you didnt screen and they dont have rent by the allotted date start the eviction proceeding. Sometimes simply initiating it with the notice is enough  theyll pay the rent and late fee. Worst case  you file the eviction keep security and hopefully limit your losses.

7561547,0,t3_4iw5cu,Some things to look out for Knob and tube electrical wiring. The house is the right age for it. Active knob and tube can mean difficulties getting loans andor insurance. Buried oil tanks. They had no idea about the damage these could cause. Cleanup of a leaking tank can be tens of thousands of dollars. Asbestos. Yeah high likelihood of there being asbestos in there especially wrapping the radiator pipes if there are any. If you see something that looks like white corrugated cardboard thats likely asbestos. Also  x  floor tiles have asbestos but its not as big of a problem as its not likely to become airborne. Lead paint. Yep especially on window and door frames. Lead paint was used for its durability. You can get an Xray inferometer test done figure on spending several hundred for that test alone. If you have any renovation work done make sure the company you hire does the required testing. Lead pipes. This is a bigger issue if they are on the supply side. Lead drain pipes arent really a problem other than they are old. Id be more worried about galvanized pipes these corrode from the inside out and can look perfect from the outside but be paperthin and ready to burst. Plaster walls. Not sure if the walls are plaster or drywall? Try pushing a thumb tack into the wall. If it penetrates its drywall. If not its plaster. Plaster walls are more expensive to repair. Sloped floors. Its an old house it will likely have settled over the years. Bring a marble or other smooth ball and put it in the middle of a floor it will help determine if the floor is level. Most old houses have already settled as much as they ever will barring geological changes its part of their charm. Radon. Old houses were leaky drafty and benefited from lots of air circulation venting gases from the house. If the house has been buttoned up in the intervening years and you hope it has you should do a radon test at some point.,RealEstate,d31pmi1,10,t5_2qipl

Its Sunday pick up the local paper and see how many openings there are for leasing agent. Unlike the overwhelming majority of real estate agents youd even get an hourly wage and benefits in addition to a small bonus for leasing units. However you need to think very very very carefully about the idea of lose your job and lose your home too.It would be a good idea for you to research what goes on in the daytoday life of an agent. I think you might have some unrealistic ideas about what an agent does all day. Talk to some agents in your area. Talk to some brokers. Reliable transportation is absolutely key for an agent not an apartment person. You wont lease or sell anything unless you can get around town and the bus wont cut it.

Unless there is a ton of traffic or noise that comes with that its probably not going to have any impact at all at least in my area it would not. Condos arent going to be comparables for your house either so same logic  if they bring a ton of traffic or noise that might be bad. But sometimes they can also attract new businesses and all of a sudden youve got a little hip trendy urban thing going on that might be good for your values. But no one can really answer your question without knowing your market. In my market neither of those things are going to be a big deal either way. Over time you might get a little more or less appreciation than you would if it stayed a school but this depends on how your market is trending anyway. If the area is in decline leaving it asis is probably the worst thing for values but eventually someone will see the land use possibilities and then you get into revitalization and gentrification. ,RealEstate,d3t7cs2,2,t5_2qipl

So to purchase a house with the same monthly payment the purchase price must be lower.  This will put downward pressure on prices says conventional wisdom.  Historically  interest rates have risen during times of economic expansion or inflation.   In these times more money is available to the average home buyer ergo no downward pressure on home prices because that which prompted the interest rate increase also prompts home price increases.

What I may not be communicating well is that if I am your seller agent selling your house and you want me to put it on Zillow Ill do that but it can hurt you.Your goal isnt to have  people see your house. Your goal is to have one person buy it. Right? Think about what happens when people look for houses. They browse listings and the look for things they dont like. Its easy to discard most listings based on things we do not want  a price too high condition too poor wrong area etc. When something looks great to a buyer they look closer for what might be wrong with it. Ugly wallpaper weird coloration on the wall in the basement photo. If they cant find any reason to rule it out theyll want to see it. Zillow gives a lot more information which makes it easier for people to rule out houses. So now when people see your home its a driveby most of the time where people used to stop and ask about it. Think about that for a moment. If someone stops and asks about your home they may still get the information that would have caused them to rule it out but it might be delivered with information that helps them rule it back in. Theres no way to address their objections if theyre doing a driveby view though because we dont find out what those objections are. And when we dont know what the objections are its harder to sell.

8039503,0,t3_4pc3k4,gt it would take me . years to earn the amount of money in rent than I would get for selling the house today.Thats not a good comparison because youre not counting the fact that you still would sell the house . years later.Rental properties are a type of investment so you should treat them as such with your calculations. If you sold today and you got  after whatever costs you incurred selling it youd have  which youd invest somewhere else and get some forecasted return. Say you invest in the stock market and get  average return after fees over those . years you would have somewhere around  minus taxes after that time. Stock market returns have been somewhat consistent over time periods of that length usually returning somewhere around  so  after taxes and fees is probably not a terrible estimate. If you kept the house and kept renting it you can generate some estimate of how much money youd have after that time as well. That calculation is going to be complex and probably have more unknowns than a stock market estimate. Youd need to consider the potential change in property value and associated rent you can charge taxes repairs development that occurs in the neighborhood if you can include depreciation of the property vacancy rates blah blah blah you get the idea. If the property was already being rented dig up the records for the past few years to get an idea of the income and expenses of the property. It should give you a good starting point for how much the property is making.If youre not interested in being a landlord or you think you can make more money putting it somewhere else this is more likely the case if youd use a management company then it probably makes sense to sell it and invest elsewhere.,RealEstate,d4jprmf,7,t5_2qipl

Some lenders use AMCs who hire the cheapest appraiser they can find and when someone comes from far away that is often a sign of that. Many good appraisers refuse work from shitty AMCs. But the cheap guy from the next county doesnt always have access to the local mls you have to pay for this. They should decline the assignment but they dont care if they do a slop job. So please file a complaint.  The good appraisers in your area will thank you.  Also  lenders are responsible for the quality of the appraisals they rely on.

And they can retroactively change the FreddyFanny guidelines at any moment to be longer or shorter than  years without being able to borrow.Second of all feel free to shop around!!!! That up front cost does not sound OK in my opinion. Mine did it for free well he took some commission out of the sale but it was not out of my pocket and he took it after closing. I paid zero dollars up front or at closing. Thats the point right? If you are doing a short sale you are insolvent. Are you in So cal by any chance? PM if you need contact info for my guy. Hes good. He did really good marketing photos and sold it quickly within two months to an all cash investor. He helped me with all the crazy paperwork and explanations needed by the bank.Again..... dont do a short sale if you can possibly avoid it in any way. Looking back now I would have made it happen and waited out the market another couple of years to sell at a price where I could break even or even bring k to closing to make it a normal sale. ,RealEstate,d4tcm55,5,t5_2qipl

If you find the time. Or you can take it to a mechanic who can achieve a safe consistent result in less time but for more money. You can DIY almost anything and have a shot at it coming out ok sometimes great even. But the reason most people leave anything to a professional is because of the opportunity cost of taking the extra time to do it themselves. Maybe your time is worth more money and prestige when spent at your job or more personally valuable when spent with family and hobbies.

8153383,0,t3_4qtes2,They need to provide a written notice to make any kind of evictionvacate premise legal. Verbal notices do not suffice according to the law for your state. This doesnt fall under an eviction yet in my opinion since you are current with rent and havent received a written notice to vacate. Also evictions are done through the court system. To get an eviction you would need to stay past the  days from the date of a written notice to vacate. The landlord will then initiate eviction process via a lawsuit and thats when it will appear on your credit report. But a notice to vacate the propertyterminate the lease does not affect your credit report. Here are the actual lawsLink I have a feeling what they are doing is verbally telling you when you need to be out as a heads up and then three days before you need to be out  youll receive a written notice. Unfortunately since the landlord is only required to serve a  day written notice to you you may be in a tight spot as it sounds like youll have to vacate the property before August th. I would work on securing a temporary housing solution. If you stay in the property past the  days from the written notice to vacate  you will be in the wrong legally and you will have more to worry about than just an eviction notice. Until the landlord sends you a written notice you are fine  just work on moving into another place in the meantime. ,RealEstate,d4wpy6z,1,t5_2qipl

9116047,0,t3_553mlb,Commercial Real Estate Appraiser here.TLDR Buy it. Buy it now. Or if not I will.So Ill start off saying that Ive appraised more than two dozen mobile home parks and I think theyre one of the most solid investments you can make outside of selfstorage facilities. In my market the average listing period for MHPs is under three months and a lot of them sell without listing at all. There are national investors out there hunting these things down.My thoughtsUpsides Lotonly rent is exactly what you want. Very little overhead very little maintenance and the tenants tend to hold their homes and lots to a higher degree of maintenance since they own them. You might be tempted to go hunting down old mobile homes and renting them out but hold off let the tenants bring theirs in. Itll save you a massive headache down the road. Note theres a whole game behind buying old units renovating them and selling them to new tenants but its not one for the faint of heart. If you manage to rehab an old singlewide it will still look like a rehab surrounded by modern latemodel doublewides. Old people money is stable  money. Compared to an all ages park  parks are seen as a much more solid investment. The tenant treat the park with more care they always pay their rent they dont make a lot of noise and they have a habit of building a very tightknit community which will practically manage itself. If you can move towards all  youre golden. Four year payoff!!! Thats a  cap rate assuming you accounted for expenses which is insane. I usually use a . to . cap rate net operating income  purchase price. This means that your income stream compared to your purchase price is nearly x greater than traditional parks. If you didnt include expenses in your estimate youre still in the money as expenses are traditionally very low for MHPs as Ill explain below. You might want to check the math on that but you could be looking at a killer deal. Expenses Ill touch on this since its the top comment at the moment. Expense ratios expenses vs. gross profit are usually very low comparatively for mobile home parks due to the relative lack of infrastructure. Since youll have a steady income stream from the inplace tenants you should be able to save up enough to cover any necessary maintenance. Like was already mentioned your largest nonoperating expense will be maintenance on roads and utilities.  Management This expense deserves its own mention. Management expenses are not a big deal if its a small park. You can mange it yourself or you could hire a tenant to manage. If its a  park there are likely to be a few seniors with alot of time on their hands and a nack for organization. Cut them a deal on their rent and youre good to go. If its a larger park you can hire an offsite management company to handle things usually at about  to  of EGI. Again not terrible. Turnover Other comments mentioned turnover. If youre currently running full occupancy you can bet there will be people lining up to move in. If someone dies have their relatives list the home for sale and boom free marketing and a new tenant.  Future Opportunities Many cities are enacting moratoriums on MHPs which puts a huge upward pressure on demand. People who live in MHPs... well... live in MHPs. You will always have business due to decreasing supply. Additionally land has a habit of increasing in value and down the line when youre tired of running a MHP you can scrape the site and sell it for far more than you likely paid for it. The R Word Recession. Traditional investors hate it MHP investors love it. People living in MHPs are already on the low end of the rent scale and not to generalize too much they tend to have rather stable income be it social security Section  drug sales etc. This means when the next recession hits should be in about late  your investment will likely be safe.DownsidesThe downsides are exactly what you would expect MHPs are nonglamorous investment properties with nonglamorous tenants in nonglamorous locations. The tenants might be flakey the infrastructure might be shoddy and you could be walking into a bookkeeping nightmare. But with some elbow grease a handyman and a few eviction letters you could turn just about any park into a solid investment.Good luck. If you have any questions let me know. ,RealEstate,d87lnpi,68,t5_2qipl

A successful sale involves properly marketing the property often on the mls with good pics and description and properly pricing the property. Price too high and people wonder what is wrong with your property after its been sitting there for  months. Price too low and leave money on the table.Another point  if your house offers the buyers agent less than the standard  they usually recieve you can be certain the buyers agent will be less likely to show or recommend your house.All that said redfin could provide a great service  I am not familiar enough to comment.,RealEstate,d8p8555,1,t5_2qipl

Dont get pissed at her as sales are hard and she feels dicked but the answer here is real easy  and repeat after me and tell her  you want your own representation. Realtors are kinda like attorneys  she represents the best interest of her clientssellers and your realtor represents your best interest. Mind you that anything you said to her could go directly to the sellers because of this representation  which is also why its good to get your own.TLDR Have the realtor you want to represent you call the listing agent and tell them that you chose to have your own representation.

Your mortgage has a rate of ..So your balance should be around k which is not far off from appraisal. You could owner finance to someone who has bad credit or no credit due to self employment or previous credit issues. Youd have to vet them make sure they have a good job etc. but for whatever reason their credit sucks and they cant qualify for a home.Heres the deal you owner finance for  over appraisal which is k. Ask for  down and negotiate a rate. I set it to be  and set the payment to be . So thats basically a note value of k that gets paid off in  years. You have  years left on your condo note so youll get an extra  payments of  once the note on the condo gets paid off. There are third party owner financing companies that service the note and make sure its all DoddFrank compliant. If you really want to grease the wheels you could drop the owner finance payment to  and possibly take a larger down payment instead. Another option... You set the down payment to be large enough to cover your refinance cost then you refinance and your monthly payment drops to   for  year mortgage. Now youre making  spread a month.  uaardy please let me know if I missed something I see you here a lot.PS OP youd probably hate yourself for blowing your savings if you go the original route.,RealEstate,d92cn4j,7,t5_2qipl

Its not uncommon. housing prices move in cycles and may come down when you have the money to just into the market.. remember that manymost do not put  down.  I have two houses neither of which I bought with  down  and .  Its ideal but not required.. expect that this will take time. expect that you might be buying a crappy first house or in a not so great but hopefully up and coming area if you do your research. maybe based on your income and location you just cant buy a house.  Maybe you can buy a small condo or  bed townhouse.  Many people do that because they cant afford detached housing. Plain and simple not everyone in the US can afford to buy a house.. maybe you need to move someplace cheaper.  Thats what my wife and I did.  We decided Seattle was getting too crowded and expensive and we couldnt afford a home so we moved to a cheaper place in another state and got new jobs. This was not an easy process as we left all our family and friends behind and moved someplace with no family and knowing no one. It was a huge sacrifice but we wanted to own a home with a couple acres not a small condo.  Prices were cheaper where we moved and so we bought a cheap  sq ft house that we werent thrilled with.  Then saved some more and bought a dream house and turned the first house into a rental.  . good luck.  you can come up with a solution but its going to take time and patience.  ,RealEstate,d9k2fn5,2,t5_2qipl

9504207,0,t1_d9kki01,You can make an FHA appraisal subject to repairs. I do it all the time. Its just that for FHA there are specific guidelines that appraisers must adhere to with respect to what should be conditioned for repair.If the roof is just older but still functional and has a remaining useful life then no it cant be conditioned for repair. Or at least the appraiser wont condition the appraisal on it. If on the other hand the roof is leaking and a bedroom ceiling has caved in and theres mold growth and water damage like the FHA appraisal I finished yesterday yeah subject to repairs.With respect to the factual inaccuracies thing...if there enough of them and some of them are related to issue that affect market value then the credibility of the report is in question. For most lenders just saying hey this is incorrect isnt going to be enough to trigger anything. You need to explain with supporting market based data how those mistakes are mistakes to things that affect value. Yeah just having mistakes makes the appraiser look sloppy but usually nobody does anything about that. If the mistakes are material to value then you have something. But you need to show it not just claim it.Again unfortunately demonstrating the impact of inaccuracies or poor comp selection is probably going to be tricky on your own which is why it might be worth hiring another appraiser for a private appraisal that you can glean information from. In my market for a noncomplex private appraisal I usually charge . So expect something in that range but your market might be different. Unfortunately if you sincerely believe the home is undervalued and you really want that house its either get the data to support your opinion by spending a few hundred dollars if you need help compiling the data or fork over the thousands of dollars youre short based on the appraisal you have.,RealEstate,d9klgui,2,t5_2qipl

If they do not have another unit ask if they have a preferred hotel that you should stay in and inquire if it can be billed directly to them.  Basically come at it like it is assumed they will be providing alternate arrangements.  If they bulk call the health department and complain.As far as your stuff goescall your insurance agent ASAP.  They should deal with cleaning or pay to replace your items.  Do not throw anything away until everything has been fully documented with your insurance.,RealEstate,daqy6fv,1,t5_2qipl

9894977,0,t3_5h2k4i,Once you find a house it typically takes  to buyclose on it.First step is to get a good real estate agent.  Ask for referrals or look online for agents with lots of good reviews.  A good agent is honest with you and will point out flaws and structural problems with the homes you look at.  In that price range nothing is going to be perfect but make sure you work with someone you trust...a good agent will keep you from putting in an offer and wasting money on an inspection on a house that has glaring issues inspectors will help you find many other things but some are obvious enough that you should be aware before even writing an offer. Have your agent refer you to a good mortgage lender and get yourself preapproved for a loan.  Then start looking at homes. If the market is decent and you are not insanely picky it should take the average person no more than  weeks to find something to buy.  Good luck!

9932351,0,t3_5hqhor,Ive helped my mom rent her house twice now using different property managers and twice now the experience was horrible. PM was new to the game he was incommunicado most of the year and misrepresented repairs that were done tenants shuffling in and out and then disappeared completely at the end when we told him we would not be renewing with him causing some trouble with timing and security deposit. Next we went with the old Pros in town. They ignored repairs that became a major issue they missed significant damages to the home when the tenants moved and they forgot about re renting the house when their tenants moved out after a year. We literally had to call and tell them that they needed to list the house somewhere or at least put a sign up that said for rent. I think a friend that took a basic course could have done better. That said just vet anyone through their other clients or at least their education on the subject.

He is required to disclose any property deaths?

Really it just boils down to appearances and what facts we glean from OPs posts. But Im sticking by my initial reaction and that is to get a better idea of Tax Lady and Lawyer Sons motives.

10252911,0,t1_dc66j72,gt I thought agents are supposed to do the leg work instead of me and present the facts.I can do that. I can tell you that Joe next door is a registered sex offender but after you move in you find that Jenny next door is also a sex offender and I did not tell you that because my research did not show that. You can now sue me. You bet that has happened in the past sex offenders permits square footage school zone etc So to protect ourselves I can provide you with the info but as a disclaimer I will always tell you that I am not an expert consult with two more sources. gtits yet another reason to avoid using real estate agents.You probably think I am a  year old realtor I am probably younger than you I am in my early s a millennial who grew up seeing Uber putting taxi drivers out of business travel agents going out of business Airbnb radically changing hospitality industry so I am a part of the generation that would love homebuying to be a point and click industry like online shopping. But trust me as an insider in the industry its easier said than done. Redfin Zillow and Trulia were the last radical disrupters in the industry and it has been a decade since they even innovated. One of them is a brokerage and makes money when people buy and sell using their real estate agents and the other two sell ad spaces to real estate agents so they depend on them to make money. They have combined raised more than a billion dollars you would think with the money being thrown at them or to several other real estate disrupters somebody by now would have made home buying an online shopping esque experience. There is too much money being paid to real estate agents   billion yearly in commissions for somebody to not want to disrupt the model and get a piece of the pie. If it has not been done during the golden age of real estate innovation   thats when Redfin Zillow and Trulia were founded it tells you something.  But your free to not use agents though your not obligated by law to use them there has and always be a small group of people that will be diy and not use agents. gtSo far all you guys are allowed to do is talk to other agents punch the code into the lock box and open doors.Most agents do just that. Thats about  agents of agents in your market. And guess what those agents are not doing much business at all. The top  percent of agents in your market are doing  percent of the business how are they doing so much business? because they are good they get referrals from happy clients  referrals are the bread and butter for many and they do much more than what you mentioned. It is on you to find a top  percent realtor.  I advise my clients on what is a fair price to offer by offering detailed pricing analysis offer suggestions on what it might take to win a multiple offer situation negotiate with the sellers post inspection make sure your earnest money deposit is protected in escrow. In todays world I believe that a realtors value  is predominantly post mutual acceptance all you mentioned is pre mutual acceptance a monkey could open doors for you. Thats the real easy part heck many realtors have their hourly wage assistants do that. The value of a good realtor now is in their transactional expertise it used to be informational expertise  before the internet age  and you get to see that only post mutual acceptance.  ,RealEstate,dc682bt,4,t5_2qipl

10320364,0,t3_5no911,It might take a while for land being held in an estate to be put up for sale and if there are multiple heirs that could complicate things further. Assuming the family is willing and able to sell you would need to find out from your town if the lot is indeed a separately taxed lot and wasnt combined with the rest of the property. You would also need to find out from the town what the requirements are to build some may have minimum lot size minimum distance to property lines etc. You will need a soil test before you can start the process of digging a well. If the street is on city water and sewer be prepared to have to hook up to those. In many areas its not optional and it is prohibitively expensive to hook up after the fact.You are correct that you will probably have to pay cash for the undeveloped lot. Do some research into the cost of building a home it is typically more expensive to build than to buy and you will have to get a construction loan with a bank which is a slightly different process than applying for a traditional mortgage.,RealEstate,dcdvbsd,3,t5_2qipl

You say your not paying buyer agent commissions and buyer says they arent either and they go buy another house. sold  Best option is to pay a flat fee listing agent bc  listing agents are going extinct.

10682452,0,t3_5sty8o,Ive contemplated putting them in many of my higher end flips and rentals.At the end of the day the biggest concern and issue with these systems is that they require an internet connection and the security to prevent them from being hacked is simply substandard.  Even a relatively bad hacker can get in these systems.  Compounding the problem is if your company gives out the password to the wireless network.  Once in the network it is even easier to hack these door locks and open them.  Heres a CNET article  I hope to see these get better security on the software side but until then I really would be very careful about adding these.

10697425,0,t3_5t0edh,When we bought in Alaska years ago the inspection of the heated garage turned up hidden things but not as serious as mold. As in deliberately hidden by the seller. It was a heated garage with finished walls down to about . feet off the groundI guess at that point the insulationdrywall doesnt matter for heating a garage. Our inspector thought it was weird that there was plywood all along the side walls nailed to the drywall. Thankfully it hadnt been nailed very well. He was able to pry it away from the wall on one side and thats when we discovered huge gouges in the cement wall. Turns out the seller had been leaving their Siberian Huskies in the garage during the work day and Huskies are DIGGERS when theyre bored or playful or just in the mood. The sellers were trying to get out of paying to fill in the cement seriously I think it ended up costing them  by boarding over the walls. Were talking x  deep holes all along the walls. Thank goodness for our inspector!You should totally ask to have part of the drywall removed. Its not that expensive to get it rehunga few hundred dollars for halfwalls when we had it done last where there had been panels along the walls of one room and we had the paneling removed and it destroyed the drywall underneath. And if there is mold back there theyll have to rip it down anyway for remediation I think. AND they have to disclose the mold now anyway or at least they would in Alaska Ohio and Maryland where weve bought so Im assuming they do in Illinois too.

Condo associations can levy a special assessment should they discover they need money for a major repair. That means you get a surprise bill for potentially thousands of dollars.  This condo will occasionally need repairs and renovations made. Make sure you budget accordingly. That brings me to the next point you do want a property manager. Not just when you need to rent it out but every month. You need a reliable person who can make sure that rent is paid on time repairs get done in a timely fashion tenants are screened an even bigger deal in a college community! leases are written to comply with state law evictions heaven forbid you need one are done properly and all that.

Although thats over decades and in there of course some people made a lot of money and some people lost a lot of money. I prefer to be diversified with some in both types of investments but that is a personal choice. I dont want to rain on anyones idea of becoming an investor. Its certainly a realistic goal lots of people have made solid investment and some even fortunes that way. But just bear in mind that RIGHT NOW most of the country is on an upward trend and has been for a few years  really good years in most places. So when people are saying oh this is the best investment Ive ever made or this is my cash flow you gotta consider the context. I wouldnt take advice from anyone who has been doing this less than  years because they really havent seen the good and the bad. In fact if they bought  years ago they probably have made a lot of money but most of that was due to their timing. A newbie investor right now is buying under a much different atmosphere. We see the stories here where all the buyers in the market are overpaying because the place even loses money monthly. But theyre hoping from gains from appreciation will continue. They might. And they might not. So I would just caution you to do a lot of research dont get emotional dont make a quick decision.

11378312,0,t1_dfkvoba,Youre right its probably very subjective and in some cases you can just find the right buyer at the right time.  I just know that as a current home searcher I notice the houses that stand out more than the ones with the same color in every room.  I should clarify  there are homes where the owner painted the living room chartreuse  THAT will turn people off but Ive also seen houses where they went with nonoffensive modern color palettes and that really makes you stop and take a second look.  You can probably narrow perspective buyers into two camps . People looking for a good deal and willing to put workmoney into it.and. People looking for a movein ready house and will to pay more for it.  Since the constant price reductions havent done much to spur activity thats why I suggest delisting doing some work that would cost you significantly less money than the current price reduction and then relisting at a higher price.  If OP didnt already bring the price down k with no action I might not have suggested the idea of improvements.  To me it sort of indicates that the person willing to live next to the highway needs a little incentive  something to counterbalance that  and a blank slate house might not be the incentive.,RealEstate,dflpnyj,1,t5_2qipl

Obviously anything can happen but chances of needing an entire new roof or similar is pretty low.  Being underwater is definitely a concern obviously a risk there and youre absolutely right about the lack of flexibility.  But its extremely frustrating to send a big rent check to someone else every month when I could be paying down a mortgage instead.You make good points and I will say that k was my upper limit not my ideal number.

11599540,0,t3_65jqzk,See this thread from a couple days ago No one here can really tell you if what you are offering is reasonable or not it depends on your market. If the appraiser notes that the conversion was done without permits you may have trouble getting a loan. To say a conversion was done OK is pretty naive. You cant know what the electric plumbing or structural stuff behind walls looks like. If you try to do other work on it or get retro permits you may face additional costs as youll be required to bring other things up to current code as opposed to the code for the year the house was built. Insurance may not cover you. Its a big risk IMO. I would not want to pay someone market value for a house that is quite different from the others on the market and comes with a big risk. Id also be concerned if they opened up walls in the recent reno. Structural modifications like this require permits in most areas to make sure nothing load bearing is changed. ,RealEstate,dgateli,10,t5_2qipl
11604079,0,t1_dgatoji,Who on earth would agree to that? A retro inspection of such a remodel would require removing all the sheetrock to ensure plumbing and electrical is done to code at least in my state and then making those improvements again and in turn have the refinished space reinspected. Forget all the walls that have to be removed but if you have a bathroom or a kitchen in there all those would have to be destroyed too. Why would anyone agree to that? You do not have to include that space in the appraised value anyway for most markets it has no effect and most lenders would have no problem with it. If you did not like it in the future you can tear it down. It will cost you probably KK to demolish the improvements and get the garage back in the original shape. So why would anyone agree to costly retro permit?

11655845,0,t1_dgh4hqb,Thats quite a range of homes.  How would a sf home stack up against the others in the neighborhood?  Same number of bedrooms bathrooms?  Exterior and Interior finishes?  Honestly seems kinda risky if youre looking to sell in .  I would really look at just returning it to a screened in porch.  If you really want to make it nice I would look to installing a fireplace.  They have kits for those and you could install it on the exterior of the porch.  If you did this and you added slider windows you could get pretty close to  seasons out there.  ,RealEstate,dgh7dj3,1,t5_2qipl

11678046,0,t1_dgjfzpx,I dont think they built our house above the level though its on a two foot high crawlspace I think or at least more space than I see on most homes. However I dont have high flood insurance rates nor required to have it because Im in a flood zone protected by levee. So it counts as Zone x. I still try to get the plan anyway just to be safe.I was mostly worried about the likely chance of it ever changing. Im in Chattanooga and Nashville had a huge  year flood event many years back that started raising concern on the overall area. FEMA changed the maps an required some updates on the levee but not enough was done to save all houses from being in the flood zone. However those homes were not in my area. They were much further down near the end of the levee. I guess I just wonder if its a risk to be in this area not due to the levee failing but due to FEMA changing its rules.As for an agent I tried to talk to them while getting insurance for my house but they were not too helpful. All they could say is well our data doesnt show it in a flood zone. Doesnt help my house is new construction so they dont really have details on exactly how much it would cost in the area until having proper data on that. Just what it costs right now for not being in the flood zone.,RealEstate,dgjq1gn,1,t5_2qipl

You read that correctly.Property taxes arent reduced by a larger down payment this is a crazy scenario where your monthly property taxes would in fact be larger than your mortgage payment and homeowners insurance combined.These are ballpark California numbers. Texas for example has way higher property taxes.If you JUST meant the PampI payment and not taxes and homeowners insurance too about  down will do it.,RealEstate,dgp22uw,5,t5_2qipl
11734010,0,t1_dgppl60,Thank you so much for the feedback so far a couple of follow up questions. If inspection and an appraisal is going to be required from the loan officer should we do that after speaking with a loan officer or before? Also do those activities cost money and what kind of ballpark figure would that be?. My understanding is that not having  for first house is very common and a lot of people go through FHA  am I correct in that understanding?. What are your initial thoughts on the overall situation  are there any red flags from a financial standpoint that make it seem financially irresponsible or does it sound like a feasible and worthwhile investment?,RealEstate,dgq2vwb,1,t5_2qipl

11735896,0,t3_67goki,We had a very large oak in front of our house another in the back and two smaller maples.  The amount of leaves they dropped each year was staggering and there were two months a year where we were under continuous acorn bombardment.  WHACK! on the deck and roof day and night that was also where the driveway was and we had to move cars for those two months.  Then one year the largest oak tree  feet diameter got hit by lightning.  Not split a branch and charred the tree lightning but Exploded in a fireball that blew out windows and sent flaming chunks of tree hundreds of feet and cracked water and sewer pipes underground where the roots exploded lightning.  At which point I had to pay to have it removed including the stump which was so large it nearly flipped the frontend loader they brought out to handle it.Now I look for houses where the neighbors have nice trees.,RealEstate,dgqakq1,2,t5_2qipl

11743114,0,t1_dgqimro,Yup.  Had a few trees removed from my place a few years back.  At first I thought the quotes I was getting were crazy because the whole thing was going to cost more than I expected.  After taking the middle quote and watching all the work they did however I feel I got a pretty good price.  This view was further reinforced when I had them leave some of the wood behind and I started breaking it up into firewood.

11758666,0,t3_67s6ke,have you talked to a lender to see if you can get a mortgage to purchase the property? thats your first step.do you know what the property is worth? you can probably get an idea from info on the internet  dont look at zillow or redfin auto evaluations look at each sale specifically in the same neighborhood. you should be able to get a ballpark wont be  accurate.you may want to engage the services of a realtor most would help you with a deal like this for a discount to you and the seller but its not necessary to use a realtor. probably worth talking to a couple who would spend some time walking you through the process. there are also a lot of statescounties that have homebuyer education online videos and classes those will get you through what to expect.if you dont engage a agent then do find an attorney who can help you with the contract explain your obligations the sellers obligations and your next steps.again most important thing is to see if you qualify for a mortgage.,RealEstate,dgsvhun,3,t5_2qipl
11769314,0,t1_dgtwj3m,gt  the period lapsesHere the contingency period does not lapse on a particular date. Standard contingency timelines for us are  days for inspection and appraisal and  days for loan. But on the th day those contingencies dont just expire. The buyer has to sign a document called contingency removal and send it to the seller only then the buyer has removed contingencies. So on day  if buyer has not sent the contingency removal doc the buyer still has the contingency. So seller can then send the notice to perform. ,RealEstate,dgu2zlc,1,t5_2qipl
