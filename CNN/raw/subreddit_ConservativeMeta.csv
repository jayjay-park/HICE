6711080,0,t3_47gz32,gt Having your views challenged helps you and anyone who reads your postcomment to better understand your viewpoint and why you think it is the correct way to think about a given situation in the political world.This is true.  You should do this but not on rconservative.  The purpose of the subreddit is not to defend conservatism against liberal talking points.  The purpose of the subreddit is not to debate issues from the point of view of every political ideology what rpolitics should be.  The point of the subreddit is to discuss issues from various conservative points of view with fellow conservatives.If thats not what youre look for then too bad.  Sorry.  Go find another subreddit that is what youre looking for or create you own subreddit.,ConservativeMeta,d0dhelt,1,t5_33gd0

8592815,0,t1_d4uj0uj,Im late to the conversation as I just discovered this sub and threaduchabanais banned me for arguing with him as well  permanent ban no warning. my mod message to him was polite asking about the ban  at which time I received a modmessage ban or block so that I could not question him further. I reached out to the other mods personally  i was ignored by most but told by a couple that they couldnt do anything to control chab and they couldnt unblock me because he was the one who blocked me  is this about bad blocks? or about bad mods?,ConservativeMeta,d6foxv5,1,t5_33gd0
