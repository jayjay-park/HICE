6309524,0,t3_421ggg,It varies yeartoyear perhaps someone from that area would have better knowledge but be sure to remember that just because the snow is gone from city streets and yards doesnt mean the back roads are passable. If there is dense tree cover the snow can be protected from direct sunlight causing it to last longer and the road itself though uncovered with snow may be soft and muddy from snow melt waters that are unable to drain properly because of deep frost. Always remember to let someone know where you are going or better yet take two vehicles in case one gets stuck.,yooper,cz6tltx,2,t5_2s6ul
