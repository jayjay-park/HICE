1270494,0,t3_28ifhw,What a bummer! It sounded like your tank dropped under  psi or your remote was kinked enough to drop you under  psi and your heat core couldnt reseal before the leak actually emptied your tank under  psi. Check your oring it may be on its way out I have to baby mine a bit cleaning after every use oil before airing up. Hope any of that helps.,magfed,cicjpym,1,t5_2yss9
