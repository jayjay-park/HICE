215885,0,t3_1wl98a,I would have liked to have seen Anwar and Maxie and the boyfriend forgot his name more than anyone.I would have liked to have seen Sid. Although I did like that Cassies story wasnt about him. I like them separate.And Im vaguely interested in Michelle.Didnt really give a shit what happened to Cassie.Onto gen I also didnt give a shit about effy and preferred cook dead as I assumed him since series  finale. Although his story in series  did turn out to be quite good.I really wanted more Emily. Probably my all time favorite skins character.I also would have liked to see if Thomass future played out the way it seemed it would. And gen more alo and mini would have really interested me. But I think Im satisfiedish with everyone else there. Vague interest in where the brothers wound up.,skinsTV,cf3186z,5,t5_2t67h

It wasnt information that was available to the public hence insider trading. Illegal in many countries because its viewed as ethically wrong.,skinsTV,crocrf9,12,t5_2t67h
4625849,0,t3_3brf1t,But thats what I like about Skins it repeats storylines but tells them with different outcomes. I actually never even thought about the love triangles appearing in all  until I read this. Also love triangles are just the worst but inevitable in almost ANY story.,skinsTV,ctdnt2a,1,t5_2t67h

7958717,0,t1_d49ojwf,Youre totally right! I didnt specify but really any of the degrassi series could kind of fit the mould. I think I might rewatch them I dont know if I ever watched it in succession or just caught episodes here and there. ,skinsTV,d4amv67,2,t5_2t67h

11744904,0,t3_672qhl,Just started watching season . Immediately hate Cook. Hes such a fucking asshole to everyone even his best friends. I feel like they tolerate him just because hes there and if he werent there then they wouldnt have any friends.I cant help but cringe at anything and everything he does.I hope he goes through a huge change. Like something that completely changes his personality and development as a character.,skinsTV,dgrbc5w,2,t5_2t67h
