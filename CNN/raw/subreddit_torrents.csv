This is how I would do it as well.But just food for thought...Another alternative would be btsync bit torrent sync basically can keep  folders  diff locations synchronized. I use it for a lot of things and love it especially syncing to mobileThis would run constantly and always be sending once new things appear as opposed to a cron with rsync which does allow more control but not as automatic as btsync would be.You could set your computer to readonly for the seedbox to prevent any accidental deletion on the seedbox side.Just an idea. ,torrents,cehr2d1,1,t5_2qh0w

521807,0,t1_cfzahx3,gt first it is not micro anymore. gone are the days of a KB runtime.The newer versions of uT have a smaller executable than Deluge so Im no sure what your point is here.Also if youve tried seeding a few hundred let alone over a thousand torrents with Deluge youd know it leaks memory until it crashes and uses a high amount of CPU for no apparent reason. The developers are aware of this but still havent come up with a fix the only workaround is to use the daemon and webui which is pointless if youre using it as a desktop client..i.e. uT has a smaller executable than Deluge and uses less resources too. So considering those aspects compared to uT Deluge is a subpar client.gt second it is not free anymore. the free verision just tried to install  different addon programs to my machine.I cant speak for newer versions of uT as I use .. but Im sure its easy enough to untick the boxesdecline the offers much like most free software doesnt take a rocket surgeon to figure that out.In my opinion the only decent desktop alternative to uT that Ive found is qBittorrent.

I am on different networks and I notice sometimes I can connect on the same torrent from one and not the other. Some peers might have part of a torrent a part you already have so they have nothing to give you  Some peers may be not connectable or you might be so they or you would not be able to accept incoming announces only outgoing.

Just add as normal and itll grab the episodes and seasons as it finds them.Series and episode management is easy too.

1251392,0,t1_ciadbou,Very VERY silly you should NOT have settled with them even if they were a real copyright troll that represented the actual copyright holder and not a complete scam an IP address alone is NOT sufficient evidence to prove anything. Barely any copyright infringement demands ever end up in court and if they did they barely ever win their case! They therefore work by creating fear in the hope that people will settle out of court instead as they know they have very little chance of winning otherwise. It also costs them money to take you to court which they know theyre very likely to lose when they lose the case hence why it barely ever goes to court. You should have ignored them or perhaps sent them a prewritten legal response you can find them online.As I have advised the op use private trackers  a vpn  a secure seedbox in future.,torrents,ciaeaqi,4,t5_2qh0w

1688586,0,t3_2dp7oj,Start by disabling any antivirus and third party firewall on her PC then switch the cat cables from your pc to hers and hers to yours. Also make sure her torrent client is setup with the same setting as you have on your PC. If her pc speeds up using your cable the other cable may be inefficient. If there is no noticeable difference her ethernet card or even the computers CPU or hard drive may be too slow for the  megabit? line. It may also help to reboot the modemrouter and only test one computer at a time. Do a speedtest.net test on both machines one machine at a time. Then swap cords and do a speedtest again one at a time and see if the cable makes any difference. Most of the time cheap routers and modems are unable to process the high volume of connections required for torrenting. Cheap routers normally have small NAT tables and once they fill up with multiple connections the router wont allow any more connections until the tables clears more inactive connections.  If this is the case reduce the TCP and UDP timeouts to  seconds in the router settings to help keep the NAT table from being filled with inactive open connections. Also make sure that the torrent clients ports are properly port forwarded with either UPnP Automatic Port Fording or an internal static ip from both computers to the router. Let me know if this helps. If you are ever in need of a high end router I have had amazing success with my Netgear Nighthawk.,torrents,cjs0dtf,1,t5_2qh0w

Well it depends on whether there is a policeman monitoring the stretch of road at the time that you happen to be speeding.  There are roads that are more likely to have cops on and there are times when the odds are higher that there will be a cop monitoring speeders but no one knows for sure.  Cops cant monitor all roads all the time.  All I can tell you is that pirate bay is the number one place that trolls monitor and it would be best if you used a VPN to hide your true IP if you dont want to get caught because the odds are that you will just like if you speed all the time.

I will consider trying out a seedbox too depending how it goes but for the amount of  I can spend I cant put a lot of trust into a cheapo seedbox provider plus I will get only gbgb tops if Im lucky....the VPN actually works well... at least for leeching  it doesnt seed well even with ports forwarded but such is life. Im living on a tax return rn and can spend it cuz I live home... but once I get a job the story changes...I am in rehab though so it kinda gets in the way of working time wise...I got into some private trackers too  so a seedbox is definitely a possibility its just money  I dont trust someone actually HOLDING my bootlegs with small amounts of open source software in between for very little payment  thats like suicide but I can afford a decent vpn. Im trying out PIA and I may go for torguard instead havent decided but PIA works ok.depending on how life treats me a seedbox may be in the future... I may even keep the VPN for public torrent access and privacy and still get a seedbox exclusively for private torrents. side note a sketchy seedbox site assumed I completed an order without even finishing the order form they only took payza and I later realized they ripped off a more reputable sites layout and everything... it was seedboxbay  since I couldnt pay them anyway I had to try and cancel which they havent responded to but I keep getting overdue payment notices. I changed all my private info to be fake and sent multiple notifications that I didnt finish ordering it and could not deliver payment in the methods they asked for  im not into spending extra for bitcoin and US doesnt even accept the scam that is payza. ID say STAY AWAY unless you know better and they are a legit site. otherwise customer support would be all over this.the convieniences of a seedbox are def worth it in my future. until then VPN all the way... helps with privacy too...,torrents,cqqhivb,1,t5_2qh0w

They also do that clientversion spoofing that private trackers dont like very much AFAIK. gtTixati  It has some features like the ability to modify the peerid useragent http headers and spoofing that need to be removed before well consider allowing it here.gtThe issue is that once a client is banned on a tracker for whatever reason it is almost impossible to have it unbanned on that tracker.,torrents,ctggnmm,6,t5_2qh0w

Offhand especially check Connectivity  and  and everything under SpeedsConnectivity.First make sure youre testing with a known good torrent. e.g. a Ubuntu Linux torrent General stuff you can doublecheck when having issues with torrent speedsconnectivityConnectivity. Are you connected to a network that allows torrents? e.g. many schools offices coffee shops public wifi etc. actively block torrents. You would need a torrent friendly VPN to get around that see rule . Are you using a VPN or proxy that is not torrent friendly? If thats the case then you should get rid of whatever youre using amp get a paid torrent friendly VPN see rule . Are you connectable port forwarded? For your torrent client test the clients connection port with something like www.canyouseeme.org amp see if the test passes. If it does not pass then you need to manually configure a port forward through your software firewall andor network router.. Have you tried disabling any antivirusmalware programs? They can sometimes interfere with torrent clients. If you find this is an issue you could try whitelisting your torrent clients in your antivirusmalware programs amp see how that goes.SpeedsConnectivity. Did you enable any bandwidth limits in your torrent client? Setting your upload to something ridiculously low e.g.  KBs will negatively affect your download speeds too.. Are you using any blocklists? If so stop using them see rule . Try disabling uTP in your torrent client amp see how that goes with Deluge this can be a bit tricky see rtorrentscommentsdzgquestionaboututpanddelugeonthemac for other clients just look in the settings. In your torrent client make sure to set your bittorrent protocol encryption to Prefer Encryption or Enable Encryption not Disable Encryption or Require Encryption this will allow you to connect to more peers in the torrent swarm.. Make sure to enable DHT amp PEX in your torrent client especially if youre using public torrents this helps you locate more peers in the torrent swarm. In your ISP routermodem check if you have any sort of flood protection etc. type of things enabled. If so disable them.. In your network router or ISP routermodem check if you have anything like traffic shapingQOS enabled. If so try disabling them andor changing the settings.,torrents,dcrjzxi,3,t5_2qh0w
