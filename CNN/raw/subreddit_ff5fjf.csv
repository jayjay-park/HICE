1189162,0,t1_ci31m60,Yeah this is true. Terrain is mainly useful for random encouters I suppose but there are also some bosses in the first world that it can be useful against. It just doesnt get better throughout the game so once your in the final world or the Void its not so great.,ff5fjf,ci3ee6m,2,t5_31mq8
1300877,0,t1_cify1pz,I never really thought about using !Image. I tried it a few times when I got it but I didnt like it much. It does sound like a good idea though. Guess I must have been attacked by magic a lot when I tried it out because in my memory it wasnt really helpful. I used !Black on MK because it did more damage than his spellblade attacks when not fighting against fiends that have an elemental weakness. And I prefered MTcasting. Also when using !Spellblade it took up a turn and most of the times MK didnt even get to hit because the battle was already over. Of course for bosses that was not the case. What should I use instead of !Black? !Image or !Throw I guess?I gave my BM the main gauche so he could survive longer and to the end I mostly used Flare instead of elemental attacks.  Chicken knife annoyed me because it triggered Flee sometimes but I guess I could give it a shot. Who would be the best to use it?  ,ff5fjf,cifyrgw,2,t5_31mq8
1734858,0,t3_2e5aqn,Ehh.  I feel if I had gotten either a White or Black Mage Id have been much better off.  My run was ThiefKnightMonkRed Mage which despite the ability to break rods was not a whole lot of fun.  I ended up with a data loss issue and really didnt want to run that from scratch again.  So Im doing an endofFiesta Team  run and Ill give Classic Mode another crack next year.  Maybe drop more money on the Job Fair for great justice and my sanity.My dream group compostion would be KnightWhite MageBlack MageThief.  But Im torn between the entire spirit of the Fiesta my patience and giving Gilgabot Childs Play more of my money.,ff5fjf,cjxud17,1,t5_31mq8
1865789,0,t1_cke0gmb,Ah alright thanks! ,ff5fjf,cke0su5,1,t5_31mq8
3894416,0,t1_cr029d8,So... donate to a charity of your choosing and indicate that its on behalf of the Fiesta or something?Like Im not sure what you want RK to do here. His charity of choice that the Fiesta benefits is Childs Play. Either donate through the side bar and that money will go to Childs Play or dont.,ff5fjf,cr074ah,3,t5_31mq8
4104638,0,t3_37m3yz,Ill wait until its all sorted out before I register. Right now Im feeling a Normal Berserker Risk for my first run.,ff5fjf,cro5jah,2,t5_31mq8
4252811,0,t3_39o5e0,Oh wow the  votes didnt make it for BM Beastmaster And Samurai.Well good luck to runners. Should be good.,ff5fjf,cs50aid,2,t5_31mq8
4253561,0,t3_39o5e0,Also of note is the donation total is over  already.Interesting set of jobs. The Run is going to be a good watch.,ff5fjf,cs53cn4,2,t5_31mq8
4338211,0,t1_csekt7g,Thats some serious power though!,ff5fjf,csen9nx,6,t5_31mq8
4367169,0,t3_3ayodt,Cheers guys and thanks my second fiesta and second time playing trough the game. Ill give it a shot! lt,ff5fjf,cshwy7l,1,t5_31mq8
7136855,0,t1_d1papy6,gt I think the record is something ridiculous like under level ? actually. Requires a very specific team and quite a bit of lucktalent to be doable but yeah.,ff5fjf,d1pds2u,2,t5_31mq8
7712384,0,t1_d3itogy,Cool! Ill be on the lookout for them. Just fun to see what everyone else is doingthinking on their runs. ,ff5fjf,d3iugkl,2,t5_31mq8
7934159,0,t1_d47tqh7,Easiest way is to use your Time Mages to break Thunder Rods.  If you use an equipped Thunder Rod in battle it casts Thundaga.  That will take out the two launchers then its up to you whether you want to keep doing it or try to do enough damage to the gun.,ff5fjf,d47vhb1,1,t5_31mq8
7953529,0,t1_d497uoa,Thanks man!,ff5fjf,d4a1v0k,1,t5_31mq8
7991622,0,t1_d4ebskm,I think people use the dancing dagger to confuse the kite cat monster which can be found on the mountain Bahamut is on near the desert with Phoenix tower.,ff5fjf,d4ec1nk,1,t5_31mq8
8025478,0,t1_d4hknej,Then Id go to Jachol CaveBal Castle and grind off Skull EatersObjet DArt for ABP until you get at least one Rapid Fire user which you can then use to try and start dealing more reasonable damage and building your levels. Even a group of  Nutkins in Jachol Cave yields  ABP so theyre both good spots for ABP grinding.,ff5fjf,d4i50ko,1,t5_31mq8
8096805,0,t3_4pzrf5,I hear you. I had four runs with Geomancers in a row spanning a few years.My luck has changed kinda... now Ive had Chemists the last three runs. Its an amazing class and all but it basically invalidates the rest of my party if I feel like constantly maxing out Turtle Shells.,ff5fjf,d4q5jky,2,t5_31mq8
8125570,0,t1_d4ta0z5,Ninja and Ranger are probably a matter of personal preference they both hit multiple times and can fight from the back row at no penalty. But XFight ignores defense and !Critt is some very solid healing for a large portion of the game especially without another healing option. Its a close call but Id go with the Ranger.Berserker vs. Red Mage is another tough one because theyre so different but I value the Red Mages versatility over the Berserkers raw damage but can definitely see the opposite argument here.,ff5fjf,d4tdy8d,2,t5_31mq8
8620273,0,t3_4xwwx3,XFight with your Knight and Samurai may be an alright idea provided you get lucky and dont hit his dummy parts depending on which version you are playing this is also a good idea for whoever you put the Chicken Knife on as XFight will ignore the run away chance.Your Red Mage is probably going to be best be assigned to healing duties for pretty much the entire fight unless you can find an off chance to use an offensive spell.If you havent done so already equip everyone in your party with Hermes SandalsRunning Shoes you can buy them from the Phantom Village for  Gil each I believe.Other than that a very cheap alternative is to simply get a lot of money I mean a lot and give everyone in your party Gil Toss  Zeniage from your Samurai and go to town.Good luck!,ff5fjf,d6j4uwz,1,t5_31mq8
