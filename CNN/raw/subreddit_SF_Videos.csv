9745180,0,t1_dae8r6h,Excellent point you are most certainly not wrong at all and yet still whenever anyone argues whats the point about anything it is always a very slippery slope at best.  Because whats the point of any video?  Whats the point of anything for that matter?  Whats the point of thanksbgiving? Whats the point of that comment you left?  Whats the point of me replying whats the point of anything?  God is dead and we are all alone in the Universe...the truth is there is no point there is no such thing as a point we all just simply do GOBBLE GOBBLE!!!!!,SF_Videos,daeb0ga,1,t5_2tenl
