5629033,0,t1_cwuspyg,Alive huh...? Shidu murmured. Trapped within that garden...Compared to Anteiku the CCG and even Aogiri Tree certainly the Inquisitors must have been the worst of them all. Their meeting location was a forgotten rusteaten warehouse the floors of which were now covered in various splatters and pools of blood after the evenings events. A leader who displayed no remorse for bitterly cruel things and who appeared to consider the death of the child before her as nothing more than the elimination of a witness rather than the loss of an innocent life loomed over them exceeding them in both control and what surely was physical strength.The blood was on their hands now. They could justify it all they liked but no matter how it was explained they had been the ones to kill those unfortunate victims.Murderers.Ah yes. It seemed that this was who the Inquisitors truly were.No amount of money will protect you she said. If its another life you want that band of pacifists Anteiku or even Aogiri Tree will grant you such things.

She kept her hawklike gaze on Okazakisan as he stepped forward and broke into a charge. His arm was prepped for a punch but his legs rotated at the last second reaching forward for a low kick. Dodge and attack. The words an academy instructor had once spoken to her. She sidestepped the low kick and in the following seconds she had already sent a kick aimed at his stomach forward.She wasnt physically strong enough to go for a punch nor tall enough to go for a kick to the head. The stomach was a good area to go for assuming she had enough power to knock some air out of him if it even landed.Im going to call it a night for now so this was kind of rushed. Sorry!

5678698,0,t1_cx0qcjf,As Izumi saw his opponent dodge it confirmed to him that she was more of a nimble type of fighter trying to look for an opportunity to counterattack. Though that was why he reached for a kick at a safe distance so that if his opponent was to counter he would at least manage to avoid in time.She reacted quite quickly so he didnt try to dodge and just crossed his arms in front of his stomach to block the kick. It was well placed though it was not strong enough to knock him off balance. Izumi allowed the momentum of her kick to retreat a few steps back. He then took a combat stance with his fists raised while watching her movements. Izumi wasnt ready to go on full offense yet he thought it would be better to wait until the spar had escalated a little bit more.You are fast.

5802456,0,t1_cxgcasv,Well this is just my method since I ended up doing all of them yesterday at like  AM but I first took all of the character and quinque forms and put them into a spreadsheet where I could see everyones strengths and weaknesses. I then tried to put everyone into a pairing where their partner could fill in their weaknesses ex someone with light hits being paired with someone with high strength and looked at quinque types for investigator teams but they didnt work out perfectly so I ended up having to compromise with some teams that werent as cohesive. For those teams who werent as cohesive I tried to make their opponents less cohesive as well so theyd be equally unbalanced. For example I think theres one car where everyone in it is fast but lacks defenses as there arent enough characters with defense as one of their strengths for everyone to be paired perfectly.Rank was important as well but the ghouls were severely lacking in Branks compared to the number of Rank  investigators we had. Originally I was going to have Soundwave and Maki fight v alone but that would be awfully imbalanced given that theyre Branks like many other ghouls. Additionally the number of investigators we had was higher than the number of ghouls by two so I tossed two investigators arguably a highrisk pair due to Kenjis sharpshooting and Alistairs agility against a higher ranked NPC. Theres also certain pairings that requested to be together when they signed up so they were put together and given an opponent of equal lethality rank  abilities etc.,tgrp,cxgcllb,4,t5_3a7k7

The thought passed through the bulky investigators mind far too late to actually speak up a single word as the undulating monstrosity vanished into the darkening night. Kristof stood unerringly as if things had not changed for a moment the determination still smoldering within his ancient eyes. His grip upon the metal briefcase only grew stronger the man almost felt disappointed after having been so ready to perish for a comrade. Why had such a creature spared a life readily relinquished? Perhaps an act of a beast already engorged perhaps the work of a lord drunk of chaos. Or yet a mystery still the last shred of humanity in a childs broken mind.Was macht ein Mann ein Monster? The words uttered under his breath filled with a certain saddened tone echoing ever so slightly through the barren warehouse. The mustachioed mans mind weighed heavily upon him nearly forcing his stalwart body to a knee but a familiar sound the laughter of a friend forged new resolve within the elder man vitality and vigor returning to his form. Coupled with the sight of his partner that very same smile of jolliness crept back upon his aged face heartily laughing aloud enveloping the utterances of the younger investigator.Releasing his hold and allowing the cold metal of his sheathed weapon to clatter upon the ground Kristof outstretches his thick arms and laughs an expression of pure relief washes over him as he scoops the similarly large Kosei into a mighty embrace.

Returning the other man back upon the cemented floor Kristof spoke with a firm tone This was not insanity friend we could not have escaped such a creature on foot together no?

The starridden sky the icy air the beautiful quiet city... a mere breath could soothe the soul and calm the mind. In recent days Maki found himself taking more and more walks like that although ever since Velis death he had preferred to walk around with his ghoul disguise and stick to the rooftops. Perhaps it was paranoia. Perhaps it was desire to live life to the fullest and enjoy the sights from a the eyes of the birds. No it definitely wasnt paranoia... Maki simply didnt care enough anymore to actually be worried about being ambushed. It was simply the freedom of being able to move however he wanted that he valued.Sitting on top of a warehouse the ghoul stared at the unreachable heavenly shroud wondering if limits truly existed. If impossibility was actually something that had always been present in our reality. As he tried to collect his thoughts his efforts were foiled by the brief screams of a group of humans. It was impossible to really ponder something as philosophical as that when several people wail their hearts out. Whimpering inhibits the mind of anyone who listens after all. Jumping on his feet the man walked to the edge of the roof and looked at the source of this obnoxious sound that had thankfully been quickly smothered by its very creator. A ghoul. A murderous ghoul.Many moons ago perhaps Maki wouldve felt outraged. Repulsed. Utterly disgusted that someone would even dare commit such atrocities in his ward. In all honesty Maki simply didnt care anymore. After all people die every day. Enjoying the moment is the only thing that the helpless can do and despite all of his strength Maki had been helpless to even notice put aside protect these people. So he did what he felt would be enjoyable.Jumping down from the building the vigilanteturnedmurderer waved softly at the vicious creature before him. Good evening. Fancy meeting you here.

The people you shit on cant make excuses about your kagune being the reason they lost after all.Minato smirked again at her saying she would rather beat up someone whos mildly annoying. Oh so like me then? Good to know that if you ever have the choice youd beat me up instead of someone else. Its nice being someones bottom dollar.I definitely feel better after joining the tree. Well stronger I guess. Not better. Getting constantly knocked around and almost dying twice doesnt really deserve the term feels good. But people say you learn from defeat so in that case I suppose Ive been learning quite the lesson. And I agree that a lot of humans can actually be worse than ghouls. At least with ghouls you can mostly figure out what they want. Humans though...theyre just weird and think weirdly too. Minato shrugged agreeing with Asa on her opinion about the damn humans.I dont know if always wanted is quite accurate but for this case I guess its ok.

Like are you even an actor dude? Youre literally paid to act a part not look like an idiot during the most important part. The couple walked down the street one a good few inches taller than the other. The taller one was wearing a dark green sweater and pants to match it although his bleachblonde hair ruined the look. He was talking animatedly to the girl walking beside him with her brown hair tied back into a braid that fell down to her waist. She was wearing a light blue shirt and a navy blue skirt with a small purse slung in the crook of her left elbow. While the boy was obviously very into the conversation the girl was decidedly less so. She was paying attention of course but just the bare minimum necessary. She hadnt seen the movie after all so she didnt really know what he was talking about. Also Shinya was much more of a movie buff than Ayumi was.After hearing about the raid of Antieku both of them had agreed that they would need to find a new cafe to do their homework at. After all fresh coffee and sweets were a must in order to overcome the horrible task that was class work. So the pair had agreed to try out this new cafe named re which was just now coming into sight as the two rounded a corner and continued walking. To the inexperienced eye it might look like the two were out on a date together. To anyone who was more observant that would obviously not be the case.  Ayumi was clearly not interested in Shinya as anything more than a friend and he had resigned himself to this fate a few months before. Anyone who thought otherwise was quickly shown the error in judgment after spending a little amount of time with the two together. Or if they asked Shinya about it alone he would admit that he had been shot down time after time by the bespectacled girl. Now he was left with only the occasional friendly meetup with Ayumi or if she needed some help with homework then he was sometimes called to action as well. Today was one of the former.The soft welcome bell chimed cheerily as Shinya pushed open the door to the cafe. Looking around he took a deep breath in through his nose and nodded approvingly. Well it certainly smells good. Then again cafes tend to be like that....smell good I mean.From behind him Ayumi took a deep breath as well and smiled slightly as the nostalgic scent flooded her nose.

My names Kazuko Akita and shes Haeki Shirogane and were initiates to this grand organization fresh from the academy Kazuko took a deep bow her head sinking low this time in a more showy manor. She popped back up her hair practically everywhere and she corrected it by tucking some loose strands behind her ear.

Where do you stand on the Aogiri foodchain? Yukis eyes flickered back over to Asas face and he smirked as he met her eyes. Sure he had come here looking for her and he may have every reason to fear her but he just couldnt. She was something akin to a goal for him. He wanted to reach the spot she was sooner or later.

As quickly as possible she pulled out a tan folder and locked the case.Sorry youll have to make change for this.

She couldnt focus on anything else but Michi and his safety. The thought of leaving him behind was completely out of her mind now. She wasnt going to Tadashi. No way. But what else could she really do?She just stood there knees shaking lips quivering with wide eyes. Like some coward. Like some rodent just watching. By running she could at least be somewhat useful but even then her feet were glued to the ground the scared girl was unable to move out of the shadow. A slight whimper came out when she saw that he was about to fight it was barely audible she didnt want to reveal her position. She almost reached out when she saw that his coat dropped to the ground but it was all in vain even running wouldnt help. Such a predicament was too much for Ryokeis little brain to handle. Why did her brother just charge out? She crouched behind the wall and leaned her back against the cold bricks trying to devise some form of a plan. Her palms were clutching at her head on one side she wanted to wake up. Wake up from this nightmare where she was helpless and scared. On the other she knew that she had a duty to fulfill.

Id prefer that you keep it hushhush but if you need to worm your way out of a tight spot or something I dont mind if you spill the beans. Sorry you had me a little confused there.The taller boys hand reentered his coat pocket and he seemed to relax a little his smile shrinking to a more regular size. The rest of the questions were much easier to answer because they werent all that deep.Hunt wherever. It doesnt matter how you get what you get so long as its fresh.

For payment itll be something like  yen per month so like  per body plus you also get a place to live for free.

That time you spent getting that physically strong would probably be better spent just practicing combat itself if you ask me. Better to have experience than just train your body although thats definitely important too of course. Minatos response seemed fairly obvious to him but he realized that to her that may not have been the most obvious choice. After all if you just fight over and over youll eventually get the hang of it and start to get a feel for the flow of a brawl.As the boy lay panting he offered up a tired grin at the girl and chuckled slightly. Of course it was great. First thing youll learn being around here is that Im just great. Anyways it helps to have a kagune like mine. It can take at least a bit of the brunt when in doubt.

Youre just starting your career and Im sure youll be off to a better start than me. This is not a very good mindset to stick to you know? Ill definitely take you someplace nice now.As she followed Yumi and made her way towards the bar a couple of rather worrisome thoughts gnawed away at the girls mind. She was pretty certain that shed made it clear she wouldnt drink. Had she... forgotten to do that? Or had Yumi missed out on that? Perhaps forgotten about it? In any case no matter the why or the how fact to the matter was that the Initiate was clearly expecting her superior to take part in the drinking. That was a bit of an issue. More so given the context. As Kayami herself had said this wasnt work. Outside of work... well she felt more confident ever since Izumi had taken her under his wing but she could definitely feel the social pressure. Yeah... she was probably going to end up drinking for the second time ever tonight.Seating herself alongside the taller woman Kayami awkwardly observed the exchange between Yumi and the bartender. This junior seemed strangely accustomed to the whole process. Sadly Kayami didnt have much time to examine that in greater depth  first the bartender himself vanished out of sight rather quickly then the Initiate herself addressed her superior. Ahhhh ummmm... Taken a bit aback by the sudden question given that she hadnt even decided whether shed wanted to drink yet or not the First Class took a moment or two of trying to decide bbefore her brain went on autopilot. I think vodkas fine for me too.She had already stated that she didnt handle alcohol well. Still a part of her felt like as the senpai she had to go an extra mile and prove that she could handle anything. Including heavy drinking. Of course that wasnt the case but the desire didnt diminish in any way regardless. Thats how shed ended up at this situation where her own mind had tricked her into locking herself in to a strong drink like that.Yeah things couldve been going a bit better...Hopefully she wouldnt get wasted.

His thoughts shifted from recent events to those further back in time in particular the last time he was in a mall like this one. That day terrorists had struck ruining what had been quite a lovely day. The young ghoul still had the burns from that day though the scars had begun receding recently. Akihiko pulled his head away slightly as Minatos light knocking snapped him back into reality.Sorry yeah Im good. What were you saying? Akihiko responded. He felt slightly embarrassed that his distracted visage had been noticeable. Today was supposed to be a day free of worry yet here he was dwelling on the past. On top of that it had been Minatos idea to come out here so Aki somewhat guilty that hed been a dead weight on the journey here. Did you just ask me if you could ask a question?

I have plenty of ambition just not when it comes to this. groaned the young engineer writhing on the couch clearly prioritizing comfort over world dominance. Now  in a proper place there was a sigh of relief and the woman held up all but one finger. Four weeks and youll tire of world domination. said lazily keeping eye contact with her younger brother acting as basis of reality to his fantastic dreams.  Its most likely not worth the effort nor the sacrifices. Replacing one devil with another hardly helped anyone in this world while Minato of course had ambition and seemingly infinite willpower the ravenhaired boy probably realized he wasnt the kind of person to run something as complex and troublesome. Somewhere under his mask of jokes and bravado hed most likely agree.Nodding deliberately yet unimpressed she retorted without wasting a second of thoughts You are a boss not the boss. Valued but expendable like most leadership staff. So no funny ideas you hear me? To be frank even if it was a joke proposing suicidal plans  right after stressing the importance of their survival appeared to be a bit hypocritical in Kaorus eyes and it showed in her piercing stare.Truly a death ray could have provided ample fire power to clip those doves wings melting their limbs after rising up in the sky in their arrogance. As it usually happened with misunderstood geniuses even if the foundation could be created itd likely be impossible to construct. You win some and lose some I suppose. stated the quiet voice of Kaoru mourning countless way a weapon like it could work its magic.Good to know they both agreed how irrational their pleas always ended up being. Providing they lock me up that is I doubt the doves find me useful like I am right now. she replied in a matter of fact fashion while alluding to their enemys particular taste in accessories. To be frank Kaoru found Minatos seemingly rather recent obsession with proactive Darwinism to be quite odd considering his disability especially. A cruel joke? Perhaps.Pushing aside somber and cruel thoughts in exchange for something more fitting their reunion Kaoru raised herself up. Until then you have to deal with this first! she shouted lunging on Minato the poor couch creaking under the impact.

The two knives were targeting the ghoul as he rushed forwards one held in a backhand grip. Despite the control and execution of the movement he still seemed smooth and fluid. With invisible steps seemingly gliding across the battlefield. With no wasted movement the First Class cleared the distance.The gap between him and the other ghoul was something that would also close in an instant. But he was confident in his own skill in his ability to finish this motion before the Koukaku could get close enough to his back. He held faith in his focus. He had not been a person who thought their attacks out in advance and had always depended on speed reactions and initiative. In the past he had been incapable of doing otherwise but now he was starting to work it out. The development of a new underused muscle which could only lead to improvement. He had been able to perform to such a degree due to the lack of any hesitation. No fear of pain and the calmness of a young child on their deathbed. An acceptance of himself of his situation. A peace of mind which gave him such a serene aura. Which made him dance effortlessly across the battle. ,tgrp,ddpkhjv,2,t5_3a7k7

One time I made myself pass for the barman of a gay night club to shadow a man that was dealing with children. My wife laughed for days when I told her the number of men that tried to approach me and their lame pickup lines about sailors. I said shrugging grimacing about the memory.  Another time I painted the whole day a house from white to light pink and it wasnt even mine or no one had asked for it I just knew nobody lived there and I needed to look out at the house in front of it. I left it with only the front painted the rest still white. And now? Now I have stolen a key card from a cleaner to get up here and take shoots of a pair of lovers that are fucking in front of us!

A second later they slipped a bag over his head and he was jostled along pushed and shoved he heard people calling out over what he assumed was a radio. Telling someone he was there and then they shoved him onward. They took his bag to check it and then shoved it back into his arms a few moments later.The sound of the opening and closing of doors the ground went from dirt to hard cement. Boots clacking all about him and hushed voices here and there a few every now and then that he thought he recognized and then they were gone. Up and elevator they went and then out into what he assumed was another hall. Now they went from hushed voices to near silence and the floor changed again... wood? The boots still fell heavily on the floor about him his own boat shoes silent on the veneer... and then they stopped. A door creaked quietly and he was pushed forward a bit abruptly the hood being pulled off his head as he heard the door slide shut behind him with a creak and a click. Blinking quickly his eyes adjusting smoothly the wood interior first came into focus in the room. Glass here and there reflected the soft sunlight and the furniture antique? Looking over the room his eyes rested upon the one person he had expected to be there.Maki I dont recall you ever calling me mister.Walking slowly to the chair that Maki gestured to he looked different perhaps a touch older a mix of emotions perhaps a bit of tiredness though more it seemed it was directed at Jack than himself.

Still left room for interpretation she wasnt particularly happy about that one. While I am amazing is core of his philosophy I think I dont believe Im getting the same treatment as you do. With a shrug she added Ever thought hes being a gentlemen because he really likes you? Weird to spell it out to someone like that doesnt come close to Minato acting like a gentleman nonironically but still. She wasnt an expert in reading other but Kaoru had seen that kind of smirk occasionally. I have no idea what youre talking about but I dont feel like being impolite is what it usually spelled out and so Kaoru did the same smirking back Robes cant be that breezy can they? I mean Aogiri wears their disguises or clothes or whatever under them. mused the brunette her pointer tapping away at her lips.

Hm there should be a way to preserve them somehow... mumbled Kaoru eyeing her pale arms in a fruitless search for body art. Dragging an unblemished nail across her arm she frowned Ripping your own skin off huh? Wonder if I could even do it. Even though ghoul s could get hurt and dealt with more punishment than humans Kaoru nevertheless couldnt be convinced selfharm would ever be a good idea.You know expecting an answer to your outrage and getting a humurous gesture seemed absurd. Absurd enough for Kaoru break out into a gigglesnort. Regaining her posture she glanced over to Asa and asked Okay what was that about? Actually. Nevermind.

In a nearly unfathomable show of sloppiness her tie was askew and the stiff ponytail her dyed red hair slowly fading to blonde had been shaped into was beginning to come undone. A portable gaming device that Yumi knew little about hung loosely in her right hand. Yukishima was dead killed in action by a ghoul. Some part of her to her everlasting shame wasnt particularly surprised. He had never been one for caution or thinking things through. The strange handheld contraption in her possession had been his final gift to her in the will that all CCG personnel filled out before missions. Knowing him he had probably done it as a joke. That only made her feel so much worse. Reaching the bar she managed to work her way between the mass of bodies crowding the counter and signaled the bartender. Jack Daniels please she ordered voice dull and listless Open a tab and just leave the bottle.Pulling a card from her pocket she slid it across the counter. The bartender eyed her with suspicion but had the business sense to stay quiet. Armed with her bottle of whiskey Yumi removed the top and took a vigorous swig. She winced a little at the burn of the first taste.  A better whiskey would have been preferable but one couldnt expect much from Japan or so shed been told. She scanned the bar but could see no sign of an open seat. In a fleeting moment of despair she nearly gave up and started drinking where she stood heedless to the consequences. Luckily for all parties present her keen vision spotted an open spot in the corner across from a massive bearded hulk of a man. Yumi felt the slightest hint of trepidation as she made her way over but she no longer had it in her to care how the man might respond. She paused and gave the man a deep bow her movements mechanical and with none of the usual vigor. Pardon me sir she said dully I fear yours is the only open booth in this establishment.

For now she reined in her temper the promise of new knowledge worth more than immediate primal satisfaction. Among the various benignlooking bottles and bricks she was surprised to see the little bag of multicolored candy. Those were human food to her recollection. She wondered briefly why he would have them.I wouldnt know how things were before you left. Its my practice and common sense to avoid trusting in others. Blindly believing in the goodness of anyone especially ghouls only ends in getting stabbed in the back.Since Jack hadnt specified where to leave the bleach Kaya carefully placed the bottles down next to the other items hed removed. She was familiar with the substance and its cleaning properties but little else beyond that. If a ghoul said to be cautious however she was more inclined to heed it than most. Moving to his side at the little fire at his request she tried to keep her voice as nonchalant as possible.You blew up the old base huh? I think I remember some of the others mentioning that. It was a pretty big deal at the time. Id had a passing interest in meeting the culprit so I suppose this works out well. Is that what this potassium... stuff is? Explosives of some kind? How does bleach end up becoming a bomb?Her skin crawled a little with embarrassment. Kaya was far from accustomed to stumbling through her words.

He sat down in Tadashis seat much the same way although he sat straight up and drummed the fingers of his right hand against his leg while he waited for Tadashi to finish explaining how it all worked to Ume. Outwardly he was waiting patiently but internally he already could see at which parts Ume would struggle and be confused about and wasnt sure whether he should further expand on what the Re employee had said so that Ume would get the entire picture or let things play out as they would naturally especially since Ume wasnt the only one that had to get used to things. Tadashi had to get used to the way Ume worked too.In the end he decided to keep his mouth shut for now and let things happen as they would instead waiting for Ume to start with the mock serving. He smiled slightly towards Ume and nodded to show that she could do it his fingers having stopping drumming against his leg as Tadashi had finished speaking. After all he didnt want to make her any more nervous than she probably already was. Does she even understanno she literally doesnt. I remember asking her something about money before and she didnt really get it too well. That might be an issue....not to mention the sniffing thing. Subtle? Ume isnt exactly the most subtle of people....On one hand he was fervently hoping and wishing that things went off without a problem and Ume managed to understand everything properly right away. On the other however he also knew that any problems that needed to be sorted out would go over better with him as the customer instead of some random person.
