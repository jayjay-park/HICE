1435847,0,t3_2a1fr2,I usually flip back and forth. This year will be my th NaNo rd to win. So let me instill some wisdom on you. if youre writing a very worlddepended story get into rworldbuilding . make a loose plan and write down some ideas. lose the plan when it doesnt fit and just keep writing. Following the plan fully is not your goal so dont overthink it.Thats how I got it done. Every book Ive written Ive pivoted about quarter way through K sounds about right maybe earlier and wrote something almost completely different. I threw a wrench into the story and pivoted hardcore thats what happens when you start to see the flaws in your plan and see a better way out. It WILL happen trust me.As far as your questions. I mull around an idea all year but never start heavily planning until  months out. And by planning I mean I make a new Evernote note and write down bullet points of ideas world ideas and some plot points. I dont use the snowflake method and when I did it just caused issues. Its a rigid structure that doesnt allow for these pivots. It also doesnt take into the account the flow of writing at least for me.. I have trouble developing characters but beforehand just answer the major questions about your characters. What is their motivation? Whats their back stories? What is their goal? How are they around others? And formulate an image this way. Also take into account what their goal may be but where they end up. For instance if your characters wants to get out alive from wherever no matter the cost but in the end ends up sacrificing themselves.Good luck and cant wait to see you on this subreddit in November! ,nanowrimo,ciw9ddv,2,t5_2ql34

Its also much easier to edit  no messy scribbles on the page whenever Ive made a mistake or decided I dont like something.Plus I find it easier and more enjoyable to write when I have music going to set the mood. Having the writing music and any potential research needed readily available on the website just simplifies it all so much so I dont have to worry about managing several different things.

2181523,0,t3_2jub0q,Ive been doing NaNo for many many years. And I have found that I am most likely to fail when I dont have an outline. Therefore I have a very extensive outline for this year because I really want to stick to it.  One of the issues that has plagued me in the past is getting off to a great start and then having no idea where Im going. That can be fun even exhilarating for a bit but for me that soon turns to frustration and then boredom.  So this year I have really worked on an outline. Its solid. If I get stuck  I have  dozen other scenes I can write. I know roughly how it will end. I feel like I have a point to aim for.  Plus for me its harder for me to abandon my novel when I have put a lot of prep work into it. It gives me extra motivation.

I think this is where not during NaNo or during a break time without writing during NaNo you can sit down and read a book that is similar in genre to yours.  Read a page and analyze what the author did to create that page.I think cutting to the chase which I am victim to is when you are telling rather than showing.

Give yourself a couple of days to sleep on it.  Finally when youve gone over the notes a couple of times and considered all of the possibilities try to be honest with yourself and see if theres one you like best.  One that calls to you the most.  One that if you were looking for books to read you would buy today.As of right now I have five different story options for this year.  Im already working on outlines.  Once theyre finished Ill do exactly what I told youlook them over a couple of times each and add notes where necessary.

5632089,0,t3_3s95u0,Bi girl here and also Im interested in the representation problem in general so here are some thoughtsIm gonna step away from the sexuality discussion for a second here and talk about female characters. When a book or movie or whatever has only one or two important female characters they become representatives of their entire gender. This is why for example action movies with one damsel in distress and then a whole bunch of guys are a problem  theyre saying subtly and probably not on purpose that all women are kinda useless and weepy and need to be rescued all the time.Some people try to solve this problem by taking their one female character and turning her into a Strong Female Character. The result tends to be some kinda ninjaassassinstereotype who kicks ass but has no depth. Or if the author dares to give her a weakness it causes a huge internet flame war because oh look again a statement was unconsciously made about all women. For an example see the whole Black WidowinAoU shitstorm.The only solution Ive actually seen that worked was quantity. If you have five different female characters that are all important to the story suddenly you have freedom! One of them can be a damselindistress but thanks to the four other women in your story youre not accidentally saying that all women need rescuing. One can be sad about having been sterilized because that matters to her while the other women can have different opinions oh look women are not a hivemind we are all different who wouldve thought.So to get back to your bisexual main character You seem to be already on the right track by having a second bi character. Great! Now be sure not to give them both the same flaws. If one of them likes to sleep around a lot it doesnt sound like either of them does this is just an example the other could be in a serious longterm relationship to balance it out a bit. If one of them turns out to not be bi after all again just an example the other should most certainly stay happily bi. That way your characters are characters instead of statements.,nanowrimo,cwv7pk3,3,t5_2ql34

The short freewriting session was just about pouring my stream of consciousness down on the page discussing back and forth with myself about what I wanted to write. This really helped me in forming a seed for the story to grow upon and I ended up with something I think I never would have reached without trying this technique.

9538411,0,t3_5bhbnp,Hey youve got something right? Vampires. Thats a start. So heres what I would do. Think up a person. You dont need to know anything about them. If youre having a hard time look up pictures of people on Tumblr or Imgur until you find someone that interests you ideally this should be someone unknown to you. Now think up a place. It doesnt have to be super descriptive just something like alleyway or cheap motel or by the beach can be enough. Again if youre having trouble look up random pictures until you see something you like. Now that person is in the place you described.Now keep asking yourself more questions. Who is this person? What do they look like? What are they wearing? Are they a vampire or a human? If theyre a human are they going to become a vampire and if so how? If theyre a vampire then are they a part of a larger group of vampires and if so who are those people? How are they feeling? What are they doing? Are they with someone else or alone? Whats next on their agenda? Whats something interesting that can happen to them?You dont need to have some grand conflict planned to start. If you find yourself coming up with something you feel isnt interesting enough or a scene drags on ask yourself How can I disrupt this scene? For example maybe it starts with a vampire person sitting on the side of a road texting to their friend. So whats next? Maybe they get kidnapped by a vampire worshiping cult. Maybe a rival vampire attacks them. Maybe another supernatural creature possesses them. If youre still having trouble consider using a story conflict generator or a writing prompt You can do this just start putting words to paper or word processor.

Then I called it Religalia after the magic clothing she uses to fight monsters. A few billion name changes later I settled on Dressed to Kill also based on the magic clothing she uses to fight monsters.Honestly Im not sure Id read something with a name that barfy but I agree with the message  the title will come to you. Just keep writing for now.,nanowrimo,da0atrs,2,t5_2ql34

9666090,0,t1_da4jkgx,Ok that second option was where I was leaning toward though I havent explained it at all yet. Now that my mind is on plotholes I just realized another one. The hero and heroine have subdued the villain. Technically the villain is now completely defenseless. Why dont they kill her or trap her in something or do anything to her at all instead of just escaping before the villain wakes up?Thank you again by the way!,nanowrimo,da4jqqu,1,t5_2ql34

When Im about to take a break it helps to leave myself some notes where ever I left off  telling myself what part to write next and also some words of encouragement. Its a lot easier to start up again when I know exactly where to start. Happy ramblings! ,nanowrimo,da9n1rn,1,t5_2ql34

9755815,0,t1_daf1a4m,Why not have him say the machine is broke but hes hired someone to fix it. Roommates laundry piles up... Realises no one has come to fix the machine in a week... Then goes to investigate etc?,nanowrimo,dafmf99,1,t5_2ql34

9781563,0,t3_5f8e8c,I think it would be interesting if the protagonist gets the chance to escape at the end but perhaps sees the cult Ina new light that makes him stay willingly. ,nanowrimo,daisip1,2,t5_2ql34
