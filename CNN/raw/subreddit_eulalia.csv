4316320,0,t3_3aeihu,In the first book its pretty clear that the woodlanders live in a human world because it features human artifacts and things. However in future books Mossflower has become an entire world all on its own. St. Ninians persists however as does Redwall Abbey. The Abbey was founded by an order of mice but they dont seem to do much note than promote peace healing and charity towards others. I do get the impression that Abbess Germaine and her order were a bit more traditionally religious and some of that is reflected in the Abbeys principles and architecture. The Redwallers however dont have regular prayers like more traditional abbey monks but they do say grace or offer a blessing at meals. They do respect Martin as a guide and leader figure and they do thank him from time to time or ask for his guidance but hes treated more like a saint protector or father figure than a deity or a prophet. Hes... Like a talisman.Similarly the Badgers of Salamandastron venerate their ancestors. They also go into meditative trances where they believe they may have visions or find guidance from their ancestors. Again its less like worship but more like warm respect.Oddly the vermin often seem to be a bit more overtly religious  they refer to Hellgates often with their curses and seem to have a Devil figure as personified by a big wolf. Which is totally unfair by the way. The vermin have more superstition and they believe strongly in omens portents and witchcraft. The Badgers also believe in omens but vermin take it to another level. Soothsayers and seers are often positions of great power and importance in a vermin band often acting as secondincommand or advising the warlord directly.Overall Id say the creatures of Mossflower are quietly religious but not pushy about it. If they have a codified faith it is simple and lacking in frills  much like the woodlanders themselves. Its just a part of who they are as present as a tail or a paw so theres no need to proselytize or send out missions for conversion. The mice of Redwall live by their principles and offer a warm hearth to any goodhearted creatures who wish to join them. Its more of a philosophy than a codified religion.,eulalia,csc6d51,4,t5_2wt79

4822605,0,t1_cu2fdkp,I strongly recommended Pearls of Lutra and Marlfox. Doomwhyte is good but not necessarily a classic like the older ones. ,eulalia,cu2fgc2,6,t5_2wt79

9214339,0,t3_56fmxr,The Taggerung was my favourite because it was one of the few of his books where not only was goodevil not necessarily drawn down species lines and because Jacques tackled more human social issues like child abuse and domestic violence. ,eulalia,d8jzi3l,2,t5_2wt79
