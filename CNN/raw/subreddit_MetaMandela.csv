5707791,0,t1_cx4laoc,I think youd probably be surprised at how little moderation actually happens now  after the sub purged the users that were just going around antagonising everyone and nothing else. There are some dogs that only aggravate and never settle.The reason to my dismay the sub tends to get a disproportionate share of parallel universe theorists etc is because theres a lack of people posting the alternative e.g. neurobiological study stuff or whatever. If peoples opposition to an idea is just to say its crap then theyve basically handed over the control of the narrative to the people with the idea they oppose those people have set the agenda for you because youve not actually developed a platform to stand on yourself.,MetaMandela,cx4lvaa,1,t5_39l2d

8395111,0,t3_4tkkfy,The problem is the Mandela Effect seems to be an enigma wrapped in a meme wrapped in a cult. A lot of people dont want to actually discuss the effect because as far as theyre concerned its cause has already been solved and its effect is beyond discussion. Once you dismiss everything as the universal simulation being rewritten and any evidence to the contrary as residue then what really is there to discuss? How many angels can dance on the head of a pin? ,MetaMandela,d5qxp7w,5,t5_39l2d

9077365,0,t1_d82k6sw,Actually both google and bing search and could not find any quotes that have been changed in the New Testament due to the Mandela Effect. Hmmm I wonder if more Christians than Atheists Muslims Hindus Buddhists Jews Pagans etc. have MEs? Maybe we should take a poll. The only thing I would worry about with a poll is people hating on any of the religions. ,MetaMandela,d82ya9x,1,t5_39l2d
9481686,0,t1_d9hoo4g,gt I would of course hope I may of some description be able to show that when commas are forgotten there is precedent for a modal verb being seen before of. In this I hope we can of agreement be.When commas are forgotten? No thats bad orthography which negates the point youre trying to make. You leaving out the comma makes your would of course just as invalid as would of been. Who or what is the would of course? In any case you avoided the point the point which negates your original post which Ill repeatIt is not the same thing at all because no one remembers a time when could of was correct.,MetaMandela,d9htm86,1,t5_39l2d
