11642271,0,t1_dgedg5n,This was a great read!  Safe to assume you know the history between John and Ty?  I had the exact opposite experience.  I caught Thee Oh Sees live for the first time with Ty opening didnt know Ty but knew OF him.  This was back around Goodbye Bread.  I saw three dudes covered in stoner locks and a gal on drums Emily Rose and was like WTF is this?  Then they DECIMATED.  My boys and I instantly switched to tequila and next thing I know we are stage diving...first and last time an unheard opener caused such a primal reaction.  Spent the oh sees set flailing on the front monitors like an unsound fish...oh the memories. ,TheeOhSees,dgfny8y,2,t5_2we41
