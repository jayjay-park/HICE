Most people I talked too feel that  is good for immortep. If you have better heroes for raids ect immortep starts becoming a victim of diminishing returns for hbm wave clearing past this point. Succubus is only really good in the arena and her skill is not level dependent. So leveling her any just gives you more hp to your shrine and more damage in a head on situation. Then you have your pally ninja atlanticore group. these heroes are only serve niche purposes that can usually be done by some other hero better. atlanticore with the right talent can be amazing but still only helpful in arena and and i have heard that with luck good at taking down a troublesome dino in hbm. All your other legendary heroes are great and should be leveled as much as possible really. but like dad said cupid and pd can go up last. It is especially advised on pd every star level increases his speed. and If he too fast he will kill himself with out the help of every one else.  ,dadsguild,cimjj33,2,t5_31z5l

4601183,0,t3_3e0ld0,I think that boss  is not worth the reward. Hopefully the other guilds dont do it until they raise the rewards. I would like to try every once in a while though. Maybe the st and th of the month... or something like that.,dadsguild,ctakga4,1,t5_31z5l
