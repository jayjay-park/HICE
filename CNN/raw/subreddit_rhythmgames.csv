6757977,0,t3_47hkar,I dont think the Patapon series has been mentioned yet. Theyre an interesting mix of strategy RPG and rhythm where you help little eyeball people reach the end of the earth playing drums to the beat of the music to command them and take down enemy armies and giant beasts. It somehow sold enough to get three games all for PSP but I never see it mentioned anywhere. Its a pretty cool series if you can get into it.,rhythmgames,d0ibxst,2,t5_2qlqn

6775282,0,t3_48i9ka,its a shame rb doesnt have the real instrument mode from  nor does it seem to have support for the keyboards from  either. when rb was announced months ago i was hoping for a piano mode even if it wasnt real. oh well. at least i can possibly buy this game now even if i would have to go get a guitar for it at least.,rhythmgames,d0k9ff4,5,t5_2qlqn
7840563,0,t1_d3vcfre,osu! is the easiest to set up rhythm game Ive played... Step mania and kshoot mania were hard to find the songs for compared to osu! and LR was a nightmare. Osu mostly sets itself up. You install and grab a few beatmaps from the official web page and youre good to go.,rhythmgames,d3xciij,5,t5_2qlqn
8215065,0,t3_4rtjo3,Seems pretty interesting although it feels more like a novelty than anything that could feasibly evolve into a high end rhythm game. Cool concept nonetheless.,rhythmgames,d54frvc,1,t5_2qlqn
8729181,0,t1_d6wb8tq,Yeah I agree that C is better than JS for code quality. But for projects like this one Ive found that playing in the mud is more productive for me because somehow the part of my brain that makes creative stuff just shuts down when the part responsible for code quality wakes up. We programmers are good at fixed attention but creativity requires wandering attention and having unexpected lucky thoughts. YMMV.Also I just tried adding some keypress sounds from simple clicks to whooshes whistles scratches and such. It feels like adding any keypress sound upsets the delicate balance of attention that exists in the game. Either the music fades into the background or the raindrops become unnoticeable etc. Ill keep experimenting but its very likely that the idea just doesnt work.Actually hey you can try it. Open the game in Chrome. Open Developer Tools go to Sources tab. Somewhere under the gamedrop folder find script.js. In the source view find the line with playMoveSound uncomment it and hit CtrlS. Continue playing the game without reloading the page and see if you like it,rhythmgames,d6wsi2q,2,t5_2qlqn

11225594,0,t1_df4ean0,You can try the alpha version on their website. Personally Id say its challenging enough keeping track of several different rhythms at once seen in the alpha version is difficult.,rhythmgames,df4enre,1,t5_2qlqn
