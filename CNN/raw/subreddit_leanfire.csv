4605547,0,t3_3e0r2n,gt Personally I feel that this has a small return relative to what a business owner could make.The more I study business and corporate finance the less Im convinced this is the case.  If your growth requires additional capital its not really increasing your return.  The nature of competition tends to drive down return on capital back down to reasonable levels.  The only exceptions tend to be natural or created monopolies think a gravel quarry where the cost of shipping the gravel is much higher than the actual cost of mining it.As a small business Im sure you may be able to find a niche where you can operate without significant competition and if you fly below the radar Ill bet you can enjoy out sized returns for quite a while.  Its just not an easy task there are a lot of people out there hunting and if what you are doing is obviously highly profitable someone will try to replicate it.,leanfire,ctb44z5,3,t5_38u7g

7934102,0,t1_d47rxsj,Its going to take you  years to really understand the landscape and for the downsides to be apparent.  Government entities tend to take on an institutional character of their own and can be highly resistant to change.  You may realize one day that management doesnt actually care if the projects succeed or that your success is upsetting the oxcart and getting you sandbagged.  It may be a simple as the realization that the more work you do the less work everyone else does.  Im not saying youll hate it Im just saying theres no telling right now if you are really going to love the job  years from now.Theres also other opportunities  if you succeed where you are you may be able to switch to a different agency or private company for higher pay.  Try to reduce the amount of time you spend with your hands tied if possible just so that you have the freedom to chase a great opportunity if it comes along.You may have both a b and k.  If that is the case you can double dip and contribute the max to both.  The b is better than the k since it has no minimum age so you could use it as an unemployment fund just as easily.  If theres a match you may be able to get the match on both.When I talk about stagnation I just mean that on a personal level. There are a million and one ways to keep yourself moving forward outside of working on FI.  It might be at your job or lifting weights or rock climbing or building your side business.  Just beware of falling into complacency its real easy to just watch TV when you get home order a pizza and do the minimum at your job for  years.  You wont be happy with the result.If you are going to be working anyways then start trading your money for time in intelligent ways.  Take a look at anything you do that you dont enjoy and figure out if you can throw money at it instead of time and what the exchange rate is.Examples   minute run to Target instead of Amazon.  Save  on the items spend  on gasmileage pay rate  per hour. Costco trip per month that takes  hours.  Save yr on groceries spend yr on membership yr on extra driving.  It comes out to mo saved or around  per hour.Move to an apartment  block from work.  Cost  extra per month.  Commute of  mins saved x  tripsday x  work days per month   hours.   per day of gasmileage saved x  work days  .  So cost is  time saved is  hours it will cost you  per hour for that time.Hire a maid  cost .  Would take you  hours to do the work yourself cost hr.Dine out instead of cooking  cost   minutes saved.  Cost hr plus you wont be eating as healthy.Some back of the napkin math will help you to make smart deliberate trades that increase the amount of free time you have for doing the things you enjoy.,leanfire,d47v8zj,1,t5_38u7g

You put your emergency fund in too and then tell the roboadvisor what kind of liquidity you want. You dont hold part of your portfolio elsewhere that just messes up the allocation. Its designed to work with tax advantaged accounts and youll probably trigger wash sales and make an absolute mess of your taxes holding the same assets elsewhere.  In any event cash is part of the portfolio and that is by design to get to a portfolio with an optimum balance of risk and return.

11683762,0,t3_66oyxf,I feel mostly qualified to answer this as my plan is to sell everything that doesnt fit into my backpack within the next  years and start perpetually traveling the world.First you can absolutely keep a home base and travel full or part time.  The main drawback is that it would be more expensive than not having it so youd have to work longer and save more to make that happen.  Now of course thats fine if youd like to do that but I think its unnecessary and a waste of money effort and years.I think you need to figure out WHY you would want to keep a residence.  If you just want a place to stash your possessions you dont need to continually pay a mortgage to do that.  However I suspect that this is not the reason you want a home base.  What you really want is some stability some guarantee that youre not going to be sleeping on the coldass concrete again.  Something to protect against when it gets real crazy.But heres the thing.  You dont need to own a house to protect from that.  You just need money.  Your current mindset is that of a bare minimalist read broke traveler.  Personally I cant imagine sleeping outside would ever be an option.  I would simply pay for a room.  If I want a house Ill rent a house.  If I get tired of travel Ill find some place to stay put for  months or  months or a year.  None of these require me to carry a mortgage deal with renters or property managers pay for maintenance or any of the other headaches that come with owning a house while not living there.  But all of them ensure that I can move at my own pace and have insurance against sleeping on concrete.And then if you travel for awhile and decide that youd like to stop you still have the money to buy or rent a place anywhere youd like along with the money to furnish it with possessions.  In short you have options.  But having a house with a mortgage payment that needs to be met every month gives you fewer options because it leaves you with less money.,leanfire,dgkde0y,10,t5_38u7g
