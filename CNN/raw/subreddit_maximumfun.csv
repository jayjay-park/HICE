The AR platform is very malleable. By choosing different components you can create guns that perform very differently. Mine is made to be a soft shooting midrange rifle. My local range only goes out to  yards so that is what I built it for.My metallurgy knowledge is focused more to foundry processes. Melting pouring and heat treating of steel. We make valve components from  to  lbs. These go into refineries and power generation including nuclear. We also make some military parts. Its mostly armor but also drive wheels for tanks and such.

2289689,0,t3_2leuus,There was a moment I thought Hodgman might rule the wrong way on this. phew. Glad it went my way for a number of reasons.Also if you need to restrain your dog in your car please be aware of what your actual options are. Right now there are only a few meaningful ways to fully secure a dog in a car is in a secured hard crate of appropriate size. Almost anything else will fail in a crash and may potentially cause much more injury to your pet or you and some of them are downright useless or dangerous. The take away here is this the only way to safely transport a dog in a care is a secured safe crate in the car. Nothing else comes close in terms of safety but some are particularly bad.The one that is the least useless is perhaps the dog safetybelt harnesses  the ones that clip on to a seat belt and keep the dog harnessed in the seat. These have been proven to have extremely high rates of failure and because of the way that they can restrain dogs are more likely to injure the dogs. These devices were not crashtested until  when an animal safety group finally crash tested them and found terrifying resultsgt  Results and Analysis  What We Learned  gt Alarmingly the pilot study revealed a  percent failure rate.  None of the harnesses were deemed safe enough to protect both the dog and the humans in the event of an accident.gt The slowmotion videos below provide evidence of what happens to a large harnessed dog in a simulated collision of a car traveling  miles per hour. Examples of problems includegt  Extremely low likelihood of survivability for the animal.gt  Danger to humans when the dog becomes a missile.gt  Choking andor other bodily harm to the animal when harness materials cinch tightly upon impact.gt  Extensive damage to fixtures within the vehicle caused by the projectile animal.There have been a few options that have been developed in more recent years as a result of this that are decent options and that have been crashtested. So that  failure rate is reduced in certain models only.,maximumfun,clupzum,5,t5_2s8a0

3456705,0,t3_2yqtfa,Loved so much  had to transcribeBut even though you are fourteen years old Keaton and thus a little bit older than the target audience for the original run of PeeWees Playhouse I would guess the fact is that it is ESSENTIAL CULTURE.  Its an important piece of American culture because it represents such a strange time in our televisual history when we entrusted our Saturday morning childrens program to avantgarde cartoonists and postironic performance artists.  It also featured both in front of and behind the scenes incredibly talented actors set designers composersI mean the set design of PeeWees Playhouse itself is a legitimate work of American art of that time. It was designed by Gary Panter the great cartoonist whose work I first discovered in the s in the pages of Raw magazine which of course was the new underground and European and new cartoon magazine that was coedited by Franoise Mouly and Art Spiegelman  and Gary Panters work was in there incredibly provocative subversive cartooning. Cyndi Lauper obviously sang the theme song which is iconic. It launched the careers of actors like Laurence Fishburne and S. Epatha Merkeson and Natasha Lyonne it had music from Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo and The Residents and the Penny cartoons some of the earliest work of Nick Park and David Sproxton of Aardman Animation who went on to make Wallace amp Gromit I mean  this is  the DNA of this show is full of amazing artistry and thats even the stuff you cant know when youre a kid you only know when youre an obsessive older person right? But even as a kid imagine Keaton if you can  I know its difficult for you because youre a fourteenyearold and your imagination has stopped working for a while while your body pumps all kinds of weird new hormones through you that make you into an inhuman selfish monster that cant see an inch beyond himself for any given moment  but imagine if you can what it would have been like in the s when Saturday morning all you could watch was Bravestar  and here was a show that was anarchic silly profoundly human decent nonjudgmental WEIRD. And this is the thing that I think is most valuable because kids who watched Saturday morning television shows in this time and arguably today had no model of weirdness. So if anyone felt weird if anyone felt like a weirdo because of what they liked what they listened to how they felt whom they were attracted to what they looked like and anyone who felt like a weirdo and was a kid at that time had NOTHING TO SEE. Until PeeWee showed up wearing MAKEUP. And talking to genies with heads in boxes and malicious mannequins and creating a world for himself full of friends that was profoundly strange and beautiful and human and great. And you also got to see which you didnt know you were seeing when you were a kid was a peek into this world of art history you know of the Gary Panters and the Residents and the kooky architecture and strange musics and Miss Yvonne the most beautiful woman in the world which is not to take anything away from the woman who played Miss Yvonne who is beautiful but not  you know when you hear the most beautiful woman in the world and someone walks in in a crazy s hairdo and she looks like your mom and PeeWee is falling all over her its a beautiful subversion of what quoteunquote beauty means. So Keaton I dont blame you for not knowing any of this or not getting it because as far as I can tell YOU WATCHED THE OPENING SONG. Why dont you watch the rest of it? If its not for you I understand. When I was youngerbecause Im still young relevant and vitalwhen that show came out I was in my late teens moving into my twenties. I guess I was    around there. And I loved PeeWee from the MTV cause I was cool and I watched that show and Im like Ooh this is not for me. This is for kids. And it was only later that I appreciated it absolutely is for me. Its for everybody. Its for everybody. I like you was a judgmental jerk because I was in my teens and I was anxious about my status in the world that is to say I was anxious about being thought of as an adult and thinking of myself as an adult and wanting to put away all the greasy kids stuff so I would obsessively cultivate only the most mature sophisticated culture  but as I have said over and over again to the person in my life who is closest to your age a thirteenyearold woman who lives in my house now that she has started to worry about being adult she acts more childish than when she was a child. You should watch this thing and figure it out and acknowledge that your dumb little brother maybe understands a little bit better than you do why its great. And if you cant acknowledge he does acknowledge that I do. But because you are a teenager and you cant acknowledge that anyone has anything to say to you it may be some years before you appreciate that I was always right. Your weird dad was always right and I just hope you visit me in the hospital when that time comes. ,maximumfun,cpmagh6,2,t5_2s8a0

However given some though I think this could actually be really good.    One of the main things that could use improvement with Wham Bam Pow is the audience interaction.  I think Rhea Ricky and Cameron do a pretty good job of responding to the audience emails and tweets but I do envy the Pop Rocket Facebook forum.  I wish the reddit here was more lively.  I think there is a lot to talk about with each episode but I dont really know where to put my thoughts.  It would be really cool to have more interactions per week.    If the hosts are really going to have purposeful and engaging conversations outside the podcast like they said they would I think that could work.  I would definitely want to be a part of that and I think most of the audience would like that too.

If you say Yes I am Jewish usually they help you put on a tefillin  and say the shema main Jewish prayer or something like that.  Or sometimes they are looking for extra people because they need  men to pray  or God cant hear them.

I have such an appreciation for what he does but also for the fact that hes just a pedantic nerdy dad with a pulpit something I aspire to be one day. But really his verdicts have brought me to near tears more often that I would have thought possible. Its really quite brilliant.

I mainly state what I said because even though I see your point on how you saw the movie I think lots of folks who both saw and liked the movie will agree with Justin on it.However I always take issue with bias when someone brings up a comparison to an older model of the movie eg Richard Donner films which Justin precisely mentioned. Statements like that make me think of my childhood bias.
