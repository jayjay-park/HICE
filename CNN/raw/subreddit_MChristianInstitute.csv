9187063,0,t3_561rk1,I am glad to see content coming out of the CI though of course I do disagree with it on a theological and philosophical basis. One thing I must point out however is the translation of the Hebrew. I dont think its intentional but that translation of Genesis  does not match up very well to the Hebrew. The JPS translates it asgt  And the Lord God said It is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him.fromgt          .The phrase help meet is derived from the word for help helper or saved ezer and kenegdo meaning in front of or opposite The root being neged. Ezer crops up a lot in the Tanakh notably in Samuel where we get the name Ebenezer and the Psalms in reference to God. The part which refers to help doesnt actually have any relation to being opposite of something.This is at least how I understand it and have been taught it. ,MChristianInstitute,d8gizp9,1,t5_3ft9x
