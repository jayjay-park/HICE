5571785,0,t1_cwnnjmn,My area slightly leans left but there are a large number of conservatives. Id say that a more than a third is liberalprogressive a third is conservative and a third is moderate. The club is technically about progressivism as a whole but most of my posters are talking directly about Bernie. Ik that there are a fair amount of people who are interested or would be interested. There is a feminist group at my school that consistently gets dozens of people at their meetings upwards of  sometimes and a good number of them are Bernie supporters. A couple of them are conservatives but most are liberal or at the very least lean left. There are people who are interested I just havent found the right strategy to get them to actually know about my club and show up as well.  I think the problem is that high schoolers generally arent that interested in politics or activism and so when there is already one leftleaning activist group it may be taking up all the space for peoples desire to be involved in activism. If that ends up to be true Ill fold and continue on alone but I would really like to get people organized for Bernie.,StudentsforSanders,cwnqc6f,2,t5_386wo

Make sure your friends who will be eighteen are registered and will vote in the primaries. If you have a car offer to drive people on June .,StudentsforSanders,cwt4qeh,1,t5_386wo
