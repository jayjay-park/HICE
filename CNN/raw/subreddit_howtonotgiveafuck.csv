99210,0,t1_cepk64b,Although I think the statement was poorly executed and thrown out very lazily he didnt exactly state that the past was nothing. Simply that it was history.There is a bit of a distinction to be made. Of course your history and experiences have played a gigantic role in who you have developed into. Thats ok.However the truth of the matter is that you will have to accept your past for what it is and forgive yourself and those involved for it. Forgiveness in this instance does not really mean anything along the lines of Hey rapistperson dont worry I forgive you. No harm no foul were cool! at all. It is instead something more like I am no longer angry at you or going to let you or what you did to me have any power over me any longer. I am releasing you from dominating my active thought patterns and you will instead be relegated only to my memories.Not only are you jumping to conclusions a bit with how defensive you are but it seems to me that you cling to your past to identify yourself by the importance you place on history. This makes the original quote all the more relevant. If you are clinging to your past to create your identity rather than consciously deciding who you want to be and choosing to view all of your past simply as learning experiences then you will continue to put yourself in the position you find yourself in now. It scares me that you say History is everything because that line and those words are cementing in your head that you are the person of your past as opposed to being the person you decide to be here and now. I recognize that you are cognizant of needing to make peace with your past but part of that is accepting that it literally is in the past and it does not have to dictate your present actions as you move into the future.In other words by clinging to your past you are saying I am a person who was abused my entire life to yourself and that is who you are as you go through each day. Scared insecure etc. When you start to let that go you transition to saying statements like I am a wonderful person who loves to hobby does a great job working at my awesome job has a great significant other and gosh darnit people like me.So yes the way to make peace with your past is literally changing how you relate to it and view it which is directly tied to realizing the past is history. Instead of History is everything try changing your thoughts to The past was something I went through and I have learned from those experiences but it does not define who I am. What I do in the present defines who I am.Please dont get me wrong Im not trying to be a dick and correct you to show any kind of superiority or play on small little differences in words. I didnt have as fucked up a childhood or adulthood as you did but Ive gone through my own struggles and many years of turning around huge depression and anxiety to living a confident and fulfilling life. It is because of this that I am replying in hopes of helping in my own small way because my heart goes out to you and I would simply implore of you to start to consider the quote in a larger context beyond Oh dont worry about your past so much and youll be fine because that is not what is really being said.Of course this is not as simple as the original quote. This is a long road to redefining who you are. You have to modify your reactions and break the repetitive patterns you have conditioned your mind to do via habit all these years. There is a very famous quote from Viktor Frankl about that moment of space between stimulus and reaction. For example when you start to get jealous over something with your significant other that would be a good time to try to catch yourself and go Has this person given me any reason to be jealous? Is this the person I want to be if I continue to react the same way I have in the past?One last comment I have a good friend who was sexually abused as a child for years and went through many fucked up years in his teens and twenties as well. He wrote a book about this that has helped a number of people. I would not say the book is the beall endall to selfdevelopment but it is a very good introduction to turning your life around and moving beyond your past. It is also a lot more modern and accessible than some other selfhelp stuff out there because it is filled with personality and reads like a story rather than a psychology textbook. I wont link it because of my obvious personal interest in seeing my friend do well with book sales but you might try googling When Jonathan Cried For Me and if his style suits you then consider buying the ebook which is very cheap.,howtonotgiveafuck,cepq4eh,3,t5_2tna8

I think a friendship based on attraction and one based on friendship are two entirely different things because the underlying motives and hopes for the relationship are different. Strong friendships can form from hookups but usually its not until after that curiosity is sated can you really bond. I feel like no matter the outer appearance of the relationship if the motives are steeped in wantinghoping for something else the bond isnt as strong.

THATS what put a value on your previous relationship together when you saw she valued you less than she valued the SO which you found intolerable. Good for you. You know your worth.Regardless she brought the distance. You dont have to nor should you let her back. Its all good. Go have fun with you and yours and ditch the baggage carrying regretful girl.

757881,0,t1_cgqd1jr,Wow thanks for sharing that! I am loving that you know your opinions may not go over well but youre still willing to put them out there for criticism. Respect.As far as addressing your comments I suppose I would say that both scientists and the very religious have something in common a deep regard for the truth. Therefore I think that whenever science and religion are in conflict we have come across either bad science bad religion or possibly both. And I think we make a mistake when we suggest that one of these fields always trumps another. To claim that science always trumps religion is to assert that naturalism is true in which we presume that the supernatural is impossible and reject or reinterpret any data that points to such a thing. And unfortunately for the committed scientist who honours the old code of never making assumptions without evidence naturalism is a presupposition a bias  not a conclusion. Conversely to claim that religion always trumps science is to assert that our physical observations are meaningless and in no way affects spiritual true reality. Unfortunately for the Christian who believes in a Creator God of truth this severely limits the immediate practicality of God makes the Christians beliefs seem like nonsense to those around him or her and worst of all hinders the Christians motivation to be of real sacrificial service to those around him or her which directly contradicts Biblical direction.So my argument then is that claiming science makes religion obsolete or vice versa is logically inconsistent with the position you claim to hold either as scientist or believer. Perhaps the reason you are easily frustrated with religious people is that you see them on the opposing extreme of the spectrum.  I can easily see a religious person taking exactly the opposite view that you have! They might think that you cannot possibly understand how awesome our universe is because youre confined by naturalism. Without considering something to be intelligently designed how could you ever appreciate the intricacies of the world? Perhaps they are especially bothered when you say Medicine alone saved this persons life despite the fact that the doctors were totally blindsided by the patients sudden recovery? What makes your position correct and their foolishness? You will probably think Because my claims are corroborated by science! If your science assumes philosophical naturalism which is ALWAYS a faithbased assertion! then this is directly comparable to Because God says so in the Bible!. My dear mom told me once that when we are easily frustrated by someones behaviour it is often because it reminds us of something we dont like about ourselves. I respectfully suggest this only because you have posted here asking how to stop caring about this Maybe your belief in science has stepped beyond what is objectively proven and into the realm of faith and you are actually finding that religious people remind you of yourself. Many on this sub will happy agree to the idea that you cannot change others which means that your journey to inner peace requires selfawareness and a commitment to changing yourself which you do have some control over. I hope my ramblings aid you in that  if not please forgive me for conjecturing about sensitive issues. I truly do just want to help.,howtonotgiveafuck,cgqfev1,3,t5_2tna8

1009784,0,t1_chj24hq,Awesome advice. Im going to elaborate a little on it and see what you think. My ex was living with me she had moved in about a month and we both went out separately for the night. She ignored my phone calls around the time she was supposed to pick me up. I assumed she was cheating because she had slept with some coworker in our past. Kicked her out after a huge blow up fight.She basically said she hated me and forcefully moved onto the old guy shes with now.For a year and a half... Up until this past month she would reach out to me via email. She changed her number and we blocked each other on Facebook. I had never tried contacting her ever. But like clock work every  months she was contacting me telling me how she wished she treated me better and how much she loved me.Shes been seeing this guy pretty much on and off for a year. She had an abortion of his in January and ran back to me. We had sex while she was going through her abortion  which I had no idea about until she told me the next day. I thought she was just on her period.That fucked me up horribly. I didnt know how to handle it. We decided to stop talking. No contact from me again... She emails me if we ever got back together I would be the best girl you ever had promise made with a few more flirty emails following up. Then she tells me shes still seeing this old guy.. So I went off on her and told her to stay out of my life forever. Which was towards the end of April. Now shes moved on with this old guy and Im not as depressed as I once was. I just cant seem to let go entirely. She is easily top  worst thing thats ever happened to me. Im not sure if its because shes extremely hot and the sex was great that I cant let go. Or because she was sort of there for me when my sister died. Until I found out she was fucking another coworker who was a old friend of mine either way... Ive done it all. Taken months off dating went on slut sprees. Tried getting involved emotionally working out building furniture as a hobby... Everything.I just cant seem to let go entirely. I just dont want to give a fuck anymore. Im too young for this shit.,howtonotgiveafuck,chj2j5k,1,t5_2tna8

People who dont waste  years of their undergraduate career drinking smoking weed and partying while failing shit tons of classes.  People who have selfrespect and are intelligent enough to realize what they want from life and the steps needed to get there.  People who dont take  fucking years to finish an undergraduate degree.

1261785,0,t3_28jgfq,Dont think of it as being weak asking someone for help see it as being strong for getting help. The hardest step is getting help at the start a lot of problems will come to the surface and it may feels like things are getting worse but then youll notice theyll start to get better. The therapist isnt there to fix your problems the therapist is there to help you to fix your problems. Its a bit of a shock right now and you probably feel fairly low that you know for sure but these terms are only labels put in place to identify the problem. They dont have to follow you around for the rest of your life if you work with your therapist to make things better. Dont worry about tags or labels right now in a way you already knew and now you have confirmation you can go about fixing it. In the same way if you go to a doctor with a bad back and the doctor telled you with a slipped disc. You already knew there was a problem you just know for sure now. Keep your head up and follow the advice of the professionals.,howtonotgiveafuck,cibkeiv,8,t5_2tna8
1268003,0,t1_cic8nfo,Peaking is when you put more and more on the line until you go downhill and basically dont have nearly as much happiness as you once did. one example can be a kid that gets more and more into drugs including alcohol. then at peak hes living this crazy life. he is having a blast sneaking out of his house going to parties not really studying for school at all but he thinks hes got it all figured out and says fuck the system. Parties are getting boring faster to him so to keep things interesting he gets drunk at one party and then drives up late to another something he never did before. His parents are getting angry but dont know how to handle it. Any punishment he sneaks around anyway. After his junior year his grades are shit. They start yelling at him he yells back and then leaves in his car pissed off because hey he knows more than they do right? Goes to an end of the year party drinks. Driving to the next party he hits someone with his car. charges D.U.I. manslaughter. reckless driving. Thats jailtime and at least and thats just the DUI At  years old this guy is working retail and has no other plans for anything soon hes still paying off heavy fines.Another example. Girl is really smart and absolutely beautiful. Taking honors classes in sophmore year and is involved in extra curriculars after school. She cant handle this schedule but shes trying to impress parents friends boys and colleges. Come Junior year she is taking  AP classes in the first semester. This girl is a weekend partier but its mainly just weed in a friends basement that gets her to relax on a saturday night. Over christmas break shes at a party in someones basement and really needs to relax so she heroin. As school is starting up she is slowly falling into addiction. She doesnt see the problem its helping her lose weight how could this be bad? Her  AP classes dont make it any easier. In march shes caught with a heroin kit. Expelled from school. I dont think her credits transferred. I honestly dont know what happened to this girl next. Havent been able to contact her since. She sort of fell off the face of the earth.Ive seen both of these happen and its really sad.,howtonotgiveafuck,cic9m10,3,t5_2tna8

If its smaller than  inches yeah I guess but thats about less than  of the population. But if its longer than  you dont have other issues like ED or premature ejactulation and most importantly if she doesnt sense that you let your size define your sense of selfworth there is no way shes gonna make an issue out of it. Most guys make little to no effort to please girls during sex they just thrust at the pace that feels good to them and finish. Youll just have to make more effort than those guys. Any woman that would shame a guy for his dick size clearly has hideously lowesteem that they feel the need to resort to such cruelness to cover their lack of selfworth. Not someone Id wanna associate with much less have sex with.,howtonotgiveafuck,clqbrgm,1,t5_2tna8
2263121,0,t3_2l4ebq,I had the same problem the thing that got me over it was being rejected and rejecting advances from girls. I learned that if you get rejected it doesnt mean that youre ugly or undesirable youre just not in that particular persons tastes and its better to keep looking and find the person that likes you than the one who is settling. Same goes the other way rejecting a girl I may not have interested in rather than saying yes because Im lonely or I feel like therell be no one else. Those were big confidence boosters for me as well as the helped me understand myself and my tastes better.,howtonotgiveafuck,clrfx6k,4,t5_2tna8
2270053,0,t3_2l72mp,Brother brother brother I feel like I was MADE for this thread.  I went on medication for acne minocycline shortly after my st birthday.  It cleared up my acne but it gave me the WORST facial blushing Ive ever had.  When it first started to happen I thought it was just a weird side effect that would go away when I stopped taking the medication spoiler alert it didnt.What followed was three of the most painstaking years of my life.  Obviously not all of it from the blushing but it definitely destroyed my confidence at the age when I should have been out having fun.  A few things I learned  Learn to love yourself.  In the grand scheme of things facial blushing is not a big deal.  There are people walking around with disfigurement that have confidence why cant you?  The less you let it embarrass you the less you will blush overall.    Get healthy.  Drink a lot of water.  Exercise.  Eat better and take care of your diet.  I found I would blush a lot more when my stomach was upset or I was experiencing acid reflux symptoms.  This led me down a path of acid reflux meds that I should have never been on and led to more problems down the line.  Cover it up.  Buy this and use it.  Grow a beard.  Wear a hat.  It will help distract others and yourself from thinking youre constantly embarrassed.Anyways that and time are what worked for me.  I know how bad it can suck as I went from a confident guy that loved attention and would look everyone in the eye to a recluse that shied away from life.  I can never get those years back but you can learn from my mistakes.  Its really not a big deal at all.  I went bald two years later at  from my doctor overprescribing an acid reflux med.  Then facial blushing didnt seem too bad.  Live long and prosper my friend.,howtonotgiveafuck,clsaqz1,6,t5_2tna8

2380855,0,t3_2mnujt,Well you shouldnt give a fuck because everybody has to start somewhere to get good at anything. Even the very best boxers were beginners once.That being said consider taking lessons or a class or watching some videos because punching technique is important and beginners get injured frequently because the little stabilizer muscles around your wrist arent strong yet. Hand injuries are no joke and can be pretty common among beginner boxers if you dont watch your form. A few tipsWrap your hands tight and properly. Watch a few videos on this and dont neglect to wrap your wrist for support. Use  inch wraps unless you have tiny hands.  are mostly for kids and women.Never hit the bag without hand wraps and gloves. Strike with your top big knuckles and raise the shoulder of your punching arm when you strike.  Your wrist should ALWAYS be straight never bent for any reason. If youre throwing a hook it bends at the elbow from the elbow down should always be an unbroken perfectly straight forearmwristfist.Practice slowly to get the form into your muscle memory. Look in the mirror if you can. Practice your  combo in slow motion until you can do it in your sleep then work on hitting with power. Bring your hand back to a defensive position immediately dont let it flop down after you strike.Keep your upper body loose relaxed and casual. When youre walking down the street your upper body isnt stiff and your arms swing a little bit right? Well for some reason people tense up when they fight even though thats bad for movement. When I throw a punch my arm doesnt really tense up until the very last second before impact its like snapping a towel in the locker room loose and free for most of the movement and then it explosively snaps right at the end.Finally check out ramateurboxing and keep working hard!,howtonotgiveafuck,cm5zcxp,7,t5_2tna8

Its very easy to be caught up in the feelings of anxiety and you just need to take a step back and figure out why you feel that way.

3870132,0,t3_34rf9i,Hey Buddy Sorry you have a condition that makes you feel so bad. I really dont think you should let it affect your social life though. People who are not superficial assholes wont mind having you around even if youre spitting just because you have a condition especially if youre cool. Why alienate someone just because of some medical condition they have? I dont think Im in the minority when I say that most would not care as long as they know whats going on. As far as dating goes I dont think you should be too worried about that either. Just go out make some friends and have some fun be yourself and eventually once youll be okay with who you are with all the quirks and strangeness that your body sometimes have youll find someone who will love you. Its hard to love someone who doesnt love themselves though so first learn to be okay with yourself before you go out and try to find someone who can love you. My boyfriend has a disease that makes his skin peel a lot and it also makes his ears very waxy at all times and it can get kinda gross but honestly I couldnt give a shit less. I love him all the same partly because he didnt let his skin disease overshadow his amazing personality. I barely noticed when I met him and I barely notice now. Please dont let your condition overshadow who you are. Living like a recluse is not worth the bad reactions that people might have to your disease. Theyre grossed out? Fuck them. They dont know you. You aint got time for that. Move on to some people who are not some superficial assholes and who wont let some dumb condition affect whether or not they want to hang out with you. ,howtonotgiveafuck,cqxfg6y,3,t5_2tna8

4023764,0,t1_creqq05,gt Im actually pretty muscular but I once found out people were making fun of my on campus for overcompensating so Im trying to get more of a lean muscle thing going instead of bulk.I understand your sentiment but I think this is helping to contribute to the problem. By changing your body composition as a response to what others are saying youre reinforcing in your own mind that their opinions matter. Like you said in some sense there is an element of fake it till you make it. But faking it is more than just putting on a brave face. Its familiarizing yourself with the state of mind needed to make it actually happen.If youre already muscular thats fucking awesome. You know what I think when I see a short muscular guy at my gym? Fuck. That guys huge and Ill bet hes strong as fuck. I dont fucking care if hes   or . Getting jacked takes work and I have instant respect for that. I imagine many other people feel the same way. So step  is reminding yourself of that whenever you start feeling self conscious about your height. But dont just state it as a meaningless mantra. Recreate the feeling of being confident even if its somewhat contrived. Itll take some practice but more on that in a second.Step  is to keep getting fucking huge and get strong as fuck. And whenever you worry about people jumping to conclusions about overcompensation just remind yourself that  they probably arent really even thinking about you  the only kinds of people who immediately criticize something awesome like gainz are jealous people  you dont really even need the approval of some fuckin betas who can only deal with their own insecurities by taking it out on someone else and  all that matters is whats true. If someone else wants to be wrong let them be wrong. Aint your problem.Step  and this one is important take up a daily meditation routine. Seriously. Just make the time for it. It doesnt have to be long. Studies show that as little as  minutes a day can make a noticeable difference. I know you can find a  minute span out of an entire  hour day.In my experience meditation is a great place to create some headspace and recreate some of the mental states that I need to work on developing. In your case once your head is clear just focus on the feeling of being confident. Dont try and convince yourself that you first need a reason to be confident. Just let your mind be calm and work on feeling confident. After spending a couple minutes feeling confident imagine a situation where youd normally feel unconfident but instead replace your unconfident self with the confidence youre currently feeling in the meditation. Now what youve done is trained your brain to respond to a new situation with confidence so next time you find yourself in a situation thatd leave you second guessing yourself youll approach it with a little more confidence than you normally would have.Do this every day. You might see some small instant results. Or it might take a week or so before you see anything noticeable. But in my experience I usually notice something within a few days even if its small.Just keep pushing forward boss. Theres a courageous stoic inside every one of us.

4735730,0,t3_3fnfxp,Heres a great little exercise anyone can do to eliminate old habits and create new empowering ones. Youll need a piece of paper and a penpencilhandmade quail pen.  On the left side of the paper write down all of the habits and routines you want to get rid of whether they be mental physical what have you.  On the right side of the paper for each habitroutine you wrote down on the left side write down a new habitroutine that you want to replace it with. Once finished rip off the left side of the paper old habitroutines ball it up and throw it in the trash. Completely disconnect yourself from them.  Every day spend  minutes reading over your new habitsroutines. This works well for a number of reasons Writing things down allows you to get specific and detailed about your new habitsroutines as opposed to depending on your brain to remember every detail about them. It allows you to get your ideas out of your brain and onto something visible. When you can see something it has much more impact then when you just think about it. Writing  clarity. By ripping off the left side of the paper your old habitsroutines it serves as a vivid imagery of disconnection to those things. And once you identify the new habitsroutines you want to replace them with you want to focus  on the those new ones so keeping the old ones attached doesnt do you any good. Chuck them!Reading your new habitsroutines every day will begin the process of your subconscious helping you to put them to work as when you do that youre conditioning your mind to understand that those new habitsroutines are what you want so your mind will begin putting them into practice. I do Mental Sports Coaching with professional athletes and when we work on habitsroutines this is what I do. Its never not worked yet!,howtonotgiveafuck,ctrhcn9,3,t5_2tna8

Better than anything I could even fathom of adding to the discussion.You also have understood what I was getting at Dont let others sway you away from what you believe without a valid reason meaning wellgrounded or justifiable logically correct.A lot of what I said requires serious introspection are my beliefs flawed? Am I unhealthy? Am I dependent on others? I myself fell foul of all of the above once upon a time.It sounds strange but on your own there is no way to tell objectively that youve viewed yourself objectively. We are all subjective creatures. But trying to take a rational detached perspective of oneself is immensely beneficial particularly for those among us who feel emotions very deeply. Once you have done so provided youve done it properly youll have the right perspective to remain true to yourself.It might take several attempts but you owe it to yourself to do it. Even if you dont care about yourself your body and your personality are what you use to interact with others so even if you dont care about YOU you must take care of YOUrself to reach the people you care about or could potentially care about.It is hard but everyone can do it some however need to work harder than others but thats okay. Imagine a world where you act with as much ease as you do in your imagination. Thats what Im advocating. I havent reached that yet  I imagine that few have but it is most definitely a dream worth striving for.Its one of the sad facts of being human that we all deal with inhibitions that arise from our personality and external reactions to our personalities but all of us can conquer those inhibitions!,howtonotgiveafuck,d1ufzz2,1,t5_2tna8

7853638,0,t3_4mvria,You probably think too much and because you are not busy at the moment you are in overdrive. If you consume anything with caffeine regularly you may want to stop at least while you are not busy or greatly reduce consumption. It takes about  weeks of withdrawal though and isnt very fun headaches and some depression. You can replace caffeine with B vitamins and they will give you some energy. Caffeine is anxious energy at least for me. Light exercise can also give you a boost of energy too. Find stuff you enjoy even just  minutes can make a difference I like biking.If this isnt the case for you you can try journaling. Keep track of what you eat. Food can have drastic effects on mood and energy and its so easily overlooked. Eating well can make a huge difference on mood. You dont have to force yourself to eat healthy crap you dont enjoy. Eat yummy healthy food. Check out the abs diet for ideas its a book probably on amazon. Try learning to cook too if you dont already being able to prepare epic meals is incredibly satisfying. You only need to master about  good meals to start it doesnt take too long. You can track other things too just figure out stuff that is affecting you its part of being more mindful of your surroundings. When you are young its amazing how much we overlook but as you get older you will start to notice things that affect you and it gets easier to deal with. Of course if you dont keep track you might never notice those things. Im sure there are dozens of other things you can try too this is just a few ideas that have worked for me for dealing with generalized anxiety. The hardest part of all is being consistent I still struggle with it. If someone has the strategy for that please tell me.,howtonotgiveafuck,d3ytibi,3,t5_2tna8

She looked up and glared at me Im no mindreader but you could tell she thought I was laughing at her. She said WTF are you laughing at b!tch all mad style so I just threw up both hands and went on about my business.  minutes later Im in line and hear someone come up behind me embroiled in some cell call it sounded like she was trying to get someone to come up to the store because some lady was waiting outside to beat her up. Im nosy so I turned around to get a peep at her and she looked kind of familiar...then I saw the kid and realized and it was the mad mama who called me a bish. I had forgotten the whole incident that quick! including dismissing her face from my mind. I told her as much but she was convinced that not only did I remember but I was so insulted that I would want to fight her over it. ??? LOL people are crazy.

So if your idea of happiness essentially thats what this sub is about revolves around changing your wants instead of acting on them then discipline is the way to go. However some people feel like doing the opposite instead of simplifying their wants the overall goal of selfdiscipline some people will ignore whatever they think is a barrier to their pursuits as more often than not those barriers are insubstantial.

11159212,0,t3_5z9fo1,Hey youre not stupid. Are you going to therapy? Self harm is very serious and if youre still doing it please reach out for help. About showing your scars I think it goes beyond not giving a fuck. Would you treat someone badly because they have scars? I imagine not and neither should other people. Your scars are proof that you survived such a tough time youre very brave youre here youre alive. Check out the oils people suggested or getting tattoos could look really cool but dont hide ok? There is nothing shameful about you.,howtonotgiveafuck,dewvuvv,1,t5_2tna8
11226302,0,t3_5zqun8,Read Codependent No More by Melody Beattie.You can either get peace from taking care of yourself... or be miserable wondering about what people think of you.I ead this book  years ago.  I am a completely different person.I used to always worry about what other people thought and spent my time making other people happy.  Having peace in my relationships was extremely important to me.Now I dont give a FUCK if people like me or approve... because MY OPINION COMES FIRST.  What I think of me is what I focus on every day.When I genuinely compliment people my coworkers call me a fake flirt.When I go above and beyond in helping my boss my coworkers call me a kissass.The lies and jealousy will NEVER end.  But how I react to it HAS.Read the book.  Set up healthy boundaries.  DETATCH from toxic negative jealous people.And most importantly???Take care of YOURSELF.Because ultimately..... only YOU can.,howtonotgiveafuck,df4hjk0,2,t5_2tna8
