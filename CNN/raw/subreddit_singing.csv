136054,0,t3_1vhxgw,One of the important things about singing runs is not to think about the pitch but rather the tempo. This is especially true for blues or gospelbased runs which are incredibly popular in pop music. Know what note to start on where you want to stop and then FOCUS on the beat. If you have a good ear and listen to a lot of that sort of style then your voice will naturally know where to go.For the technique itself Ive said this to some other people but focus on singing in the mask. Part of having sliding runs is that youre not really controlling your voice optimally and your voice isnt centered on the pitches that you want to hit this causes the slidingoff of notes that youre talking about. But if you do sing in the mask you have a greater agility and precision.,singing,cetxd60,1,t5_2rlcx

A lot of voice pathologists use the fry during therapy because its a really good tool for getting beginning singers or singers who have recently had nodes to start the folds coming together evenly. I begin a lot of exercises with a fry my favorite is starting with a fry then doing a siren up and down an octave. A fry is also a good way to check if your chords are swollen. If you cant easily fry your chords are probably swollen or in bad shape. ,singing,cez10th,8,t5_2rlcx

By all means shop around and find the best fit.Your voice continues to mature and evolve well into your s.  I used to be a low baritone and have slowly turned into a high baritone.  You shouldnt have to do nearly as much work to maintain the bottom range as the top range so if youre losing notes on the bottom thats probably due to a genuine change in voice.  You can always work on your lower range but theres not as much that can be done down there your vocal cords have a pretty much fixed lowest note.As long as youre not straining or causing any pain you wont hurt yourself.,singing,cfk5w9h,5,t5_2rlcx

1025024,0,t3_25ttmq,Two points of clarification one not so important and one very important.Not so important all breathing involves your diaphragm. Use your diaphragm is a ridiculous and nebulous term which gets thrown around a lot without any meaning behind it. VERY IMPORTANT Your whole conception of singing needs to be recalibrated for two key reasons. First singing is far too granular to be boiled down to a binary of singing correctly versus incorrectly. There are countably infinite gradations of how one sings. Second singing requires engaged muscle memory and coordination. No one learns to sing from a check list of tips. Yes technically we could generate a huge list of things your body should physiologically be doing when you sing but having that list will not help you to sing well. Ultimately that information is of very little value because no one can say magic words to you to make you sing properly  you have to figure out how proper singing feels to you.If youre getting hoarse after singing then yes you are doing some stuff incorrectly. I cant identify all of what that is from a paragraph of text but I can tell you this when you sing your body is necessarily going to take on a certain amount of stress. If you sing well you will move that stress away from muscles which cant take it your throat your jaw your tongue onto muscles which can everything in your torso which involves itself in breath support. The result of this is twofold  you will sound good and  you wont get hoarse or lose your voice. This leads us to the great question how does one learn to use the body to singing properly? While it may be frustrating the only methodology is to study voice with a teacher and do all of your exercises and repertoire work with your teachers instruction and guidance in mind and to practice regularly and diligently. A really good singer usually has at least ten years of rigorous training under his belt. And even then most really good singers still get some stuff wrong.So whats the takeaway for you? The following Singing is really hard and highly granular and requires lots of handson instruction and diligent practice Singing is more an athletic feat than anything else and as such requires you to come to understand your body and develop your own particular muscle memory There is no substitute for private lessons If you ever feel any strain youre doing something very wrong  on that note if youre getting hoarse youre doing something horribly wrong Your only action items are to find a teacher and to not do anything which causes strain in your throat or tongue or jaw.,singing,chksvhh,4,t5_2rlcx

1141640,0,t3_276oqg,Hey bud! Disclaimer I am not a doctor nor even a singing teacher but I have been singing almost my entire life more than half with skilled teachers. My first thought Theres nothing broken in your voice. You havent developed nodes or anything like that. You have quite a nice instrument there and your pitch is quite good so congratulations! If I were a teacher Id be excited to take you on to see what we could do with a voice like yours.Youre  eh? I havent given this talk to anyone in my life yet but I suppose now is a good time to start. You are right on schedule. Welcome to beginning of a very frustrating decade for male singers. As you may have heard or known youre likely hitting or already in the midst of puberty. If for whatever reason you are unaware of what that is or means please respond and ask me or go ahead and google it yourself. What is very very likely happening and what is very audible between Sally Gardens and Think of Me is that your vocal range is naturally shifting downwards. You have a much deeper sound in Think of me. This is a normal part of growing up youre likely also getting taller realizing you have newbile interests and your speaking voice is probably getting lower. Thats because your body is changing. Your vocal folds are getting longer and thicker your chest is likely expanding and the size of your throat and the resonators in your head are changing size as well. All of these things happening near simultaneously makes your voice sound lower and also will likely require changes to your vocal technique. To share my experience When I was in th grade about  years old I tried out for Oliver from Oliver. If you dont know Oliver is a boy soprano part which is very high like Sally Gardens. I got a callback but in the  days between the audition and the callback my voice changed so much that I got the part of Mr. Bumble who is one of the lowest voices in the show. Sometimes the change happens quick sometimes slower but it always happens. If youre lucky have practice well you may even be able to hold on to a lot of your high notes.I want to restate though that you have a lovely voice! If you dont already have a teacher and want to become a better singer you should definitely go find one because you have quite a talent that just needs to be guided some. Good luck with the next  years Wanttobeacop.,singing,chy1ndr,2,t5_2rlcx

And what I need is the building blocks. Which Ive never had. I want to know how to be an instrument. Thats whats starting to fail me now as I mature past my adolescent voice. I think Ill only get that from classical study. Its hard to turn down a special opportunity but I know what I need and right now its the basics  no one ever taught me that because I was one of those kids who was a good singer from an early enough age that I got cocky and skipped right on ahead past the fundamentals of technique.

Neither example sounds bad or particularly forced to me.What I would ask yourself is if youre forcing your tongue and larynx down to make that more baritoney resonance in the first example or if youre pulling chestpulling your larynx up in the second example. And then go with whichever technique has the most relaxed feel for you. For me I can sing in a really belty way and it is really loud and powerful or I can mix more and its sounds more tenory but the first requires a lot of tension and pressure that is uncomfortable so I sing with more mix. You should evaluate in the same way.,singing,cjzrxuc,1,t5_2rlcx

1873670,0,t3_2g2b1p,Honestly while it probably wont help much right away the best advice Id generally give is to just do it a lot. The more you sing solo the more you realize its no big deal and you learn to convert nervous energy into positive energy. So I guess if you can practice at home like in front of your mirror or something I think that would help. And then theres all kinds of silly things they teach you in public speaking classes like imagining everyone naked  I dont know if that will help you but I guess its worth a shot? Also pick something else to focus on instead of the people in the room and try to come back to that thing when you start feeling nervous. Looking at something up on the wall can be a good one or in sight reading just focus on the music. Finally remember that most people arent assholes waiting for you to fail  theyre hoping you succeed too. Theyre not going to freak out about one wrong note or funky rhythm. In fact chances are most people wont even catch your mistakes. Ive sung pieces that I thought I completely sucked and messed up tons of stuff but when asking people in the audience they said they dont remember anything wrong. People arent that critical most of the time. Anyway I dont know if any of that is helpful but good luck!,singing,ckeyy82,2,t5_2rlcx

1899101,0,t3_2g9jrf,I too am impressed by youre determination to sing better on your own. I havent been singing very long  years  with a coach but the best advice I can offer is to think about your placement as a whole. When I was singing on my own I held a lot of tension. Just about everything in your mouth and throat can effect the texture of your voice in some way or another. I dont have any tricks but like uMoldyBanana said play around and see how different things change your voice. For instance keeping your tongue relaxed will keep your palate open. Its hard to offer advice without being able to see you sing but keeping your tongue out of the way pharynx open and larynx low in the throat will lead to finding a natural open tone and some vibrato on sustained notes. Also with all that deep breathing from the diaphragm make sure youre really supporting the notes with fast air. It helps me to visualize a column of air and let the notes resonate lower in the chest cavity.,singing,cki14ua,3,t5_2rlcx

Second of all not all women get pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Third of all its a myth that women are more hormonal  people of all genders have hormone shifts as a general physiological process. Im really uncomfortable with making the generalization that being a woman itself makes you more susceptible to vocal damage. And even if thats the case thats not what OP was asking about  theyre asking about things people do to presumably avoid that can increase risk of vocal damage. Seeing as gender is a state of being and not something you can magically snap your fingers to change I think its completely inappropriate to bring it up in this context and Im pretty saddened that posters I otherwise respect are stooping to that level. ,singing,cki7tbc,4,t5_2rlcx

And of course the best way to get more power is to be singing daily and singing well. As someone whos way out of that habit and dealing with a lessfun voice to work with Id cant emphasize that enough Heres one exercise explained in scale degree . Or solfege Do Me So Do Do Do Do those were all high So Me Do. Try it on buh when youre lower and switch to nay as you go higher in your range so you can have more resonancebrattyfocused sound. If this is a bit hard just stick with one high do at first. The range of this warmup and as you can do it faster encourages you not to just switch into a head voice. That said if your having trouble even keep it real simple with  if that makes sense just the chord triad.This is a bit less obvious but Id also recommend doing any exercise where you start high and go low and try to see how long you can keep the softer light head voice in place. Just that awareness of where your break is and how to work around it will help  same way knowing your cars dimensions helps you park.Do you have any basic piano skills so you can accompany yourself? Not required but Id recommend you jump online or buy a scale book or pay a teacher just for that. Even if you only learn the three notes in each chord itll let you help yourself stay on pitch.P.S. Make sure youre doing actual easy warmups before you do harder vocal exercises. Even just going up and down on three notes a few times before moving up the piano is good i.e. doremereCDED and repeat like three times in a row on different big vowels. Those simple ones can be good for focusing on overall tone and breath support.Good luck!,singing,ckncfxm,2,t5_2rlcx

2027066,0,t3_2hws6i,I actually quit in the middle of a musical some threeandahalf years ago.  I think the biggest things are the changes your body goes through after quitting that indirectly affect your singing.  Lung capacity for instance.  Your body got more efficient and filtering oxygen while you smoked so it got used to smaller breaths.  That will change soon.  Your range will likely extend upwards a little bit and I found my throat got tired much slower.  YMMV.,singing,ckxhf4j,1,t5_2rlcx

2067714,0,t1_cl1qw3w,Yeah. Although so much of singing is about coordinating different processes that its hard to separate them out. For example soft palate movement is highly linked to tongue tension so you cant really have an ideal soft palate space until you address latent tongue tension issues. Which might then be a matter of addressing the positioning of the larynx since a high larynx can lead to tongue tension. And so on and so forth. But yes I think there is some value in understanding physically what is happening with the voice. Its very much a balance because a lot of the physical elements cant really be controlled directly or are so heavily linked to other things that its not worth expending mental energy thinking about them. This is also a major point about learning style  some people definitely respond better to physical descriptions and ways of understanding while others focus more on processing the sounds aurally and others focus on metaphors and visualizations and probably other ways I cant even think of. Its often a matter of balancing those different ways to think about singing and thats a balance that varies from person to person. As for your edit this does happen sometimes in lessons  Ive had teachers demonstrate various vocal faults in order to help me address them. In fact in my vocal pedagogy class we do exercises where students pretend to have a specific vocal fault and another student pretends to be their teacher and identifyaddress that issue. Its definitely an interesting process. On the other hand some of these faults can be pretty deceptive. First of all everyones voice reacts slightly differently to different issues so hearing what happens with one voice might not be that informative when working with another voice. Also because so many of the vocal issues are heavily linked to each other its hard to isolate one issue. When someone is demonstrating say insufficient breath support they will probably also have related faults like an excessively aspirated onset unclearweak vowels poor breathing technique not enough vibrato etc. So you cant really just say this is the difference made by breath support because its also a difference made by better attention to onset more deliberate vowel choices better breathing appropriate cord closure to facilitate vibrato etc. Theyre all related but not necessarily the exact same thing. ,singing,cl2nhg6,1,t5_2rlcx

Especially since its hard to imagine someone with a really nice voice as a teen never having a desire to join a choir of any kindBut I would say all of that is kind of different because it isnt individual attention and I do think that is a difference.  I would say a trained singer is someone who has had individual training and coaching for their specific vocal instrument.I dont think that someone who remembers stand up straight and sing from the diaphragm from grade  choir class counts as a trained singer or who was chorus in an amateur local production of Hair suddenly counts as a trained singer yknow?,singing,clheypb,2,t5_2rlcx

2403578,0,t3_2mwbzz,Hey! First off take a deep breath. Grad school auditions are such a stressful process. Im a year behind you as Im just now starting to think about applying for the  year and looking at audition requirements already gives me minor panic attacks. But I agree with ughoti  its not the end of the world if your school choices dont pan out this year gives you another year of lessons and repertoire prep not to mention maybe an opera residency or summer program although youre still well within ranges to send more apps out now before December deadlines. So general thoughts. Try to schedule an appointment even a phone or Skype appointment with any previous teacher with university connections your current teacher undergrad prof even university choir directors. Ask them to make a list of programs that they think would fit your needsgoals especially institutions where they know a faculty member current grad student or recent graduate. Of course you dont have to use connections but sometimes it helps to narrow your choices down and have a contact point to learn more about the program. Then try to find a specific contact point especially a current or recent grad student. Get an email address or if youre in the area schedule a live tour. To me this is the best way of finding out specifics about the program so you can get a feel for whether its right for you and what their general expectations are for auditions. All in all you just have to cast a wide net. Know that being rejected doesnt mean youre a bad singer or even that you werent right for their program  most grad schools intentionally admit a small number of students so they can get more individualized training and more access to resources not necessarily because there werent more good applicants. Anyway this was super long but I totally feel for you and dread the process when I do it next year. Best of luck! ,singing,cm8shiv,1,t5_2rlcx

And with screaming its a good idea to learn to sing first but I learned to scream first and it really messed my voice up for a while. I didnt know what use your diaphragm meant until months later when I could finally produce a scream that I was proud of. Then I matured and by the end of Highschool I had been in a couple of bands and played dozens of shows I also started learning how to sing. My singing was really really terrible in the beginning but I found out that i had the genes for singing. I began singing better and better I was able to sing extremely high notes my voice is on the lower side.

2746295,0,t1_cng804n,You have a nice tone! Try working on your phrasing and taking breaths at the end of sentences instead of mid sentence. Breath support is also important when youre holding longer notes so they dont quiver. Your voice sounds breathy and light and it may just be your style but you could try singing out louder? Also the music is slightly loud and is overpowering your voice. You could try stepping closer to the mic or just toning down the music a little?

2748110,0,t1_cnfz9cw,Its literally impossible to sing without using your diaphragm so I cant really see how thats helpful advice. And actually moving less air is incorrect as that basically means you arent supporting the sound. The amount of air should remain roughly the same when singing softly if not more because at the lower pressure youre losing a bit more air through the vocal folds but the air speed and pressure decreases leading to a weaker adduction as uTotoCotogni points out. ,singing,cngg5sh,0,t5_2rlcx

It sounds like its not. Pinch your nose while you sing a vowel. Does that change the sound? Have you been sending air through it? Ideally you should not. Breath in as if youre about to sneeze. Do you feel the back of your mouth just open up to a cavern? That is what you want to feel when you sing.Small thing stop pronouncing the t in but.

All the greatest operatic tenors did this night after night for    years. What theyre doing is not exactly belting. Thats a term Id really only use for women who do what these tenors are doingthat is learn what the cover mechanism is dropping the jaw and lowering the larynx and inserting the chest voice into the dark timbre while simultaneously engaging the socalled breath support in order to keep the blast of air away from the chords. It is a kind of coordination that relies on balanced and coordination registration the falsetto action pullingbracing against the maximum work being done by the chest voice.

Your tessitura is much more important.Im not sure how to put this but your voice has a kind of a whine to it. Im guessing that you dont have a raised soft palate which is causing you to lose air out of your nose. The exercise I normally use to change this habit is to breath in like youre breathing through a straw. Do you feel like the back of your mouth just expands? Like theres all this new open space? Try singing with that space. You sound nice on this but I really dont think that musical comedians are the way to go for learning how to sing. Listen to Bo as much as you want hes hilarious. But next time maybe something a little more serious? You can hide serious technique issues by being funny so its kind of counterproductive.I think youre also being hard on yourself.

Forget your mouth for a while and focus on your core. Try expanding your lower ribcage while you sing. You need to use your core when you exhale almost as if you were still inhaling while singing. By doing so you will notice your throat will be free. However you better begin to work on the middle of your range before trying difficult notes. ,singing,cotbl2v,5,t5_2rlcx

3414057,0,t3_2zafiq,Ugh I have a thread in the works that goes through the major facts and myths of diet when it comes to singing but I havent finished yet dang schoolwork. I can say a few things though.It seems like the vast majority of science claims that the dairy gt increased mucus is a myth and there havent been any good studies that show any increase in mucus production although there are a ton of other factors and some people could still be affected. By contrast the two biggest actual factors that are important for singing are hydration and acid reflux on opposite sides of the spectrum. Dehydration does greatly affect singing primarily because it affects the viscosity of the mucus membranes that surround and protect your vocal folds  overly thick mucus can reduce its ability to protect and lubricate the folds leading to excessive friction and therefore irritation. Acid reflux can cause big issues if the acid actually reaches the larynx but even irritation in the trachea can have an effect on the vocal folds. Basically its just important to control gastrointestinal issues because once it gets to true reflux stage youre kind of in a bad place. Beyond that its entirely personal preference. Some people do have issues with other various foods for whatever reason so it sometimes just takes experimenting to figure out if you react poorly to certain foods. Also caffeine and alcohol deserve mention for their actual mental alteration properties. It really depends on the context and how you react to them but they can be problematic in performance. I know personally too much caffeine makes it difficult for me to control tempos accurately because I get a little bit jittery. Alcohol can also create issues for performance. I would personally recommend staying away from both during a major performance but it is really a matter of preference.,singing,cphfe4l,9,t5_2rlcx

3683909,0,t3_32k38r,I just sit down and play chords and hum a melody over it until something comes together. Then Ill make a lead sheet do a couple pages of freewriting on the associations I have with the song and make a sketch of the lyrics structure accented syllables per line and rhyme scheme and the first few verses are pretty bad and hard to think of but after that it will stay in the back of my mind and verses will just pop into my head over the course of the next few days. As far as background thats helpful for this I have a solid theory background have read up on lyric structure a bit I can sight sing and I can transcribe melodies I hear and I have a background in jazz and blues on guitar and piano. The main thing is that songwriting really benefits from regular practice just like on an instrument or with your voice. If you sit down and work on songwriting for  minutes per day at first you will feel like you cant think of anything but eventually you will start to accumulate musical and lyrical ideas and youll have something nice in about two weeks. The shorter versionJust figure out the concept of a key. You take the notes that are in a key and use them to build chords and then your melody draws from the notes in that key to harmonize with your chords. Lets think of G major for a second because thats what your chord progression is in. This contains the notes G A B C D E F G. The most popular chords are built on the st nd th th and th notes in that scale by stacking thirds which means going through that G major scale in skips. So lets pick the super popular progression I vi IV V. Your I chord contains G skip A B skip C and D. Your vi chord contains E G and B. Your IV chord contains C E and G. Your V chord contains D F A. So play your chord progression for four beats each. And start singing through the G major scale so that you sing one of the notes that is in the current chord whenever you are on the first beat or third beat of the measure. Start with just singing quarter notes so one note per strum. Your second and fourth beats dont need to harmonize and are used to smooth the connection between the notes on the first and third beats. This is a massive oversimplification but hopefully it helps. Just find some easy  page theory book you can crank through in a day or two its not even nearly going to tell you the whole picture but its totally adequate for pop purposes. Then check out writing better lyrics by Pat Pattison and whatever else looks good. Songwriting by Stephen Citron is a decent quick overview. Also building your comfort on an instrument and doing tons of improvisation will help. Good luck!,singing,cqc6upp,3,t5_2rlcx

4356887,0,t3_3awfz5,Well it is complicated so there could be lots of things that can help you. First of all I would like to address some of the things you do mention though. Yes diaphragmatic breathing or more physiologically correctly supported breathing  all breathing is technically diaphragmatic and resonance are some of the main ways you can control the loudness of your voice. Registration balance is also a big one. But those things arent exactly simple onoff switches that you can easily perfect in a short period of time.Ill also throw out the fact that in terms of being understood diction is very important. And actually good diction can improve overall resonance by creating clearer vowel spaces that allow for a more advantageous resonating pattern for the vowel. But mostly diction is highly important for being understood by people whatever the dynamic level. With that in mind the reason you wont find someone detailing out a stepbystep approach is because its just not that simple. I could even tell you exactly what I do Im a pretty analytical singer myself but its unlikely that it would be very helpful for you because my voice is not your voice and my feelings are not your feelings. This is why it is so important to work with a qualified teacher when addressing complex issues of technique. A teacher doesnt have to lay it out stepbystep but instead can react to what you are doing in your lessons and try new things to get you closer to the goal. A teacher can make sure what youre doing is within the realm of health and not something dangerous even if youre experimenting with delicate muscle groups in your voice. ,singing,csgr60n,2,t5_2rlcx

4382948,0,t1_csjn4xz,gt You seem to be assuming that because it is harmful it has to be a wrong technique.Thats my opinion but thats not the point I was trying to make. Im saying he could have achieved his goals utilizing healthy technique. That is more of semantic argument for me as I personally consider singing unhealthy to be the same as singing incorrectly but thats neither here nor there.gt Chester Bennington was not trying to sound like M. Shadows he wasnt trying to keep an open throat but failed to do it.Absolutely agree. He didnt know how and probably didnt care at the time. Hell he probably didnt even know there was another way to achieve the same tone.gt Yet he cant sing Hybrid Theory songs the same way they were recorded. Because you cant achieve that kind of drive in a healthy way.One of the biggest pieces of wisdom I received from my musical theater teachermentor who was also a huge metalhead If you can create a sound with poor technique you can create the same sound with proper technique.Chester can still go back to that sound I just assume he hasnt relearned how to achieve the same tone with proper technique or his musical endeavors simply dont require him to or he doesnt care. Could be a multitude of reasons but my main point is his Hybrid Theory tone is perfectly achievable using the pitch screaming method I am talking about. In contrast to Shadows the only real difference in emulating their two distinct sounds is your resonance and saturation of distortionovertone.,singing,csjp0d9,1,t5_2rlcx
4392309,0,t3_3bbm7n,In general Im always a tiny bit wary of people who use fancysounding techniques for teaching just because it sounds more like marketing than actual skills. However I think the terminology used to describe a teacher is less important than the actual product  are they a good teacher and are their students good singers? Ultimately I think thats a much more helpful way of evaluating a teacher than any sort of specific teaching technique. No label can guarantee a good teacher or a bad one for that matter. There are people with advanced degrees in vocal performance who are not good teachers and there are people with very little written record who are great teachers. You should always use your own judgement and the judgement of musicians you respect as the final arbiter when choosing a teacher. And also its possible that a good teacher is a bad fit for you. If your learning style and goals dont mesh with a teacher they can be the most highly qualified skillful teacher and they wont necessarily help you improve your singing. ,singing,cskqyxb,3,t5_2rlcx

Ive been with the same teacher a couple of years now and would never switch.So I dunno...Im not a professional singer and Ive no idea whether this style of singing is more lies to lead to nodules etc but my teacher is taught by one of the guys who trains Broadway singers and they generally seem to be ok ?

4909755,0,t3_3i3xag,So first of all by definition you cannot sing a chord unless youre overtone singing so I can say with almost absolute certainty that you are not singing E minor. Secondly yes if youre trying to sing an existing song unless its a genre that accepts improvisation you have to sing the actual notes to the song  you cant just sing other notes and call it the same song. Thats kind of like saying youre reading a certain book but someone changed all the words. Then its a different book by definition. So the problem here is that Im not sure whether you have a technical issue e.g. inability to match pitch accurately an aural issue e.g. inability to hear the correct melody or a theoryreading issue e.g. not reading accurately leading to singing lots of wrong notes. I think you really need to figure that out before you try to get any deeper.,singing,cudetli,1,t5_2rlcx
4933981,0,t1_cufsd9q,Well singing lightly doesnt necessarily mean there is less damage present  things like incomplete adduction of the vocal folds can still be unhealthy. But more importantly if you put your mind to it you can definitely improve. As far as flexibility I honestly dont know. Im definitely not an expert on older voices so I dont know a lot of specifics. But I think just generally keeping your voice in shape can stave off most of the effects of age. ,singing,cugguc3,1,t5_2rlcx
4964406,0,t3_3ivr4l,Well yes lessons are tiring. Without knowing exactly what youre experiencing its hard to say if youre just feeling new muscles and new sensations due to a good vocal workout or if youre doing something that raises concern. As others mention its extremely important to communicate about this with your teacher. They are only human and everyones stamina is different so they cant know what is too much singing for a lesson. You do not need to be singing nonstop for a lesson especially as a beginner. But if your teacher doesnt know that youre getting tired they wont necessarily know when to stop. Ultimately if you have a good teacher theyll notice before you do anything permanently wrong. Technique doesnt get fixed overnight so there might be technical reasons youre experiencing more fatigueaching than usual but that doesnt mean it cant be addressed as you continue to practice. ,singing,cukavun,2,t5_2rlcx

5084859,0,t3_3knm54,Who says baritones cannot sing high? . I am a bassbaritone but i got once placed into tenor in a choir because of my tone and my range. I used to have a very rough and throaty voice and through time and proper practice it became well placed and resonant. Your voice is very good for a  year old almost makes me doubt it actually you singing . Now onto the topic at hand Diaphragmatic support serves a general purpose of releasing strain in the neck area by using air pressure. it also is used together with good cord closure to produce a sound with more core especially on high notes. So it is always important to have a good amount of diaphragmatic support it is the engine that drives your voice. That being said support by itself will not let you feel the ease in the upper range. Sure some people can just sing high Cs all day with support mucles but normally most people cant. By relying on support you inevitably fall into the mentality of trying harder for each higher note. Where ideally each note should be singable with roughly the same amount of effort and diaphragmatic support. So the more ideal way to work on developing your upper range is to start prepping the voice for blending with head resonance. see the singing wiki for definitions etc.I would recommend singing your songs on a hum or a ng sound as in the word sing or rung. Focus on letting the sound travel into a more nasal placement rather than going out of the mouth. Another exercise would be to use liprolls to get the voice used to the appropriate amount of air flow .

5108530,0,t3_3kvqs1,This placement varies through your range depending also on the level of adduction you are using and the color you want. Keeping a high placement all the time is perhaps even worse to vocal health since it can enforce more air as you describe and air when going loud is to use your own words how you kill your vocal folds but for real.Can you control this? Try playing with this idea when going soft allow the placement to rise when going loudstrong lower it. See if it feels good and if it improves your overall condition.,singing,cv1rpj2,1,t5_2rlcx

Loud no problem but never pain.Darkening a lot is not a good idea applying dark tone is not trivial and can lead to injury much more easily than using a bright sound if done wrong.

5139904,0,t3_3kvrj5,Welp it depends on what kind of tenor you are.  Im a tenor leggiero so my notes start getting difficult when I cross over to the D different formant register etc etc so my F to C are rather fluid and easy.  A friend of mine is a spintoish lyric and he starts having a difficult time after Bb and doesnt even touch C.One thing that is difficult for tenors to unlock or realize is that all of that chest color doesnt go above an A and for some tenors like me can barely bring that vocal mechanism to the Ab and even then it is exhausting.  You have to flip to unlock those notes and then add color to the head voice through different techniques.  It all depends on the particular voice.  I flip more often than not at the G instead of covering it in a mix like most tenors but because of my leggero voice thats what my voice naturally does to blend through.  It sounds like to me your passagio has not been developed enough as far as covering correctly and being able to flip freely into your head mechanism.  An A should not feel like work unless for some reason the piece calls for that much chest being heaved up there.  Once you get to your A you should be completely into your head voice and working with a much smaller formant than what you are used to feeling when you are in chest or mixing in your passagio.I hope my ramblings have helped if you ever have any questions please feel free to message me.  I will however say the same thing I say to everyone.  The best thing to do is work with a teacher.,singing,cv5ju70,1,t5_2rlcx
5140264,0,t3_3le9u1,Its great that you are beginning your journey of singing lessons . Make sure you enjoy the lessons and singing to the fullest. Now other than the obvious question to ask there really isnt much else. My personal recommendation if she does not mention is to bring these things. A notebook to take down the main points the teacher is saying and  something to record the whole lesson with.   Side note here the qualification of your singing teacher is great. But i must state that if she teaches in a pure classical method. This method is very unsuitable for modern genres such as poprock that you are expressing interest in. But if she knows how to teach with contemporary method mixed in then it would be the most ideal. Classical technique in my opinion gives a very good foundation for support and placement etc. But just giving you the heads up!Good luck and enjoy your lesson EDIT Make sure to double check with your teacher to ensure that she is fine with recording the lesson ,singing,cv5led2,1,t5_2rlcx

5388337,0,t3_3oszkk,Self taught and expertly so singer here! I have two major suggestions for you . SING as often as you can! Whether its between classes while youre in the bathroom at the grocery store or in your car my favorite! just keep singing. After all practice really does make you better. . When youre singing along with a song turn the music down a little bit so you can be sure to hear yourself. The problem many amateur singers have is that they turn the music up too loud when theyre singing along. Then think theyre hearing themselves but in reality they are hearing mostly the perfected pitches of the song theyre listening to and confusing it with their own. The reason I say this is because the only way to get better is to realize where falling short and how to get better at these problem areas. Keep singing! It can be the most profound outlet of emotions a person can experience  ,singing,cw0f5l2,1,t5_2rlcx

5448148,0,t3_3pocki,Hey you have a beautiful voice and a nice range. Something to think about is that you probably perceive those notes as sounding more childish than we perceive them. In my opinion you dont sound like a child and in fact you sound pretty close in timbre to the original recordings.What I sense that would help your sound is to get rid of some of your tension especially in the second song. Try to sing the high parts while rocking your jaw gently from side to side and keep your mouth open you can forego the words and just do the vowels.When youre singing all of these parts try to keep your soft palate raised in order not to have unnecessary tension and for the notes to have better resonance. If you have trouble finding that muscle movement just yawn. After you create that space within your mouth you can just yawn.More specifically to your question a way to avoid sounding childish would be to try to belt those notes using your mixed voice. Right now youre using falsetto people disagree on this but in the places I was taught this is falsetto. Your mixed voice is a combination of falsetto and chest voice. That would allow you to get a more manly sound because youd add some of your chest timbre to the notes. Personally I like your sound as is. Singing this in mixed would be way more challenging and it would change the sound drastically making it louder and harsher. For these particular songs the sound you have now works really well although you might want to practice belting if you want to use that type of singing for other songs. ,singing,cw81xrd,2,t5_2rlcx

5564255,0,t1_cwmq44z,Ok as I do not have Ken Tamplins program and am not terribly familiar with what he teaches I can only give a partial response.When Phil and I talk about a bright sound it just means a clear sound. Thats produced by a combination of  things  efficient cord closure and  the tongue articulating the sound clearly.You should always go for a clear sound even if doing the call voice. That said as the voice develops more it takes on a more mellow rounded quality even when going for a bright sound. As the intensity of the voice kicks in more the larynx becomes anchored down more  the chest voice and support anchors the larynx down. And this brings in the mellow color.I dont know how bright of a sound youre using to warm up though  so that plays a factor here but this is generally what happens.In regards to warming up for me personally warming up is just finding the strong elasticity of the support muscles. My voice is not warmed up until I feel that. I have to sit in the call register for  minutes and do lots of things involving crescendos and decrescendos to get to that point. If I dont do this in the call register my voice never warms up. So the bright sound is a nonissue for me  I never have to use that to warm up as it is always my intention to make a clear sound regardless of how I vocalize. But this is just me and different people need slightly different things.One more thing. If you keep the jaw muscles loose when singing the voice will not be super bright even if trying to go for a bright sound. This is a very important thing to keep in mind. To make the voice bright beyond a certain point you have to start tensing things in the jaw throat and larynx. ,singing,cwmsoeg,2,t5_2rlcx

For example if the song was originally sung high i would sing it low and vice versa. When i try to sing it in the same was as the original e.g. low or high for some reason i can never manage to sing the song properly.

5740451,0,t1_cx8e9on,Male. It may be F or G. I can produce vibrato on that note but its such a small sensation in the chest area that its not a real vibrato. More of a volume fluctuationlight accent. Mainly because at that pitch the chest resonance is very small. The reason I can do vibrato on like a C though is because the chest resonance moves into the throat and I can wobble that better. So its kinda obvious that there are a ton of reverb effects going on in that video to give more sustain and illusion of chest resonance.And yeah I wouldnt doubt a female having good vibrato up there. Normally females have an upper breakpassage thats about to an octave above a guys... So theoretically it would be very possible.,singing,cx8nqby,0,t5_2rlcx
5744097,0,t3_3tsudo,Look you can absolutely become a great singer. What I gather from your writing is that havent really even started to try. You seem to expect that it will be easy as other instruments and as an instrumentalist turned singer myself I found this to be completely untrue. Singing was more difficult for me but mainly because I started really taking lessons and practicing correctly at a later time. Ive only been at it for  years and Im extremely grateful for my current ability. I was just as happy when Id been doing it for  years. Its just fun. The key to getting out of your singing rut here is that you NEED to take lessons with the best  coach you can find and afford.If you are frustrated with your instrumental ability the same goes for training your instruments.Whenever you are stuck on a skill and your lack of ability makes you unhappy it should be a nobrainer to invest in training to get better.Life is not much without happiness so I was always one to put the work into achieving it in a way that can give back great happiness to others in the long run singing is one such activity and I hope you see it the same way.Now with that being said my hope is that once you start really training your attitude will shift from frustration to gratefulness for improvement. It will naturally flip back and forth during your journey to great singing but you simply cannot let frustration paralyze you you have to move forward to overcome it.This is the approach of good students who will improve over time. We hate being frustrated and stuck on a skill like singing. Thats why we work harder to get better invest in real vocal training etc. so that we can find happiness is every little improvement we make. But what we do not hate is being imperfect. Good students understand that is expertise is a long term journey.I wish you all the best. You can completely transform into being a confident singer with more range and musicality in your voice. I really hope you take the time to read think about and reply to these comments instead of just throwing a rant here just to let it out and it sometimes seems like people do here.

5762418,0,t1_cxbciuw,I have to say the first thing that jumps out to me is Ive never heard anyone practicing on modal scales like this before hahahaha. Its actually something I do with people for ear training but I get the sense youre doing it by accident because youre just trying to play all the notes that would work for the key of C major but youre just starting on a different note.But when I hear these scales the first one to me sounds like a mixolydian scale while the second one sounds like a phrygian scale even though that probably was not your intent. Either way its still good to keep doing these for ear training purposes especially if you can sing them acapella.Anyway as for the technique your throat starts constricting as you go higher into the scale. This is partly because you are undersupporting and part because you dont know what to do with your vowel.For now STAY AWAY from those really high notes. They are doing nothing but constricting you and teaching your throat to close off. It will be a horrible habit to have to unlearn later. For now going no higher than E should be MORE than sufficient for you as you will need to learn to get that range more efficient first before even thinking about trying to get that higher stuff. You need to learn the correct position of the throat and mouth for all your vowels. You AH is too nasal and you dont let the mouth open freely enough. Your OH is better at least on the lower end but as you begin to go higher getting near the GC area you start to go nasal with it and this is when your throat first starts to close off.You should just be sticking with simple scales for now. Nothing bigger than a tone scale. Even a  note scale would be perfect for you. A scale like CDEDC. Then move it up a half step. CDFDC. Etc. This is necessary because it allows you to hone in more on the precise problem areas.In your YouTube clip your support is actually stronger and you kept you chest voice connection MUCH better there but the position of your vowels is off and you have issues with not opening your jaw freely. That causes your larynx to raise as you go higher. But I actually do like your voice. It has an interesting color. As you train though your voice will get clearer and ring more but without you raising the larynx. Youre going to need lessons to learn the correct position of all of your vowels because this is something you will likely not pick up on your own due to tension patterns in place and preconceived ideas about how your voice should sound.,singing,cxbdqu9,2,t5_2rlcx

But you have to tackle the problem right at the mildest forms of strain. This is mostly speaking about the throat though...the lower abs will be quite physically active in singing.When you do lip rolls just dont strain in the throat at all.

But tell me honestly isnt it much simpler to just say shouting?Belting is a very specific way of singing thats why I am saying this. Imagine for example Band on the Run from Paul sang in a Broadway style. It would ruin the song!I am a huge fan of all their work and both of them were amazing singers Paul still is! but I fear that people get a bit carried away on the technical terminology.What I can tell you is that with the normal training it will be more than enough to sing their material quite well. No need to worry about special coordinations. Its on the interpretation and musicianship that it will be more challenging a song like Come Together can be ruined very easily by poor choices on phrasing and dynamics for example.Hope it is a bit more clear on what I am trying to say.

6137828,0,t1_cym14ks,Heres a quote from the textbook Ive been working from emphasis theirsgt Forward placement is not the same as a nasal tonethey are exact opposites. You make nasal tone by preventing the tone from resonating in the nasal passages.  You close off those passages at the back of your throat or by holding your nose so that the tone sounds pinched and blocked producing a quality you understand as nasal. By contrast forward placement uses all available nasal resonance adding it to the resonance produced in the throat and mouth.To me this seems to be a direct contradiction to what you and others are saying about holding your nose while you sing.  Either nobody actually knows nose? haha what theyre talking about or Im not understanding something important.My book also says Forward placement is often held up as the ideal.

6371884,0,t1_czdib3w,Ok i get the deal now this was abit better but still and im not saying this to be mean. Im saying this because singing becomes alot more fun when these things fall into place its not something i could do but i got it bashed into my head by teachers.. your falsettoheadvoice is untrained its breathy and lacks closure. when you belt your vowelmodifications are off you drift between vowels. your onset need work aswellthese are the things i hear form these clips if you get these above down what will be the result? Youll get more range probably up to the high C fullout better pitch a more reliable voice more dynamic control etc. and youll be able to sing that japanse stuff in that key without sounding iffy.,singing,czdwvmr,1,t5_2rlcx

6442438,0,t1_czlmyqi,Im not sure I understand this analogy. Why is prioritizing chest voice the same as prioritize learning to write with your right hand?People are righthanded or lefthanded but theyre not chest voiced or head voiced. Your chest voice is an extension of the same register you normally speak in.Edit I just reread your comment and noticed your flair. I shouldnt have made such a blanket statement and youre right to point out that what Im saying doesnt exactly apply to countertenors because their primary singing register is usually not the same as their speaking register. What I should have said is you should prioritize your primary vocal register which is your chest voice unless you are a countertenor.BUT just because you have a strong head voice or high range doesnt mean youre a countertenor. It takes years of training and often an entire degree to determine whether a man should be a countertenor or not. If youre reading this and asking yourself am I a countertenor the answer statistically is probably not. ,singing,czlorar,1,t5_2rlcx

6681925,0,t1_d07djtk,You have a very soft voice and you need to push it more to make it louder. Other people often have a natural resonance which projects without trying but yours does not have that. You sound like the kind of person who has to shout himself hoarse to be heard in a noisy pub. So just try to make the voice louder and stronger until you can feel a resonance coming through.

While its unlikely that someone singing G in full voice is a tenor but were both assuming that OP means full voice and that theyve properly notated what octave theyre singing in a bass baritone or baritone may well be able to sing that so its still not particularly indicative of voice type.

7000688,0,t3_4bjedg,If your lower back curves in that could be the problem. Theres a great fitness exercise to work on getting it flat thats personally helped my singing you can learn it hereIf you lower back DOESNT curve in and youre getting the pain then it could be from too much diaphragm support but if you reduce it you could cause more problems so its a tough call. If you do reduce the support youll have to make up for it by getting the voice working more efficiently in the throat area and not letting yourself tense up or screw up the coordination there.Lastly if your lower back actually rounds over like a slouch when you sing thats another big problem youd have to address and get it flatter. I havent experienced it myself so I dont know how to help that one unfortunately,singing,d19vemj,2,t5_2rlcx

7110448,0,t1_d1hk4s2,Sorry for the super late reply Ive been terribly ill recently and I havent been able to get on a computer. Anyway I definitely believe that you demonstrated whistle there.As you said somewhere else that the top note was an A not an A. Definitely whistle. Im also definitely sure that whistle isnt limited to higher and the highest of tenors Ive met some baritones and basses who definitely can go up there. So I think its definitely something you can develop.And for head voice exercises one that I do is starting on the easiest whistle note and going down to my easiest lowest chest note. And then back up and then you try a note higher.And more than that I would recommend looking up some classical soprano head voice exercises my goal for my head voice is to get it literally sounding like a classical soprano. So far that hasnt shown harmful effects for me and has only helped me expand my mix even. Good luck bro.  ,singing,d1mcpoh,1,t5_2rlcx
7114200,0,t3_4cy3uu,I think you should always listen to your private teacher more than anyone.  Theyre hearing you in an intimate setting more and know your voice best.  Theyre also usually the most knowledgeable about the technical part of singing whereas the choir director is focusing more on music making emotion color getting a good blend in the ensemble etc.All that aside theres really no need to worry about distinquishing mezzo from contralto I think.  Most of the contralto singers still sing mezzo repertoire anyway and if you have the low and high notes then youre solid for a lot of the mezzo stuff plus any of the alto lower things like Handels He Was Despised etc so I would just do both.  It sounds like your private teacher isnt interested in classifying you like others are so I would defer to them.,singing,d1msimz,4,t5_2rlcx

7159934,0,t3_4diz61,I think you keep your larynx too low. It needs to be able to move as you get higher. Try to place the sound in the front part of your mouth not in the back. Bring your tongue forward so that the sides of the back of your tongue touch your upper molars and the tip of the tongue is behind or touches your lower front teeth. Smile so that youre showing your upper front teeth. Using more twang can also help with high notes.,singing,d1s0jz3,1,t5_2rlcx
7232596,0,t1_d208oul,Its just not as cookie cutter as that baritone is not the direct center of the distribution of varieties of male voice types the center thats most common is somewhere between baritone and tenor.I believe the same is true with females the most common female voice is between mezzo and soprano but that Im less sure about I wouldnt like bet money on it or anything.These types are just words anyways though so who cares!,singing,d20akcw,1,t5_2rlcx
7235992,0,t1_d20lflp,Still too quiet bro. Youre way too close to the mic. Id recommend putting the mic somewhere a few feet away and then singing. If its too quiet then you need to sing louder.Also although youre doing a scale which is more a vocalization rather than singing I feel you should try to sing it more if you know what I mean. Try to sustain each note. Or add vibrato if you can.It also sounds like youre really dampening your larynx for those lower notes which is an option but I believe Ive heard many say not to do that. And try to only hit low notes which you can do without any drastic laryngeal changes. Also quick tip I believe low notes require more breath support than high so that may help.  So to be honest I wouldnt even worry about your vocal range for right now. It kind of doesnt matter I would say for now. Like most voice teachers would probably say much more eloquent than I to get your low and middle good before working on anything high.Which I was like you too! I was obsessed with high notes and although Ive developed them I am still currently working on making my lower notes and mid more efficient and well nice. My lower is slightly less developed than my high! And thats a no no. Heres a quote that is from uphilmoufarrege a fantastic vocal coach who posts here!He says essentially everything that I could say about vocal range. For beginners intermediaries and EVEN some professionals. TLDR Still too quiet and you kinda went into another type of falsetto. But dont worry about that for now.

Humans respond better to good looking people and thats just a fact of life. Susan Boyle also gets her popularity not just because of her skill but because of her lookshow can a seemingly unattractive person have such a beautiful voice. Anyways considering the two main vocalists of the most popular band in the world are baritones maybe were seeing a preference shift to deeper voices?

Im sure you would appreciate just getting a second opinion in case something new clicks with you.I was in a similar frustration point of my training a few years ago I was stuck at a plateau with bridging my vocal break and I took advice from many people on forums who couldnt help me including my coach at the time...but once I found the right new coach I overcame the issues and I was smooth sailing. When youre stuck ask for help from everybody who may be able to  go wide in your research and really try out different folks to find the right teacher for you not just blindly trusting any teacher. Because with these more severe bad habits in your singing it can take trying many different forms of advice before something works. Just wanted to share that I am available to help.At your stage I wouldnt even be worrying about how long it takes. Just fix the problem fast. Dont settle for coaches who say it will take you years to just get about a freakin C properly. Thats bananas.,singing,d4oevx0,4,t5_2rlcx

When I think of advanced singers I think of people who have had at least a few years of real nosetothegrindstone training and seen significant results. So technique would be a fairly large criteria I suppose but I definitely wouldnt consider it to be everything. There will also always be like you mentioned in the original post things that people want to change about their voice that might just not be possible such as wishing for a different range timbre etc. At an advanced level they would have already discovered most of this about their voice and only be working to improve what they know they have.So I suppose yes I would stand by my original statement but I do think we have probably have differing opinions on what constitutes certain things in terms of training or general satisfaction.,singing,d4xebei,3,t5_2rlcx

That being said I would check out some channels on YouTube devoted to vocal lessons. Inspired to Sing Felicia Ricci Eric Arcenaeux are just a few channels Ive viewed. Breath control is one of the most important parts of singing but there are a lot of little things that you need to add to it like raising your soft pallet focusing your breathsound etc. Various exercises work on certain things you can build upon and add to. Recording your self is a double edged sword. One one hand its the best thing to do in my opinion when you dont have someone listening and correcting you but it can be tough to listen to and easy to think youll never do it.Just keep at it. I use to be monotone and very unlistenable when I started out and now Im considering doing a few open mic nights solo. I stared lessons at age  so youre definitely not too old to work at it.

The worst case scenarios happens to me alot as well since Im also a beginner. I sometimes get so demotivated after  lesson and spend the whole day sad. But just remember after a good nights sleep it should blow over  One thing I noticed is that our hardest moments are usually due to being a newbie and learning boring yet crucial buticantseemtogetitright fundamentals. Im pretty sure once your teacher has gotten a lot of your fundamentals going on in you youll be allowed to sing what you want and how you want. of course not neglecting whatever youve learnt.

8865881,0,t3_51npok,The way you are using your chest voice is incorrect and is weakening your head resonance which means as you get around the G instead of the larynx tilting the vocal folds thinning and the resonance shifting it is unable to grab onto any of this resonance.  This is probably because your vocal cords are inflamed from straining in your chest voice.  You may also be tightening the sternocleidomastoid muscles in your neck which press the vocal cords together crudely and inflame them which results in a loss of range.You may be blowing too much air through the vocal folds which also irritates them causing loss of range. hours of singing should make you better not worse.There are many things that can go wrong and I think if you dont want to waste anymore time you should get proper guidance from a skilled mentor who can show you step by step what to do.

9185310,0,t3_560u0u,There could be many reasons for singing from the throat lack of support squeezed throat pushing chest voice too high trying to yell sing too much so the best advice is to go to that teacher  make sure they are a good teacher who is recommended through word of mouth. They will be able to lend an ear to what exactly is causing it. For now with what little info I can blab on about on reddit Ill suggest our softpalate article and a couple of exerizes that can be really effective at engaging the smaller sound that is less throaty.Heres an article about soft palate specifically from our site.The title is super corny apologies in advance! since we post them on our facebook group  . I would specifically point you to the exercize that Celine Dion does in the video we posted about halfway down. She uses a kind of hot potato blow before doing a very gentle warm up.The backwards hiss also works wonders for lifting the soft palate. If you try it with a menthol lolly in your mouth just dont inhale the lolly! it can really work wonders.As for not singing from the throat I would recommend using a very small ooooh vowel. Lips in a whistle position but not tight let them be loose and make a goofy sounding ooooohh through a  scale. To avoid this being a backwards sound imagine that this sound exists only above the mouth. Do not add too much volume to the sound. Make sure when you do this not to let your tongue go into your throat. Let it sit relaxed with the tip touching the back of your bottom teeth and the root lifted in the mouth  this doesnt need to be forced the tongue will sit where it wants to sit when it is relaxed.Another way is to do staccato  on an ah or a boi  its a little bit like going boing but do not hit the notes. You almost but not fully want to imagine a slight hah at the start of the note. Make this extremely slight though as you do not want to go in the opposite direction and have a breathy sound. I dont want to go into the intricacies too much because getting to brainy about the whole thing can make things worse but by doing this you are using less vocal cord mass while encouraging an easy onset of the note. Singing from the throat is a combination of singing with way too much thickness i.e. yell or blurting out quality and also from not having a tonne of other things in place like singing with a nice relaxed breath followed by engaging support when singing.  ,singing,d8gazwb,0,t5_2rlcx

9531474,0,t1_d9n91pd,Exactly! I would honestly recommend many beginners to learn pick up keyboard or any other easily transposeable instrument so that they would go through the process of hmm this key actually sounds better than the other not only in terms of sounding good but also easier to sing. Basic chord accompaniment would be enough really. I think many beginners innately know they need not necessarily sing the high tessitura the pop singer may be doing on the radio but they just dont have a proper place to discover that so they can only rely on what they think of how a song should be sung. ,singing,d9nyddr,1,t5_2rlcx

Once you have the technical stuff under control and thats important so dont skip it the artistic stuff is easier to tackle. Mostly its just asking yourself questions Do I like this song enough to work on it for as long as it takes to be good? Do I relate to the text or have a concrete character in mind that can convey this text? Is it appropriate for the settings in which I plan to sing it? For example dont plan to sing a song about sex in a church service and dont sing a song about dying in a hospital. Do I have access to the performing forces needed? If it requires a big rock band and all you have is an acoustic guitar will it still sound good?For the most part if you have these things nailed down you probably have a good song choice.

I do not mean to be rude but it sounds like any regular singer to me and not really someone I would seek to teach me how to better my singing because it does not really sound like you are trained yourself.I think it is pretty arrogant for one to think they know better than everyone else especially in a subject that has actually been studied for centuries.

9800723,0,t1_dal4tjp,I think that belting might be right but Im not sure about overdrive? Is that the kinda rasp that you can build up in the tone with the relaxed jaw? The problem I think was like a month or two ago I would try to sing a lot and use the rasp sound and try to add more ring to my tone. Then I went in to a lesson and the teacher said that I was pulling chest and I dont remember how to do it the same exact way because the last month or so I been trying to sing everything clean. With the rasp I can carry up like some really curbed tones but with out the rasp my belt sounds much more classical but Its a lot more demanding technique wise. I dont know if that helps... I think im more comfortable with practcing the clean  belt now and I just dont want to go back to doing it exactly the same as before. I feel like there was way to much wasted air and energy with the old way now that im paying more attention to getting a clean tone. Does that even make sense?,singing,dal5f60,1,t5_2rlcx

With whistle tones you use even lessA violin can play extremely high notes as you reach nearer to the end of its strings and harmonics but its low notes cannot be lower unless sub harmonics. lower instruments like Bass and Cello can reach the high notes of a violin too but theyre less easily achieved and more of their extremities.Its more surprising when women who can sing low and full like a man!

10073975,0,t1_dbkga2w,Some people consider head as falsetto while others consider head as mixed.People lump mixed as real voice or just an extension of chest. So usually performing range is your chest  extension of your chest mixed  head and not really falsetto. You can have a high falsetto note here and there but unless the song is being sung fully in falsetto it doesnt really matter. So it depends on what kind of head voice you are talking about. Some people use different notations to separate like Im F  G  F. Where G to F is pretty much falsetto and F to G is chest. I dont count vocal fry. But if you ask me about singable range its probably B  G  D. The highest and lowest ends are still very difficult to hit healthily and easily in a song so yeah. Your voice clip is not very accurate representation of a vocal range because in order to SING you cant just slide through the whole song. So its best if you can sing ascending scales. If each note is decently solid it can be counted as part of your range because it is performable. I agree your lowest notes are vocal fry and highest notes are falsetto. Also if you dont want to nuke your voice learn proper techniques when singing the highest or lowest notes in your range. It sounds to me like theres strain at higher notes as well. You dont wanna scream unhealthily. Your voice wont last long. ,singing,dbknszp,1,t5_2rlcx

10177556,0,t3_5lptts, I dont know how to properly use my diaphragm to push air out    Therein lies the reason why you are feeling like you are singing from the throat and feeling that only the muscles are flexing but no extra freedom or support is being felt in response.  Singing from the diaphragm is not pushing air out to sing. Pushing the diaphragm outwards is to slow down the natural exhalation process so that the breath expulsion is regulated  not being pushed out. By slowing down the rate of exhalation you let the air flow become more focused as some would describe it. This also encourages the vocal cords to close up in a clean manner without too many muscles outside the larynx trying to help in the tone making process. But by pushing excessive amounts of air in a unregulated manner the neck muscles will try to press down on the larynx to resist that large amount of breath you are using. That press of the neck muscles is what is causing you to feel like you are singing from the throat  One way to feel the idea of the regulation of air flow is to take in a certain amount of air and exhale out with a hiss. Do it the first time and exhale out the air through the hiss as quickly as possible. Then the second time with one goal make the hiss last as long as possible. Do not try to increase the intensity of the hiss or make it louder the one goal is to simply make the exhalation on the hiss last longer the second time round. If done correctly you should start feeling some expansion in the abdomen area. Just note that this illustration may or may not work for you as these things vary from person to person but hope this helps!,singing,dbxokg3,6,t5_2rlcx

10377017,0,t1_dck5xf1,When we breathe in our lungs expand as does our ribcage. At the same time the diaphragm and abdominal muscles move downward to make space. The more you can keep your abdomen relaxed and your posture tall and open the lowerdeeper that movement will be. You cannot directly control your diaphragm as I said before but you can accomplish this by not tensing your ab muscles and by filling your lungs. Thinking low can help too. If youre having trouble it can help to try this deep breathing while lying on your back. You will feel your stomach and chest expand toward the ceiling. If that doesnt work it can also help to drop to a low squat on the inhale.  Again I cant reiterate enough that you want your stomach relaxed so that the diaphragm is able to contract downward freely as your lungs expand. You are not really harnessing air or controlling anything as much as you are filling your lungs and letting your body do what it knows how to do. Its almost more like giving up control. ,singing,dckar60,1,t5_2rlcx

10487338,0,t3_5q6tfl,There are many many theories about how to set up the different voice parts  articles and maybe even books have been written about it. As far as sopranos and basses together the prevailing wisdom is that basses act as the harmonic foundation and sopranos have the melody so being in close proximity allows those parts to tune with each other most easily and the inner parts would then fill in the chord and tune with each other in relation to that foundation. There is also the possibility that in less experienced choirs sopranos and basses tend to be the weakest sight readers so there is strength in numbers as far as hearing the relevant part or not being thrown off by harmony parts. Of course this is a secondary concern but it does go into the decisions in a school or community chorus situation. ,singing,dcwukwj,1,t5_2rlcx

It is easier to diagnose problems in the classical voice because problems are far more obvious. I have found that learning classical technique made it easy to apply to contemporary and historically speaking that is how contemporary singing evolved. Classicaloperatic singing WAS the pop music of the s and earlier. This does not mean that you NEED classical singing to learn to sing contemporarily. BUT  many pop singers have taken classical lessons and have said that it helped them.Again I do not pretend to be the beall endall authority your teacher is not wrong  but be careful. You must still sing contemporary pieces. There ARE classical singers who complain about not being flexible to apply classical technique to pop.

A trained vocalist should be able to find the place in their headas Ive learned to associate vibrato with to cause vibrato when needed and cut it when not needed.Vibrato like any other vocal technique is a toolsometimes its naturally learned sometimes its not and can be selected to be used or not be used. However it is possible to use a fake vibrato by vibrating your chestthroathead but that is not true vibrato. When I first started my classicalopera training my wonderful teacher had me try to find a place in my head where she could hear the beginnings of vibrato. At this point in time I could use it when I needed to in songs but I didnt know how I was producing it. Anyhow we would go over  finger patterns on piano and I would shake my head left and right slowly while bouncing my arm up and down to help find ither way of helping me find it. Eventually I did find it and can now introduce it into a note whenever I need to.I agree with others here take a few lessons with an experienced vocal coach and they will help you figure out your voice. They will tell you what youre doing right and wrong. Lessons are like a cheat code for people who started out self taughtlike myself. You will learn so much and it will be amazing it totally changed how I view my voice others voices and music in general.

10887222,0,t1_de2o6nf,gtIn my experience both teaching and using this to sing it comes rather naturally after the clean technique is working well enough to allow it to happen.Can confirm. I thought for years it wasnt possible to learn that you had to be born with it. As I developed greater awareness and coordination of my vocal apparatus I started experimenting with different shapes and levels of compression and found it.That said I want to add to what uFelipeVoxCarvalho said. Once you discover this new mode of vocalization chances are its probably going to sound weak a little wheezy and possibly forced. Now just like your clean voice you will need to develop the tone and consistency of your distorted voice.Of course then comes the musical challenge of knowing when and how to use it to accentuate your performance not to sound dirty for the sake of it. Listen to some of those singers with great distortion and you may find they use it less than you think.Final thought Hydrate hydrate hydrate.

Everyone experiences singing differently so you never know what a different perspective could help you with. I find its actually most beneficial when seeing different teachers on a long term basis but it surely would help to find a good teacher that you can go to as a back up if something like this happens again.

11328267,0,t1_dffz8lm,I didnt respond to you further because I didnt think it worthwhile to get into an argument with you. For one itd be an argument about your abilities an area where you have  experience and Ive got . And if this was a case of one of us being mistaken about how perfect pitch works or if youre just a really rare example of it  which under normal circumstances could lead to an interesting conversation  you seemed snarky and combative in your reply and are continuing that now by bringing it up again a month later so wheres the fun in discussing it with you? Ive got better things to do with my free time.But since Im here fine. Here is why I said what I said. Absolute pitch is the ability to identify notes without any point of reference but your description made it sound as though you were using a point of reference  Bb  and that you had trained yourself to remember this pitch through dedicated practice. That sounds to me like relative pitch and the fact that you can now do this quickly for any note without conscious reference to a Bb sounds like you just got good at it. That hypothesis is reinforced when you say you learned this between eighth and ninth grade which would be most unusual. Could I be wrong about this? Sure its possible. But I think it was a reasonable conclusion to make from your description and your snarky response didnt interest me in finding out more. ,singing,dfg1ggf,2,t5_2rlcx
11358459,0,t3_623htl,Youre not doing anything wrong at all in fact good on you for getting the first step down! Opera and art singers pretty much sing with an entirely raised pallet. If youre going for more popish less exaggerated singing experiment with finding a sweet middle ground as far raising your pallet.  Edit Also this is the part where vowelsounds and consonants become pretty important. Opera singers will sing tall vowels up and down shapes. Flat vowels are typically only used stylistically. Find a middle ground. These things are pretty much developed through practice and listening to oneself while one sings.,singing,dfjgl5w,2,t5_2rlcx

11440729,0,t1_dfsqq64,Your comment is insulting. Im not a moderator here but even if I was I dont think its out of line to point out how ignorant and insulting your argument is. Whether or not people have to modify speech they do. Its a basic reality of being human and being part of society. Surely you dont give a formal political speech using the same vocabulary and intonation you do when youre hanging out with your friends at a bar? Anyway Im not going to argue with a troll like you. Its clear youve come in here to be deliberately dense and inflammatory and getting any more involved in this conversation would be totally offtopic. Have a nice day. ,singing,dfsso2a,2,t5_2rlcx
11503254,0,t3_63xllw,Hum some scales and hum some songs. Make a ritual where you find your voice only in a way that is most comfortable to you! That might be going pretty soft volume or loud if no one is home but as long as you are comfortable. Some people dont care if they are heard by others but if you dont want others hear you you should honor that but that might change over time to if you discover yourself and your voice. Lots to explore no matter where you are. ,singing,dfzw74q,1,t5_2rlcx

She has a beautiful voice and is a very accomplished singer and he says it takes a lot to touch her that way. Made me feel good!Critique  I was just learning my first French aria and was all proud to sing it for my teacher. I had been practicing a lot trying hard to overcome my natural reticence in order to be a bit sultry. Her response? No you sound like Edith Piaf and she was a bar singer! Lesson quickly learned on the difference between classical and nonclassical sung French!,singing,dgfkdb4,3,t5_2rlcx
11660228,0,t3_66d611,I am not make so I can primarily speak to my personal experience and things Ive witnessed in my male colleagues but here are some general observations The range definitely changes through puberty. Its partly a matter of training but partly a matter of musculature. At  I was convinced I was a mezzo fortunately my teacher at the time disagreed and didnt let me sing mezzo repertoire and I could barely hit G. Now at  I am very clearly a high soprano and can sing at least D to performance quality with a bit higher still in the works. On the reverse end while I used to be able to comfortably sing below the staff I now start getting uncomfortable about Bb. I can still phonate to about D same as when I was a teenager but the quality and comfort diminishes rapidly unlike when I was young. Timbre is even more noticeable although again training is a factor. I had a pretty typical case of the glottal chink in high school and my voice was very breathy and thin. As I got older I started developing a much fuller sound and now I actually have to be careful not to overdarken my sound as opposed to brighter than neon which was essentially my sound until I was around . For men the range issue seems to manifest itself in a lack of controlled middle register and a stark break near the top of the chest voice around D or so. With time there tends to be much more comfort in that DG range even for baritones and tenors can start seeing comfort to around Bb or so. Timbre wise again the sound is more filled out and gains more character than the younger male voice. Its a little less noticeable than for women but the voice does change in timbre as you get older. Now all of this is very much a generalization. Its impossible to know what puberty will do to any particular voice but these are some general changes Ive noticed off the top of my head. ,singing,dghp9ny,1,t5_2rlcx

11731670,0,t1_dgopn8b,Critique for your Right Here Waiting coverIt sounded nice! Your tone and range are quite good. I would definitely work on your vocal rolls or riffing. It was a little sloppy. You seem to get most of the notes right. There were a few that were off key.If you can you should invest in a better mic. There were noticeable pops of air puffs here and there. But if you dont want to spend money on a mic thats ok.To improve enunciation just practice speaking extremely clearly. Move your lips to shape the words. Always check YouTube to see if there are tutorials. There are many tutorials addressing the issues you mentioned.For your Versace on the Floor coverWow you sounded almost just like Bruno Mars! You could be an impressionist! Good tone. I did notice you went off key many times here and there. Focus on staying on pitch. Practice hitting the right notes. Again there were noticeable air puffs into the microphone but it was pretty great given the low quality equipment! Good work!,singing,dgptcvl,1,t5_2rlcx

11794507,0,t1_dgwxnms,I can hardly hear your voice over the guitar but a big issue for me is that the song sounds too low for your voice. Otherwise I cant really hear enough to make more of a comment. As for learning I recommend getting a voice teacher. I cannot at all recommend YouTube  while it can be a good resource for exercises or to learn more about certain aspects of technique YouTube cant listen to you and adjust for what your personal instrument calls for. And that is a crucial part of learning to sing. ,singing,dgwy410,1,t5_2rlcx
