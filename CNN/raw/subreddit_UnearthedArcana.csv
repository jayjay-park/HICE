4284574,0,t3_3a1sob,One quick question what do you want this class to do? The mind blade and some of the features suggest a striker d hp extra attack fighting style half casting while others suggest a controller spell choices huge int buff capstone telepathy both subclasses. Some of your abilities are incomplete like Psychic Hardening and Mind Reader at least I hope Mind Reader isnt detect thoughts as a cantrip at rd level with bonuses.Id suggest looking at the bard for inspiration pun intended.

4438898,0,t1_csq5v1i,Both in flavor and in mechanics the e Sorcerer is much closer to other editions Psions.  The flexibility of casting the more raw style of the spells as compared to those on the Wizard list and the ability to augment via Sorcery point metamagic all play very similarly to ndrd ed psions.Also the distinction in . between Psion and Wilder always seemed very thin to me.  A Psion is a powerful user of natural mental strength drawn from an internal wellspring of power.  A wilder is a powerful user of natural mental strength drawn from an internal wellspring of power... but a little more unpredictable?  PsionsWilders were way closer together than WizardsSorcerers were.  In fact in the e world Psions and Wilders would probably have been subclasses of the same class rather than two distinct ones which is exactly what Ive put together here.  So instead ofgt Psion  Wizardgt gt Wilder  SorcererItsPsion  Sorcerer with Psion SubclassWilder  Sorcerer with Wild Magic SubclassBesides this is for Dark Sun.  Wizards are already getting redivided into Defiler and Preserver.  ,UnearthedArcana,csq7hrg,1,t5_384bx
4458796,0,t1_csseg95,On another note the ideal tactic in multitarget combat is virtually ALWAYS to kill off as many targets as possible with focus fire one at a time. This is a widely known strategy used by just about everyone whos played more than  minutes of an RPG or even just certain types of video games.This skill encourages nay rewards going against that tactic. I dont care if its SLIGHTLY overpowered because what it does is reward awesome flavorful fighting styles. One might argue that the flavor should be enough reason to do things like this but I for one think rewarding such things is important as well.,UnearthedArcana,csspngu,2,t5_384bx
4498093,0,t1_csxlqfo,The Dervish already exceeds other melee characters through the ondemand sweeping attack it receives at level  which must I remind you is something only a level  Hunter Ranger can do.Do not try to equate the Bards melee prowess to the prowess of intended melee classes like the Paladin and Fighter.The Bard has Full Casting to compensate for lack of comparative melee power. You already dramatically increase the bards normal melee power through that sweeping attack.Think less of making any subclass on par with any other class that dedicates itself to that particular stage. Think more on simply enhancing the base class through subclasses beyond what the base class could normally do.I think the above applies to much of Vecnas work perhaps it is the case that the common cause of people calling Vecnas work overpowered is that the Vecna creators try too hard to match the power of established material instead of focusing on simply enhancing the base class through filling a unique niche. By trying so hard to match the damage base of normally nondamaging classes with damaging classes Vecna exceeds their power because seemingly Vecna forgets that the base class itself has more than enough power to compensate for unequal damage comparisons.It is simply enough to boost damage on subclasses that are meant to deal more damage than their base class normally provides. Never forget what the base class can do.Sweeping Attack which is what Im calling it at this point is more than enough of a damage boost for the Full Casting Bard class. It Doesnt. Need. More.Each time you come up with a new feature try asking Who Else Can Do This and at What Level?In the Sweeping Attack Dervishs case An th level Hunter Ranger could do that. A rd level Bard doing what an th level Hunter Ranger can do? Then we go with restrictions to justify that.Lastly Simplicity is King.  The more streamlined you can make a feature the better. The fewer interactions of numbers the better. The less you have to count on your hands the better. The less a DM has to keep in mind the better. So I would recommend not letting a Battledancer hit one creature twice and all other creatures once.Name one class that can do that at any level. Name one. There is no one. Granting the bard such an ability would make the Bard the only class that could do such a thing on top of being a Fullcaster. It says to the Ranger Im a better caster and a better multiattacker than you!,UnearthedArcana,csxn1u2,3,t5_384bx

4640865,0,t3_3effzp,Rather than Construction specifically I think this might work better as a more general crafts domain so it works for stonemasons and carpenters but also for blacksmiths tanners tailors etc.I think you also overcomplicated the Rite of Construction ability. The short duration really kills the utility of it aside from fooling someone into buying things. For a domain centered on crafting there should be abilities that help out during downtime. Of course being able to churn out infinite longswords or whatever would probably cause a lot of problems though you still need to find someone to buy them so as a balancing factor you could require the raw materials for that item. Id propose it change to something like thisRite of ConstructionFrom the nd level as an action you can use your Channel Divinity to create a nonmagical object described in Chapter  Equipment in an unoccupied space adjacent to you in which it can fit. The value of this object may be up to  GP per Cleric level. If you have the raw materials required to make the object they are consumed and the object is permanent.

It is very powerful for level one and more powerful then any other racial features.I think it has to have a usage limit maybe once per short or maybe  times per long?When making homebrew content it is really easy to make things a overpowered especially since there is a personal connection to the concept essentially comparable to a character being special snowflakey. Your race is great in every single category it has more speed than all races get other than wood elves stronger darkvision ridiculous age making timeless body obsolete pretty much and great attribute scores and skill. Now the problem is if you plan of having Night elves run around in a regular campaign they are too good. However if you plan on making all the warcraft races and make sure that they are on the same power level it could be fine.

4946457,0,t1_cuhxyns,Here are my thoughtsThe flavor is good. I like the concept of adding elementallike abilities as a replacement for morphing into beasts with Wild Shape. It seems a bit overpowered but I like that you are trying to take a bold departure from what the other subclasses do. Some of the language definitely needs clarification You are not a native speaker? Once you get the features right I can help you with that if you like.More specific featurebyfeature comments below most of which are asking for clarificationsCirlce of the Four Elements better name?The Cicrle of the Four Elements is composed of clan protectors who have formed around planar portals both pulling streght and power from the planes protecting them from intruders and protecting the world from creatures that may emerge from them.nd Level Elemental Attunement As a bonus action you may shift your elemental attunement between one of the four elements Fire Earth Water and Air. While attuened you can cast a cantrip associated with your element Control flames Mold earth Shape water GustThis is good.Elemental Form In addition to taking the form of beasts Circle of the FOur Elements druids have learned infuse thier shapes with elemental energies. When you wild shape into a beast form that form exhibits characteristics of your attument element.As a bonus action you can expend one use of your wild shape to enhance your humanoid form with elemental power based on your attunement.How long do these benefits last? Until you return to normal form as Wild Shape?Fire Resistance to Fire damage all creatures within  of you take your WIS modifie fire damage at the end of thier turns.This may not be overpowered in general but its definitely pretty potent relative to the Air and Water abilities.Earth resistance to Acid damage your skin hardens as your unarmoured AC becomes ConStr WaterSee comment for Fire.Resistance to Cold damage you can Water Walk as per the spell and enemies within  hit by your melee attacks make a CON Save or are slowed until the start of your next turn. Air Resitance to Lighting damage you have advantage on athletic checks when jumping and gain  movementThis is the weakest of the four abilities for this feature that doesnt necessarily mean its bad. Is this  when jumping or to all movement? If its all movement Id say your speed increases by  feet.th Level Elemental Blow As they grow in thier connection to the elemental planes Circle of the Four Elements druids learn to infuse thier strikes with the power of the planes. Your melee weapon attacks take on special properties depending on your elemental attunement. Fire Flaming Cleave On a Hit creatures within of the target take your WIS modifier fire damage. Earth Stone Strike you melee weapon attacks deal and addtional d or should it be  die? bludgeoning damage. WaterAir Speed of the Storm you can attack twice when taking the attack action on your turn.This seems mostly reasonable. I would clarify what kind of attack for waterair. Weapon attacks only? Melee weapon attacks only? th Level Advanced Elemental Form Your elemental form gains new abilities.Like the other Elemental Form abilities it is unclear how long these options are available.Fire Whirling Inferno when hit or missed by a melee attack you may make use your reacrtion to make a ranged attack agains any enemies within  for d fire damageThis is unclear. Is this a ranged spell attack? A ranged weapon attack? Earth Stone Stomp  Cone all creatres must make a DEX Save or be knocked prone those who save treat the cone as difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.Water Tsunami  Cone all creatures must make a STR save d damage and pushed  save for half damage and distance.Air Lighting Leap Leap to a spot within  all creatures within  of your start and end point must make a DEX Save vs d lighting damage save for half. This does not incure attacks of opportunity.Earth Water and Air It is clear enough what youre trying to do. Air seems to be the weakest again.th Level Elemental Gate Once per long rest you may open a gate to one of the elemental planes and hold it open for upto h druid levels. While travelling the elemntal planes you take not damage or discomfort from the natural enviromental hazards of the planes.Does the gate stay open or can you close it?,UnearthedArcana,cui1hcv,1,t5_384bx

You allow ranged or melee attacks distance but omit the type and allow spell attacks but omit the distance.   When you omit the distance descriptor youre implying that either distance is fine as long as you obey the type requirement see Hunters Mark.  Similarly omitting the type descriptor implies either is fine as long as you obey the distance Crossbow Expert is worded like this.   If you mean for it to effect any successful hit you want the wording of Hex.

5527710,0,t3_3qrfcu,Hey. I like the class and though I did not like the Reaver in Dragon Age it was definitely one of the more interesting mechanically.Ring of Pain is nice early on but falls off pretty quickly. You could add rage damage to help it scale into later levels and it is only usable while raging anyway.Devour life is fine from what I think and I have nothing really to comment on it.The level  ability is always a non combat feature for Barbarians. I suggest maybe a divining ability like the Ranger or something that lets the Barbarian detect wounded creatures or something along those lines.If you add an exploration ability then I reckon that Dragon Rage should be the level  ability. Terrifying Critical is nice but Dragon Rage fits better in the archetype as a whole and will see more use than Terrifying Critical.I like it though fits the theme of a Reaver from Dragon Age nicely.,UnearthedArcana,cwi7pgy,1,t5_384bx

Im not familiar with your description of becoming a lich it sounds like flavor text from one of the undead source books. Not surprising I havent read every book so such things do slip by LOL there is just to much to read.Frankly the permanency spell was never well supported and general broken.  Only specific spells were supposed to work with it as its original description simply said effects the duration of certain other spells making them permanent.  The problem is that only a handful of other spells officially said they could be made permanent with the spell  of .  Players and DMs extended it to make other spells permanent without worrying for balance.

Oftentimes where you were last turn isnt necessarily a better position than where you started and if you are facing an intelligent enemy they could even figure out how this feature works and then easily out maneuver you.Mainly if I decrease the power of this ability much more why wouldnt a rogue just always use their Disengage Cunning action and then use their movement as normal? If they do that they get to choose where they go and they ignore OAs.However I will specify the wording to state that they get shunted to a nearby space if their space was occupied and I will think a bit more about the grappling issue.

Maybe have creatures that are sensitive to light have disadvantage on the saving throw and possibly get rid of the lock out restriction. However the damage and it being spread out does give this ability some notable strengths over Sacred Flame so keeping the lockout is probably necessary.Overall love the concept but a little worried about the restriction though it is only situationally a problem and the potential overlap andor outshining heh of Sacred Flame.,UnearthedArcana,cxzdac8,1,t5_384bx

6093262,0,t1_cyi50b8,Hey no problem!  I enjoyed doing it.This is another superhuge comment but the very TLDR version is more spells rework the lowlevel spells you already have and extra attack is extra awesome. With regards to the armor proficiency and the swordmage warding I have a lot of thoughts about that.  TLDR They have the Defense fighting style and theyre encouraged not to use a shield.  The only shenanigans would be getting the Defense fighting style and the Bracers of Defense but those arent solved by light armor since Assaulting swordmages would just prioritize Dex over Str.  Long version about armor and warding Arcane Warding is literally the Defense fighting style plus making a free hand into a shield.  Itd make them better at grappling since they wouldnt have a shield but without extra attack I dont know how much theyd be grappling.  Either way I really dont think theyd have any more AC issues than a paladin or a fighter if they ran straight swordmage.  I guess the big issue would be stacking with the Defense fighting style through multiclassing and the Bracers of Defense.  I dont have my DMG on me for the holidays or else Id look at the exact wording for that one.  I guess if you cant word it such that the warding doesnt stack with either of those then yeah you can have AC shenanigans.  Restricting it to light armor would just make them prioritize Dexterity though for the assaulting swordmage theres no motivation to have Strength through the class features.  You could have Intelligent Blademaster and Lashing Shield use their Strength modifier but that really goes against the flavor in my opinion if its a spellish effect I prefer it to use the spellcasting modifier. About the extra attack I kinda figured that out towards the end of writing my comment that theyre expected to use a cantrip every turn but theres a lot of extra benefits provided by extra attack.  The most obvious one is flexibility.  Attacking doesnt have to be just attacking you could shove or grapple which given the free hand and expertise in Athletics from the Assault swordmage build that could be really potent for battlefield control.  However the big issue with the custom spells particularly the low level ones is that they are outclassed by cantrips youd need a way to cast a combat spell and still have a normal attack if those first level spells will be relevant.  That comes later in this comment though. And about the Extra Spell since the cantrips increase the damage with level it looks like a greatsword Assault swordmage would do dd damage plus d more if it moves every turn with booming blade...times two compared to a greatsword paladin doing dd plus divine smites which take up spell slots.  Id just take the Battle Magic feature from Valor Bards. With regards to marking if that works for your group then keep it but I would expect most DMs to raise an eyebrow at it and maybe sweat nervously.  I got the impression that they consciously tried to make maintaining aggro harder in e compared to earlier editions.  As it is due to the perks with opportunity attacks if it has the Sentinel feat a Swordmage can lock down a foe about as hard as using the Compelled Duel spell.  Id just remove the opportunity attack bonuses without that its a longerrange version of either the last part of the Sentinel feat or the Protection fighting style kinda. Speaking of the Protection fighting style to diversify the Aegis of Shielding features you could make either the Aegis effect or Channeling Shield apply disadvantage to the attack roll. Another thing that could be used is more teleporting powers.  One of the things that seemed very Swordmagey to me was teleporting a lot although that may have just been the characters I played with.  How about the following feature replacing Arcane Resilience which just seems kinda bland to me?  There are obvious uses to it in combat where you can instantly move the front line but it could be used to render assistance if someone gets screwed by a trap or caught while scouting.gt Summoned Aidgtgt When one of your allies takes damage while within  feet or whatever of you you can use your reaction to teleport to an open space adjacent to them. Also something I totally missed my first time around  two Swordmages can have the same creature marked causing some shenanigans with allswordmage parties.  Youll need to word it so that it cant be marked by the two different marking features either. About the wording on Arcane Fortitude  I done goofed when telling you to change the wording to match that of Tough.  I shouldve said to match something similiar to tough  right now the HP per level matches d hit dice.  It should be something like this if youre so inclinedgt In addition your hit dice for all of your swordmage levels becomes d your maximum hit points increase by an amount equal to your Swordmage level and whenever you gain a Swordmage level hereafter your hit point maximum increases by an additional  hit point.On a side note if theyre rolling for HP per level would they do d or d? Regarding the spells and explorationinteraction theres very few choices for lowlevel spells that arent combatoriented.  For first level spells I count only  choices that dont require an attack or saving throw and one of those is a recovery thing.  Considering the first level spell slots will do less damage than a cantrip by level  when you get second level spell slots there should be more noncombat options than combat options.  Even with the combat options Id be more comfortable if they were bonus actions to deal more damage and effects with a subsequent hit so that you can mix and match attacking maaaaybe with extra attack? with an empowered stndlevel spell and attacking with a cantrip.  This is kinda the same approach with paladin smite spells. Also Mythal Recovery I dont think saving throws occurring at the end of turns for ongoing effects is particularly common they might only get a saving throw under certain conditions like using an action to determine if an illusion is real or fake.  Id change it into a selftarget version of Lesser Restoration but thats just me. Shackled Warding looks incomplete. With regards to Strength of Elemental Earth it looks like the Enlarge part of EnlargeReduce but with  Strength and no bonus d damage.  Id give it some other bonuses or make it a nd level spell.  Given the other elemental spells Id give it another feature maybe bonus temp HP or advantage on Con ability checks?  Im surprised that channeling elemental earth wouldnt provide a bonus to hardiness haha. The Form of Elemental AirEarthFireWaterHeart dont need to be different spells do they?  Id just make it one spell so that they wouldnt be tempted to burn all the th level spells known on that.  Youd need more th level spells though. Im not a big fan of Ironskin it looks strictly better than stoneskin despite being the same level.  Id make it a th level spell. Im also not a fan of Arcane Empowerment.  As a ritual with a material component cost it translates time and money into damage. All in all Id add the following spells to the spell listCantrips Blade Ward True Strike maaaaybe Mendingst level spells Comprehend Languages Feather Fall Find Familiar Identify Illusory Script Jump Longstrider Shield although its a bit redundant with Ward of Brilliance Maybe a few other illusion ones like Charm Person Disguise Self or Silent Image since those remain useful at all levels.nd level Alter Self but then again I love that spell haha Knock Levitate Locate Object Magic Mouth Magic Weapon Silence Suggestionrd level Elemental Weaponth level  Dimension Door Fire Shield Polymorph Stoneskin maaaaybe Confusionth Level Passwall Other spells I cant figure out exactly what they do since Im away from my PHB for the holidays... but just two or three more since they dont get so many th level spells or spell slots Just as a guess Id say Geas Modify Memory Telekinesis or Wall of Force.I know thats a lot of additions to the spell list but the low level ones as they stand dont scale well or remain relevant and they dont have access to the whole spell list so I figure more spells shouldnt be too much of an issue.,UnearthedArcana,cyi8os6,5,t5_384bx

6420874,0,t3_43mkpo,The most obvious thing to me is that it scales somewhat weirdly. Im not aware of any other spell that scales by increasing die type. There are some noncaster features that work like this so its not a completely new idea but I think it would be the first time a caster is exposed to this sort of thing. And having it scale any different way would obviously be extremely dangerous so I guess the way youve done it is probably for the best.Personally I wouldnt adjust the level it starts at or the way it scales. It looks pretty good to me asis.,UnearthedArcana,czjge0c,3,t5_384bx
6428503,0,t1_czjcshp,gtThe intention is that you spend one Channel Divinity per attack although now I think that the once per turn restriction is unnecessary.When you say this it makes me wonder if youre confused about the way that Channel Divinity works. Paladins only have one use of channel divinity per short or long rest.gt The mechanic is that you spend  points for a level  smite  for a level  smite etc. Why is  hitpoints not worth a divine smite? A level  smite on average will do  damage and the discrepancy only gets worse the higher the slot level. In broadest terms health is worth less than damage because health scales up faster. Theres more of it so the value of  single health point decreases faster than the value of  single damage point. But further I think youre viewing the relationship between Lay on Hands and Divine Smite as too simplistic when theyre re so mechanically different. In combat theres a divergence in opportunity cost between the two. Its not a    relationship where youre using an ACTION and delivering  points of damage instead of  points of healing. You can only use LoH on a single target and it requires an action to deploy. So you can only use it ONCE per turn. What makes Divine Smite so valuable in part is that it doesnt take up anything in the action economy to use  it doesnt require a bonus action reaction etc  its damage that can be dropped on top of all the other damage that accompanies your melee attacks. So you can deploy it twice or more times per turn. gt Yes the intention is that the paladin can use spells more often than usual in return for giving up his core healing capability.The issue here is that because of the exchange rate youre allowing the Paladin to effectively purchase more spell slots in his range than any full caster class. If you want a character who gives up a LoHslike healing ability but has the ability to use more spells and still wears heavier armor and can perform melees attacks you should maybe look more towards a Cleric  who also gain the ability to use their Channel Divinity more than just once per shortlong rest.,UnearthedArcana,czk8u1q,2,t5_384bx

6501196,0,t1_czrqihx,To clarify what Im saying about a lack of contextual awareness about the rules of the game. It doesnt need to grant armor class since tanking is not a core concept of these prestige class and the only semicanonical prestige class in e so far only grants tool proficiencies.. I cant tell if youre using sarcasm here or not. Ill assume its sarcasm and say that if you make a prestige class without full casting you basically guarantee that full casters will never ever take it because it will be such a huge loss of potential for them. And honestly Darkness is not that powerful.. I do agree with you here. Not so much because I think youd be dragging around a wizard but it is stupid complicated.. No. If you are in bright light dim light gives no penalty that Im aware of. If youre in dim light youre probably already around some spots that have darkness anyway. Not to mention that a walking shroud of darkness is likely to attract attention AND it takes a full action so doing it in combat is really really silly.. I think youre greatly overestimating how good fighting style is or who should have it. Paladins and Rangers get it in the PHB yes theyre halfcasters and not full casters but no class gets fighting style without it being paired with another benefit because again its not that amazing. Its good for sure but its not good enough on its own.. Again I really really really encourage you to check your tone. There is absolutely no need to be rude to a stranger on the internet and in particular when you are doing so from the standpoint of understanding the game better than them when its quite clear you dont. Caliginous Gift is a trade off. Its better than ABI in that you can pick a different stat every time. Its worse in that you only have it some of the time.. Full casters tend not to need Extra Attack because their cantrips scale. This just gives the Dark Knight who is a front line fighter or else he has no way to dump his darkness another way to scale his damage. The fact that its there in the PHB ought to tell you its fine. Plus the Eldritch Knight gets both cantrips and Extra Attacks.,UnearthedArcana,czrrtsa,0,t5_384bx

6543983,0,t3_458acz,Looks pretty good!  Id also put in your changes summary that you made it so that they can only use each option from a discipline once per turn which significantly limits the burst potential from Lethal Strike if dualwielding or if multiclassed as a fighter.Im not a huge fan of the Soul Knife having access to the Defense or Mariner fighting styles largely due to the synergy with Iron Durability.  One of my complaints with the WotC mystic class is that you can get both features with either a  level Fighter dip or a  level Mystic dip which makes it really strong.I can see why you wanted to give the Soul Knife damage akin to sneak attack but the other two mystic subclasses are following the pattern set by the cleric where the damage bonuses occur at th level which scales at th level for weaponusers.  Im dont think that giving d extra damage around the same time that the order of the immortal gets d extra damage is balanced.Id keep only one offensivelyoriented feature for the Soul Knife and put it at level .  The level  and  features should either be defensive or something that helps with explorationinteraction.Im not sure why you gave the Soul Knife a level  feature.  To me that would work well as a level  feature and you could give them the rogues ability to hide or something as a bonus action as a level  feature.  Im not terribly familiar with the .e soul knife but I assume its basically a halfrogue halfpsion right?I think that the Force of Will feature looks nice but using  psi points on what is effectively a cantrip as a bonus action is a little underpowered.  Id consider using the same cost as a quickened cantrip that the sorcerers could use but thats just me.Some of your greater disciplines have  effects while others have .  You should standardize it.With Alter Perceptions you should work on the wording for Visions of Death it is ambiguous whether a creature who successfully saves would take the d damage.Even though Aspect of the Beast is associated with the immortal order the Vigor effect does not synergize with it at all.  The immortals already get temp hp every round.  Sure theyre going to get more if they spend more than  psi point but I think itd be better off going with the Soul Knife order.  Also the frightened effect on the Form of Doom should have a way to be negated on subsequent rounds whether by having continued saving throws or ending their turn a sufficient distance away or something.I think you meant to have a different focus effect for Astral Manipulation.For Alter Memory Id put the total psi cost for using it at higher levels rather than the incremental psi cost.  Thats just my personal preference though I wouldnt blame you if you disagreed.Temporal Action overlaps heavily with Surge of Action I had figured that Surge of Action was supposed to be a psionic replacement for haste so I would avoid giving them the same thing.I dont have the time right now to look over the talents or the rest of the disicplines but I really like what youve done with this class.

That said here are a few thoughts I had after reading the archetype Naming MagicWhile I like the concept of this I dont feel its really needed. Its also a fair bit more powerful than the Bonus Proficiencies other Bard colleges get at rd level. Power of the VoiceI really like this ability. I think its good that it uses inspiration die and that it is limited to once per long rest. Im not entirely sure the checkDC setup you have for it is what I would go with but I think its a good start for sure. On a side note I would probably call this ability Naming Magic or possibly Awakened Mind. True NamingI think you could make a really cool naming magic class by reflavoring the rune magic system. However as this is an archetype for Bards I feel this is out of place. Maybe some thing more akin to a Rangers favorite enemies ability would work well here. You can pick certain types of creatures and you gain advantage when trying to recall information about them and you have advantage when using Power of the Voice against them. Name Thee amp Bind TheeThis falls well into the theme of a naming magic however a Bard can already accomplish these things using either Bard spells or spells they get through Magical Secrets. I would use this th level ability to enhance the naming magic abilities given at lower levels. Maybe You can now use Power of the Voice once per short or long rest.

7053145,0,t3_4c1rj0,My review.I like Masters of Blood and the Spellcasting Focus difference is cool.The flavor of Blood Magic Savant is top notch. I love it. The way it interacts with healing is awesome.One problem is that there is a ton of stuff you get at level .Blood Ritual is cool. Phantom Vigor is perfect as is Potent Blood. Silence the Pain is good. Staunch the Wound is good. Armor of Vitality is good. I dont like Blood Agony. The flavor works but I dont like another smite existing. Wizards are already strong they dont need more damage. Remove it is my call.Wizards dont get rd level things for schools. Remove that. I do like them learning Cure Wounds and Spare the Dying.Hemomancer means they will have too many blood points during the day. Mark of Blood is fine.Wellspring of Life is fine.On the one hand I like the flavor of Blood Awakening but on the other Wizards dont need even more spells known. I say replace it.Blood Sense is way too strong for a cantrip. It can exist but as a higher level spell.Blood Sacrifice is awesome but it may need to be affected by resistance to prevent imbalance.Blood Wound is cool. It says you add ds on higher levels but it uses ds. Dont know which is wrong.Blood Control should be a Con saving throw. They should also get more saving throws to be like other save or sucks.Cull the Blood seems fine and bloody awesome.Changes I would makeMaybe make Master of Blood replace Potent Blood as a Blood Rite.Remove Blood Agony.Move learning Spare the Dying to level  and add Cure Wounds as a spell that can be learned but not known.For Blood Siphon make it spend hit dice or Max HP to get blood points back and only so many times per day.Rework or remove Blood Awakening.Overall I love it so much. It is almost there to be the blood mage I have wanted.,UnearthedArcana,d1ftzpe,1,t5_384bx
7055967,0,t3_4c8r08,Its  AM and I have work in the morning but ...I actually agree with uMVIIDS on a lot of points.  When I first opened this I was ridiculously excited.  I am a huge huge opponent of new base classes I think for the most part we should be adding Subclasses and Races instead.  Prestige classes if really necessary.But there is a distinct and gaping hole in the available classes which is the concept of a nonmagical healer.  Someone who can provide party support without casting spells.  It can be faked by retheming Paladin and turning all your spell slots into smites but tis not great.So I was incredibly excited to open up a Captain class which promises to be a nonmagical support cast!I was however disappointed by what I found.  Your concept and ideas are really great!  Please dont be disheartened from this project because I greatly want to see you take this class and make it something great.However right now your class isnt unique.  If I take your class I am basically just making a hybridized custom PaladinBard that uses Charisma instead of Wisdom.  This class could be so much more imaginative with a little work and I think you are capable of doing it.For some inspirations I encourage looking at LOTROs Captain class and at the Crusader Blade Master and Swordsage from .e and at es Warlord class.Whats most important is that this needs to be a unique standout class where every ability is new and unique and interesting.Copying BardPaladin is okay if you just want something easy.  but if you want this class to be good then you ned to put the effort into coming up with more creative abilities.,UnearthedArcana,d1g5iqj,4,t5_384bx
7061965,0,t3_4ca1e3,Help me Arcana Forge youre my only hope!Im working on a Hexblade fighter subclass. The basis is a Warlockfighter merge using pact magic with a Hexblades Curse ability built off of the Bestow Curse spell. I think is is specifically weaker than the EK or the BM but potentially more interesting and is especially good against enemy spellcasters. Mettle and Entropic Ward are variations on the abilities presented in the . hexblade.The bigger point of contention is how to balance multiclassing with two classes that use Pact magic. I built the Hexblade so that even if you straight up merged the available spell slots youll never end up with more than  and  lower level than normal slots for most of your career if you chose to multiclass warlock.

I am aware that it is not a cleric feature thats why I stole it from fighter.  On a more serious note the whole idea behind the War Domain is that you do actually get more martial training than other cleric archetypes. This Law Domain gets more martial training than other cleric archetypes as well. They dont get as much as a fighter of course which is why they have less superiority dice and their superiority dice start at a lower dicelevel than the fighters do. They also have a limited selection of maneuvers which reflects a more targeted and specific training.    gt Lawful arrest is too powerful as you dont set any conditions for breaking off the restraints.

What I have learned through rigorous number crunching is that Sorceror X  Warlock  Can probably break most damage charts but a level  Bard can take paladin or ranger spells that even those classes dont have access to! Even so it doesnt really matter because the game itself is designed around strong utility roleplay and creativity. Combat stats and numbers are important but this system is so far removed from its predecessors that its easier to identify the weak classes as opposed to the really strong ones. ,UnearthedArcana,d20bsii,1,t5_384bx

7292763,0,t1_d2702jj,A wizard with a huge amount of skeletons is spending long rest spell slots. Hes depleting his capabilities for the day in other areas to buy that value. Warlocks can cast long duration spells like animate dead or hex and quickly recover them with a short rest.I also have to agree with uZwets  large armies of zombies and skeletons under player control will painfully slow gameplay. Also dont underestimate create undead. Cast as an th level spell it produces two wights. Each wight is capable of controlling  zombies created by its Life Drain. A single eighth level casting of animate dead only produces  zombies otherwise  zombies behind the wights total capacity.Its true though mystic arcanum cant be upcast using higher level slots. That would otherwise typically cap it at  ghouls. Perhaps the level  feature could grant create undead as a free mystic arcanum and include the ability to expend a higher level arcanum to power it. gt Favored of Deathgt When you reach th level you learn to call up intelligent undead from Myrkuls court. You may expend a use of Mystic Arcanum to cast create undead at a spell level equal to the level of the arcanum spent. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. ,UnearthedArcana,d274zig,3,t5_384bx

Maybe they also lose the ability to cast and concentrate on spells but gain some other bonus  an extra damage die on melee attacks or something.Why is the Bruxas Eerie scream a cone?  While I agree screams are usually somewhat directional I think most soundbased effects should be a spherical AOE centered on the source.  Also  psychic damage instead of thunder.  Yes.  And maybe a fear effect too.Other than my little nit picks these are really great!

7377388,0,t1_d2fz9mc,gtLike other people Im concerned about the different save DC valueYeah like I said Im on the fence about that but I figure outcry is enough that Ill have to change it.The intent wasnt to avoid MAD though. It was to avoid disencentivizing people taking ki save abilities because theyd likely avoid being MAD themselves if they could.gtAlso something to consider when thinking about this in regards to balance is that you are not gaining one benefit each level but two at every level but . So by level  youve got Ki two Ki abilities bonus proficiencies two Jutsu abilities two Ninja tricks and Deathblow. Comparatively Thieves and Assassins get only  abilities to your .The point of balance for this is the Arcane Trickster being the  caster option which I think this is objectively weaker than.Keep in mind thieves and assassins dont need to spend resources to gain their advantages. Every level after third I made the abilities with cost intentionally so that while this option gains more latitude with its benefits though less than the AT it doesnt get them all the time and it has to manage how it uses them in a way thieves and assassins dont.gtEverything is a weapon You specify that you can wield your unarmed strike as if it were two weapons with the finesse and light properties. In the rest of that paragraph the only thing really necessary is stating that it does d bludgeoning damage as everything else is included as part of the weaponfinesselight labels. True but I felt it needed specifying given the thematic overlap with a monks Martial Arts. Not everyone is going to intuit everything and Im alrightto cover misconceptions where I can.Besides if I didnt put that there Im like  sure someone would comment here saying You know this means you can sneak attack with your hands right? Sometimes its better just to be clear and cover my ass.gtIn addition Im not really seeing the benefit of the improvised weaponry. I get that its characterful but unless the improvised weapon has better damage dice than your fistsexisting weapon or maybe has the thrown characteristic its a lot of fiddling around for something that isnt particularly beneficial.Yeah I feel you but dont know how to make that more desirable while keeping it within the mostlyutility mold. Pretty much the only interesting weapon proxies would be rapier or dagger and its easy enough to carry those around normally.gtHundred FacesImmaculate Footwork Double the Ki cost of Disguise Self and Jump. As it stands at level  a Rogue could cast it on themselves  times a short rest. And it brings it in line with the Ki costs established with elements. I know a lot of people think theyre too expensive but it fits. Not to mention it does slightly limit the extremes capable with a MonkRogue multiclass who using using Step of the Wind and Immaculate Footwork could jump between  times and  times their normal distance.Reasonable can do.gtBonus Proficiencies If the character isnt already proficient in acrobatics I dont see why they should become so now. Theyre already a rogue who has amongst the highest number of skill proficiencies available. If theyre going to become a Ninja chances are they should already be proficient in acrobatics. All this does is discourage players planning on being a Ninja from taking the Acrobatics skill which makes no sense.Right? I dont like that method of skill delivery either but thats e standard. Its supposed to replace the you must be trained in X to take this option stuff of earlier editions but does it in a hamfisted way that disincentivizes learning a skill earlier.I think the way to fix that would be if you already have proficiency in Acrobatics choose instead one other skill from the rogue skill list. gtMastery of Form I have no problem with this. I just way to say I actually think this is a pretty inspired way of representing the archetypical Ninja supernatural capabilities.Thanks. Its spiritual but not overtly supernatural. Thats the niche Im trying to fill best I can.gtSmoke Bomb An AoE blindness is a big deal. A better option may be to say it removes the reaction of all creatures within  feet of you. This makes the smoke bomb a great teambased ability that can make a big difference.Like it. I know how big a deal an AoE blind is what with advantage and all and I figured only one turn of that was probably alright.I like the idea of it eating enemy reactions though. Do you figure it should do that with or without a save? Im leaning towards withsave given that the ability makes you invisible anyhow.gtEyes of the Ghost By this point a Rogue already has Blindsense so Im not sure the  Ki point cost of this is worthwhile.Hurr durr really fair point.Ill knock it down to  Ki points and have it extend the range blindsense as well.gtStep Upon Air The thing I mentioned about stepofthewind and immaculate footwork? Now the Ninja can jump about  to  times their normal distance assuming strength  thats  to  feet long jump and  to  foot high jump. BUT under Jump in the rules pg  it specifies that each foot of distance with jumping costs one foot of movement. So you may need to work out how that interacts.A line stating you may not jump altogether further or higher than you have movement and as normal you may use the Dash action to extend your movement should fix this.gtBasically if I havent mentioned something assume I like it. The idea of giving Rogues a Kiusing archetype is really interesting and provides some fascinating prospects of multiclassing with Monks. And Ive got to say Im kind of proud you avoided the possible lure of giving them darkvision that can see through magical darkness.Darkvision is given out like candy in e anyway and magical darkness is a DMs only defense against that bullshit. Its made me rage enough as a DM that Im not going to throw away my one recourse.And thanks for the indepth look youve really given me a good idea of the nitty gritty of the power level of this archetype. ,UnearthedArcana,d2gra9c,2,t5_384bx

7600806,0,t3_4jdkp6,An interesting idea to use fighter instead of Paladin as expected!    Righteous Strikes The wording here could be simplified  When you use your action to attack a creature with the spellcasting ability you double your damage modifier on a successful hit.    Last Sacrifice I would simplify this greatly. Make it expend your use of Second Wind if its available. While doing the  math is easy keeping it to a known base class ability and expanding on it makes it more fluid.    Cleanse Area What type of action does this require? Is it a reaction action bonus action?  My thought here is to again simplify.  Make it a roll every time even for a first level spell if you are going to have it usable multiple times per long rest.  You can then improve it at  to include your INT mod.    Mental Fortress This is too strong. Pick either force or psychic and reduce advantage to  save not . Way too strong. Charisma would be fine and synergizes with psychic.    Holy Smite Should be long rest IMO and wording  Creatures with the spellcasting ability are at disadvantage on their saving throw.

Id definitely go with the second option.Personally Id actually use the Paladin as your template for classbuilding. Strip the armor instead of smite let them channel the spells into their strikes which will give them burst damage similar to divine smite. Make them a halfcaster going to th level would be nonstandard.

7791922,0,t3_4ltiq2,Just keep in mind that a comment which would mean an analysis takes up more time than being able to vote. With that said here are some thoughts Disciples FormIm not a fan of the  to all other weapons thing. I understand the intent but I think and especially in e vs. something like . or Pathfinder that archetypes taking away power from the base doesnt fit or work very well.In addition and this is something Ive seen before with Kensai brews is that allowing the monk access to any weapon on the list trivializes their Martial Arts features significantly. A monk is balanced to use their monk weapons whose damage scales from d to d. By allowing them to at rd level pick up a Greatsword d and just use that from then on not to mention penalize them for using anything else it completely takes away the point of Martial Arts damage in the first place.Its easy to say well yeah but they could just take a level dip into Fighter or take the Weapon Master feat but I personally feel like an archetype shouldnt take these things into account. As an archetype you should be building only to the base class as both multiclassing and feats are technically optional rules that are not automatically included in all games and so shouldnt be considered aside from balance concerns if those rules are used.All that said giving them a single weapon isnt the end of the world and if thats the feature you want to go for for your Kensai then alright. I would personally probably figure out a way to instead grant a bonus to a weapon which is already a monk weapon instead of adding a new one. I would definitely drop the negatives to other weapons however. Dual WieldinggtWielding two versions of your chosen weapon one in each hand you can make attacks with your chosen weapon in place of the bonus unarmed attacks granted by your Martial Arts or Flurry of Blows class feature. Also you can use your chosen weapon to deflect missiles using your deflect missiles class feature but you cant catch or throw the missile back if you do. You also gain  to AC while dual wielding your chosen weapon.You can already do this making this sentence unnecessary. From Deflect MissilesgtStarting at rd level you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so the damage you take from the attack is reduced by d  your Dexterity modifier  your monk level.If you reduce the damage to  you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.I began to write a paragraph about how the jump in damage due to both the offensive and defensive aspects of this fighting style is too much but looking at it since the new Kensai weapon does not count as a monk weapon as written it doesnt actually work with this fighting style. The Kensai weapon needs to be explicitly listed as a monk weapon for the Kensai in order for this fighting style to actually work. And as is since you must be dualwielding the weapon meaning onehanded at most the jump in damage isnt that outrageous.I do think you should try to offer at least one more fighting style however. Every option besides fighter that gets access to fighting styles so paladin and ranger from memory get a choice out of . Ki WeaponI think this is mostly fine honestly. Considering that at th level the monks unarmed strikes are magic anyway. I feel like the increased crit range is pretty unnecessary I think the rest of the feature stands fine on its own. It detracts from the Champion fighters niche and the player has to remember where that bonus is coming from if they do use all their ki.I do think the favoritism to dual wielding is a problem. While the dual wielding was alright at rd level this is a pretty huge boost for explicitly no extra cost. A  bonus to all attack and damage rolls lasting until I assume the next short or long rest? Its never mentioned how long this actually lasts for potentially the entire day or at least through multiple combat encounters will add up quickly on its own. Put it on two weapons simultaneously and youre literally doubling it for no extra cost. I think that sentence should be omitted. Perfect DefenseI would reword this.gtBeginning at th level when wielding your Kensai weapon you can use your Deflect missiles feature when you are hit by a melee weapon attack. If you reduce the damage to  you can redirect the attack to target another creature within  feet of you. The original attack roll is used against the new target. Perfect FormI also think this one is fine although kind of bland if Im being honest. But I think its a pretty fair investiture of ki to get maximum damage for  round. Although it should probably be reworded togtStarting at th level you can spend  ki points to invest your Kensai weapon with the power of ki. Until the beginning of your next turn all successful attacks you make with your Kensai weapon deal maximum damage. OverallI dont have a lot of attachment to the Kensai archetype which I know is quite popular considering how often we see it surface here. I also dont have a lot of investiture in what a Kensai actually is. I know its a weapon master and while this subclass definitely does a lot to push that I still dont get a clear sense of what a Kensai actually is. That isnt necessarily your fault it may just be a gap in my own background of DnD archetypes. But I do think that this could be expanded a bit to give flavor as well. I understand they use magic to infuse their weapon with power. And if thats all you need then thats fine. But what Im saying is thats the only thing I get out of this. A guy who uses ki to be a better weapon fighter. Okay. That doesnt give a lot of direction on what kind of character a Kensai actually is. It doesnt help that all of the abilities are  combat meaning theres no ribbons at all that can describe what kind of character this is.Again not just saying this to detract. You said youre already using this for a game and thats totally cool if you or a friend is already using this and already have a rich character and you all know exactly whats going on here. Like I said youve put it on other forums and we get Kensais here all the time so maybe its just me. But for me coming into this relatively blind guy who uses ki to be a better weapon fighter doesnt have a lot of flavor to back it up which is a shame because I think that can be pushed into unique directions.,UnearthedArcana,d3rvb9w,2,t5_384bx

7901096,0,t1_d43rcep,gt There would be no reason to take the Dual Wield feat over the Exotic Weapon feat.Except that you can for example dual wield rapiers for a d on each hand. Or two whips if youd like.The dual wield feat gives versatility while the kusarigama feat gives specific expertise. Tactical choice depending on which you would prefer.gtThe offhand attack the way you worded it initially could be done as the primary attack making the bonus attack with the d side since the term offhand doesnt exist in E rules.Im not referring to off hand as a e mechanic. Its not a part of core e.I am referring to offhand as a tangible visible facet of the weapon list here however. The offhand is a specifically listed quantity here not some oblique thing that can be anything and is therefore nothing.gtYoure already making it an objectively superior option by making it cost the same as a dual Rapiers but dropped one damage die two marks to be able to Grapple w Restrain not a free thing that any STR class can use since it requires a feat to Restrain and investment in Athletics to even be likely to pull off or Disarm Battlemaster technique but at reach with the ability to move the item you disarmThe restrain is a fair point. Ill amend that.IIRC the Battlemaster disarm uses class resources to make a disarm as an attack. This uses no resources to disarm as a full action forgoing damage and any other potential attacks. Its a hard comparison to make and extract meaningful balance information from.gtNot to mention that the Double Sword is already equal to two Rapiers which again makes the Exotic Weapon feat a better pick than the Dual Wielding feat.Again specific mastery versus versatility. If you get the feat for the doublebladed sword thats the only weapon you can dual wield while the dual wield feat can have you wield anything any time.gtAs I said at the very least if you choose to continue to approach it your way you need to drop the mainhand damage die to D or drop finesse and you need to remove the Restrained portion of the grapple. Id also consider dropping the pull portion of the Disarm to bring it in line with the free Battlemaster technique youre giving away.Not sure I agree. I mean Im with you about the restrained here but the rest of your argument is significantly sketchier territory. Also Im getting an overall hostile vibe here and Im genuinely unsure as to why. I respect that youre helping with feedback but its likewise my job to weed through feedback to achieve the best possible result rather than taking the feedback wholesale and likely creating more problems than are solved.Especially with this weapons project tempers have ran high from multiple posters. Many people have a specific vision for balance or how a weapon should be represented and many of these visions are angrily contrary to one another.

7981933,0,t1_d4d5mxa,Its not really mixing poisons but combining the herbs and plants to make a poison with multiple effects.  It allows a little more depth to the system without overburdening it and the crafting DC escalates quickly as a measure of balance. Then you have milkweed seeds that act as a stabilizing agent when mixing to reduce the DC.    Gameplay wise it makes finding a few different ingredients fun and gives the player a choice of making individual poisons that while useful are weaker or rolling the dice literally and seeing if they can make something truly special and fun.  It adds a fun push your luck effect to the crafting that would otherwise be rather bland and uninteresting.    Has it allowed the rogue to make something fairly powerful that ruined an entire encounter I spent hours planning? Yup.  But thats the game.  I should have planned better!

8091208,0,t1_d4pi53y,gt You may use your bonus action to command your companion to take the attack dash dodge or disengage actionThe problem with this wording is that it does nothing to stop the companion attacking using its own action and here youd just be enabling it to attack a second time.  gtround down v round upI already feel like using the companion instead of dual wield is a bit of a hard sell. Round up helps this diminished Sneak Attack be less of a waste over the full Sneak Attack dual wield would give in its own small way. Round down is the default assumption in e but there are plenty of places where round up happens when ability modifiers are halved comes to mind. As always specific trumps general which is why I specify here. gtDoes the Companion ALWAYS get sneak or does it only get it if you miss?A rogue can only Sneak Attack once per turn. The text here specifies that you and your companion share in that so only one of you can benefit from Sneak Attack each turn. As your companion functions on your turn youre limited to one Sneak Attack per round aside from those you can get from AoO.gtIf you want to tone it back change feet of movement into advantage on saves to remain standing in bad weatherrough seas while on a shipAnother idea would be a more general advantage on saves versus the prone condition but Im really not sure if thatd be better or worse than a situational  to speed.gtInfamyThe text specifies how often the abilities are used which is CHA mod per day. Its at the bit right after the two options.gtWhen initiative is rolled you may select a number of friendly creatures equal to your charisma modifier that can see you to deal an additional d weapon damage with their first attack each turn.This is a different effect. As its worded now Avast only gives them d damage on their first attack that hits on only the first round of combat. As worded here thisd give d damage on the first attack made on each of their turns for all of combat. gtYou may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier before requiring along rest to use it again.Im not sure the limiter is necessary here. None of the other rogue level s have one and this ability is balanced to deal comparable damage  median.gtI would also consider giving them advantage on the attack instead of d damage shows them fighting harder advantage better. Advantage also makes more sense for spell casters.Eh its hard to balance Advantage versus d damage but Id say d damage is more inline with what other rogue options such as the UA Inquisitive in this instance give you. An aura would be very hard to balance and much more inline with what paladins get than what rogues get. Rogues tend to get oneoff startofcombat oneanddone effects.Well except for the Arcane Trickster. But that archetype is just plain weird. Thanks for the indepth look though!

I think having a DM make Int checks more common and useful is a great way of solving the problem but people should not rely on people in this case. What I mean by that is that a rogue or fighter knows that their Dex andor Con will be helpful to them with absolute certainty but the rogue or fighter have no idea how many times their DM intends on making Int checks. EVen if they talk to their DM they could feel cheated a few sessions down the line when they wish for better con instead. The DM might try hisher best but might not make checks important enough or forget sometimes. The point is that if you are a DM you can always affect the players but a player cannot affect anything not really true but you know what I mean. Having an additional skill is a direct benefit so neither the DM or player have to think about it too much. ,UnearthedArcana,d5ngb3i,1,t5_384bx

While Open Hands level  feature improves Flurry of Blows Way of the Storm improves Step of the Wind. If I were going to play a monk this would be enticing enough to pull me in as long as the th level feature was strong enough.th Level Feature  Gain a swimming speed equal to your movement speed. Gain the ability to breathe underwater. Gain resistance to Lightning and Thunder damage. You gain the ability to commune with the elements. After performing a  minute ritual either an air or water elemental will appear before you. The monk can then ask the elemental for information guidance or assistance of some kind. The elemental will not act hostile towards the monk or his allies but it will not necessarily be friendly. The monk gains advantage on Charisma checks relating to speaking with the elemental if the ritual is performed in an area where the elements have high influence such as on the deck of a ship at sea or outdoors during a thunderstorm. As part of learning this ritual the monk can now speak read and write Primordial.Boons of the Storm When an ally within  feet of you takes Lightning or Thunder damage you can use your reaction to redirect half of that damage to yourself.  When you take Lightning or Thunder damage you can use your reaction to take no damage instead.Call of Thunder  Yeah I have been very happy with this feature from the beginning. Glad you like it too Storms Herald  Yeah there are a lot of passive effects but I wanted to make transforming worthwhile. What if I scrapped the Call Lightning upgrades and just made it this Activates all Boons of the Storm even ones you did not choose Immunity to LightningThunder damage Melee attacks with monk weapons or unarmed strikes become  foot ranged attacksThat means you would go from  passive effects  boons you chose to  passive effects  boons you didnt choose and then the two new ones.

The biggest thing is that if a class relies on Short Rests like the fighter or warlock theyll probably get fewer chances than before to take those short rests.My method for handling this was to create Rest Tokens.Basically Short Rests get changed to being to five minutes enough time to catch your breath after thirty seconds ie five rounds of exercise. During those short rests characters can spend hitdice to recover hitpoints and whatever but they dont recover abilities that recover on a short rest.If they want to get those abilities back they need to spend a Rest Token. Each character gets three rest tokens and they recover all of them after the end of a Long Rest which are still  hours.The main issue with Short Rests is that they broke up the flow of an adventure interrupting the action with an hour of downtime which meant that when you did have the opportunity to rest for an hour you probably had the opportunity to rest for .  They also had assymetrical benefits rogues and wizards dont care much about short rests fighters and warlocks need them to function.This puts the control over their resources in the players hands to manage which Ive found makes players happier and makes the game run smoother.,UnearthedArcana,d5z0mp3,9,t5_384bx
8460230,0,t3_4vj86d,I really like this idea about idle feats. In my game I run short and long rests in accordance with the idea that if you take a really short rest you will have to pay for it later. So for any difference between an hour and the time my PCs short rest they pay double in a long rest. For example if my PCs want to short rest for  mins then the next time they long rest they must do so for  hours because    .

8623500,0,t3_4xofdj,And here we goIt helps that I played a Siren as my first class in Borderlands. Proficiencies Weapons. Borderlands is a kind of game based on gun combat. DnD e is a game based on sword and magic. Do not try to make an absolute direct translation into e e.g. limiting this class to gunlike weaponry. Instead try to capture the spirit of the Siren through e mechanics. There is no reason to believe that in a e setting a Siren would only be proficient in crossbows.Consider granting the Siren the Wizards or the Rogues proficiencies.Equipment Do not grant a hand crossbow as starting equipment. At  gp it is too expensive. No class gets access to a hand crossbow at st level.Phase Strike Several things to consider here. First you are granting an atwill elemental attack at st level that you get to add your modifier to damage to. That is not too big of a deal considering its melee range but its something to keep in mind. Nobody gets to add their modifier to magical damage at st level. The soonest anybody gets to is the Warlock at nd level with the Agonizing Blast invocation  but the Warlock is made special for this. The next soonest is th level Draconic Sorcerer adding mod to a specific damage type. The next after that is th level Cleric adding mod to cantrip damage.Next we see that you can use Dexterity for attacks and damage like a Monk which makes sense for the Siren.What does not make sense is the d damage die. Why is your attack as strong as a longsword from the getgo? Then why would you hit as hard as a greatsword at th level? Consider that the Warlocks Eldritch Blast damage die never increases. Rather the number of attacks the Warlock can make with it increases. But not only does Phase Strike increase in damage you also get Extra Attack. How do you justify getting the best of both worlds?Another aspect to consider is the effect of multiclassing. A Siren Monk X now deals d damage for all of their unarmed strikes. This damage will not be exceeded until the Monk reaches level . Further do not grant feats as class features. This means no getting rid of the loading quality. Lastly do not double mod damage unless youre at a very high level and you carefully control for the number of attacks you can make. Double mod damage only appears twice in all of official material At th level for the Pact of the Blade Warlock and th level for the th level Ranger. While the Ranger capstone may be widely considered one of the lamest capstones of all that does not change the fact that WOTC felt being able to add your wis mod to attack or damage once per turn was something worthy of th level.To conclude you cannot justify a d starting damage die that scales with level alongside Extra Attack plus part of a feat and double mod damage.Recommendation Do not change your unarmed strike damage value. Instead make Phase Strike a specific new Attack Action that uses an unarmed strike. This means that if you were to make a plain old unarmed strike then you would deal the same damage as every else   str mod. But if you use your special Phase Strike then you deal X damage etc.gtAs an attack action you can make a special unarmed strike. You use dexterity for its attack and damage rolls. On a hit you deal d damage of your elemental type. At levels   and  increase the damage dealt by d.Now its like a cantrip. And now we can get rid of the Extra Attack system. Its not as if the Siren is able to attack faster as it improves its psychic powers rather their damage just becomes more powerful.If you want to keep Extra Attack then do not make the damage scale.If we do get rid of Extra Attack then whats left is dealing with ranged weaponry. Obviously we dont want ranged weapon attacks to be a completely useless option. For that we may consider the Clerics th level Divine Strike as a model. For examplegtAt th level you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with planar energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit with a weapon attack you may cause the attack to deal an extra d damage of your elemental type to the target. When you reach th level this increases to d. This feature cannot be applied to your Phase Strike ability.Residual Energy Harmony. Now this is far too easily abused. Carry around a cage full of chickens or a sack full of rats and whenever your party is low on health kill a bunch of the critters for easy healing. If you want to keep this consider Temporary Hitpoints instead that last up to  minutes.Motion. Bonus action dodge huh? Potent but not beyond the scale of expected power. You would be the first to be able to bonus action dodge without consuming a limited resource but the fact that you have to wait until a creature is killed by you may serve as a sufficient limiter. Cataclysm. Needs a range. Nearby is not precise enough.Extra Attack I advise against Extra Attack though it isnt as simple as advising against it. There are many factors much of which I have explained that need reconciling before making any final decisions on the use of Extra Attack.At this point I am starting to express some concern regarding the lack of ExplorationInteraction features. By th level the Monk has Step of the Wind and Unarmored Movement that can be made useful outside of combat. In comparison Phase Strike Residual Energy and Second Phase cannot be used at all outside of combat.That aside if you take my earlier recommendations then Second Phase will no longer function.Multiattack Considering how your damage scales and is also automatically a magical damage type one must seriously consider how granting Multiattack is warranted. This issue should be addressed once Phase Strike is addressed.Gift of the Phoenix A dramatically improved version of the th level draconic sorcerers Dragon Wings. How do you justify an atwill unavoidable infinite version of st level spell Hellish Rebuke alongside an atwill unending fly speed just  level after the draconic sorcerer gets its wings?The reactionless damage sounds more like a once per day  minute duration Paladin capstone feature.PhasewalkThere is no such thing as a move action. Why th level?Do enemies make a saving throw? Why only enemies and not allies as well?How do you justify an AoE nonrestricted version of the Rogues Sneak Attack twice and then eventually four times per short rest?Compare this to the Fighters Action Surge. At rd level the Fighter gets to make  attacks within a round instead of one dealing at most an additional d  mod damage once per short rest.In contrast the Phasewalk Siren will deal d magical damage to every enemy target within a  ft diameter sphere and will get additional movement and will avoid opportunity attacks and pass through enemy spaces. At th level the Fighter will make  attacks within a round instead of  dealing at most  x d  mod  d  mod once per short rest.In contrast the Phasewalk Siren will deal d magical damage to every enemy target within a  ft diameter sphere  movement  opportunity attacks  pass enemy spaces and will deal up to an additional d damage to any target the Siren passes through during their movement three times per short rest.Inner Glow Why that odd multiplication and not just your Siren level?Interesting. This Siren seems to be a cross between the Monk and the Sorcerer. Monk features Sorcerer features Sorcerer subclass progression that one Ranger feature for some reason. Except theres an additional subclass feature at th. Radiance So you are going to stack damage on top of damage? What about this class feels lacking in the damage department enough that warrants a further increase to damage?Silent Resolve Functional though now I am considerably concerned at the dramatic lack of noncombat features by this point. Even the OpenHand Monk has at least by this point Tranquility.Dramatic Entrance This would make a nice capstone if not for all of the earlier combatoriented damage boosting features. Once those are better managed this becomes viable.PhaselockSo a ranged  ft diameter AoE magically damaging no saving throw Sneak Attack twice per short rest at rd level. Plus an unavoidable stunning effect. How do you justify  A  ft range  an AoE magical Sneak attack  no saving throw to avoid the damage  more frequent uses than the Fighters Action Surge and  an autostunning effect can potentially last longer than the Monks th level Stunning Strike?Converge And now we are increasing the number of potential targets?SubSequence Defeated has no mechanical term in e. Immediate Reaction is a e term. Phaselock is an AoE that has no specific target but rather effects an area so how do you acquire a new target?What about this class seems lacking in damage that you feel that adding a target to damage is warranted?Thoughtlock So if they succeed they suffer all of the AoE Sneak attack and if they fail they get dominated meaning no matter what you win? And then on top of being dominated once the domination ends you do the AoE Sneak Attack anyways?And you do this  to  times per short rest? Consider that Dominate Monster is an th level spell.Ruin The last thing this subclass needs is more damage.Conclusions Too much damage not enough personality. Borderlands is an allcombat game with no roleplay whatsoever. DnD is cooperative real time rpg built on the three pillars Combat Exploration and Interaction. Draw more consideration for the other two pillars for the next iteration of the Siren. And do not grant an AoE Sneak Attack used more times than Action Surge.,UnearthedArcana,d6jjf9w,1,t5_384bx

8829351,0,t3_5122me,There are some spelling errors just thought i should mention that before going giving feedbackBangle of the Frega RuneMaster of Blades Simple Property While you are attuned to this rune you have advantage on attacks that deal slashing damage. I would change this to Proficency in all slashing weapons or do additional d slashing when you attack once per turn. The profiecency for characters who dont have access to martial weaponsbecause simple weapons only have  slashing weapons like wizards bards some clerics sorcerers warlocks most of the casters who would benifit from runescribing the most and because having advantage on all attacks that do slashing is more of a complex property and is a bit unbalanced for anyone dual wielding slashing weapons and anyone who has extra attacks.Sliver of the Delmek RuneCritial weaknesssimple property As an action and as part of a melee attack you scribe this rune usingyou left this blank onto a creature within your reach as you expend a spell slot. If the attack is successful the rune takes effect highlighting a vital area of the creature with the rune. The creature is now vulnerable to piercing damage. The creature can take an action to cover the rune. The creature is only vulnerable to piercing damage as long as the rune is visable and can be realistically attacked.You should add a duration and it seems more like a complex property then a simple as your imposing x damage from piercing attacks Id keep the effect but id change it to something like As an action and as part of a melee attack you scribe this rune using whatever you were gonna put there onto the targeted creature. If the attack is successful the rune takes effect highlighting a vital area of the creature with the rune. The next attack that does piercing damage has advantage on the attack roll. Although if you wanted to keep the bonus damage make it do an additional d piercing damage.Impaling Strike Simple Property While attuned to this rune your critical strikes with piercing weapons impale your target treat the target as restrained it also gets moved to the end of your reach. While you have a target impaled you must spend your turn maintaining a hold on them or they will escape a successful Strength or Dexterity saving throw DC  will also allow them to escape though only on their next turn. You can use a bonus action to wrench your weapon out of the target dealing d piercing damage and removing the impaled condition from them. when you say gets moved to the end of your reach to you mean it gets pushed back by the range of my weapon? like if i have a rapier and use this effect he would get pushed out of melee range? other then that thats actually a pretty cool ability.Strike True Complex Property As an action you scribe this rune onto a weapon that deals piercing damage while spending a spell slot. The rune lasts until used or this property is used again. The rune can be activated with a predetermined key word and when it is activated it grants a  bonus to attack rolls until a successful hit is landed though no damage needs to be done. Cannot be applied to ammunition.Id lower that. alot. like  guarantees a hit no mater what like the war clerics channel divinity does  and  that pretty much guarantees a hit with a god guiding your weapon. Id change it to  and an additional d piercing . The  as its still an accurate attack but its being guided by magic and not a god so your not always gonna hit your mark. and the d to make it appeal more for use as  Far reach makes your weapon a magic weapon for  but does no additional damage.Aegis of the Tsaro RuneSturdy Composition Simple Property This one is okay but id consider changing it to proficency in shields if you dont have it already. Because most people who would go into rune scribing are casters and most casters dont have profiecency with shields. although i imagine a fighter would get some more out of this it would make it almost unappealing  to most runescribes.Id change Superior cover to You set into a defensive stance while in this stance you cant attack or move but gain the effects of being behind half cover. Because with the shield you get  and an additional  the half cover and a  from the AC bonus from sturdy composition is  to AC fighters enjoy drowning in their armor so as a simple property your giving them  with their heavy armor turning them into a tank.  ALSO YOU PASSED UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME CAPTAIN AMERICA WITH A BOOMERANG SHIELD. YOU BLEW IT!Badge of the Tezlik RuneSpider Acrobatics Simple Property While attuned to this rune you gain a climbing speed equal to half your base walking speed but you need to always have at least  limbs touching the surface you are climbing. Your climbing swimming and crawling speed are always equal to youre base walking speed. Maybe Make it equal your whole walking speed instead.Evasive Maneuvers Complex Property While you are attuned to this rune you gain the Evasion trait from the rogue class except you still take full damage from a failed save. Id give rogues who multiclass as a runescribe advantage when using evasion if they get this rune.Hasted Movement Complex Property Over the course of a short rest you inscribe this rune onto the soles of a pair of shoes. While wearing these shoes a creature gains a  bonus to their movement speed.In addition you can expend a spell slot to grant the shoes an additional movement speed bonus equal to the spell slots level divided by two.This effect lasts for  hours or until you use this property again.What if you dont wear shoes. and because you usually move in s id change the speed to equal spell slots level divided by two times . so a a level  spell slot rounded down would be   which is . Bowl of the Asam RuneMetals Bane Simple Property As an action you scribe the asam rune using acid onto unprotected and nonmagical metal. The metal immediately dissolves. Dissolving the object in question makes them fall to pieces and rust becoming useless and worthless. You can dissolve up to  square feet of metal with this effect. You can extend this distance by expending a spell slot when using the asam rune in this manner. For each level of the expended spell slot the distance increases by  square feet. If this metal is being worn or wielded by a creature or is sentient that creature makes a Dexterity saving throw DC   the level of any expended spell slots.If a creatures metal stuff is being dissolved i wouldnt make it immediate. Id have it go by round to make it fair. so on the start of their next turn they get a  to what ever you touch. and sentient weapons are magical so they cant be dissolved.Souse Simple Property As an action you scribe the Asam rune using action onto any rusted or corroded surface. The material becomes pristine and is restored to its uncorroded state. You can affect up to  square feet of material with this effect. You can extend this distance by expending a spell slot when using the Asam rune in this manner. For each level of the expended spell slot the distance increases by  square feet. This restoration does not restore any magical properties the object lost as a result of rusting or corroding.Would this be able to fix damage done by metals bane?Disintegration Glyph Complex Property To long not gonna type.Great for ambushing could do a bit more in damage maybe d as witching bolt a level  spell does d. Vial of the Velenu rune.Pretty much nothing wrong imoEffigy of the Mort RuneCircle of Life Simple Property As an action you carve this rune into a corpse that has been dead for at least a month. Immediately the corpse deteriorates if it is on dirt or around plant life it fertilizes the area and the plants immediately seem more vibrant and full of life. If there is nothing around to absorb the nutrients from the corpse then your effigy absorbs what remains of the deteriorated body.Nothing wrong with this but because you dont need the effigy to attune to the rune and because you never even need to find the rune to attune to itRunicDiscovery id just say the body turns into dust. Marked for Death Complex PropertyId up the additional necrotic damage to d. as a warlock gets hex which does d necrotic when you do any form of damage to them.Id also remove the necrotic damage for the additional temp hp and make it so you get it whenever the target gets hit from anything and change it to teh d necrotic damage  it took plus half your player level.Healing Touch Simple Property As an action you scribe the cura rune using holy water onto a creature that has  hitpoints but is still alive. If the creature is not of an evil alignment it is immediately stabilized.So spare the dying? id change this to they are stabilized and are healed by drunescribes INT when they pass all their death saves.past that i have no complaints.,UnearthedArcana,d795xwk,3,t5_384bx

8866644,0,t1_d7di0ts,I think its weirder to have useless actions. The real wyvern is actually a great example of a monster with three different options where it would use them all. On the ground it bites and stings. In the air it can use its more powerful claws instead of its bite. This encourages it to be in the air.Heres how I would do the young wyvern based on your great startYour young wyvern is balanced around an attack that does  piercing and  poison so  damage a round. Lets try to give the young wyvern the same multiattack since its neat and move things around so that we do the same damage.gt Multiattack. The young wyvern makes two attacks one with its bite and one with its stinger. While flying it can use its claws in place of one other attack. gt Bite. Melee Weapon Attack  to hit reach ft.one target. Hit  d   piercing damage.gt Claw. Melee Weapon Attack  to hit reach ft.one target. Hit  d   slashing damage.gt Stinger. Melee Weapon Attack  to hit reach  ft. one creature. Hit  d   piercing damage. The target must make a DC  Constitution saving throw taking  d poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.It makes sense that a younger wyvern has less strong poison right? Now our young wyvern does  damage per turn which is still  damage a round. Also all of its actions are useful and it has an interesting multiattack. ,UnearthedArcana,d7dn9wb,3,t5_384bx

8906450,0,t1_d7dkrfb,Thats still pretty overpowered. Theyre only giving up an attack if they are otherwise using the bonus action for attacks which they wouldnt be if they are picking a class with this ability. And I assume you meant they activate the jump with a reaction  not a bonus action because otherwise they would literally be unable to ever jump. Plus once they use the reaction to dodge the first attack they cant get attacked by anything until theyve landed. And giving up a reaction isnt as much a tradeoff because the likelihood of triggering an oa is lower than the likelihood of getting attacked and once you avoid your damage you get extra damage added to your next attack on your turn versus any enemy near you that you no longer have to worry about terrain or obstacles to reach so really the tradeoff you claim is exaggerated ,UnearthedArcana,d7ifcx0,1,t5_384bx
8923309,0,t3_51wigx,I noticed that the th level ability was  ki points. This seems a little...unattractive since other monastic orderss th level abilities only cost  ki points. Might it be worth lowering the cost? The damage also seems a little low since the Quivering Palm ability just strait up kills someone if they cant survive the throw. Id recommend doing something similar so that this ability seems worth it compared to others.Lastly it might be worth making a rd level ability that allows your fire to ignore fire resistance since many things have resistance to fire damage.

8957396,0,t1_d7noujx,I understand your perspective but mine is actually the opposite  I think that almost entirely certain but with a minute chance of failure rolls are trivial. To me asking a th level Ranger to roll to track say the horde of Urukhai carrying a pair of Hobbits is on about the same level as asking the th level Barbarian to make a strength check to open a jar with a really tight lid. If the result of a failed roll is the player making the same roll again with no dramatic consequence there shouldnt be a roll there. And as uboktebokte said it shouldnt be an issue with the powerlevel of the ability because any attempt by the trackee to move stealthily will result in a contested roll. I can see that this might be a case of our DM sensibilities not aligning though. ,UnearthedArcana,d7ojmk2,1,t5_384bx

8996837,0,t3_53frhx,The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more? Now then this is a super weird mishmash of abilities.  Stardust doesnt seem super op to me just a little confusingly worded. Im still not positive if the restriction based on ongoing hazards applies to the whole ability or just the selfstunparalyzed removal. Maybe thats just me though. the rise straight up thing. I mean...I guess I just dont get why. You can see over some cover I guess? But it makes you super exposed in combat to ranged attacks. I dunno maybe theres some possible synergy Im missing. Also three stars to use it again seems cheap for an ability normally used once per rest since  even by level  you can have  stars with  charisma. I forgot about the first ability so Ill put that here. So proficiency with shields I would rather see as a new invocation just because it seems super random for part of your first ability. The fistful of night thing I dont really get. If you dont already have dark vision you are forced into taking the devils sight invocation to be able to use it before level  without basically blinding yourself. But it also doesnt seem to provide any actual tangible benefit other than laying out the stars thing used for your other abilities. I would like to hear your thought process behind this maybe Im just not getting some part of it. Firstly not calling it grossly incandescent is a missed opportunity. Then again if you didnt play dark souls then all is forgiven. OK so the ability is you can create light sources that work in your fistful of night thing while also getting immunity to blind and resistance to radiant damage. Seems underwhelming for a level  feature  but I dont see anything wrong with it mechanically. I cant figure out from the language if you need to touch them as in touch attack or if thats just flavor and it is of an unspecified range. Ill assume its touch as in physical contact. I think my confusion stems from the fact that despite being called fistful of night that ability doesnt say anything about your hands or touch at all even just flavor text.  So then they make a dexterity save or become charmed which is weird and not really the right save for a charm effect. Then theres a wisdom save or paralysis for a number of hours but they are immune to damage in the meantime. So the second effect essentially cancels out the first one which is odd. The  you can spend stars to force failed saves which I dont like at all. How does that interact with legendary resistance that some monsters have? I guess thats up to DM i just dont like effects with no possible save. I mean  stars is a lot sure but I still dont like it.Those are my thoughts I apologize if I am not clear on any points or if I misunderstood anything you wrote I would be happy to be corrected if I made any objectively wrong remarks. My conclusion such as it is is that you seem to have a picture in your head of what you want this to look like but the actual mechanics are very disjointed and lack context as to their origin or purpose. I hope this feedback was helpful.,UnearthedArcana,d7ta3rs,2,t5_384bx

9021385,0,t3_535ot0,I actually really like this class I think its a great alternative to the Fighter for players looking for a more indepth approach to combat.  Instead of raw scaling it requires the use of everything at your disposal multiple abilities bonus actions and reactions to excel.Refined Reflexes is a great ability and I really like it as an alternative to extra attacks but I have a few concerns.  First it says when weapon damage is dealt against a creature  which makes it a little unclear about whether or not you can use it when you hit the creature yourself.   Secondly it might be a little strong to allow the samurai to use it as a reaction ontop of the free use at level .  Id say keep the free use and move the second use as a reaction to a later ability.Similarly the Sword Discipline and especially Iai seems very potent but I really do like it.  At level  it allows you to make a third attack which might be a little too strong.  Shiranui also might be a little too good its basically a poor mans Advantage but getting it for free with unlimited uses makes it dangerous.What I find really interesting about this class is how it strong it can be in the right circumstances compared to how weak it could be in the wrong situation.  This also makes it tough to balance.,UnearthedArcana,d7w89ds,1,t5_384bx

9107623,0,t1_d86kuff,MinotaurThe wording I put and the minotaur has makes it a melee weapon so it can have properties of melee weapons like finesse. I think the reason monks do not make their fists finesse is because it adds a property to a weapon that already has a statline. It would be like a battleaxe being finesse in your hands. It is not finesse even if you are using dexterity because no normal battleaxe is finesseable. But a new weapon let us call it a floppyaxe could have the finesse property.,UnearthedArcana,d86l8w2,2,t5_384bx
9113041,0,t1_d877t8q,Using disjunction from this affects every single magical effect or magical item within range. So if your buddy is holding a stored spell  feet away that one is fine. But all the ones on you? Dispelled. Not rendered useless those items still exist to have spells stored in them again later. Only the item in which the dispel magic spell was stored is rendered actually broken.  For wording Im going to change it to be break it over your knee so people know that it is something you have to be holding the item to use which then further requires that you be within the area of effect.    So basically the final wording will include these points     You must break an item which has the dispel magic spell stored in it currently. You must be wieldingwearing this item when you break it Im not sure if theres rules for drawing rods and such but if so then you must have it drawn.     You physically break the object if this would normally be difficult or impossible the destructive magic unleashed casuses it to shatter. So if its an iron rod you bring it down on your knee and it snaps from the massive outburst of magic.     Any magical items or effects within the area of effect are subjected to the effects of the spell except for Artifacts. This includes any magical items on your person.     If any of your stored spells are within the area of effect these items are dispelled but you may reuse the item to store spells in later.     Any items created by your Quickened Artifice feature are considered to be items with limited uses even if the item is normally permanent. Since all Quickened Artifice items fade after  days they should be weak enough to be permanently dispelled by this.    So now I just have to say all of that in a concise and understandable fashion. But I am quite satisfied with it I like the feeling and I think its pretty balanced. Balancedish.  Who am I kidding disjunction still terrifies me. But I love having it in the game because its just such a cool effect... So this is good and Im content with it.

Another option I thought about would be to add their Charisma mod to their base AC instead to simply make it a stronger investment but that might become silly if one chose to ignore CON. I think it still works as is even if it only gives a minor buff to AC.I dont know why I threw in a level  feature not sure why I thought they had one lol. I cut it.The Swashbuckler was actually partially my inspiration for this but I didnt want to just copy and paste their ability I wanted it to have a unique feel.

9187748,0,t3_565ul7,Well if you want people to be brutal with the feedback here goes.I would not allow this in my game at all as it breaks most all the things that E brings in.So full spell casters particularly of the arcane variety tend NOT to have additional abilities in high quantity. You have pretty much something happening every level from st thru th. Way too much power. And over all you have this casting class gaining something every level. Look at other casting classes for balance ideas NO other full casting class gains something every level. The closest is a Bard but they are handicapped by their spell selection.I number places you have  to this and a  to that which is something E tends to avoid alot. One of the best things about E is the reduction in the math follow that trend.Copy like abilities. You for example you have Rebuke undead. Rebuking is not a thing in E so you are using language that is confusing and has no standard. I would change this to the cleric turn undead ability.At th level you have given th level spell like ability that is in fact better than the spell. Based on your wording it takes a bonus action rather than an action and there is only one save rather than three. This is so completely overpowered at that level range. You have completely new spell progression. One that is in fact more powerful than any other casting class in the game. Again way over powered. In E there are  spell progressions and only three. Full caster half caster and third caster. Drop it down to the same as all other full casters.There is no negative energy in E it is necrotic. And undead are no longer healed by necrotic.Lich body is even more powerful than the resistances that Liches have. As magical weapons will not bypass that resistance. Also damage reduction is not a thing in E there is only one feat in the game that reduces incoming damage. I would not give damage reduction to a class.Negative Energy Resistance. All the things you are giving advantage to saving throws on dont have saving throws in the first place so this ability does nothing to the class.Fortification is no longer a thing in E.Craft Wonderous Items is not a feat in E.Creating a class that allows someone to become a lich seems to make the gateway to becoming a lich so much easier than it should be. Also of course the wantabee lich is going to have to spend a ton of gold in research and crafting to create a phylactery. Saying they does have to spend any to create it seems ridiculous to me.Overall what this looks like is that you are trying to turn E into .E. You will break the game doing that and the game will not be challenging at all. In that way I would think you would not have any fun with it.I am not sure what to offer for constructive feedback as the way I see this it is so broken and I am not exactly sure what it is that you are trying to accomplish. Is it just a want to create a player that becomes a lich and mimics a lich? That is the way that this comes across.,UnearthedArcana,d8gm4l2,3,t5_384bx

Thats not really needed I can easily see necromantic magic as having a severe effect on a creature of light.Keep Immortal Origin. My reasoning there was to make the deva vulnerable to a banishment spell or a hallowsanctuary spell as they still have the soul of a celestial.Remove Astral Majesty.If you scroll down Ive discussed some fixes to Reincarnate.

Maybe shifting the focus more towards how common creatures evolve and adapt to harsh environments like the desert and tundras of the world.And as for it melding the two official circles together and it therefore being stronger you might be right but then again it is also worse than both of them at what they do best.

So when you bring that up it leads to ideas like sucking magical items dry. Or absorbing spell energy. Which becomes very overpowered in game terms. Its probably better if you reflavor the magic addiction into some kind of radiation totally distinct and separate from regular magical energy.

Plating is more likely to be resistant to slashing if you had to pick one but likely to all conventional weapons. Siege weapons on the other hand...Oh and wood is not resistant to lightning.

You could probably remove the level scaling from harmony so you dont end up with the job of party healer while your cleric goes on unemployment. Youd get  healing per ki which is still a lot.  While Ki is valuable that ratio of reward is what concerns me  Ki will never do half as much damage as it could do if used it for healing. My concern right now is that the party might be better off if you saved you Ki for harmonydiscord instead of your other abilities. With OoD do you mean it would cost Ki per attack? If so thats probably too far.  You could just reduce the number of orbs you have so the average Ki cost goes up without making it not worth the investment.,UnearthedArcana,d9qremt,2,t5_384bx
9558604,0,t3_5bq6kt,Hi heres my feedbackTbh I dont really like this archetype from a flavor pointofview. Im not entirely sure what is supposed to separate these wizards from any other kind of wizard. You could work to give this arcane tradition a more interesting description and reason for existing. For example an arcane tradition that focuses on tattooes. Branded with Eldritch Knowledge So I cannot read this feature without wondering how much room for spells there is on your body. Of course you can handwave the problem away with magic but I think a more interesting route would be that the limited number of spells tattooed of your body receive some kind of benefit. Inscribed with Cosmic Might Im not much of a fan of the two free cantrips from any spell list though its not inherently unbalanced. Just be prepared for a single character with minor illusion guidance and shillelagh. Infused Power I think this should be reworded to make it similar to the monks Unarmored Defense. As it is this can be stacked with either armor or mage armor. Between this and the free shillelagh cantrip this is shaping to be more of a combatfocused wizard than some kind of master of magic. Intrepid Power Immortality is just a ribbon while  extra prepared spells is nice but it isnt exactly exciting. This is pretty underwhelming. Inherent Power  minutelong long rests? No just no.,UnearthedArcana,d9ralqp,1,t5_384bx

I dont think it applies only to weapons with finesse  unless Im mistaken that might be a rd edition rule that no longer applies.One suggestion Id have is to consider replacing one of the archetype bonuses perhaps an earlier level one with something that isnt a bonus to the classs combat abilities. Even though the focus of the Dragoon appears to be battlefield combat certainly not everything they do relates to that. Maybe something like double proficiency bonus on Animal Handling checks combined with something else that suits their general role as an irregular but doesnt necessarily translate into a more effective fighter?

Even if the condition is met you essentially gain one half of a damage die in damage compared to average dice rolls. ,UnearthedArcana,dab2gxc,1,t5_384bx

Condition Immunities should be listed after Damage Resistances Does not in Languages should be doesnt Day in Legendary Resistance should be capitalized You should just call him Nicholas throughout the statblock In your post you call him guy and use male pronouns. You should do so in his statblock as well Consider formatting his stages like a beholders Eye Rays or an androsphinxs Roar While in a high stage does he benefit from the other lower stages the way exhaustion works? If not can you explain to me your reasoning for why he unlocks and loses certain features based on his health? In all stages the Only should be capitalized In Greataxe add a space before ft and a colon after Hit In Watchful and Chilly spells should be italicized and lowercase. Also before DC add save I know its tedious but if you want to stay true to official formatting you need to describe legendary actions here.

9809261,0,t1_dalzcb4,No because you have to select a different target and both rolls are still susceptible to gaining advantage or disadvantage. You also have statistically less of a chance to critical on either attack.Unless you would consider a cantrip like Acid Splash to give free advantage because it targets two creatures. I wouldnt but in that sense that there are two dice involved.,UnearthedArcana,dam79m6,1,t5_384bx

9909557,0,t3_5ha5io,I understand you want to bring out the feel of a class from Final Fantasy but I dont think its translated quite well here. I hope you keep working on this. There is lots of promise and its very clear you put a lot of thought into this! Now for the critThis class doesnt compare by firepowerIn comparison to a full caster the functionality of this caster is severely limited. At most they have access to  spells for most of their levels followed by  once they get to  but only for one minute. These spells are also very limited they cant pick and choose which ones they have they are being stuck with a theme. Clerics get certain spells memorised for free AND get to pick from lists which they want per day. Wizards still have a large pool they can memorise and can learn many more spells over their lifetime than  of Clerics get access to. Sorcerors have a restricted list but get more spells to cast per day get free memorised spells per their Origin and get their Metamagic abilities. This class doesnt majorly do something different to other classesAt its heart the Arcanist doesnt do much different. Yes they can switch sets of  spells in and out at long rests a severely limiting process short rest might be better and combines some Sorcerer and Cleric spell lists but it is limited to th level spells and feels very flavourless. Wizards have their Schools each ability from those Schools are different and develop to make dependable tools. And they are useful from the moment you get them. A level  Diviners Portent ability is fantastic because you get  d rolls you can replace at any time without using your reaction for any kind of roll. Yes you have to see what going on but it is very useful and very much feels like something someone who could see into the future would be able to do.What does a level  Arcanist have? Miasma? Its barely balanced enough to count as a cantrip. Poison Spray would be a better bet in the long run.Sorcerors have Metamagic. Clerics have Channel Divinity. Druids have Wildshape. Barbarians have Rage.  All of these classes have their special powers developed by their specialisations. Arcanists however dont have much going for them. Too many abilities that focus on combatEverything the Arcanist does is draw in more spell points spit out more damage summon another spelllist increasing creature. They occasionally get a specific spell for free a note your language is vague as to what level slot these spells are cast at especially as some of them are above th level the maximum your Arcanist can reach. Even if this was a class devoted to being a tempest of destruction the abilities are very weak. Miasma and Bio only chip away at a creatures health dealing poison damage sucking up Aetherpoints equivalent to high spell levels and at the cost of even more points being minorly inconvenient such as affecting a few more creatures or stopping them from being healed for a short time.For example Bio is a terrible trade. For the equivalent of a rd level spell you can possibly hit a creature deal da bit necrotic damage and blind them for less than half a minute. Or you could cast a Fireball and deal d fire damage and affect every single creature in the radius. For the action economy a th level fighter could possibly hit a creature twice and deal more damage even using a ranged a weapon. Thats not even throwing manoeuvres in there. As a final point here for a class that focuses on summoning creatures from an endless source of power they sure do spend a lot of time handling diseases and poison. These abilities feel entirely unrelated to the flavour of this class and arent very helpful. I think you got too carried away directly transferring this Final Fantasy class into DampD and missed the spirit of what it was. Final thoughtsFrom the first few paragraphs and your description of the Aether this is much better suited as a plain Sorcerous Origin. Drop the Miasma and Bio and other useless fluff and focus on making swappable small spell lists these summons the sorcerer could access. I would avoid any healing spells because that would be too powerful the Bard fulfils that need. My advice would be to have a small list of the Summons and let the Sorceror choose a few throughout their level up. Stick to the single spell lists that the Sorceror already has. When developing new abilities make sure they are simple. Maybe try to avoid combat abilities because the Sorceror is already a powerhouse. edit formatting,UnearthedArcana,daz8ln7,4,t5_384bx

Red spell shouldnt be italicizedI like Shared Initiative but most of its already that way Page  of the PHB says gtThe DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures so each member of the group acts at the same time.

Like you select one thing to become proficient with at level  two things at level  or  and three things at a higher level.

10200281,0,t3_5m0d8f,I like it but radiant aura seems a little too powerful and other places needs some tweaking to be balanced and useful. These are points to consider Auras are a paladin class feature. Perhaps call it something other than aura since it doesnt work like an aura.   ki points should resemble a nd level spell. This is way more powerful. More like an th level spell. gt Ki points have some subtle guidelines in how they are expended features that cost  ki point usually focus on utility or are the equivalent of a single unarmed strike. Features that cost  ki points should be on par with a stlevel spell while a feature that costs  ki points should be on par with a ndlevel spell. Examine the elemental disciplines of the Way of the Four Elements monk for further examples of how to match ki points to spell levels. from  Blinding Smite Why would you blind instead of using stunning strike to stun an enemy? Sometimes perhaps but it doesnt seem adverse enough against what the base class can already do. Tweak it a bit perhaps? Call the Sunrise Using an action to give someone temporary hit points is kinda weird IMO. Id rather nerf the hit points and make it a bonus action. Monks almost always use their action to attack and would rarely use it to give a few temporary hit points instead. The second part of Brightstrike can become really abusable. Perhaps give creatures that have been affected by it have advantage against it? ,UnearthedArcana,dc09btw,2,t5_384bx

Are these based off the original tables or did you make them up yourself? I feel as though theres too good a chance for some of these. Maintaining the d I might change it to something likeCritical Hit Max damage nothing more.

10330887,0,t1_dce9iu2,I thought Id post here because I have thoughts on the above. My only additional suggestion would be to remove the bullet point under Midnights Chosen saying that Armor of any kind no longer imposes penalties on DexterityStealth checks. Giving advantage on DexterityStealth checks the second bullet point already essentially does this. Of course there are very corner cases where removing disadvantage is not the same as adding advantage but I think it would still benefit the ability to be simpler.gt Its a hard predicament. I dont want to do halfdamage because that doesnt seem right but I also dont want to have a fulldamage radiant smite if youre a paladin of darkness.Why dont you just keep the damage type as Radiant but write a little flavor text box saying that your smite now resembles grasping shadows instead? Now we have Radiant darkness and we have a nice progression from glorious radiance to glowing shadows.gt Umbral JauntI would just give resistance to the damage instead of negating twice Charisma modifier.

10378095,0,t1_dckcedn,Expanded Spell ListVery good to know about the elementals! I had difficulty finding what to add there short of creating extended spell lists for every primordial source which I did and did not like. I also did feel some were weak but couldnt figure out how to balance them as I still dont have a good understanding of most spells idiosyncracies and combo potentials. I could design new spells like I did the cantrips to compensate but that may be excessive in the end hmm...Primordial PanoplyYeah the thought definitely crossed my mind when designing this. Still going by schools of magic rather than raw element went against the grain of the Primordial flavor so I thought working through the pain would be worth it in the end. If I had to make a ruling here itd likely be that anything the DM rules thematically appropriate enough will do. Alternatively I could have all warlock spells have interchangeable source damage but then wed end up with all Dawn Titan Warlocks using the same optimized kit. TBD!Soma of the TitanI intentionally lowered its effectiveness since I was afraid the rest of the patron features were too strong but it seems I may have been wrong! I could have them choose a second Primordial source purely for the purpose of resistance? Confirm Phlogiston FuryI also calculated the damage and compared it specifically to Hurl Through Hell haha! My initial reasoning was that CPF has  ft range and a ft radius so anything within a  foot cube will get carpet bombed. I wanted it to deal less than HTH because its intended to hit groups of  enemies which then blows HTH out of the park since its single target though it does get a mook out of a fight for  turn. Moreover I wanted less variance so that though other options can deal much more damage with luck CPF would deal more consistent and dependable medium damage. If this is still too little damage though I can definitely increase it I just did not initially feel it was the weaker of the two!Also its a science pun haha. Its wordplay on Confirm Phlogiston Theory a theory which was famously disproved by Lavoisier. Phlogiston thus gets its revenge in DampD hence confirming its fury rather than its theory. Thank you so very much! This was invaluable help and Ill be able to tweak this a lot more I thought!

10407383,0,t3_5oxak7,I like it on the whole. Let me first say I love your work and Im only making a comment in the first place because I think you amp your crew make great work. I have two specific critiques that dont have too much weight on them. Multiple features that add static passive bonuses to damage are the kind of thing e avoids. Its just... awkward bookkeeping at that point. Also theyre both named  Assault which is weird in a set of  combined with the fact that they both do the same thing.. For a class based on intelligence it appears to play a bit on the simple side. Its basically a Lore Bard comparing Sage Advice to Inspiration Dice is fair with a static Int to baseline combat stats instead of access to Spells. It has utility out of combat but all of the effects I see are fairly close to spells that a Lore bard can take. Id consider some kind of resourcegated pool of maneuvers like KiSuperiority Dice with an emphasis on teamwork amp elaborate conditions. Maybe Commands? ,UnearthedArcana,dcnqtfo,1,t5_384bx
10416384,0,t1_dcor6nf,All other classes cap at . Keep it there as WOTC have put th edition is about making heroes not demigods. Furthermore most players dont make it into rd and th tier play. level  characters are by far more common and those levels deserve more focus than the later ones.As for level  the ability to concentrate on two spells at once is neat though I think for a th level ability it should be a little simpler and less restrictive as to its useE.G You can maintain two concentration spells or effects at once so long as at least one of the spells is below a rd level slot. When you roll to maintain concentration you roll separately for both spells.The wording of this ability means you could also Hold a spell as your action while concentrating on something as holding your action to cast a spell requires your concentration.,UnearthedArcana,dcork2e,6,t5_384bx
10430826,0,t3_5p8dwq,Murphys Protective ShellI really like this in concept a Shield for saving throws rather than attacks. You could have this spell be triggered by all saving throws rather than just spells currently it protects you from a magical area of effect attack  like a Fireball spell  but doesnt protect you from exactly the same effect if the source is mundane  like a barrel of gunpowder exploding for example. This would also mean it works against nonspell magical effects That makes this a lot more competitive with Shield as well. Currently Shield is a pretty good spell to take all the time because you can count on being attacked and it works against magical and weapon melee and ranged attacks. This spell is only worth learning or preparing if you know youre going to be up against lots of spell casters who use spells with saving throws. I understand that these spells are meant to be anticaster but I think making it work against all saving throws makes it a lot less narrow and a much more competitive with Shield and Absorb Elements.For the other spells I think uMrDaves changes are great suggestion. Especially the th and th level spells. The only other thing I would change is the thunder damage to psychic damage firstly it seems that attacking a spellcasters ability to cast spells would be a psychic attack and secondarily and to a minor point it means they have less synergy with Tempest domain clerics.,UnearthedArcana,dcqej0b,1,t5_384bx

10469033,0,t1_dcu40tk,Glad to be of help. I think cold resistance would I shore up the Northborn nicely without pushing them into being overpowered.  For Squad Tactics twice per short rest seems okay to me. I prefer to avoid scaling abilities when I can but that may just be me.A nd level spell is stronger but Augury is kind of a niche non combat spell so I dont think is that much more powerful. The cool thing about Augury is that if you look at the end of the spell each additional time you cast it there is an increasing chance of getting false information. If you move it to a short rest you give the player an interesting choice to make about whether or not to risk using the spell again without dramatically increasing the races power. For Blood Thirst I would probably play test both versions at th level and see which one you like best. I personally find the turn clause in my version keeps the features value more consistent across multiple attacks although classes that grant multiple attacks will still get extra mileage from it. Anyway its a cool setting keep up the good work. ,UnearthedArcana,dcursxu,1,t5_384bx

You do need  th level wizards for enough th level slots.... th level wizards are rare...  in  but you can keep increasing the circle with progressively weaker spellcasters.... assuming they dont get one shot by whatever it is your fighting that requires a meteor swam... Also how many wizards can even fit in the dungeon? How are you feeding them all? Just for  seconds of pwnage?But you may not be able to find a copy of the spell or its in a restricted section your master wont let you in until youre stronger. If you do have the spell because you took it when gaining a level or because the dm is nice you are still using extra resources and bonus actions to increase your damage output for one turn at the cost of less resources for the rest of the day.

10726045,0,t1_ddmaysy,Anything set it apart from just using conjure minor elementals or a druid using conjure fey? I mean the biggest thing i was hoping to attain with it was  parts. The first giving some love to the idea of manipulating shadows and incorporeal undead. The other was nothing is stopping them from using conjure minor elementals so wanted to give an alternative for that flavor of character. Right now been using things like spirit guardians to show incorporeal undead for clerics. Also for action economy since they need to be commanded all at once using the mass attack rules in the dmg feels like it will cut it down alot. Was thinking something like the diablo  necromancer with his bloodboneearth golem for the creation of a more powerful undead.All of these require concentration and an active spell slot so if someone wants to use them they have to sacrifice controlled undead if theyre a necromancer. ,UnearthedArcana,ddmb8ab,1,t5_384bx

10762911,0,t1_ddq1me5,gt Why do you say that? The Invocations providing smitelike abilities have no such restrictions and the Pact of the Blade allows you to attune to a magic weapon.If you notice in each of these invocations they explicitly refer to the very weapon you are being forced to make. To use one example lets look at Claw of Acamar You can create a black lead flail using your Pact of the Blade feature. Already it has you create a specific weaponone that cannot be a magic weapon you bonded to even if it was a black lead flail. You have to create this one with the invocation. Then When you hit a creature with it you can expend a spell slot... Emphasis mine. The intent is clear that you are entirely precluded from using a bonded weapon with these invocations.gt Regardless of whether you can we should not assume any magic weapons for homebrew.I agree with this completely hence what I said later in that paragraph. The ability to take a  invocation can be a blessingif it is a very low magic gamebut it can also be restrictive if you need to take it to compete with the rest of the party. I feel I should also reiterate that there is a further opportunity cost with these invocations that the Paladin doesnt need to worry about. I dont know how much that should be factored into it but it is worth considering.gt Why should that be the case? Thats a very strong claim. The Warlock is a full spellcasting class after all so martial attacks are not a part of their core identity. Spiking damage is kind of the Paladins thing.I dunno I am just gonna disagree entirely with you here. Paladins spike damage comes from using spell slotsnot really their martial ability. A Warlock which is a full spellcasting class should be able to accomplish more with their spell slots than a Paladin a half casting class. And I stand by the damage thing. This isnt the first time we have seen asymmetrical design in similar class features. We need to consider the whole class features dont operate in a vacuum.gt Well I showed above that the Warlock smites are at the bare minimum three times as powerful as the Paladins smites at certain levelsThe highlighted part is really the key here. The Warlocks power spikes tremendously when it gets additional slots or spell levels. Thats just the way it is. Looking at level  the other extreme youll find that they are much more closely aligned The Paladins d vs the Warlocks d. Yes the Warlock will probably get a short rest or two in before the day is over but it is in no way guaranteed just like the magic weapon from before. Even typically you might expect to get a short rest but I wouldnt really consider it something to count on.gt The Pact of the Blade was already competing with the blaster Warlock for damage. I think the problem most players had with the Pact of the Blade was its MADness not with the damage necessarily. The blaster Warlock had a lower investment of resources. Now I would suspect the Pact of the Blade exceeds the blaster Warlock.Id agree with all of this I think. Id add that for most players it was just a hop skip and a jump to add full blaster functionality to their Pact of the Blade Warlock. And it is really good. So if they wanted to make Pact of the Blade invocations to really promote that fightermage playstyle theyd need to make invocations that are at least on par with the ones available to the blaster set up. If were talking about the type of player that will take things just for optimizationand it seems we areit would be nice to reward them for thinking about it that much while at the same time providing a flavorful and fun way to do it that isnt just the same one or two invocations.For me it is hard to analyze if the new options go too far but from looking at them so far I am excited to see play test results.Edit I thought of something else to consider. The Warlocks iteration of the smite is much more suited to bursting one big target while the Paladins is capable of spreading its damage out over many targets or all into one. At most levels a Paladin will be able to smite  or  as many times as the Warlock. While the Paladins are weaker theirs offers greater flexibility.,UnearthedArcana,ddq450s,6,t5_384bx

10899464,0,t1_de3z0wp,I see Artificers as being particularly special individuals though we cant reflect this perfectly in the game no two artificers should be exactly alike.  To this end I tried to reflect that in how they learn artificerskills.  An artificer has to focus their knowledge and expertise on particular formulas or inventions which are theoretically unique to them.  One might have a great grasp of alchemical acid while another has a better grasp of thunderstones.  Realistically there is still going to be plenty of overlap but the theory behind it is to make each artificer unique.  That said because of this already existing overlap I suppose I could open up the formulas so that an alchemist knows all of them and has to choose which to have available each day like a cleric might for their spells.  That might not be a terrible idea actually and might help make the alchemist a bit more mechanically valuable compared to an engineer which is more limited in what modifications they know but also gets a mechanical servant.  Hmm.  Ill think about it a bit more.The Flash Ice point you make isnt a bad one though gives it a tiny bit more utility without being overpowered and makes it a bit more attractive to take.  It would have to be a relatively low amount of damage maybe a flat d.  Overall worse than any of the actual damagefocused formulas but still offering a tiny bit of use.  That said I dont know if it would remove the concerns you have because it would still be dependent on being in or around water but since this is something that an alchemist is only going to take when they are actually in a waterbased environment that might not be a terrible thing.,UnearthedArcana,de47akn,2,t5_384bx

10933194,0,t1_de6t61c,Interesting I see what you are doing making spending prowess points a more tactical decision which I kind of like. On the other hand the choice between using a prowess point on your turn or waiting on the uncertain chance of using it on a reaction latter seem kind of weighted in favor of using it on your turn especially at low levels when you only get one prowess point per round.   As for having lots of good reaction options thats true but you are still only able to take one reaction per round so you are inherently limited by action economy. Still changing the limit to once per turn would probably make the class slightly more powerful so thats a strike against changing it.Im not sure if Im actually trying to change your mind or not thought it probably looks like it there is definitely something to be said for both approaches I think ether would work.  If you do want to keep your current design I would mention in the text how the perround limit does include your reactions.

I would have given them an expanded spell list misty step dimension door plane shift etc.  to help solidify the theme otherwise. Had I made this a full class I would have given them the ability to travel to planes as the link you showed me did.There was an ability I considered for the th level that gave plane shift. In addition it also allowed you to call upon creatures from other planes that you had met in your travels for advice. Another ability I considered is channeling different planes through you affecting the areaenvironment around you based on the plane you were channeling  Edit admittedly I could have chosen a better name for this subclass though Im not sure what it would be.

11081377,0,t3_5y6dfa,I do have a few comments on a few features.First off the Heroic Toughness is a bit odd. Having the hit dice changed from a class feature is kind of weird. If you need a class with that different of hit points then it makes more sense to go with a paladin or a fighter instead. Going with something more like the draconic sorcerer option would be more in line with Es design and just give him  more hp per level.The eldritch blade cantrip is too much like eldritch blast in fact they are the exact same spell with the stipulation that you have to be in melee reach and cannot target multiple creatures. This makes it worse in every way and makes it so you cannot take advantage of any features of a magic weapon should you get that in the future. I would suggest looking at greenflame blade spell from SCAG as a guide making a weapon attack as normal and then having other effects happen as part of the cantrip.You also removed the Hex spell for some reason. I can understand the thematic reason for doing so but that is a potentially good source of damage you are denying to this class. You could rewrite the eldritch blade cantrip and have the basic concept of hex baked into it. Having the cantrip do an extra d radiant or force whatever feels better thematically and disadvantage on an one kind of ability check until the end of their next turn with an increase of damage at th th and th per normal cantrip design.Also not sure why you are denying healing spells for this archetype if it is supposed to emulate a heroic champion. Giving it a healing spell doesnt make much sense as most warlocks wouldnt want to spend their few available spell slots on healing though some might with how juiced up warlock magic is all the time. Either way a way to give this archetype healing so that it can be like a paladin or fighter with second wind would be to give it an invocation like healing word and either have it cast at max level once per short rest or as a level  spell only but usable as many times equal to the warlocks charisma modifier recharging on a long rest. Limit this invocation to the ancient hero patron.,UnearthedArcana,deo2biq,3,t5_384bx

Therefore it contributes to the overall AC of the creature if it has an AC bonus just like a shield would e.g.  to AC.  Otherwise how does a DM determine when a creature gets hit or just their prosthetic? It makes much more sense in terms of the mechanics of the game to treat it as the character wielding an item. I get what you mean by charging using spell slots now it might be tough on players to have to burn multiple slots per day just to use their arm though. ,UnearthedArcana,detftsk,3,t5_384bx

11374522,0,t3_61s0xd,Hi everyone.  I made a Ranger archetype with the UA revised Ranger in mind the other day but Im having more trouble getting a feel for its balance than I usually do with homebrew stuff.  This is my very rough draft I appreciate balancing guidance and thoughts.  This is more of a prototype than I feel is currently worth a unique post.Conclave of the Grand Horizon may change to Conclave of the Explorer  Adventurous  At rd level you gain proficiency in Handle Animal or one vehicle type of your choice and Investigate is a Wisdom skill for you. You also gain the Mariner Fighting Style and gain the Find Steed spell as a ritual usable at will that does not count against your spells known or prepared.  Your steeds type is always Fey not Celestial or Fiend.  Extra Attack  Opportunistic Survivor  You may cast the spell Hunters Mark as a st level spell once per minute without consuming a spell slot or needing to have it prepared. You heal for double during rests are immune to Disease and gain a  bonus to all saving throws.  Balanced by Necessity  At th level you gain an additional Fighting Style depending on your first choice. If you chose Archery or Dueling you get the other. If you chose Defense or TwoWeapon Fighting you get the other. If you chose any other style you may select a different style not named here provided it is a Ranger Fighting Style.In addition You add half your proficiency bonus rounded up to all damage rolls you make.  Wanderlust  At th level you and your mount are continually under the effects of a nonmagical Freedom of Movement effect. You are both immune to the Stunned and Exhausted conditions. When you gain Foe Slayer it may be used twice per turn but still only once per attack.Whoops quick formatting edit.,UnearthedArcana,dfla648,3,t5_384bx

If it were a specific example I would say you have to do something like travel to the furthest end of the feywilds where you will find an oracle or a sphinx or something.

It gets better at th and th level with Blood Thrall but that synergy is finnicky at best and it doesnt solve the problem of level  being kind of a dead level.  I think the biggest issue from porting over the ability from Dragon Age is that the action economy really hurts what is effectively a healing spell.I did originally have an ability that allowed the blood mage to transfer health from herself to her allies but it doesnt quite fit the theme of the class as I envision it raw power at the expense of dancing with death rather than having a supporting role.Im going to have to think about whether I want to keep Sacrifice or ditch it for another ability in which case Id probably move Blood Thrall and Sanguine Strength down one level and add a different capstone.,UnearthedArcana,dfnv9w1,2,t5_384bx

An easier to understand example would be Cure Wounds.  Avoid rolling horribly badly and youve got free healing.  Well there are a few solutions I can come up with.  Most basic would be to say that casting spells in this way causes magic to temporarily alter your blood preventing you from healing for a short period of time.  Another option would be to say that instead of just causing damage your max hp is temporarily reduced.  I think I like the first option more.  Ill throw it in there.

11574610,0,t1_dg7vfq0,Thanks for the feedback glad you liked it Im not as much a fan of requiring the player to hit. Because I think that that could lead to the very frustrating situation of high AC enemies or perhaps bad rolls making it hard to use a core feature of your class. However simply requiring the player to attack is a strong enough condition to rule out many strange uses while not being so strong as to end the ability too early. I believe this is why the barbarians Rage ability is worded as is instead of requiring you to hit. I do realize that having an ability last  rounds is strange but it seemed to be the change that affected the smallest amount of other things and brought the power level more in line. Ill try to think of other possible changes if people feel that  rounds isnt a good one.Ya it was recommended to me in another comment to run the whole thing through a spellchecker. Ill make sure to do that for the next submission. I think increasing hp gain when you attack with your fangs is very interesting. Because you will be often times be sacrificing damage to get more life steal. It could be an interesting addition to Sluggish Strikes.Hmm okay. What do you think that Focused Savagery is lacking? It encourages the player to attack a single target they have advantage on their first strike and it lets them more easily lock the target down advantage on shove. Do you think there should be more than one ability that expands on Feeding Frenzy or that Focused Savagery currently isnt enough or something else?,UnearthedArcana,dg7zkzl,1,t5_384bx

11610780,0,t3_65logi,The patron abilities are too many you have three different bonuses at each patron feature level Look at the other published warlocks And the UA ones too and they only have one set of bonuses at each level.  That many different abilities seem more like trying to make the warlock into an entirely different class than trying to flavor the warlock.The level  and level  abilities seem flipped.  Normally on warlocks  is the passive abilitiesresistances and  is actives.  Elemental Vigor is too strong as it sits now there is a reason why Agonizing blast specifies Eldritch bolt Keeps the damage of EB in line with Fighters using Longbows which is what it mirrors d vs d but they have  accuracy as well.  Using a spell attack like GreenFlame Blade means you would stack both CHA and STRDEX bonuses to the damage. Combo with a level  dip into Sorc or the Magic Initiate Feat  and you have options like  Ray of Frost for both damage and reduced movement plus elemental dice.   The other option from this would be Firebolt it beats out Eldritch bolt by a huge margin then since it does the same damage can target objects you could stack elemental dice on it and you do not have to spend an invocation to do it.  Hex would compete for the bonus action but on bosses you can stack up a lot of damage.,UnearthedArcana,dgc3bq2,1,t5_384bx

11654505,0,t3_66b1g1,The biggest problem I am seeing is the use of Performance for the attack. I understand the idea behind it but the mechanics would be crazy strong. This is likely a Rogue feat which means that same player will take Expertise in Performance. This means that with a feat you have Expertise in attack rolls. Given e bounded accuracy thats amazingly strong. ,UnearthedArcana,dgh1wmo,10,t5_384bx
11654688,0,t1_dggvf9n,for the BBEG it alludes to the fact it will be easy but thats up to the GM. I just wanted to do due diligence in the designer department for those players who think written words are the final rules. They exist they are bad and i always design for the worst case scenario. I may still go change the wording though to make it seem less like it happens within an afternoon.For the armor. Before you get into magic i think you can get dragon half plate so dexshieldironskin was what i was balancing around. Back in Pathfinder and probably .e Ironskin was the one signature spell i had on both of my druids so i was originally sad that it got cut and stoneskin got neutered. This is a relatively faithful conversion with that one difference of the th lvl slot tacked on. It is a reference to fey being resistant to weapons that arent coldiron but it also wasnt put in to be regularly used. It was purely a the option is there in case a situation comes up where it is worth taking mechanic. Its for those situations where you know you are fighting hordes of undead or are a lvl  trying to talk an owlbear into being your friend so you are guaranteed to be hit multiple times to the point where it is worth taking half dmg.for Natural Negotiator it needed some out of combat stuff. The  and the toolkit came in after it. I was already thinking the dmg stuff was roguelike and the fluff was that these guys are expert manipulators so i gave them talking power. In an edition where they remember that you charmed them diplomancy is king so i made them incredible at talking to everything a druid wants to talk to. If anything I may end up nerfing this because circle of the land already gives immunity to fear and charm.,UnearthedArcana,dgh2ni0,2,t5_384bx

11662577,0,t1_dghqck1,I agree putting a minimum range on Aim would probably make the most sense. I would probably make it ft or so. A lot of dungeons have relatively small rooms and getting or staying that far from someone chasing you would be quite tricky.

11686189,0,t1_dgjvpeu,Which frankly is the only fix it needs.  The servant is a class feature at a time when other classes are getting an extra attack or an ASI.  The Artificer is getting a body that can provide flankingsneak attack conditions force AOOs a pool of hit points and an attack.  Scaling proficiency would be sufficient to allow it to land strikes in combat at higher levels and not get hit by every thing that looks at it sideways.A subclass focused on the servant might be able to imbue it with abilities and would probably need some kind of magical effect to share hit point pools but for an alchemist?  You shouldnt be relying on the servant to be a major component of your combat performance.,UnearthedArcana,dgknaz0,3,t5_384bx

11728733,0,t1_dgpbcyu,Honestly I dont like that part at all personally. I think the idea your trying to give off is not that they are a master of dual wielding but you are adept at using the weapons you installed. I might be completely interpreting what you want this feature to do if so ignore all this nonsense P .Here would be my thoughts for how I would fit it to the feel I want to give off.When you are not holding anything in a hand which has a weapon integrated you can choose to equip that integrated weapon as a free action. You can unequip this action as a free action on any turn after the weapon has been equipped. The second sentence is if you dislike the idea of infinite equipping  unequipping of weapons. The wording probably isnt perfect since Im not good at this but I hope it puts across the change I intend.This change makes it feel like its more part of their body to me and doesnt add pointless features like the non light weapons stuff from duel wielder.You could keep the AC change if you wanted but I dont like it particularly. Bit too passive for the class IMO.If you want to replace it you couldMake the class AC   Dex. Still bland and a power increase.Give some kind of bladed parry e.g. while wielding an integrated melee weapon you can use a reaction to gain   AC when attacked. More interesting to play but really unoriginal.Calculated guard  Due to your nature you do not make errors in your guard like most living creatures I mean like human error that kinda mistake. When you are hit by an attack while wielding an integrated melee weapon you can use your reaction and the creature takes your int mod in damage. This is by far my favourite concept however it probably needs completely reworking mechanically.Your own ideas here. Most of them were awesome and Im quite sure you can think of something better than I can based off that.The Predator Prototype can then rappel to the enemy and make an attack with the aforementioned benefits. Predator again.This is at the bottom of the rappel feature.At rd level the Pursuer Prototype can increase power usage to reload ranged weapons more quickly.This is in quick loading which is a predator feature.,UnearthedArcana,dgphdnj,3,t5_384bx

Your bow doesnt deal  damage because you draw it harder it deals  damage because you put an arrow in your enemys eyesocket.The reason I want to get rid of it is because Im making an archeryfocused class where the sniper variant can sacrifice extra attacks for extra damage or tohit bonus.,UnearthedArcana,dgrkqgm,1,t5_384bx
11763194,0,t1_dgt6zal,Quick question on the AC. It seems many creatures have Natural Armor that does not match the players definition of DEX. For example the gorgon MM.  has an AC of  but makes no reference of wearing anything in particular. This is repeated all over the book so unless I am mistaken it is not incorrect to say the AC is  for a creature without armor. In this case the creature is dexterous and made of metal... I would probably set the AC at DEX As if it had a shield to account for it.Is there a reason I am misunderstanding as to why it should be ?EDIT Nevermind... it does not say Natural Armor... so you are treating it as unarmored... which makes sense.,UnearthedArcana,dgtdydp,1,t5_384bx
