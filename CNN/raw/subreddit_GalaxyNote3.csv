173094,0,t3_1w0a63,I went from an iPhone  to a Galaxy S and when it died a year later to a Note . I also have an iPad Mini with iOS . Ive always been rootedjailbroken whenever possible.Downs with Android devices There are no headphones with volume updown buttons other than the shitty ones that come with the phone. I find this to be incredibly annoying. Android devices are never as smooth as iOS. The difference is much smaller now than before but theres still the occasional menu lag and the total input lag is also quite large While this seems to have changed lately the build quality of iPhones are superior to most of the android devices I have used. My dad is still using my iPhone  and despite being used actively for more than  years it looks good. My S looked like complete shit after a mere  months the color was torn off on the right side of the display... and then it stopped reading sim cards. The memory card randomly didnt read either though thankfully this was only a problem once every two months or so. I were never using any cases though but Ive bought one for my Note  now since I dont want it to look like the S. Apps are on average complete shit. The way you get an app on iOS search for one download it youre done in  cases out of . The way you get an app on Android download  different apps that do the same thing try them all out realize that most of them suck then go with the one that works best. If youre lucky it works as well as the iOS app. Software is buggier and things crash way more often. Its better now than how it used to be though.Ups with Android devices Google apps are better integrated into the system Its easier to do certain things. For example I was shit out of luck trying to get my PS controller to work with my iPad Mini there was an app for it but it didnt work with iOS . Swiftkey is vastly superior to anything Ive seen on iOS. Theres clones for iPhones but theyre nowhere close. Having a larger screen is wonderful! Android devices are way cheaper. Expandable memory is great! I have a  GB microSD card for music.Other notes Battery life is horrible on most android devices especially idle time. With the S I had to get a double sized battery to get the same battery life as my iPhone  had which made it look huge. The Note  has a decent battery life though and it seems like the battery life of the new iPhones are really bad so chances are itll be an improvement. I still dont think its enough though if you wake up at  and you walk home from the party at  chances are your phone will be dead... and thats not cool. My iPhone  would have gt battery life left in such a situation.It might seem like Im shitting way too much on Android but the thing is that the pros outweighs the cons. I would most likely rather get the future Note  than a potential . inch iPhone .,GalaxyNote3,cey5c8y,2,t5_2v7ai

231746,0,t3_1wrblo,I bought this NFCenabled charging antennaalong with this charging padI use the Neo Hybrid case and I found its better to leave the back panel off and just put the phone into the Hybrid case without the back as it lessens the bump from the charging coil.  The charging coil has a chip in it that causes the bump right under where the camera is.Pic of setupNFC enabled charging coils have the two pads right under the camera as well as the top two pads on the left of the battery connected while nonNFC enabled coils have only the left pads.  The battery contains an NFC antenna but it is blocked by the charging coils thus why you have to add another antenna.Edit  The charging pad doesnt come with an AC adapter so youll need to provide your own.

238112,0,t3_1wtsmr,What variant to you have?  There are two categories of rooting methods.  Exploit a security hole in the OS gain root privileges and install a permanent root system via that exploit.  Use the unlocked bootloaders manufacturerprovided download mode to install a custom recovery program then use that recovery program to install a root package.The first method security exploit works on all variants so long as an exploit is known.  The program Kingo Root can exploit the . OS on all Note  variants and install root.  This is generally considered safe if it fails you will just not have root.  Since it doesnt mess around with partitions and system images it has a low risk of bricking and it will not trip your Knox flag.  On the downside it requires you to be running a known vulnerable OS the new . KitKat OS images are not vulnerable to any known attack yet and it only roots it doesnt provide recovery or access to ROMs.The second method is more in depth and can be riskier but it provides more options and is generally considered cleaner as it doesnt exploit security holes.  First and foremost it requires an unlocked bootloader.  The ATampT and Verizon nondev edition Note s have locked bootloaders and thus cannot use this method at all.  For variants that do have unlocked bootloaders TMo Verizon dev edition international Canadian you can use the download mode along with the Odin program on your PC to install a custom recovery ClockWorkMod or TWRP.  A recovery is a separate miniOS that allows you to perform backups recovery installs factory resets and install new packages root system apps google apps or entirely new ROMs packaged as zip files.  The advantage of using a recovery is that even if you brick your Android OS with some rogue root app a custom recovery will allow you to flash a new OS image or even restore a previously backed up OS image provided the rogue app doesnt harm the recovery.  The downside other than that it requires an unlocked bootloader is that it trips your Knox flag which voids use of the Knox app as well as potentially voids your warranty.  That said tripping the Knox flag opens up the ability to flash new ROMs alternative OS images with community modifications and kernels low level OS component that can provide overclocking power management features and other such hardware tweaks.For a new user Id recommend going with option  as it is pretty safe and simple especially with Kingo Root.  Once you get more experienced and if you have an unlocked bootloader variant especially after your  year warranty period is over Id recommend doing option  as it opens you up to the wonderful world of custom kernels and ROMs. ,GalaxyNote3,cf5fieu,2,t5_2v7ai

2066330,0,t1_cl2fgsl,Heres some basic terms Root  In UNIX based operating systems root is the name of the administrator user account.  Root is basically god it has access to everything  all files all devices all functions.  Android is built on top of Linux which is a UNIXlike OS so getting root in Android means being able to edit restricted files access restricted devices etc. ROM  ROM is another term for an operating system image.  ROMs are full operating system replacement images usually packaged as a .zip file that overwrite your entire existing OS and completely replace it.  ROMs are usually installed flashed using custom recoveries.  Factory ROMs aka factory images are often distributed in Odinflashable formats directly. Recovery  Recovery is basically a second miniOS installed on every Android device.  It is completely independent of your main OS and serves the function of being able to repair reinstall or replace your main OS should it cease to function or if you just feel like replacing it.  The factory recovery only supports basic recovery operations on the factory image but custom recoveries allow flashing zips rooting and doing other stuff. Bootloader  The first software that runs when you turn on the phone.  It displays the Galaxy Note  splash screen and then decides what to boot based on what keys you hold.  If its locked it will refuse to boot unofficial images recovery or main OS which limits you to only factory recovery and OS images because ATampTs bootloader is locked. Exploitbased root  To gain root without using a custom recovery you basically have to find a vulnerability in the system that allows an attacker to gain root access via some hack.  Many developers are working on finding these vulnerabilities but its a catandmouse game because once a vulnerability is found the next OTA update will likely close it.  This is why rooting bootloaderlocked devices is hard because you have to constantly follow the hacks and youre best off not taking OTA updates so you dont patch holes before theyre usable.  The most recent exploit was TowelRoot which has been patched on most phones by now.,GalaxyNote3,cl2h5om,7,t5_2v7ai

We were lucky to get in right at the start of the xx generation of chips. The GB of RAM has also been a boon  even now most top of the line flagships are sporting GB at most.
