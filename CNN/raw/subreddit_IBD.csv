I already have an incredibly round chubby cheek face as it is so prednisone made that incredibly embarrassing. Went from lbswhich was waaayy to skinny I was incredibly sick from my colon to lbs. Stretch marks everywhere. It was absolutely miserable. I hated it so much so hungry barely sleeping sweating all the time. Id get so hyped up. Ive been off prednisone for about  months now. Back to about lbs. Im SO relieved to be off. Still have the stretch marks but whatever,IBD,cfqn8ks,2,t5_2rghq

1555154,0,t1_cjb5gaz,The cannabis wouldnt be for treating pain it actually can help with UCIBD and other issues.  They do have forms of cannabis that do not give a high.This is also true for smoking cigarettes.  I smoke cigarettes to help control my UC.  I do not recommend this to anyone but it does help  Some people think that its the nicotine others say its the carbon monoxide.  Either way it helps some.I dont think cannabis would be a viableappropriate option in any case for a  year old personally i wouldnt even look into this route unless he is properly diagnosed and nothing else works.,IBD,cjb7naf,3,t5_2rghq

4328924,0,t3_3ajucq,Its always going to be hard. What I have found to be the best thing though is to be completely honest with people and dont make up excuses because you are embarrassed. I dont mean tell everyone all the dirty details of your experiences but keep it honest. Let them know you are sick in pain and really bummed hah that you need to miss out. Apologize sincerely. People are usually very understanding if they know what IBD can do to a person. Make less committed plans in the first place and try and centre your future plans around safety measures ie easily accessible washrooms. It always sucks having to ditch out last minute on something you were looking forward to but you might be lucky enough to have friends and supportive people in your life that are willing to actively make changes to plans so that you would be more comfortable involving yourself. Find those people and make plans with them Edit Also maybe take up some hobbies that are more stationary that dont physically exhaust you. During a bad flareup last fall I taught myself how to crochet  I enjoy doing it by myself so I dont feel like Im wasting my time when I am ill plus I have a few friends that can come over and we can crochet and do artsy craft stuff together when I cant manage to leave the safety of my house or am too tired to go out and be social.,IBD,csdlkuw,2,t5_2rghq

4854375,0,t3_3hcjbm,Uceris was pretty good for me. It must be new because Ive had U.C for years and it wasnt until a few months ago that my GI prescribed it for awhile. Seemed to help a little bit.,IBD,cu6fhyz,1,t5_2rghq

Find the reasons you wanted to serve your country patriotism service leadership etc etc and find a job that has similar characteristics that wont decline you because of UC.,IBD,cvcjyb7,1,t5_2rghq

5913246,0,t1_cxugry0,Well thats the thing Im no longer bleeding so I dont think it really has to do with blood loss. The Remicade and Lialda took care of the bleeding and it basically stopped within the first few days after. My doctor told me that supplements dont really have time to absorb due to how my stomach is in general. The food journal thing is a good idea though. I kept one when I was younger but completely forgot that the idea existed this time around. Thank you!,IBD,cxurc33,1,t5_2rghq
6000211,0,t1_cy47pk0,Yea my Gi Doc explained to me that because Ive been on it so long it will take much longer to taper off because my body is so repentant on the meds. It sucks having to wait but I know being patient is whats best for me and realistically how to safely come off it. ,IBD,cy65pgw,1,t5_2rghq
6421319,0,t3_43n2bl,Tobacco actually helps UC symptoms but makes Crohns symptoms worse doubles the risk for hospital admission for Crohns patients.Cannabis helps Crohns symptoms massively but I dont know about UC. Someone else might be able to help  I wouldnt smoke it though dude Id get hold of a vaporiser  it is more expensive at first a flowermate is like  or something but you will save SO much money on the actual cannabis  plus ya know no lung disease or cancer from tobacco or lung irritation and stinking of smoke which is nice.,IBD,czji1ls,2,t5_2rghq

6967510,0,t1_d1629gz,Right but the concern is for the prep the laxative solution has the potential to be extremely dehydrating when he already has reabsorbtion issues with his pouch. Shouldnt just the clear liquid diet be enough since his body is already on overdrive eliminating everything?,IBD,d163q59,2,t5_2rghq
7005957,0,t3_4bbw9c,From what I understand about Pentasa is that its not actually absorbed by the body its more like a salve for the intestinal tract. I think any side effects would be related to something else in your life.,IBD,d1agxdu,1,t5_2rghq
7536901,0,t3_4gnwvq,Let me know what the doctor says! But yes this is definitely possible I have IBS and UC and its sooo complicated. Basically the way my doctor told me to tell is if there is blood. I have painful BM and an irritated stomach and mucous stool all of the time. Its when I see tons of blood that I know its UC out of remission. It is extremely complicated for them to tell the difference whether its your UC or IBS because the symptoms are similar. I have always had IBS but after I was diagnosed with UC my IBS symptoms are a million times worse and mimic my UC. I see a specialist because my regular GI had too hard of a time dealing with both. Another way I can tell is if I take a bentyl and it helps my symptoms almost completely I know its IBS but when it doesnt help I know its UC. Hoping your GI can figure out a system for you! ,IBD,d2ywqe9,1,t5_2rghq

9485951,0,t1_d9ibfd8,Its awesome to know Im not the only one who takes absurd amts of glutamine!  I feel ya or him rather  its so natural to not want to be a problematic patient.  I finally found a GI who acknowledged that FMT will likely be curative for UC its just not there yet because bacterial profiles of donorrecipient can be so varied we havent worked out the proper matching yet.  It was amazing to hear that at least for me.  So glad hes found stuff that works.,IBD,d9ichva,1,t5_2rghq

I finally described the blood I was seeing is it mixed in or does it come after is there mucous etc. the pain sharp dull rated out of ten exact location etc. and other symptoms do you have fever night sweats fatigue sore joints diarrhea achy bones and so on and was taken more seriously.

10145421,0,t3_5l5pis,One step is high risk with stools flowing past an open wound in your gut. The wound risks not healing properly or worse leaking and worst the pouch failing altogether and being removed. My surgeon said she never does one step pouches even in healthy patients. In seriously ill patients she always does three steps because their body is too sick to heal a new pouch until its recovered from the sickness in the colon. It neednt be long between steps one and two in a two step operation just a few months which is well worth it to ensure that the operation is successful and you dont suffer complications.   ,IBD,dbtya05,2,t5_2rghq
