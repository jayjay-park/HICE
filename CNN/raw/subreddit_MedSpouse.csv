1834190,0,t3_2fkn10,Would you be willing to host the study group in your home maybe? Your husband could bring the group over and you guys could maybe schedule in breaks where you sit and have some adult conversations with the adults about recent movies or crazy college experiences or whatnot. That way youll get some time with your husband and his friends can meet you and get to know you too. Also and I know it loses some of the romance and spontaneity but schedule sex and date nights. So many times if you dont schedule it it just wont happen. But relationships need regular maintenance and input from both of you and medical school can eat away at any free time so schedule that business so you at least know when your next physically and emotionally intimate moment will be together. Leave him notes too maybe? Just like little postits on random pages of his textbook so that when hes studying hell unexpectedly come across them and be reminded of you in a sweet nonobtrusive way. And he might be encouraged to reciprocate those kinds of gestures if he sees you making them. Good luck!,MedSpouse,cka7qnb,7,t5_32t39
2594280,0,t3_2mbcj5,Congrats to your wife! I posed this in another thread but seems applicable here. My husband is finishing up his th year and weve been married the whole time. Here is my best med spouse adviceBe ok with study time. Med school will cut into your time together. Try to schedule some couple time when her schedule allows it even if its just a quick drive for take out food that you bring home. While my husband was studying for Step  I literally only saw him for dinner for about  weeks before the exam. It sucks and I hated it but had to be ok with it and of course it eventually ended.See if you can help her study. Sometimes that involved me quizzing my husband even though I couldnt pronounce half the words. Sometimes it involved me typing a paper while he dictated to me. Sometimes it was simply being near him not speaking and giving him a head or shoulder massage while he worked. Sometimes it was me sitting next to him reading my own book while he studied so we could just be near each other. Basically see if there is anything you can do for her to make the incessant studying more bearable.That being said it is totally doable. Did I always get to spend as much time as I would like with my husband? Definitely not. However it was not as hard on us as I thought it would be. Good luck to you both! ,MedSpouse,cmx7jwv,1,t5_32t39

Any guidance from someone that has been in a similar situation would be much appreciated. I have not yet dared to dream what it would be like while waiting to make it out of the first trimester and learn where we match.,MedSpouse,d0jpigo,2,t5_32t39

9700344,0,t3_5e0srp,Anybody who tells you that you couldnt find anything better is trying to condition you to believe that because they know it isnt true.If things are this bad now imagine the hell youre going to experience when youre both fulltime students. Run far away and into the arms of someone that actually loves you enough to make you feel appreciated.,MedSpouse,da8rvym,19,t5_32t39
