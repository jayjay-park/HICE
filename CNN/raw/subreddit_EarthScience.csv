10748609,0,t1_ddnqrl0,The best way to think about the arcuate shape of the boundary is by thinking of a rubber ball.  If you push on one point of the ball you get a concave indent.  Up to this point the plate itself is curved convexly as it sits on a sphere the Earth. However when one plate subducts beneath another the curve inverts  as you might expect when you force one thing beneath another.  You can calculate the radius of the arc using the equation r R arc  where R is the radius of the Earth  km and  is the inclination angle of the subduction zone.  You can see a diagram of this here  taken from Bott  With regards to the alignment the Editor of Geoscientist Ted Nield gives a good explanation here ,EarthScience,ddomxqw,2,t5_2sd2w
