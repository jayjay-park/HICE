46301,0,t3_1um3dd,I dont know really where to start but this was totally uncalled for JP. Watching that video and the previous of the show. Geoffs character was one that he doesnt normally play or that Ive seen him play at least and his public image by being kind of a brutedickhead blacksmith. Hes always as the good doing character having fun and jesting. He addressed Gen in character with his own Gen didnt blink for a second at it and continued to role play it out. Not one other person on the show even looked twice at it Ryan kept composure and Neal continued on not making the slightest of face. Your actions were uncalled for you seemed to be the only one who had an issue with it. Geoff didnt need to bring this out in public it should have been handled privately. And reading from his post I can understand why he would want to stop for the night but it still should have been handled privately. After this display its understandable if he wouldnt want to return to one of your shows theres a certain trust that is lost with this now between you two.

Jhakri almost closes the deal with  barmaids until one reveals awkwardly late in the night a long time love of dragons and slaps Jhakri in the face for murdering such a beautiful creature.Carla makes some half attempts of flirting with Victarian but nobody cares.

Shits about to get nerdy for no reason and takes NOTHING away from your drawings theyre awesome.So... What Alice used was a long sword which refers to a two handed sword with a long tapered blade note bastard sword is just another word for a sword of the same type. They did sometimes have a fuller but it wasnt needed because theyre balanced so near the hilt. If you look at Oakeshotts Typology the long sword refers to the XVa XVIa XVII and XVIIIb types but the XIIa and XIIIa can be thought of as ancestors of the long sword. The dimensions youve drawn are a bit like an Xa or XI type sword but with a diamond cross section instead of a fuller. The XVa type sword is the sword when it was in its prime and the iconic shape youre looking for. Just ignore that in DampD you can use them one handed.

1914332,0,t1_ckjrrpl,they werent travelling that way they formed up. They had like several rounds to do this. Round  the advance talking orcs were slaughtered shouting out a warning. Round  nothing happened except gen casting a light spell. Round  nothing happened. Round  they were visible. A soldier can run ft in a round ind nd edition. That is battlefieldmode so he tries to dodge arrows looks out for dangers etc. If he only sprints for example to save your life by running away forfeiting all your defenses you can triple that!The ft line may sound silly but it is even more silly that it would be seen  ft at all nor did it matter if the orcs were spread out   or  ft into the outer flank of this wood because there were no forces deployed there to fight them.In the beginning the fighters got penalties to hit because of bad lighting. They fell back some small distance and voila everything fine again. How could the players see a ft line forming anyway? They couldnt so whats the big deal?,itmejp,ckjv4l5,4,t5_2v9r5

1961439,0,t1_ckp8c5q,To add onto Jons explanation Wizards such as Lea will have their title changed whenever they specialize in a school of magic. This change in title unlike in Tariqs case DOES change how their class works a little. Whenever you specialize in a school of magic you gain  spell of each spell level per day of your school at the expense of giving up  out of  other schools of magic of the players choice. The different schools of magic are Abjuration  defensive magicprotective spells. Can create physical or magical barriers negate magicalphysical abilities etcConjuration  calling creatures into or out of the material plane to serve your will healing magics teleportation or the spawningmanipulation of objects.Divination  information gathering magic. Can be used to perceive things far away that have not happened yet events going on in another plane of existence etc.Enchantment  mindeffecting spells allows influencecontrol over the subject of your choice.Evocation  the channeling of vast quantities of magical energy into the material plane. Most spells youre probably familiar with Magic Missile Fireball Lightning Bolt are spells of the evocation school of magic. Known for dealing out huge amounts of damage.Illusion  spells meant to deceive the senses of other beings. Can be used to show an oasis in the middle of a desert to fake an army of a much greater magnitude to turn invisible etc.Necromancy  the manipulation of living and unliving forces. Known very well to control undead forces.Transmutation  magics which change the physical and sometimes mental form of a being.  A wizards title upon specializing becomes an Abjurer Conjurer Diviner Enchanter Evoker an Illusionist Necromancer or Transmuter.,itmejp,ckpjzwc,2,t5_2v9r5

Of course maybe in Solum they have some weird experiments in pole arm development that might not work out.  We can just call it that. Orcs arent the brightest at figuring out weapons technology after all. I would love to get those of us with knowledge to try and sway things yet it is a game and for entertainment so ultimately as long as we laughed and smiled and gasped at the roll of a  several times in a row then the show has done the most important bit.

Ive never blown a donkey however I imagine it would be a be horrid experience ... almost as horrid as trying to use the fucking !rollplay bot.  Just last week I was about to run to the store and wanted to check if Solum was going to be on and if so when. After going to Twitch and typing the command in the chat nothing responded.  I thought ok maybe someone just did it before me and I needed to wait.  After  minutes I tried again and I still got nothing.  By that time I realized I had real life shit to do and didnt have time to wait for a bot to come off cooldown or become unbroken so I just left.Twitter as a SolutionMany seem to think Twitter is the answer but Twitter sucks almost as bad.  If JPs Twitter was solely just scheduling information that would be one thing but no.  I have to wade through posts about chicken tenders with gravy and notices that the  second video clip of Ryan Getting Shot in the Balls During Battle Royale has now been posted to YouTube.  Also scheduling posts dont occur daily so sometimes I have to scroll through days worth of tweets thinking Fuck! Did I miss the post or has it really been  days since any info on scheduling or is there nothing posted yet?A Website a SolutionJP has a domain  itmejp.com he just has it autofowarding to his twitch channel.

2272844,0,t3_2l8f0v,I voted on story in the strawpoll.  Games to me especially roleplaying games should focus on conflict.  Whats the core problem what needs to be fixed what needs to be done?  The context of this conflict is where story or mythos or worldbuilding fills in the gaps.Combat then becomes one of the solutions to this conflict.  When it comes to video games other solutions to conflict come in the form of puzzlegates dialog multiple choice questions or cutscenes  which all are harder to do effectively in a video game format.That being said for roleplaying games this issue of conflict resolution isnt as limited to combat only.  Which is where if you begin intertwining players through the story to create really complex conflicts which can interest the players and audience without any necessarily combatfocused resolutions.,itmejp,clsn50u,3,t5_2v9r5

2493297,0,t1_cmjrw6m,Hi GeoffHappy anniversary! I would just like to say that I really appreciate you taking the time to come here and adress the issue with us! At the same time its kinda sad that you have to. At the end of the day your anniversary plans certainly arent any of our business.Also please dont get the impression that people here have stopped appreciating the content not at all. This is the first time Ive seen a thread this salty here. Especially compared to other online communities I always felt the tone here to be very civil and respectful. And even this time I feel the issue was more communication than anything else. Again not that we have any right to know anything about your personal schedules  to me its just frustrating to look forward to a show for a week to then come home at the time of the show and find one flippant tweet a few hours earlier. It just comes off unprofessional. Its just nice to see the enthusiasm thats invested reflected back. Thats why its so cool when fan creations are incorporated or you guys are excited about fan stuff on the shows. There just feels to be a deviation from that with JPs sometimes very minimalistic fan interaction especially when it comes to cancellations. Is that entitlement? Maybe.All in all the larger issue for me is regularity not quantity. As some people already said we plan our week or activities around the shows invest emotional energy and in the case of Swan Song our own time to create stuff as well. That doesnt mean were suddenly entitled to x number of hours of Swan Song a month. Like from any professionals there is just an expectation for reliability. Any one of the reasons to deviate from that over the last few months was certainly more than valid  its simply a little frustrating when cancellations seem to have become the norm rather than the exception.To close this off some hopefully constructive suggestions Im sure people wouldnt mind a biweekly or even monthly schedule for Swan Song and other shows but put it on a schedule! Including a set time and day of the week. It may not seem like much but from my own experiences with DampD groups and any other form of recurring group meetup is that things start to get sour as soon as you say well meet when we have time Paradoxically that always seems to lead to less sessions than having even a monthly fixed schedule. Maybe its the fact that people start to factor it into their own long term planning more than it just being an afterthought that needs to be adressed at some point.Youre all awesome and have created something beautiful here never forget how much we appreciate that. Its the very reason people get invested and at times frustrated. Swan Song hype!edit typos wording.,itmejp,cmk0fwg,10,t5_2v9r5

2649352,0,t1_cn31k4k,Progression for travel time can already be in the game.  Travel in Stars Without Number is hand waved instantly between systems and the game is built with Faction turns from the start.  Travel in DND is a chance for random encounters.  Sitting in a town is a chance for random encounters.  Trying to heal for a week is a chance for random encounters.  Unless we are just going to hand wave full weeks of sitting around doing nothing no encounters but then what is the point?  All their enemies going to group up around town and wait for them to heal for a full week so the CR balance isnt all messed up?Much like critical fumbles being harsher to players then npcs the change in healing also hurts the players more then npcs.  Every npc they encounter will be full hp without regard to what they likely have been doing.  Here we had a guy who likes to go around picking fights but apparently he very recently laid in bed for a week and hasnt stubbed his toe since...  This will be true of every npc just like every swing of a weapon in crit fumble rules is a chance to destroy a magic weapon but if an npc fumbles the next npc hasnt been affected.This worlds travel is already elongated as each town is a full day away from the next closest.   miles between towns preautomated transport is very far.

3114190,0,t1_cokq4nd,To note Adams lack of employment does not remove his doing things to make money or looking for other gigs. I wont pretend to know what his life is like but if I had to guess Id say it was still pretty busy just a bit more flexible.The other problem is also getting a full group of people who are consistently willing to do earlyday weekly streams which is hard. JP and the GMs are one thing but theres  other people to worry about especially if JP is just handling production.EDIT Id say the best solution is definitely rebroadcasts but thats up to how the money is handledthe time when theyd be aired.

3117689,0,t3_2vu6ku,Okay so not directly related to the shows topic but its a pretty pressing issue for me and I would appreciate you guys input. So essentially I play Pathfinder with my girlfriend in a big group and she has trouble engaging with the game on a basic story level let alone on a mechanical level however we have talked about it and she says that she does want to engage but feels that having things explained at the table to her would be humiliating. She says that she doesnt even feel comfortable describing what her spells look like or involving herself at all in the story. Ive organised to start a campaign where I GM and she and my brother who are close friends will be the only players in an effort to create a safer environment for learning but even then she doesnt want a thing to do with having the mechanics explained for her in front of him and says that she would feel too embarrassed to ask when she was confused by a mechanic or why she is rolling or where the modifiers come from. Ive suggested just trying to make her character interesting but she feels that that is overwhelming. quite frankly at this point Im not sure how to deal with it at all. Should I just leave it? We have been playing for a year in our current campaign and she hasnt felt anymore comfortable engaging in the mechanics or story since the beginning. I think that the problem essentially comes down to feeling overwhelmed and not wanting to be made to feel stupid by drawing attention to her ignorance.Anyway thanks for the show Im trying to find a table that gives nice dismemberment without a high chance of death which most tables seem to have. So far the best seems to be stED MERP.,itmejp,col5c1m,1,t5_2v9r5

3258263,0,t1_cozphnx,Basically I wanted to create a narrative to the whole Sicarian exposure to spike space. Watching and waiting in suspense as Adam and Geoff described the scene live is probably the most memorable part of the show for me thus far. Even though in Stars Without Numbers Adam explicitly said Being exposed to radiation doesnt make you a cool mutant you develop lukemia and die I wanted there to be a positive sideaffect to Sicarian risking everything and in the end only furthering The Photenhauer Societys interests. Last episode was the best chance of inserting this piece into the narrative and its still unclear as to what Sicarian is suffering from in the episode. If you look at the lines between Prosper and Sicarian Which probably should have been made more distinguishable they are copied directly from the video. In short I wanted to add a character real or imaginary no names who could be a guiding figure for Sicarian showing up in times of moral crisis and encouraging him to fight not for vengeance but for the protection of others. As the figure would say To protect the things that matter,itmejp,cozqaqb,2,t5_2v9r5

3562811,0,t3_314qr6,I feel like the original intent of inspiration seems to have been as a way to mechanically balance people playing into their character flaws and playing flawed characters instead of solely playing towards optimal character traits.Say you encounter a Giant whos a dick towards any dwarves he encounters and says and acts more harshly towards them but isnt openly hostile. The optimal character trait would probably be to just suck it up and roll with the punches whereas if you were playing a character who gets easily offended then you might end up in a truly dangerous situation. Playing towards that suboptimal character trait despite it being sub optimal is where I think inspiration was intended.I dont feel like this hack solves inspiration as much as it changes it to be something completely different in nature. Changes it towards something where a completely different mechanic might serve your needs better.,itmejp,cpydxge,4,t5_2v9r5

3695605,0,t1_cqcze9u,I completely understand the most straightforward approach was a literal giant fang  like an actual lance but bent.  For me Im OK with creating a bit of controversy as long as I had fun imagining the weapon in my own way.For the game the weapon just has to obey the DampD rules of a lance.  Appearance is left up to interpretation.So as I thought about the weapons length... they havent really engaged in mounted combat.  The Tooth is carried on his person and used in indoor combat.  So I am thinking of a shorterthanalance weapon already.Additionally I designed two poses and both didnt really support a footlong well.  Now Galahan is  already so its probably  as drawn.As for appearance I just wanted a really wicked look.  So I totally agree with anyone envisioning the Tooth of Grief as they see fit no problem.  Even shaped as a blade a human probably wouldnt be swinging it like in Final Fantasy but as with a lance in DampD rules use it as a thrusting weapon.And I know Im pushing it as far as genuine DampD look this weapon wouldnt show up in a Tolkien movieadaptation but maybe animefantasy so its just my personal choice.All your feedback is appreciated.  So Im just relaying my point of view in how I arrived to this depiction  Im not trying to convince any of you that my drawing is somehow right or this is the way it has to be drawn ,itmejp,cqdiuwo,1,t5_2v9r5

But Psychics can choose between a few different psyker schools. None of them are explicitly aggressive but Telekinesis does have the most aggressive powers. They missed a trick with the Teleportation school. Should have taken a leaf from the Blade of Orien class from .E. But I digress. Telekinesis has an attack which can do up to d damage and thats its only really explicit damaging ability.

I like a lot of people used to listen and watch State of the Game religously and when I saw on twitter you and Geoff were going to be playing DnD together I was ecstatic. I got into DnD kinda late. When e came out I  listened to Penny Arcade mike jerry and scott all good guests to have one day btw play and was instantly hooked. So by the time Rollplay started I was used to the format of listening to a group of friends shoot the shit and play an RPG. What I loved about those early shows was watching the group actually grow and learn not only how the system worked but how to be great roleplayers and be funny in front of an audience. Something a lot harder to do than it can seem. So JP Geoff Gen Ryan and Neal thanks for literally weeks of entertainment and a great couple of years.

The SWN faction turn is really great I can tell from my own GM experience and from Adams GM turns. If you want to put less time into it it will probably be less rewarding and thats totally ok. If time tediousness is an issue I would recommend just having a few ideas for factions and their goals and imagining a few events that would happen within a month. Its okay to simply brainstorm what is happening offscreen it is what happens in most rpgs and can contribute a lot to any campaign. The SWN rules for faction turns make this more impartial and give it more depth. They also give the GM loads of ideas for adventures. If you dont have the time for it thats okay but I doubt it will be easy to set it up at the push of a button.,itmejp,ct4yr76,1,t5_2v9r5

But it surely may limit player choices to some extent on a daytoday basis. Maybe the way the party travels shouldnt be decided at the start of every third day maybe the initial roll to know how many actions the party has for the following three days of travel should assume that the party isnt taking any particular stance and that they are just advancing normally and have Stealth travel Athletics travel and Survival travel as stances that players may choose every day which in turn will limit them for each day to the actions under each stance.Maybe...,itmejp,cus3mk5,3,t5_2v9r5

Cobblepot Toolspark Piani Pic Alpharius not ending his sentences Dr. Grigori etc.ex Catz rolls a  on a d and then a  on a d and breaks his gunnars. In my opinion this did not get as much attention as it deserved. In general going through with embarrassing things for the show.ex The maid RPG on JPs channel was my favorite rollplay session of alltime. I really enjoyed the gusto to dress up like that in front of the internet for all to see and still be able to laugh as much as they did.ex Shannon doing any of her rapsDoing things FOR the audience. I.e. using tropes effectively.exThis includes Using audiencefavorite spells even though it may not be relatively effective ingame Vincent slapping opponents with his glove to challenge them to a duel having Gens ferret companion Tudagub giving money to raise his own city named Willowbrook using insidejokes that the audience is aware of such as being a good boat salesman or Wu thinking that the Swan Song is a piece of shit.Having your character do things that are hard for the player to say because you want to metagame the crap out of things.ex Tudagub healing Vincent in a time of need.For closing statements the tropes category I mentioned above is probably the thing I personally enjoy the most about roleplaying.

6418922,0,t1_czj6st4,At this point Im not sure if JP has the most hours in WM. Well now that I think about it he must still have the most hours since he has had what?  different characters? Even though two of them lasted only one episode or better yet half an episode Tahc the total amount of hours played as Kurthak Koke and Poe may be enough to surpass Zekes or Strippins playing time believe they are two of the most frequent players right?.Now the question is are those hours as meaningful to the state of WM as the hours played by this or that other player? And what of the hours spent as each of those characters? Did those characters separately have the same meaningful impact on the WM as when we pool them together? What character would he choose to portray? Most people change character because the previous died but JP has  characters still alive even though I believe he said Icilla or whatever his name was has been retired and Kurthak appears to have gone insane. Should he go for Kurthak the more meaningful one Cpt Koke who went through some really weird shit or Poe his most current character?Eheheh going on a ridiculously serious approach to the matter. Anyway I would say that his characters have been as meaningful as some others and more meaningful than many even if we take them into account separately but possibly the fact that he hasnt played regularly as the same character and the fact that he has been gradually sitting out of more and more sessions may have deteriorated his relation to his characters and his connection to the show leading him to choose to sit out of the panel so to avoid more awkwardness.

7232941,0,t1_d209jyv,gt This is kind of ridiculous youre free stop your professional interaction with the subreddit if you want to see rCynicalBrit no official relation to TB at all a larger community well run and curated by volunteers but trying to strong arm nearly  reddit using subs and many others who arent subscribed into using a site they may not want to use by destroying their old home isnt a good idea.Sorry probably should have phrased that better. We wont force anyone to move away from this subreddit. If others want to keep it open that will be fine but if we make the move the site would be the official place. We wont redirect or stop people from post here it just wouldnt be official. Sorry again English isnt my first language so from time to time that happens doing my best to avoid it.gt Im curious as to what it is about the subreddit that is unmanageable?Its one part time and its one part functions that we would like to have. We could bring over Twitch mods to help out but theyre already doing so much for the chat. As for functions sure we could try to force functions thats not native for Reddit but without proper ways to handle those functions and sever access etc. it ends up being more work for someone. The investment would be in time save and manhours but also to allow for a better user experience that we cant code into Reddits source code.gt Id prefer you put the moneytimeresources into making the subreddit better than wasting moneytimeresources on trying to clone functionality for a separate site that I cant see myself using nearly as often.We hopefully wont try to create clone from reddit. That would defeat the purpose. The aim is to give more then whats possible on reddit. The limit with reddit is that its not open source and we really only have CSS control. ,itmejp,d20bzam,2,t5_2v9r5
