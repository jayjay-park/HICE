4039652,0,t1_crgixco,Ah I see! That clears it way up for me. So not all sympathetic strings would be contributing equally depending on what notes you are playing but if you have enough sympathetic strings then you can have enough contributing each time for the effect to be more or less consistent?,icm,crgr1m2,1,t5_2t0it
10034161,0,t3_5jadjl,I use the regular strings that is used for western music for my violin. The only difference is the tuning which I keep at d for Sa when playing by myself. I dont think there is a need for any modification required.,icm,dbfh7ie,2,t5_2t0it

10375346,0,t1_dcggniw,Which is why its helpful to have drone strings going! If you listen to bansuri or sarangi solo ragas can easily be transposed to a different sa.
