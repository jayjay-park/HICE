474619,0,t3_1ziwrk,Yeah Im listening too. But I havent heard anything thats not in the original episode se.Seems like they put the whole soundtrack of the episode in the game. Definitely going to see if it goes beyond D,StickofTruth,cfu7tf7,1,t5_2vqpx
475380,0,t1_cfu7g5u,Its not just Kotaku. There was also Polygons review which despite being positive had like five different reviewers from other websites weighing in about the bugs they found. Escapistmagazines review also mentioned a bug found by another reviewer from a different website.  I have NEVER seen that done with any other game. There seems to be a concerted effort to keep perpetuating the Obsidian makes buggy broken games myth even though that hasnt been the case for a long time between this game and the equally bugfree albeit uninspired Dungeon Siege III.,StickofTruth,cfuaxm4,1,t5_2vqpx
478009,0,t3_1ziw5i,Thanks it works great D ...well you may need to exclude it from your virus scanner first.I have both ESET NOD  Malwarebytes installed and only Malwarebytes detects a virus  Packed.NSPack when you inject the texture mod so I believe it may be a false positive since ESET NOD doesnt detect anything.VirusTotal analysis if anyone is interested  Edit if you google about texmod youll see many others saying its a false positive too,StickofTruth,cfulpao,1,t5_2vqpx

509935,0,t1_cfy3vrz,Thats what I was thinking too so I made a save there and tried turning off the game and restarting it resetting my PC and then messing around with my graphics options all to no avail. The only thing left I can think of is that its either caused by me being black this time around and theres a glitch of some sort with that skin color in this segment or maybe its some kind of bad racist joke well below the quality I expect from South Park. What I mean by that is South Park is usually more clever with racism deconstructing it reversing it and generally not just repeating tired racist standards like black people are hard to see in the dark unless its to poke fun at the character delivering that joke.,StickofTruth,cfy8dkq,1,t5_2vqpx

I guess Ill try that and report back Edit  I ended up deleting my other save games and starting a new character and it worked.  I can update everything as normal now.,StickofTruth,cfzblto,1,t5_2vqpx

590527,0,t1_cg7dvqt,The length was a bit disappointing though being forced to stretch it out over a week and a half because of my schedule made it feel a bit longer. The difficulty well this is a game where its more about the story and since I had to take a more casual approach I wasnt all too concerned with that. Are the more difficult options really as easy as the default difficulty just curious?Glitches and bugs seem to be the norm these days. Shove it out and fix it later. Obsidian is not the only one guilty of that practice but I think its harder to acceptignore when the game has been so heavily anticipated.My impression of the game is still a solid . It started at a  but on my second play through and third start Im finding that not all annoyances are consistent though there are some things that need to be addressed. The casual SP fan or the SP fanhardcore RPG player probably wont care too much for the game while the moderate to hardcore SP fan who is also a more casual RPG player will.,StickofTruth,cg7eamn,5,t5_2vqpx

7115509,0,t1_d1mxjek,If you look at the achievements individually non of them is pretty hard collecting all the stuff friends and Chinpokemon are probably hard in a sense that you can miss a lot of stuff pretty easy good example is Big Gay Al and somehow I even thought that the least popular achievement ReButtal was one of the easiest. But in case you are trying to get as much as possible to win against Princess Kenny while being disguised as a girl wearing the Hoffs face having Dire AIDS chained to companions that are not allowed to die  was probably the hardest part at least with combat difficulty on hard,StickofTruth,d1mxyse,2,t5_2vqpx
