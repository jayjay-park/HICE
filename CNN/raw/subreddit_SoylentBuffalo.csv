5257105,0,t1_cvjjdfq,Actually looks like we have another new city between Siksikawa and Kaninaa towards the Inuit border.  Take a look HEREThose are the two new cities that we got.  It also looks like we spent a bunch of money purchasing territory by Sichangu and Kainaa after Itazipcho burned downt he first time.I dont like this.  Creating tensions with the Inuit is not a great idea.  Our cities in the Northeast and in the Aleuts are open targets for them.  Lets hope Crowfoot is a diplomatic guy and can keep the peace while we build a blanket army.Also of note the beautiful Citadel east of Mdewakantonwan ,SoylentBuffalo,cvjo3on,3,t5_39izy
