2739647,0,t1_cnfgl69,Keeping it pretty stock. Probably an M bumper and mouldings tint bilsteinhamprs DSs or style s. Cant decide if I want to stay amber corners or go clear.The black one is supercharged this one is staying mild for my DD. May evolve into my track car though.,BMWE36,cnfhiju,2,t5_2xc6z
2742424,0,t3_2rgsat,I recommend  M control arms and  M centered bushings. This combination is a nice very subtle performance upgrade and maintains the original nonM geometry.If the upper perches were not replaced during the strut work K miles ago you should intend to pull them and swap in the Z perches they are actually a BMWapproved replacement part for the E and if you order E part numbers youll get the Z parts.  Theyre made of a cast aluminum and have a higher durometer rubber bushing so they help increase front end feel and rigidity.  And while you have everything out install the M strut tower reinforcements for good measure.Also plan to replace the steering rack and tirerods.  That will eliminate a ton of slop in the front end.  The racks in these cars are only good for around K...less if the fluid is not changed.  I waited WAY too long to replace my tierods and the balljoints were literally flopping in the breeze at K.  Get the Turner Motorsport rack centering tool and youll make quick work of that job.Best advice is to google bmw e diy.  Many others have already been through this.,BMWE36,cnfsw0q,5,t5_2xc6z

4397197,0,t3_3bak9g,Go for a  or  for bigger discs and a bigger diff.  has a small case diff and cant fit a larger diff. Also remember to swap the drive shaft since different diff size means the drive shaft has different lengths. Swap is pretty easy.

7328878,0,t1_d2b0kog,Dont worry man I know the feels. I just bought a  with k on it granted it was a thousand dollars and he also threw in extra seats center console and rims as the ones on it now are from an E and yeah pretty much problem after problem. Ive only really driven it once or twice the clutch needs replacing as in slipping at anything over like k. But its a project car and Im sure once its got a clutch and I can drive it more Ill fall in love with it.  Just keep on trucking bro ,BMWE36,d2b8s5i,1,t5_2xc6z

10719420,0,t1_ddkr17a,Tonight was the first time I really drove the car a long distance and the shocks are completely shot so itll be getting coilovers in the very near future. The e feels more go kart like its hard to explain it just feels like a much smaller car compared to my e. Even with blown suspension the car still drove pretty well the steering is still nice and tight just bouncy over bumps. Im really looking forward to driving the car once new suspension is installed. The interior of the e is pretty crappy compared to the e but I do enjoy the aesthetics of it very simple and user friendly. ,BMWE36,ddlmnb6,2,t5_2xc6z
