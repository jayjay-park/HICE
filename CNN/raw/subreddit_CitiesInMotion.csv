607141,0,t3_2138pz,. Yes getting CiM through Steam will automatically update the game for you.. There is no fix for roads being in your way when building underground. However I tolerate it since it helps me place my metro stations. I also dont like building my crosswater passages underwater so it helps me plan out my coastal level crossings to make bridges.. The tedious wait for money can be kind of circumvented using loans. I dont like taking out loans though. I generally build a few lines to connect small areas of interest and neighbourhoods and then linking a few of these areas up using a larger line.. Speeding up simulation seems to be harder though. You can use the speed up time function in the bottom left corner of the screen assuming you havent found a way to flip the UI around. There is no way to upgrade roads to a different kind.,CitiesInMotion,cg9a9ka,2,t5_2t6a6
965536,0,t1_chdrp5t,Oakland is probably my favorite map out right now. Maybe tied with Altea Island. It really captures the sprawl without getting monotonous. Im looking for the SF map to be finished.,CitiesInMotion,che1gzy,1,t5_2t6a6

2080362,0,t3_2h1z42,Probably said umpteen times already but the ticket adjustment price minigame is utter crap. I hate it so much.  knobs to fiddle with  with the monorail DLC tiny tiny buttons to hit no scrollwheel support like its  the group adjustment knobs are pretty much useless they dont adjust all prices to match colour but by fixed increments once your city gets big the economy tends to flipflop and youre forced to change prices constantlyOne halfsolution is once youre reasonably rich to just drop every price down to blue level and forget about it. Theres exactly one mod for autoadjusting prices and it may or may not work with the current patch. And with the modding tools so restricted no hope in sight.Bugs stupid cims stupid traffic nonreversing vehicles mandatory depots in each route and the very flexible but complex road system I can live with. But this spreadsheet does not feel like achieving anything. You can only lose at it if you dont pay attention. Its a punishing part of the game because it knows what the prices should be and makes you guess those numbers and enter them in a shitty interface. CiM would be so much better without it.,CitiesInMotion,cl49cw3,2,t5_2t6a6
