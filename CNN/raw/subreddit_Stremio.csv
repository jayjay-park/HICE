5503190,0,t1_cwf22nx,What I mean is that you find a linktorrent on the internet paste it somewhere in the program and it gets published for others. Heres an example Theres no stream available for an episode of a TV show on Stremio but there is a torrent online. So instead of watching only fot yourself you can place it on Stremio so other people can watch it using Stremio and that way you also ease the burden of the devs.In summary Find torrents and add them to Stremio yourself to fill the No stream available making the devs jobs more easier,Stremio,cwf3175,1,t5_3ahix
5524130,0,t1_cwggdok,I did a quick test like an hour ago. I played a HD video on youtube and noticed Chrome was limited to  connections. It stayed on  and didnt move. I then played a HD video on stremio and saw it was hovering around  connections. It kept changing. This is on Stremio ..I was having these problems on Stremio ..I need another day of watching movies to see if the latest update has fixed it. ,Stremio,cwhr9rf,1,t5_3ahix
