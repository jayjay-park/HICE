3154084,0,t3_2w8egm,Does Ms Berejiklian realise that money was allocated to install lifts at Unanderra a few years ago but the OFarrell government took it away? Clearly they didnt give a shit back then and they still would not give a shit had these videos not been released.Edit Actually upon further research it appears that it was this same person involved.gt Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian concedes the steps at the Unanderra railway station are pretty bad but has refused to commit to new lifts there. Oct.  gt Its been confirmed that a train station in Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklians Sydney electorate has jumped the queue for station lifts and the people of Unanderra arent happy.gt Mrs Berejiklian has since announced that Artarmon will be getting lifts and a pedestrian bridge as part of the NSW governments  million Transport Access Program TAP.gtThe decision means that both stations in Mrs Berejiklians electorate  Artarmon and Chatswood  will have lift access. May  Fuck this bitch and her crocodile tears.,wollongong,coox33d,3,t5_2roro

5912808,0,t3_3wacbi, Get your application in as early as possible.  Sometimes offering to pay some months rent in advance can help but a lot of agents cantwont accept it.  Otherwise just make sure your application has everything they need first time around. I know a lot of people who have left out one tiny thing and missed out because agents dont need to chase you up when they have a stack of applicants.,wollongong,cxup9mo,2,t5_2roro
