5868443,0,t3_3vmstz,NSFW for  seconds of a quintet of album cover embellished girl booties.This post is to celebrate my formal banning from rmusic the most wretched totalitarian and bassackward sub dedicated to music in all of Reddit. A major reason I love and dedicate myself to this sub was rmusics Hall Of Fame and retirementbanning of music posts of artists which Pink Floyd was among them. I found a home in this place of wild and varied tastes few restrictions and a nice community....And I know that was a sneaky thing to do with that link but can you be mad when Im bringing the heat like that?,fuckmusic,cxovtn1,9,t5_2zanw
