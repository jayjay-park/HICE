436578,0,t3_1z2a69,For years I thought all I had was vulvodynia. early last year I started treatment for it it and I did suprisingly well and I am in full recovery. I had never really had sex before that because I couldnt get past the hymen without splitting burning pain. But from june  onwards Ive been able to achieve penetration and thats when I realised the pain goes deeper. Literally.Penetration itself causes an intense ripping pain deep in my pelvis the same pain I get when I wee or poo. Orgasms amplify that pain and sent it shooting through my groin thighs and up into my sternum a really sharp stabbing that makes it hard to breathe. After sex and after orgasm the pain lingers as an ache that takes hours sometimes days to go away. I was only really having sex to see what It was like I always thought I was missing out on something but Im not really even without the pain I cant see it being better than a nice warm hug. So Im ok that it causes pain. At least with the vulvodynia being treated I can sit walk and ride a bike with no hassle. I dont care if tampons and speculum are painful I can use pads and I only really need a speculum in there  times a year at most.,Fibromyalgia,cfq0lm0,2,t5_2qwut

485738,0,t3_1zn6fk,Ive never heard that?Ive had  surgeries.  They were worth it!  Gallbladder out had to be done had stones blocking duct.  Knee fixed torn cartilage.  My latest was really major abdominal surgery that lasted  hours and fixed a lot of problems.  They hurt but I cant tell you if it hurt me worse that it would have someone else.  But I worked with my doctors on pain management and after healing still only a few weeks since the last one but already doing better it was worth it for the improvement in my life.  Some causes of chronic pain can be fixed.  So more pain for a bit to have less pain over the much longer run seems a fair trade off to me.  My husband had to have that septum surgery.  His life improved because he could breathe better and slept better.  It was like he came out of a fog from messed up sleep.  Also think that was worth it.   ,Fibromyalgia,cfvhd04,3,t5_2qwut

Also consider filing a complaint with your states medical licensing board.In order to qualify for disability you must have a specific diagnosis and in some cases a specific period of time must have passed between diagnosis and application for disability.In other words if your doctor refused to make an actual diagnosis in writing exactly zero days have passed under those requirements and you are undiagnosed.Any doctor which argues with you about symptoms or becomes belligerent when you attempt to discuss treatment options should not only be immediately dumped you should immediately file a formal complaint with your states licensing board and immediately contact your insurance company to file a formal complaint.

For me nice stresses can prompt symptoms as well as difficult stresses. I think maybe because the adrenaline involved. Adrenaline is a painkiller so it can spur us to do more than we ordinarily would stress joints we normally wouldnt which can cause inflammation. And when the adrenaline level drops or runs out were even more sensitive to pain than usual  double whammy. And weve proabably got some inflammation to contend with as well  if ibuprofen helps then thats a pretty good indicator thats whats happening.Pacing is soooo important. Do what you can to keep that adrenaline down and try not to exceed your safe capacity. Its a skill rather like carrying a full glass of water across a huge bumpy field. With practice and patience youll have less of those flares  Ive gone from almost bedbound to being able to get out almost every day and its pretty much all to do with keeping within my limits. Ask the rheumie about pacing and what sort of things will maintain and provoke your symptoms.Take it steady and enjoy the wedding  ,Fibromyalgia,cidwy92,3,t5_2qwut

In addition to Fibro meds I also take Elavil to help lesson headaches. And Im on a daily mg of Verapamil for migraine help. Verapamil is a multi use pill for blood vessel dilation and used for high blood pressure.I have also experienced visual migraines these eye migraines are very strange. When these happen usually in one eye I see black squiggly lines some light flashes and cant focus its like a part of your vision is obscured. They can last  minutes.

1839193,0,t3_2fmwni,Im sorry that this has happened to you it is a really horrible thing to go through. Like youve said you didnt do anything to deserve this and your friend did a shitty thing by turning his back on you when things got too hard. That is not the way a friend should behave and your having fibro does not justify him acting that way towards you. I was in a similar situation recently and it made me realise that losing a friend who youve been close to for a long time can be as devastating as breaking up with a partner. And youre definitely not being  dramatic. It took a long time for me to get to the point where I wasnt constantly feeling miserable about it and even now I dont think I will ever completely be over it but I have moved on and it doesnt bother me that much.Anyway my point is that although it probably doesnt help to hear this now the only thing that will make you feel better is time. In the meantime dont be afraid to grieve for the friendship youve lost and all the other things that fibro has taken from you. Its great that you know that you havent done anything to deserve this. Its important to remember that it isnt your fault. But feel free to cry and scream and pour your heart out to your partner and get angry at your this friend for deserting you and at this shitty disease for what its doing to your life. As for your partner even if heshe doesnt know how to help just having someone there to listen and comfort you can make a huge difference. Again this probably doesnt help right now but even if youre friends have turned their backs on you you still have a partner who loves and cares about you. And eventually itll start to hurt less and less to the point where you feel a lot better and are able to move on. So hang in there and even if theres nothing you can do right now to make yourself feel better try to remember that you wont feel like this forever. Also I think youre on the right track with seeing a psych and trying to make new friends thatll definitely help in the long term. What you said about feeling like the last part of you before you got sick just up and left Im on mobile I havent figured out how to quote yet sounds like the sort of issue that a psychologist would be well equipped to help you with. The way you described your feelings in that sentence really resonated with me so you definitely seem to have a good understanding of what youre feeling and why which makes it much easier to deal with any issues you may have. Hopefully your psych will be a bit more helpful than me. I really hope you feel better soon. Remember youre not on this journey alone.

Sort of.Anyway its a relief to finally be diagnosed but be prepared to spend some time adjusting to your newfound knowledge. I know I had a really hard time the first year after diagnosis.  I got very depressed because while it wasnt a death sentence it dawned on me that it was a life sentence. Aside from that I decided not to let it stop me from living the life I want.  I know that I have limitations and that gets really really frustrating.  But I refuse to give up and I hope you refuse to also.  Treatment is hard to dial in.  And even with treatment that works its still there.  Its easier when you find the right medication but its still there.Learn to be gentle with yourself.  Learn to ask for what you need whether its a new med from your doctor some extra sleep on weekends or for your partner to stay in and cuddle with you watching a movie rather than going out to a social gathering when you arent up to it. Learn to say no to simplify your life.  Figure out your priorities and make sure you reserve enough energy to accomplish them rather than frittering it away on things that dont matter.

And I really dont know how to prevent it. Trying to move in just the right ways so things stay where theyre supposed to requires a concentration and focus that I just cant maintain. I almost feel like I need to get a severe case of amnesia and learn how to walk and move around all over again because obviously Im doing it wrong. Im so sorry youve got to deal with this too. It sucks. It sucks sooo bad. ,Fibromyalgia,cmqx8of,2,t5_2qwut

Your doctors should be able to get you on some form of pain management to help pillsphysical therapydietexcersise whatever ends up working but there should be something that will eleviate a little of the pain. Yes the pain can get worse but thats all it will ever be pain  nothing seriously wrong. Ive had several months in a row where my knees and elbows feel like they are shattering when i bend my limbs and its terrible but one day i wake up and its gone and its just aches soreness all over and no more dying feeling. From my experience and reading others on the reddit the pain comes in waves.  Definately work with your doctors to get your symptoms under control even a little less pain is worth it.Having a child will be difficult you may not be able to get up at  AM to change them and maybe your wife hasnt slept in  hours the stress of your pain and a baby could become a lot. The both of you need to understand what youre capable of doing if you make the decision of having a child knowing how care will workout of youre in to much pain and shes to exhausted because if you arent prepared your marriage is what will suffer.I hope things work out for you!

One could infer a bruised bone or muscle issue and the latter woulc point to a frature hairline crack or something similar.   Did you injur your rotator cuff in the fall? The ball of the shoulder  it can be very tricky to find an injury there so some docs might miss it.  If you can stand it Id suggest taking the long wait through ER just to get a proper xray done. Theyll likely bind your arm to you in a strap sling for a little while to keep the armshouder still depending where the injury is on your arm and how severe.    I injured my shoulderarm in a car accident in  and Urgent Care told me to politely eff off and take some Advil.

If you get migraines on any type of semi regular basis talk with them about that.For me it is constantly there in the background.  I liken it to being on a kids playground merry go round with my head in the center and my feet on the end being spun around continuously actually doing this sucks with the vertigo dont do it.  Driving increases it.  As the visual range diminishes I cant think of the word I was looking for it gets worse.  At around  yards it gets intolerable and I cant drive.  My eyes lose focus and Im nauseous by this point.  I tried driving through it a few times each one resulted in a panic attack.What does help?  Feverfew pills help.  You can grow them yourself if you have a green thumb.  Anything but the root can be used.  You can also use Butterbur.  Avoiding situations that cause it to increase if you can.  That isnt always an option though.  Go slow keep the inside of the vehicle free of conversation and for me music helps.  Im not sure why conversation even if it isnt directed at you acts differently than music does.A note on it though even if you have migraines under control the vertigo most often will not respond to treatments that migraines do.  You can also have the active vertigo without migraine pain.Just out of complete curiosity do you have visual snow?

3624824,0,t3_31u1fs,Nurse here with fibro and fibrorelated IBS among other symptoms....If you are having digestionIBS symptoms then look into the FODMAP diet. Its sciencebased not a fad. Yes it includes eliminates gluten but it is based on eliminating certain nasty carbs of which gluten is only one. I have found that when my gut starts to rebel I can go on the FODMAP diet for a short time and gradually introduce everything back into my diet without symptoms.Does it alleviate fibro symptoms? For me I have found no correlation. When I have a fibro flareup I dont have an IBS flareup at the same time. They seem to be independent of each other. The main fibro triggers for me are lack of sleep or interrupted sleep and stress. Everyone is different your mileage may vary.Finally fibro pain is not caused by inflammation the process of pain in fibro is different from normal pain much like the process of pain caused by migraines is different from other headaches. This is why everyday pain killers NSAIDs as well as narcs dont help alleviate the pain of fibro or migraines for that matter. The fact that your chiro talked about inflammation as well as the fact that she thinks that a specialized diet will alleviate the pain tells me that she doesnt know much about fibro.I dont have time right now to do indepth research here are a couple of articles I found in a quick searchI hope this helps ,Fibromyalgia,cq5ggks,3,t5_2qwut

4131554,0,t1_crr6xjh,No one with a fibromyalgia diagnosis knows whats wrong with them. Even the doctors dont understand whats going on. Fibro is a diagnosis of elimination. It means that your symptoms cant be explained by any know disorders. The researchers that seem to be making headway with attaching HSV to symptoms such as these and controlling the symptoms with antivirals and antiinflammatories are onto something it seems. Im sure that this will bring relief for some of us that are suffering from that exact disorder but Im sure many others will still be left in the dark. Were all suffering from something but its my belief that were not all suffering from the same thing. As my own doctor wisely told me the more disorders in this area that are discovered the more the circle of fibromyalgia suffers will shrink as more are discovered to suffer from newly discovered disorders. Hopefully we make enough progress in medical science that no one ever has to be given this meaningless diagnosis again.,Fibromyalgia,crr7yvg,-1,t5_2qwut

4403331,0,t3_38r9kd,Dating is difficult! Having a chronic health condition makes even more difficult. Honestly in my dating life there were a small few people I came across that were jerks or thought it was in my head but you learn quickly who they are and move on. They out themselves pretty quickly Thats a deal breaker for me ! I cant deal with people like that in my life anymore.Fortunately Most people werent phased by it. Probably  of the people did NOT react poorly The guy I am with now is very compassionate and understanding. Weve been together almost  years.  I would usually tell people on the phone before meeting if it came up or in the first few dates about the condition and if they didnt know about it most people didnt they would look it up on the Internet Or ask for more information. I figured if they were going to react poorly if I told him in the beginning I wouldnt be wasting my time. Its part of who I am and I cant change it. If someone decides to be with me theyre going to have to deal with it. Its not degenerative or contagious so thats good. Its like diabetes. If you have it you have it. The most difficult part of dating for me was the fact that I didnt want kids. I never really had a burning desire for kids but once I was diagnosed officially it was my decision to definitely not have kids of my own or adopt. My level of fatigue is not conducive for kids. I was fine dating someone who had them already though. I am  and a lot of people on their late s and s goal is to have children. Which meant I wasnt for them or them for me. I had more people not want to pursue dating because of that than the fibro ironically. Lol. Again I told people flat out I didnt want kids right away so that if we had different goals why pursue a relationship on a deal breaking issue? Sure there are times when instead of going out I have to stay in or we have to cancel plans but if you find someone worth keeping they will understand and be there for you. NEVER SETTLE! I try to keep a positive attitude about it and even though I have poor me days in general I do as much as I can and try to focus on things that are going right and be thankful for the good days and get through the bad days. I know the bad days wont last forever even though sometimes it seems like it. ,Fibromyalgia,cslznp1,1,t5_2qwut

Fibromyalgia is a disease of the nerves that is to say a neurological disease and thus should not have any true physical lasting impact on the mobility or strength of your joints and bones. What this sounds like to me from personal experience is that you may have the early stages of a rheumatological disease and you should immediately get advice and assistance from your general practitioner or family doctor who may refer you to a Rheumatologist or another specialist based on what he or she find to be most helpful for your situation. I found out that I have rheumatoid arthritis after my fibromyalgia diagnosis because there were as you said other issues that could not be explained by fibromyalgia such as joint pain and what is called trigger finger in my knuckles. The fingers and toes are some of the most common early sites of arthritis development so please go get yourself checked out as soon as you can. If you have anymore questions let me know.,Fibromyalgia,cu4834o,1,t5_2qwut

5405175,0,t3_3ox48a,I was diagnosed with Fibro  years ago. In the beginning it was very bad and I could barely be touched and had flare ups every week. My rheumatologist tried all sorts of meds to help me deal with the pain and some made me really out of it and yet didnt really seem to help much. I finally found something that worked for my pain and that helped turn things around. I changed my diet no more diet soda and had acupuncture  treatments on a regular basis for two years.I try to exercise walk swim bike when I can take my medicine religiously and do my best to not overdo it. My flare ups happen less often now and I have a great new one year and going strong relationship with lots of sex. I honestly believe the sex makes me feel better too.

5630462,0,t1_cwu8x9x,Exactly! I was in hospital for a complicated cholecystectomy  they put me on endone for the pain post surgery but took me off my herbal concoctions and ibuprofen because the endone will cover it  yes the endone covered my surgical pain completely  didnt even know Id had surgery it was that effective.  But opiods do nothing for fibro pain as we all know.  That left my regular chronic pain completely unmanaged.  So naturally this forced me into a flare up  which meant healing from surgery took longer than usual. I get lapectomies quite often due to endometriosis  its usually a day procedure  Im given some IV aspirin in post op I opt out of prophylactic clexane so I can have NSAIDs  Im sent home  hours later and can manage my own medication.  Ibuprofen and peppermint  keeps it mostly bearable. it usually takes me  days to recover.  The chole I expected to be  days  but it was  weeks because I had a flare up on the rd day and they kept me in for longer to manage my comorbidities and continued to deny me NSAIDs or neuropathic pain medication.  Instead pushing endone on me.  I was even marked as non compliant  because I kept refusing endone and clexane and demanding a heat pack.

It honestly depends where you are at with your health. I couldnt even work  hours as a cashier at ALDI because my fibro has me running to the toilet getting migraines that cause slurred speech and falling asleep every few hours.

7539978,0,t3_4ikz8d,Im in a worse position than you are and am nearly completely incapable regardless of treatment and lifestyle changes. When I expressed that to my pain clinic doctor his retort was that fibromyalgia is becoming more of a canceresque diagnosis than a highly specific disease meaning that one persons fibromyalgia could be exceptionally different from anothers. Coupling that with the fact that fibromyalgia is the goto diagnosis for anything that doesnt make sense means that even in a support group like this one your experience can vary wildly from anothers.Most diseases even if specific are on a spectrum. Some take it harder than others some cases are more severe while other cases can be mild. This is true of asthma diabetes heart disease developmental deficiencies and more. Take your pick and theres a bad and theres a notsobad. Fibromyalgia even if its just a shrugoftheshoulders diagnosis still falls under that spectrum. To answer your question Im not able to work. Most jobs athome are still outside my capability since my health doesnt run on a schedule. Ill be hit with a wave of nausea or a wave of pain or a wave of general stress at any given moment that prevents me from concentrating on even menial mental tasks if Im sedentary. At best I could maybe work a job a block or two away for  hours a week maybe. At home I could do live chat reasonably well if I could also do short shifts which no employer grants.

7571448,0,t3_4izpff,On my labs I had a vit D  at  in one point early in my treatment before I knew it was fibro and we were fishing. After months of supplements I got up to  then . I incorporated a ton of vit D loaded foods into my diet and more calcium and low normal where I hover now is like in the thirties. Yes I felt like hell when it was at  and yes I wished and begged for it to be the only thing wrong with me but its not. I feel slightly less like Im going to snap apart or die now but I still dont feel healthy by any means. Dont let your doctor push you into this corner if you truly bring up your numbers and truly do your best to feel human and you dont then your doctor needs to remember that fibro is a multiheaded monster and hes not doing either of you any favors by slowing down treatment. Im fortunate to have a doctor who will keep an open mind and let me try almost anything to feel better. Different meds therapies supplements dietary changes. Hes encouraging and listens. Part of me thinks he doesnt fully believe fibro is real or can be this bad but hes not letting his personal judgment cloud my treatment.

Then out of nowhere an enormous flare up will hit me like a truck.   Even though I might feel fine I have to constantly remind myself of my limits.

7621149,0,t1_d3819mt,Fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism may have some overlapping symptoms but they do not look exactly the same.  I can say from experience that they dont even feel the same. I mean meningitis and the flu have some overlapping symptoms but they are very different illnesses requiring very different treatments.If someone has hypothyroidism and is incorrectly diagnosed with something else based on their blood test maybe it is because their doctor only tested TSH and didnt bother to test the other thyroid hormones which can be just as important in diagnosis in some cases. Instead of going online looking for bogus claims about fibromyalgia being hypothyroidism one should just ask their doctor to test T T and TSH.Treating hypothyroidism based on blood tests makes perfect sense and seems to work quite effectively for most people with that rather common illness. Perhaps some people just need treatment based on T T and TSH levels and not exclusively TSH levels. That makes more sense than all these crazy claims about how  other diseases are actually hypothyroid.Treating by blood tests allows doctors to know more about your illness when they treat you. It means that people can be diagnosed with more accuracy because diseases that look similar or have overlapping symptoms can be more easily distinguished using blood tests along with symptoms.It makes perfect sense that more diagnoses would be created when doctors started treating by blood tests. It means we learned more about diseases and realized that two people with similar symptoms may have totally different diseasessomething that might be more difficult to determine without blood tests. Though honestly blood tests for hypothyroid and the creation of the fibromyalgia diagnosis probably have nothing to do with each other.I didnt take the test because I trust my doctors more than I trust the internet. Also because there is a reason its not used any more. Its because blood tests are more accurate. Maybe some people just arent getting all the blood tests they should.,Fibromyalgia,d38hgr9,1,t5_2qwut

7783574,0,t3_4lwwzj,Yes in both healthy ways and unhealthy. When I was a young teenager   I used to self harm because the endorphins would help with my fibro pain and my endometriosis pain. I didnt quite understand what I was doing I just knew that if I was hurting I could cut my thigh and everything else would hurt less. At the time I thought this was a much healthier alternative to the copious amounts of paracetamol I used to take  which now  at  have ruined my liver. When I was  I started exploring masochism for pain relief  I found out I actually do have some small sexual kinks that allowed me to enjoy masochism for more than just pain relief. Ive always liked controlled pain.  Going to the physio for a really firm and painful massage is a good pain  trying to sit at a desk at work while my hips are on fire is a bad pain.  Epilating my leg hair is a good pain  the shin splints I feel just by existing is a bad pain. Etc Its not for everyone and its so easy to accidentally do something in an unsafe way.

7902314,0,t3_4nf4sp,It is  worth it in my opinion. Before diagnosis you know something is wrong but cant quite put your finger on it but you have this deep unsettling feeling that life shouldnt be that hard. Its like youre trying to fight someone in a dark room and post diagnosis is when the lights are turned on. In other words at least you know what youre up against. Ruling out all other conditions also helps you know that what youre experiencing isnt life threatening so that helped my anxiety a lotknowing that my fatigue wasnt because I had some horrible disease or that my left shoulder pain wasnt a heart attack. And for some back story I have had fibro and inexplicable pain my whole life. The diagnosis didnt change much but it helped me identify what the problem is so I could properly search for solutions. Sometimes knowing what isnt the problem is just as helpful as knowing what is since fibro is a ruleout diagnosis. Just my two cents. I hope you can find some inner peace with it the journey is a long one with bumps along the way but this subreddit is for additional support and were all in this together for the long haul.,Fibromyalgia,d44amik,4,t5_2qwut
7958987,0,t3_4o73hb,I was diagnosed at  about   years ago. While all of us are different here are the things I dodid to maintain my symptoms for the most part As a personal preference I dont take any medicine. I was still in school when I went through all the different options and mind fog was just too much of a hindrance. Almost exactly two years ago today I decided to cut out all the things I was taking Gabapentin Xanax and Ambien to get my mind back. This is purely a lifestyle choice. I also felt the medicine wasnt doing what it used to and after a dependence on Hydrocodone a year prior I didnt want to repeat it. Meditation. My Neurologist suggested this HUGE help. Let your mind relax its a heavy burden to always be in pain. Not to mention the insomnia I have and anxiety issues. Letting your mind take a breather even for  minutes a day might help you rest much easier. I found it made me more alert and generally happier. I dont meditate in the stereotypical sense anymore but more on that later. Eat well. A balanced diet made me feel better about myself. This applies to everyone really but all these changes are due to my diagnosis. I make sure to include plenty of Vitamin D and B as they both contribute to symptoms getting worse if I dont have enough.  Sleep. There will be good days and bad days. But I always give myself at least  hours to sleep. Usually around  since I wake up  times a night according to my smart watch. If I dont sleep enough I dont function.  GO EASY ON YOURSELF. This in my opinion is the most important one. Dont expect yourself to always feel good enough to get through the day. Dont beat yourself up for not giving your job  today. Dont get mad at yourself for having to cancel those plans with your friends. Life is tough enough as it is the only person you can truly count on to not only empathize but to understand is yourself. Never be your own enemy. Now in addition to those things I also have  exercises that I use to gauge how Im doing and to make it through bad days. These both come down to my meditation which I learned from years ago and I think theyre extremely useful. Make a safe place in your mind to go to. This might sound weird but it helps me when Im overwhelmed. I close my eyes slow my breathing and walk into a meadow grass flowing in the breeze mountains covered in snow in the distance sun on my skin. I let myself walk around enjoy the scenery Ive made for myself and escape the world. I can be anything and do anything there its my home away from home and I can go there anytime I want. It took a long time to get to that point but Im glad I do it. What would your future self tell you? About  and a half years ago I was going through a terrible time. I lost my father then went across the country on an internship. I had no one near me for support and buried myself in my work. I couldnt eat couldnt sleep and frankly didnt care about not being able to. It took a few days but I finally got some restful sleep and had a dream that I took as a lesson and applied it to my tough daysdecisions now. In this dream I was stepping back to the time when my first flares started coming. When I didnt know how to manage it and felt like I was stuck in a corner with no one to help. This version of me was labeled in the dream as my present self. I was my future self stepping back to help the guy who felt lost and take him out of the dark. Now without going too far into the dream and all that weird nonsense what I took from it is that I try to do now what my future self would have wished he had done. That doesnt mean asking that girlguy out you like or exercising or whatever. No this comes back to being easy on yourself. Your future self will look back at you and be so proud that you made it past those dark points so heshe could be where they are now. I am so proud of that lost  year old for pulling through and growing into who I am now. We owe our strength now to those dark days when we were learning what to do and being able to reverse that and essentially ask yourself how you want to remember today is pretty valuable. I think all these things are useful whether you have a chronic pain condition or not but I hope this helps feel free to PM if you have any questions or need to vent or anything.tldrEat right sleep well go easy on yourself love yourself.

I also didnt believe the diagnosis and was looking for other answers.  The doctor that fired me had taken over my current doctors practice and told me the very first time he met me that he wouldnt take a patient like me.  Really?!  And what kind of patient is that?  One that isnt easy to fix??When my father was dying of a rare brain tumor I came in asking for sleeping meds and anti anxiety meds to help deal.  He grilled me on the truth of my fathers tumor said he wouldnt see me again and then made me choose which one of the prescriptions I needed most.  He said he wasnt just going to just let me leave empty handed.I took my rx and said thanks but obviously you have no problem brandishing a person with the Scarlett letter if you cant quite grasp their problems.Now in my s I would have taken legal action against him after giving him the calm version of my riot act.That Doctor is an asshole and is afraid to be watched by his superiors for giving out restricted medications even though they are being given to a patient that legitimately requires them.
