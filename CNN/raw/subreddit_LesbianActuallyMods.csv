8849901,0,t1_d7bmifp,Someone who basically starts a conversation about one topic but really they are trying to use that topic to further some other agenda.In this case they are using a discussion about the lesbian identity to question the gender identity of trans women.,LesbianActuallyMods,d7bms1b,4,t5_3fb0q

9142244,0,t1_d8aldry,I will be the first to rip into a guy for so much as referring to a group of grown womyn as girls much less referring to them as bitches but come on its different among womyn. That word doesnt have as much sting and power coming from another womon. Its certainly not nice but it doesnt have the assertion of power and degradation it has when coming from a man. Let me ask you this why do womyn always have to be nice? The fact that most womyn are nice is not some miraculous virtue gifted to us from heaven above and its not even a biological virtue. Its a social construct hammered into us from birth so we will be more servile and docile.,LesbianActuallyMods,d8aufmo,1,t5_3fb0q
9178549,0,t1_d8ffvki,gt First I think the application thread should be in contest mode.It was the contest mode was just removed after it was unstickied.  gt gt Second I think we should be moving to some sort of secret ballot system. I totally agree that we need to start looking at a different voting method.  We have never had a problem in the past but this election was particularly hard. gt gt Third we need some clarity on how many votes can be cast and other voting rules. These are found in the moderation guidelines that were linked in the voting thread.  But we have not ever addressed changing votes. gt gt Fourth we should not permit the afterthefact smear campaigning that occurred on Saturday.Totally agree.  The other mods and I have spoken about the struggles with this vote and it is clear that it will need to be revised for the future.  We are talking about doing a number of different things but we will make sure to keep you all in the loop and get as much feedback as we can before we change the current method.  ,LesbianActuallyMods,d8fg56d,6,t5_3fb0q

9333014,0,t1_d8z07v3,Oh I agree that in a thread about loving vaginas a trans woman should be able to say that.  I misunderstood sorry.I think its obvious that transphobia is rampant as well.  Frankly anything that isnt white cis male and straight will find acceptance here and anywhere really tenuous at times.  Id love to have the luxury of feeling welcome anywhere and everywhere I want to go but that isnt something that Ill ever have.  Oddly Ive seen more of an increase in acceptance and empathy for male pedophiles who havent acted on it on a lot of internet boards than for women and other minorities.  ,LesbianActuallyMods,d8z1073,3,t5_3fb0q

9451457,0,t1_d9d9g5x,I had been thinking about this and my thoughts were . A vote can only be called if a mod breaks the rules.  . I like the idea of a user having to call for the removal in the community forum.. The vote should take in the mod sub in like a special session.   of daily users have to vote for removal.  Right now that would be around  people. If a removal vote passes then it triggers the mods to have to vote  on if to remove a particular mod.  The communities vote   vote towards the mod being removed.  This is the best way I came up with to protect against vote manipulation . Regardless of how the other mods vote if a mod removal vote is voted in by the community then that mod is placed on probation for  month.  These were just my ideasthoughts and not a fully flushed out process,LesbianActuallyMods,d9e1eog,3,t5_3fb0q
