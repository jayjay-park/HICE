5274204,0,t1_cvltpk7,Looks like you are killing it so far mike.  Keep up the good work.  I think you are going to need a bigger stable of champions to be competitive in alliance events and need to more fully rank and level your best guys to hold your own in alliance quests.  You arent quite ready for GUU yet but you are well on your way there.  If you keep grinding you will find many doors open for you within a few weeks.Take careRexKwanDan,ContestOfChampionsLFG,cvlu8bf,1,t5_384zq
