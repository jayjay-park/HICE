10475573,0,t3_5pjns9,  I felt like I was kind of cheating by already knowing a fair bit of House of the Rising Sun and already mostly worked out Friday Im In Love by the time the song choices were posted for this week HotRS was on the list FIIL was not but I wanted to learn that song anyway so I decided to do one I didnt know how to play yet and Buddy Hollys Thatll Be The Day was on the list and I found a tab and a backing track and a lyric page and was good to go. Its a fun s tune and trying to emulate Buddy Hollys vocal nuances is fun too though I flubbed a bit of the second verse oh well!Backing track   Tab   note CAPO ON th FRET! This is not noted in the tab.Huh...in watching this I guess I do make a bit of a solo face when spamming that A triad in the solo. It looks funny.,weeklyguitarist,dcvijjy,5,t5_3hspu
