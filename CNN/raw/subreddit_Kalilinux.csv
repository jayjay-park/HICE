5105551,0,t3_3kwzjt,Ive recently been looking into Chromebooks for a Kali Laptop I particularly like the Toshiba Chromebook . Seen the full HD version for  on Amazon. My plan would be to get a high capacity SDXC card for the built in card reader and use that for most of the storage.

8606827,0,t1_d6h7jlc,Well rufus is just a program that copies an ISO to your USB drive and makes it bootable. So rufus works with many different kind of ISO files windows linux etc. Google rufus and their homepage will come up it has an guide. But its pretty simple. . download rufus and the kali ISO you need. I your case it sounds like you need the bit version.. open rufus select your usb drive select your iso and press StartBut on a side note if you are not familiar with kali or linux you might just wanna create a virtual machine. ,Kalilinux,d6hg5jq,1,t5_2wr4b

10111393,0,t3_5jc8n5,Most likely they are pinning their certificates. This header tells the browser to only accept connections to the site with certs that match their defined thumbprints for a period of time before the header is refreshed with very prints again.This was devised to prevent MITM attacks to decrypt comm against sites using SSL. It isnt too widespread is use but most of the BIG sites are using it. However this also means apps that utilize resources like AWS FB etc will likely fail as well when those resources are requested... so theres bit of a cascading effect happening.There are some ways to work around it in some circumstances what Ive read but I havent dabbled in that area for a while.  I have yet to see any tools like MANA that you can run and blindly interceptmodify all SSL traffic these days. I think the best approach now is to pass along the traffic to sites using the pinning header to avoid alerting the target and just gather what you can from the sites not implementing it. If you are targeting the traffic having the certs pinned youll need to research and find a specific method of attack.  Perhaps someone with more knowledge in that area can elaborate.,Kalilinux,dbpivxn,1,t5_2wr4b
