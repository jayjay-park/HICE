2868918,0,t1_cnu4okh,Well it looks like Ive been beaten to the punch . I could help with some of these though if your interested.Seriously though for anyone else who happens to be reading this I have learned a lot from the inhouse games. I highly recommend getting a mic mine was like  and downloading teamspeak so your team can tell you stuff. Even if you dont win it really makes the game more fun.,NoobsOfTheAncient,cnu73km,3,t5_2y4gz

5952330,0,t3_3wyauc,In my opinion having the round robin will be more fair to the teams that simply having a points system based on previous wins. It will also be more entertaining to viewers and give more opportunities for people to practice casting as I know there are several people who want to practice casting.The only benefit of the points system is that it will be much faster and not require the teams to play the additional games the round robin system would need. ampnbspFrom my personal experience participating in tournaments and being an admin for tournaments I can understand both sides of why some people would like round robin and why others would not. Players might not have the time to also play the round robins and those who would currently benefit from the points system will almost certainly not want to have to go through the round robins if they will already have a spot with the points system. However from my experiences as a tournament admin the round robins definitely leads to a better overall tournament experience and leads to the truly best teams coming out on top.ampnbspSo the real question is does the community want more entertainment and a more fair system or the quick and fast system to get on with the rest of the tournament? ampnbspTLDRAs I said above I am in favor of the round robin system as I feel the time is worth the benefits that system brings.,NoobsOfTheAncient,cxzvpnl,0,t5_2y4gz
