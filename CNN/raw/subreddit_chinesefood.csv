2455518,0,t1_cmenj8k,Im going to disagree and say its kind of weird if you stop talking to them and watch them eat before you continue. I guess everyone has different habits when it comes to eating and talking but if youre socialising with food then surely you have to be eating at some point? I mean dont rush them to answer or anything but I dont think you need to wait for them to swallow to talk to them. The lifting the rice bowl is just an efficient way of eating. Chinese people dont eat rice with spoons and just using chopsticks is either really slow or risks dropping some of it on the way. ,chinesefood,cmf7cs3,3,t5_2r9fn

4130135,0,t1_crr1x7d,I guess I was a little off p That beef and potato dish even has some chinasoviet conflict background when back then people argued whether the potato should go in the pot first or the beef first lol. And old chinese generation from the cold war era see this dish as something with communismrevolution style. Lots of history!,chinesefood,crr253b,2,t5_2r9fn

5027272,0,t1_curywna,Yea like I said Im in Chicago and we have a pretty decent Chinatown. She just went back to school in Indiana where there is only one Chinese restaurant... That she works at and lives above... She likes the family that owns it but its super americanized so I was hoping to give her something a bit more. Ill figure out something. Shes not someone who expects something so by just making the effort shell be happy. I know nothing will be perfect. ,chinesefood,curz77v,1,t5_2r9fn

7236837,0,t1_d20r9e5,Thats just it. They bring the soup out ladel it into the bowls take the bowls away when youre finished bring out the rice in a communal bowl not in individual rice bowls and the only place to put it is on the plate unless you explicitly request another bowl. I always feel as if Im making a special request when I ask them to bring me another rice bowl.,chinesefood,d20ry6v,2,t5_2r9fn
7545434,0,t3_4in6oz,I grew up in northeastern China we are not known for fine cuisine. Sometimes we would eat cabbage pork stew for several days straight. One of the first restaurant I went to when I moved to the US was a Chinese buffet. The orange chicken blew my mind with burst of flavor. ,chinesefood,d2zvnn7,3,t5_2r9fn
