9138086,0,t1_d8ab68k,Sorry. Also is my research post good? I also notice how theres no Aircraft Carriers so I assumed that its still not though off which means Ill have to research prototypes before making the new ship class.,VivetAstrum,d8abhny,1,t5_3camt
9146383,0,t1_d8b2rnb,The would be greeted by not just one ships but the whole fleet of the Classis Ophiuchus. First to greet them would be the military vessels which is surprisingly about the same size as their large military vessels and if the first impression of how they destroy stray asteroids and same level of technological weaponry but only done so on a larger scale.A little bit behind the military vessels would be what look like civilian ships. Colony ship mining ships garden ships and even factory ships. While the two types seems to be normal the third type of ship would be something of a sight. A large several kilometef long asteroid with a small city carved into it. It was an asteroid city ship.The small probe was greeted by an advance drone that examined the drone from top to bottom trying to check its purpose.,VivetAstrum,d8bdc1r,1,t5_3camt

9615095,0,t3_5coe4w,So Ill start it off with a brief outline of what Im thinking.Starting around  Putin begins invading Ukraine under the guise of proRussian Ukranian Rebels eventually annexing the country after the governments collapse in  and a highly coerced referendum in .Next up was Belarus this time a much more friendly takeover. Belarus and Russia have always worked closely together in most matters until by  Belarus was essentially an unwilling puppet state.In  a revolution began successfully deposing President Lukashenko and imposing a Stalinist dictatorship which was promptly deposed in turn by Russian liberators though not until all those opposing a merger were purged by the revolutionaries.The country was officially declared part of the Russian Federation in  to much international protest.Georgia was invaded and formally annexed in  as part of an ongoing series of unofficial wars between the Federation and a theocraticfascist Turkey under President Erdogan.These shadow wars occupied Putins attention until around  when Turkey was finally humbled allowing Russian military dominance over the Middle East particularly Syria.Tensions rose high with the European Federation with Russia several times shutting off oil and gas pipelines leading to widespread civil unrest and distracting its closest enemies.Kazakhstan was invaded in  falling within a month though it soon became a proxy war between a shortlived RussoChinese military alliance and the United States. This lasted until  with the highest US death toll since the Vietnam War and a complete victory to Russia.The RussoChinese alliance soon fell apart in  after a bitter dispute for who would own Mongolia eventually ending in a stalemate as they both agreed to stay out of the former SSR.Tensions between the two rose again as Uzbekistan was invaded  then Kyrgyzstan in  leading to several major skirmishes Tajikistan Armenia and Turkmenistan in  then Afghanistan in  leading to Pakistan uniting with India soon later.In  President Vladimir Putin died of a brain tumour and was succeeded by PresidentForLife Ivan Serenikov ending Russian expansion for several decades until his death in .Next came PresidentForLife Sofia Nikolayevna quickly reigniting the spark of conflict with the European Federation annexing the Baltics through similar means to the annexation of Ukraine then aiding the Imperial States of the Balkans by preventing EF invasion in return for Czechoslovakia in .Poland disgusted by the lack of response to Russian aggression by the European Federation seceded and began a series of wars against Russia covertly backed by the EF Britain and the US.This lasted until  where Poland was finally defeated its proxywarring allies having given up by .Soon after the Peoples Republic of China annexed Mongolia breaking the secret decadesold treaty though President Nikolayevna agreed to allow it without argument in exchange for assistance in a potential Russian annexation of Korea and Sakhalin.In  in order to unite the Federation further it became the SlavSupremacist deeply fascist Slavic States of Eurasia and an even greater rival to the West than the USSR ever was.The invasions of Unified Korea and Japan came in  with assistance from China as it expanded southwards striking the spark for the Grand War.,VivetAstrum,d9y9b2x,1,t5_3camt
