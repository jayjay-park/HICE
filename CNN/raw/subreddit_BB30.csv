180805,0,t1_cez0d3k,Thanks for your response. Yes Im so glad for my yoga classes teaching me proper posture. I can imagine that it also helps against back ache when you have all this weight infront. I have to figure out what foods and beverages bloat me up. I never thought about this before. Thanks for this hint.,BB30,cez1376,2,t5_2zasz
251194,0,t1_cf6ecj4,My doctor and midwife both told me this. Whatever youre doing now continue to do it but dont add. If youre currently running K you can continue to do that throughout your pregnancy unless you encounter issues and a professional tells you to stop but dont suddenly decide to start running K. Also use your head maybe doing crunches when youre  months pregnant doesnt make a lot of sense. Im  years old  weeks along and continue to work out twice a day minutes of cardio in the morning and an hourlong strength or cardio class at lunch. I want to be a healthy mom who avoids gestational diabetes and other complications but also I feel like garbage when I dont exercise!,BB30,cf6sh3z,2,t5_2zasz
252688,0,t3_1wxyh6,I didnt exercise at all during the first trimester once the hideous nausea and fatigue hit at around  weeks.  The first few weeks I kept to my normal routines long walks swimming some elliptical but during the month I was nauseous all the time I didnt do ANYTHING.  Now that Im in the second trimester Im back to the gym  times a week swimming rowing machine elliptical and I walk a few more times a week.,BB30,cf6y1tk,2,t5_2zasz

479467,0,t3_1zlcdd,I think I had some mild symptoms in week  or so though if I hadnt known I was pregnant I would have just thought I was feeling off. I remember feeling the brunt of morning sickness at about  weeksright when we were visiting the inlaws for Christmas correlation??. For me it would rear its ugly head anytime I didnt get a good nights sleep. Unfortunately sleeping poorly also turned out to be a symptom late in the first trimester thats continuing into the second and though Ive found a way to manage it a bad night will basically make me feel like I have a nasty hangover the next day.The other thing I found myself thinking was that morning sickness helped me feel like I was actually pregnant. But...dont wish that on yourself! Its really much better without it!,BB30,cfurobx,1,t5_2zasz
499420,0,t3_1ztn3e,I think I could eat avocados every day. Id have to take out a small loan to afford that habit but I would do it.

837572,0,t1_cgvk4gh,gt  I find it quite frustratinggt  he calls me a pessimist gt  Im just trying to plan for scenarios which could realistically occur ... unforeseen holdup gt  helps me to control my anxiety to know there are plans not necessarily highly detailed more a sketch to deal with these possibilities. gt  His take on it is hell do everything while working and presumably eatingsleeping occasionally. gt  might sound sweet at first but.. I know it wont work.Oh dear I just had EXACTLY those thoughts today but I learnt something too. Before we signed a lease for the the new flat I wanted to discuss one more time our financial backup strategy at breakfast. Im selfemployed and my clients are cancelling contracts left right and center because apparently a mother is unfit to work. In a lighter worst case scenario I need to bridge approximately  months until I could potentially join a company. During this time frame he needs to at least double his current average income. Worst case scenario I dont even want to think about myself yet... i.e. bridge time until kindergarten. He is scared too so his default reaction is avoidance paired with pouting. He simply says yes yes it will work and hes got this and that planned but all of this and that is in reality just maybes that like last Sunday got cancelled on the day whilst he misses real jobs because he forgot to record his new phone number on the answering machine of his old phone and job requests by old contacts are consequently missed as we found out today. And yes I told him half a year ago to record his new phone number on the old voice box just in case. So nothing is fixed income because the majority in his industry work on verbal agreements.It is not his fault. I knew from the beginning who he was and I chose him for his other qualities. I always wanted to be the main breadwinner and its me who is defaulting. So after breakfast I was able to keep it together so I could focus on the lease agreement at the real estate agent and do some final negotiation with them. I was also calm and collected when we did one final round of the flat to measure and figure out once more what needs to be done.But the moment I dropped him off back at work I called mom ... onions in my car everywhere. Couldnt stop the whole afternoon. I said the words I always forbid myself I cant do this. I cant do this all on my own. And for this afternoon I really believed it. Scary I know.I think mom called SO or SO had sudden epiphany because he for the first time understood to simply call and say it will work and hell be there. I couldnt believe it he did even research gas electricity and internet service offers without me prompting him. I had said it more as note to myself today at the new flat and he remembered and did all the work. Im still all whiny but one thing is certain I can do this but I indeed cant do it on my own. I need to learn how to put more trust in the SO and empower him to take over responsibility his way. Gives me shakes when I think about this but I need to let go of micro management or Ill go absolutely crazy over the next couple of months with all these hormones tricking me too.My SO on the other hand needs to learn that sometimes all it takes is to tell me that itll work out. Other times he needs to give me a little bit of security by playing my planning games with me to comfort my anxiety. Maybe tell your SO this. ,BB30,cgzhgkh,1,t5_2zasz

1045678,0,t1_chn50zo,Have you tried searching for beach pants palazzo pants? I got a few pairs a while ago and they are without any doubt the most comfortable pants I have ever owned. Mine are a really wide leg made from Lycraswimming material so they are super soft and stretchy with a fold over waist so you can have it high or low on your waist as you feel on the day. I bought them long before I got pregnant and at the time though gee these would be comfy with a baby belly...  weeks in Im love them more every day!If youre in the northern hemisphere you might be in luck going into summer?,BB30,chn5cok,2,t5_2zasz

I am  weeks and am over the stares and comments bending over to get anything not being comfortable sittingsleepingeating my toddler sitting ON my stomach just about everything nasty happening in my nether regions wont give details but there are a lot of unfortunate things going on down there being out of breath doing anything and attempting to shave my legs.I am so grateful for a healthy pregnancy but in all honesty I hate being pregnant. Hated it the first time around too. So worth it but so done.,BB30,ci9qkxb,7,t5_2zasz

1339414,0,t1_cik8hih,A lot of people say that so Im not feeling too bad about not having everything done. In fact itll actually be pretty nice to work on things after the week postpartum period without this giant bump in the way!My mom said she put me into my own room after two weeks because I had a touch of apnea and itd wake her up every time. However shes a pretty light sleeper and I am not so hopefully we wont have that issue.,BB30,cikasvm,1,t5_2zasz
1345012,0,t3_28xawu,Prepare to have all rules broken with babysitting if there is any resistance  and plan accordingly. We have one hold out smoker in the family  does not smoke in the house but also has a sweatshirt to wear when smoking that then must come off hands washed  etc. when around grandkids.   No idea why with all that hassle and the rest of the family quitting there is still any smoking going on. ,BB30,cikxhat,2,t5_2zasz

1956168,0,t3_2h2qgg,If you are doing a home birth or going to a birthing centre with a midwife and you run into a problem where you end up going to a hospital you wont need someone to fight the doctors. The only reason that change would happen is because you or your baby are in danger and fighting the doctors is the last thing you should be worrying about.If youre going to be in a hospital from the beginning dont pick a doula based on her ability to fight the doctors. The doctors are there to help you and your baby. Fighting them isnt going to get you good results. Pick your doula on her ability to support you through the birth.,BB30,ckox6f6,5,t5_2zasz
1976625,0,t1_ckrdipb,Establish before hand if you want pictures of the birth itself. I would have liked to have a pic of what was going on because I couldnt see but no one knew that and I was in no shape to speak words let alone form coherent sentences for things like asking for a mirror or telling DH to photo op maybe the most traumatic thing hes ever seen. Id have also liked a pic of him all bloody and cheesy and naked on me I dont think Ill ever forget it but itd be nice to traumatize my as of yet childless friends. ,BB30,ckrdt82,2,t5_2zasz

2717456,0,t1_cncbrzu,Ive only left baby with my husband once while I had coffee with a friend  minutes down the road and I was so anxious the entire time I felt sick to my stomach. He just cant handle the crying like I can. He gets so anxious and frustrated. I mean I do too but I definitely handle it better. Also I have that secret weapon hint its boobs. Im participating in a clinical study on breastfeeding benefits and had to be without baby for about an hour while I had tests done... They had someone to watch him and even though it was a complete stranger for some reason I was so relaxed that I fell asleep even while hooked up to monitors and stuff. And I totally feel you on the surreal vacation thing. Its hard for me to accept that Ive been out of work for almost  months already. First of all Im working my ass off way more than I ever did at work! And also it just cant possibly have been that long...right? ,BB30,cncyp6y,2,t5_2zasz
4120530,0,t3_37rmuk,Also  weeks but with !  Ive been really lucky with nausea just a generalized queasiness for the most part.  Whats helped me has been crackers and gingerale.  One trick I learned last time around about an hour and a half to two hours after a meal eat a handful of crackers even if youre not feeling queasy.  Frequently the nausea is actually caused by an empty stomach.  Frequent small snacks keep your stomach from getting empty and can stop the nausea before it starts.So jealous that youre having an examultrasound already!  My OB group doesnt do initial exams until  weeks and no ultrasound until !  I understand why they do it that way but Im so impatient!,BB30,crpyrts,3,t5_2zasz

4944108,0,t3_3iihp0,I dont know if this is comforting but I remember after reaching the nd trimester safe point realizing theres no magical boundary beyond which shes safe. Even at  months old things could happen to her. So I made a conscious decision just to enjoy each moment. Of course I took my vitamins and I keep her from sticking her fingers in electrical sockets but I know life is precious... Not sure if this makes sense or helps.,BB30,cuhqta3,2,t5_2zasz
