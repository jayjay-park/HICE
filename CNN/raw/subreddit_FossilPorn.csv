4042385,0,t3_367lo5,These paleontological specimens from Fossil Insect Canyon occur in calcareous composed primarily of calcium carbonate concretions that are present within a rather narrow horizon in the middle Miocene Barstow Formation. The insects associated arthropods and diatoms can easily be set free by immersing the stones in a diluted acid solution. The dissolved nodules are then rinsed and neutralized of any remaining acid. The material is dried screened and examined by scope for any fossil fauna. This was the best find so far but there were also numerous parts from fairy shrimp beetles flies mosquito pupa and amazing amounts of fairy shrimp coprolites.,FossilPorn,crh29s4,1,t5_2vnw6
