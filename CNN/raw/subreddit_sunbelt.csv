2220418,0,t1_cllsuuc,I watched this one. I did not see the spitting or the extra point foul saw it later when someone pointed it out. You should go back and watch it anyway. It was like two Georgia Southern Offenses playing against Savannah State Defenses.  total yards of offense and quite a few very impressive and lucky plays. I enjoyed it. ,sunbelt,clm2gth,3,t5_2wjy0

Looks like some Sun Belt bros have some scheduling work to do.UAB must pay Tennessee  and Kentucky  to get out of those games. The Blazers also must pay for canceling future homeandhome series in  and  with Troy  South Alabama  and Georgia State  which will cost UAB a total of  million to end.

5035070,0,t1_cusw4by,Im giving them more credit then they deserve for simply winning Ill admit that. But since almost everyone in the conference was playing teams that far outmatched them its near impossible to get an accurate feeling for how good anyone is. Its only the first week rankings it will change a lot throughout the season. You know what they say a win is a win.,sunbelt,cusx18a,1,t5_2wjy0

5184226,0,t3_3ly394,  we havent slayed a giant since this renaissance with Hud though perhaps sans re as weve never been a great team but we were always determined to stay FBS even though southland descended and we were independents for awhile and then in the WAC before LATech. we then came to SBC and LATech went out there.  as i said we got close with the kentucky game this year and the  florida a few years back not being able to hold onto the win in the waning seconds both of which i put on Huds back especially florida being so late in the season but i still love Hud so much  anyways regionally weve had a surge with Hud I marched in the band  where  i saw two of the three wins of the year at ULM and stAte with the god awful heat. weve really started packing cajun field and likewise the louisiana superdome for our bowl wins. i think our name is kitchy enough that people who are bored and its the only bowl game on or midweek game they might pull for us. but i dont think we will get any movement nationally anytime soon with baton rouge casting shade upon the whole state which has a wealth of talent but many of them are used to go to baton rouge or go out of state. we are trying to change that but im not sure how well its going. in FBS you have baton rouge obviously far and away and then LATech and us sort of neck and neck depending on who you ask and then monroe that has spurts of life every now and then also credit where credits due monroe made a whole lot of noise knocking off an arkansas team that was though preseason to be awesome though that whole season was hot garbage if I am not mistaken but still they slayed a giant much more recently than we did,sunbelt,cvaw0zr,1,t5_2wjy0
