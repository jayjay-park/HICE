9333304,0,t3_58ak1n,You need a permit to carry a concealed weapon  that is a pistol that is loaded or could readily be loaded and which is obscured from view.If you do have a CHP and you are carrying a pistol you are obligated to inform law enforcement officers that you come in contact with that you are carrying. But only CHP holders and only while they are carrying. You do not have a duty to inform if you are open carrying. And you especially do not have a duty to inform if you have an unloaded gun that is not accessible to you in your car on the way to the range. So if you get pulled over keep your mouth shut about the gun in the trunk.You do not need a permit to open carry  that is to carry a weapon which is loaded or could readily become loaded and which is not obscured from view.As a practical matter the chance that you are going to be on the receiving end of a man with a gun call is low anyway because most people are not that aware of the people around them. And especially if you arent open carrying in order to get attention youd be better of worrying about being struck by lightning its so unlikely.If you do come into contact with the police and if they find out you have a gun in your car you still dont have to prove that you own the gun. We dont have a gun registry in North Carolina there isnt a Federal Registry and private firearm sales are legal in this state. They can ask to run the serial numbers to check against a list of known stolen firearms and in the interest of not making trouble for yourself you should let them. But unless they have some specific articulable reason to believe that you are in possession of a stolen gun andor you are not legally eligible to own a gun felony record for example they cant hold you they cant arrest you and they cant confiscate your gun.,NCGuns,d8z2bwi,4,t5_2x1vl
