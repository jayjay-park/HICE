The word sex wouldnt even be in use at the time as it derives from Latin so I do think its a little too anachronistic when there are plenty of suitable alternatives that are in use even today. Its not as if have sex is the only way to express it in a way that viewers could comprehend. Exhusband was also stupid for the same reason  former husband would have sufficed and been far less jarring.

1126610,0,t3_23yqh9,I agree from the moment he appeared he tried to use Ragnar like I felt he only sent Ragnar to Borg as a way of saying I have this famous powerful warrior on my side hand over the land.Then he reneges on the post battle agreement they had all agreed on which has the end result of Borg attacking and capturing Kattegat. Which was in response to the perceived slight against Borg by Ragnar but which we as the viewers know was Horiks call.Once the Vikings return to Wessex Horiks shot sighted desire for revenge scuttles any attempt at negotiation with Ecbert after Horiks son leaders and ambush against Ecberts son. Its heavily implied this was and attempt to show up Ragnars negotiations with Ecbert a way of saying Im the King and fuck your negotiations.The end result is a devastating defeat for the vikings in battle against EcbertAella due to his decision to take Ecberts bait and rush in against Ragnars advice. Having clearly lost Ragnars trust if not support by this stage he then plots to have Ragnar his family and closest supporters taken out to quash the perceived threat Ragnar is to his reign. Thankfully Ragnar is proved to have taken precautions against this and Siggy and Floki act as double agents against Horik.Overall a pretty annoying character and his defining trait seems to have been to make powerful enemies Bolg Ecbert and finally Ragnar.,vikingstv,chwcpjg,1,t5_2wj4c

3394428,0,t1_cpf5qnw,I think that Hirst has been rather respectful of religion on both sides this far while also pitching the idea that they are very different and not so different at the same time. He hasnt really gone in depth either way other than to establish how the people relate to and interact within the systems and to flesh out the conflicts caused by the differences and similarities.Hes handling things with kid gloves while he tries to pull story out but he isnt perfect and its not inconceivable that hes guiding us to early conclusions that hell bash later.Remember the finale last season?

3459820,0,t3_2zu3jy,Yeah I was not making much sense of this plan.He already made such a public fuss over Aethelwulf being responsible.  He couldnt maintain a story that some raiders had killed the Northmen.  Which is weird because they seemed hellbent on slaughtering every one of them so it initially appeared the directors intent was to blame outsiders.I dont get the root out those who were disloyal to me.  In what way?  WTF was that?  Actually refusing to help Aethelwulf slaughter them was actually consistent with Ecberts official policy while joining Aethelwulf was consistent with what Ecbert actually wanted for the kingdom  and not really grounds for disloyalty. I mean people were bitching that Ecbert shouldnt allow pagan colonists.  Ecbert wholly agreed underneath and figured anyone who thought otherwise was crazy... so why would he seek to eliminate those who DID join Aethelwulf?And the ruse is pointless.  He already publicly showed Aethelwulf was responsible and too closely tied to him to deflect any blame.  And theyre fucking barbarians who will be raged even if the plan was better at distancing the actor from Ecbert there wouldnt be any chance for a relationship with the Northmen.Sooo not following this logic.  IMHO this would have gone SO MUCH better if they had simply returned and found the settlement destroyed and played out a guessing game of how it happened.,vikingstv,cpmn8i4,2,t5_2wj4c

4843527,0,t3_3h7wzi,In addition to the very secular reasons listed such as knowing he wont be betrayed by Aethelstan theres a fact that has been played down a little more than the first season but still illustrates a very important part of Ragnars mindset. The Norse pantheon is different from other pagan subsets as the people did not feel their gods were out of reach. Their spiritual system functions not outside of their reach and even among this idea Ragnar is a particularly spiritual person or at least believes himself to be closer to the gods. He claims to be a descendant from Odin though this could be metaphor or perhaps a function of Norse boasting and at times goes so far as to perceive Odins presence. His closest ally prior to Aethelstans arrival is Floki the Norseman with the seemingly closest connection to the gods.As the Christian system of religion and spirituality is introduced I think Ragnar began trying to somehow parse the spiritual systems within himself and his mind and as such the angel and devil on his shoulders though to a less morally polar extent become Floki and Aethelstan the two men closest to the gods.,vikingstv,cu52a9d,22,t5_2wj4c

6765714,0,t1_d0j53au,Well you are right. The political reason at first was something benign. Both Greek and Latin parts recognized primacy of Rome. The Bishop and Patriarch of Rome was first among equals. The problem was that the pope didnt like the equals part. You see. Christianity had this concept of  seas Rome Constantinople Antioch Jerusalem and Alexandria. Bishops of those cities had additional jurisdiction over big parts of the Roman Christian Empire. Roman sea was the biggest as covering all of the Western Empire and no one questioned the primacy of the popes as successors to Apostle Peter. But at one point the papacy had this agenda that not only they should be the first but also the master of all other seas. That didnt go so well. But Only after Charlemagnes coronation Roman Emperors in the East tried to establish Ecumenical dominance of the sea of Constantinople as opposition to Rome. In fear that Charlemagne or his successors would take on Caesarpapist roles in the West and they were completely right It was the plan. Holy Roman Emperors tried to establish dominance over the pope in religious matters up until the th century. But that didnt go too well and that is one of the reasons why later Holy Roman Emperors were elected and not crowned by the Pope. ,vikingstv,d0j68z5,2,t5_2wj4c

My main issues with Vikings tend to be lack of budget or slight laziness with detail  quite often when they are rowing in the boats the paddles barely flap into the water that bothers me more than it probably should. Some of the battles have been a bit poorly choreographed as well.I much prefer the setting the lead characters are much better than any in GoT  who rivals Ragnar or Athelstan or King Egbert?  but it is less well known and much smaller budget.,vikingstv,d5pqxae,3,t5_2wj4c

And Ill probably end up liking Alfred due to the actor as well FWP seems cool on Instagram. Hopefully they address Athelstan in B and  as Alfred grows up. I think a lot of fans will like him because of his ties to Athelstan. No doubt theyre going to give his character a lot of depthI think there are a number of reasons why Ivars going to be so well received. Most people know the history regarding his character and how he avenged Ragnar and it looks like theyre making Ivar the chosen son in B. The cast says that he makes an incredibly interesting character as well. He seems to be a favorite among them. But yeah I hope they dont make Ivar borderlineevil.

9882205,0,t1_davnx47,Heres the quote Vikings Season B relays how Bjorn chooses to take a different path from Ragnar Lothbrok and Ivar to journey into the Mediterranean with Floki Gustaf Skarsgard. Michael Hirst reveals that Rollo will not only help the firstborn of the Kattegat king and shield maiden Lagertha Katheryn Winnick in B for this journey. Rollo will also be well and truly entrenched in the episodes of Vikings Season .Heres the link to whole thing I can only see  reasons for him wanting Bjorn to concede any hold on Kattegat one hes just being a prick and  he has some idea of trying to take it himself.....though neither make any sense to me.  He couldnt rule Kattegat AND part of France at the same time.  I suppose it could be something else he wants that is only possible if Bjorn isnt King.....BUT by the time this meeting would take place Bjorn wont be King of anything anyway.Im confused terribly too.

10597361,0,t3_5qjx3t,This is the best answer I found out about that sword and most it original history. It long though but very detailed.Logo Kurt ScheuererCollection of information about the history of IngolstadtDr. Werner KarlAnanizapta  A mysterious inscription of the Middle Ages There are stones whose inscriptions begin with the word ananizapta on the two oldest gates of the medieval town wall of Ingolstadt the Old Feldkirchner Gate from the year  and the former Harder Gate from the year .Inscription on the Old Feldkirchner Gate. Photo Dr. Werner KarlInscription on the Old Feldkirchner Gate in Ingolstadt Photo Dr. Werner KarlInscription on the former Harder Gate. Photo Stadtarchiv IngolstadtInscription on the former Harder Gate in Ingolstadt Photo Stadtarchiv IngolstadtIn  Dr. Werner Karl published a new interpretation of this word.The oldest document where Ananizapta is found is a manuscript of Erfurt from the year  cod. Amplon. Quart Nr. . Dr. Karl found out that the gates of Ingolstadt are the only gates with the word Ananizapta. He also found the word in the prayer books of the Emperor Maximilian I Older Prayer book from  v Newer Prayer Book from  which Albrecht Drer decorated with marginal drawings  fol.v and on a bell beginning of the th century in Strelln in Sachsen Saxony.Dr. Karls interpretation is also applicable to other spellings of the wordAnanyzapta  Coventry  Ring th century British MuseumAnanizzapta  manuscript  of the University Library of Graz after Ananiszapta  gold ring th century British MuseumAnanisapta  great prayer bell of the Ulm Cathedral Ananisabta  on a ring Goethe received in  on a silver chelice of the early th century Victoria and Albert MuseumThe letter z obviously changed into the letter s in the course of time.On the stone of the Harder Gate the letter z of the inscription has got a little tail. This made Dr. Karl suppose that the letter z dragon with the tail of the devil is the abbreviation of the Greek  latin word zabolus  devil the letter s of the spelling Ananisapbta can be explained by analogy as the abbreviation of satanas  satan.Dr. Karls theory was confirmed by the Enchiridion Leonis papae.This book is ascribed by tradition to Pope Leo III who is said to have given this handbook as a present to Charles the Great.In the best print Mainz  Johazath is written asymmetrically arranged under Ananizapta. The whole is surrounded by four crosses and the letters I a g.aus Enchiridion Leonis papae. Mainz  Anani z apta  Joha z athAccording to the medieval way of thinking the devil is the agent of all disorder and confusion therefore the asymmetrical arrangement. Dr. Karl thinks that the letters z zabolus  devil in Ananizapta and in Johazath are the logical axis which divides the two words into four parts of words.These parts of words however put into disorder by the devil are connected to a meaningful order by the stylistic figure of the chiasmus  the name comes from the Greek letter Chi X  cross  initial letter of the Greek word for Christ XPISTOS.So the parts of words Anani and ath belong together as well as apta and Joha as the cross of Christ crosses  destroys the two letters z devilAn an i  ath is the abbreviation ofAnathema anathema IesusA curse a curse on Jesus! Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians that means A curse on the devil!apta  Joha is the abbreviation ofbaptismate Johannisbecause ofthrough the baptism of JohnDr. Karl thinks that the meaning of the whole formula isJesus Christ defeated death the devilby being baptized by Johnand by dying on the cross chiasmus.geometrische Struktur der AnanizaptaJohazathFormel. Zeichnung Dr. KarlAnaniath and aptaJoha consist of eight letters each. The number eight is a symbol of the baptism which gives eternal life through the remission of sins therefore the form of the octagon for baptisteries.The letters I a g which surround this formula in the form of an equilateral triangle are a symbol of the secret of the Holy agia Trinity.Dr. Karl analysed the geometrical structure of the AnanizaptaJohazathformulaThe builders of the gates of Ingolstadt probably didnt know the exact meaning of this formula particularly since they only used its abbreviation Ananizapta. But they were certainly aware of its beneficial effect on averting all evil.Summary Kurt Scheuerer Werner KarlAnanizapta  eine geheimnisvolle Inschrift des Mittelaltersa mysterious inscription of the Middle AgesSammelblatt des Historischen Vereins Ingolstadt .

10600664,0,t1_dd9c0ai,I never said that they would do anything about it now. Ragnar trail for the murder of his Jarls man during the first raid on England was only held when they were back in Kattegat. But if they followed Nordic law that they could do something later on if they chose to do so. I didnt like Sigurd that much but my irritation is based more about the shows bad writing and seeming unwillingness to follow the rules they set up. You can argue that Bjorn could see Ivar as a unhinged liability that who wants his mother dead. He has the opportunity and his right to request a thing be held and where he can accuse Ivar of murder of his brother without justified reason which witnesses can attest to. Lagertha has to abide because it is a jarls duty to oversee these claims. She might not want to impose a sentence on him because she would never kill his sons but if a jury finds him guilty she still needs to pass a sentence. Imprisonment or exile are other possible sentences. ,vikingstv,dd9dlj2,4,t5_2wj4c

Youre not even going against the point im making about Sigurd being killed for his trash acting by saying the helgatorvi were only there cuz they are writers daughters otherwise they too wouldve been killed off a lot earlier.So Ivar and ragnars children have qualities of their father is apparently equivalent to horrible acting. Guess you cant be father like son. Ivar is a smart psychotic kid with anger issues and he portrays that really well. Rest of them are decent enough realize youre probably the only few who claim they suck at acting.Also Bjorn actor was never that great at acting either i personally found him to be just ok but he also looks like a badass he has kinda been going down hill a bit but still far better than Sigurd who looks like writer grabbed his neighbours kid at the last minute.Tell me this out of all ragnars kids which one of them was the worst actor to you.
