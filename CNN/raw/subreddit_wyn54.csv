5035925,0,t3_3jwvs4,I play Super Smash Bros. Melee competitively. Theres an intercollegiate competition for it called The Melee Games. Duke had a team which was slated to play UNC at the first event. Duke had played against UNC in the spring and lost pretty badly so everyone expected us to lose again in the rematch. But the other players on our team ignored that  they wanted nothing more than the win. They wanted revenge. The day of the UNC game I didnt sleep enough and it showed. Right before the UNC game starts I lose several games I know I shouldnt. Starting to think Ill underperform I know no feeling would hurt more than letting down the team.The battle begins. It starts out quiet but as it goes on a crowd starts to gather. Theres trash talking and cheering at all times to the point where voices start to hurt. Unfortunately were behind when its my turn go in. If I dont start the comeback were bound to lose. This should be the most stressful moment in my Melee career. But strangely its not. Im at peace. I decide to have fun. I dont worry about technical play I just enjoy the moment. However I have a slow start and while Im still having fun I begin to think I wont be the one to start the comeback.Then my opponent makes a mistake.He uses a dodging move that sends him off the stage killing him. His play becomes nervous. I capitalize and start taking a lead. He makes a mistake again. At a moment where I should be dead he saves me. I keep riding my momentum and get eliminated taking five stocks well above my expectations.Several games later the battle ends with a very close loss and we feel we should have won. But the energy the intensity of the games the feeling of playing well and defying expectations and most importantly the people on both teams my friends gathering to play a game they love  that was the happiest any video game has ever made me.,wyn54,cut0qv4,1,t5_2vlf2
