3728901,0,t3_333zjf,been a pretty awesome week beerwise and hopswise around the country and wine wise but we wont go into that right now other than to say vintage  is looking pretty stonking most placesill post in the order in which Ive tried thingsCassels Fresh Hop Ale kicked things off for my fresh hop experiences as a disappointment upon sampling last Saturday. they did rush it out to be first on the taps but its obviously buttery. diacetyl issues i did not order a pint.Funk Estate Fresh Hop Oh Lordy decent pale ale character maybe a little thin if im gonna be super picky but great floral hop aromas and hangs together quite well on the palate. yummo i can and will drink more of this.Renaissance Grandmaster was one of my top picks in last years cohort despite my general predisposition against high octane jampacked fresh hop beers in my not so humble opinion theres a delicacy that gets lost and abv serves the purpose far better than going stupid. despite past years being a study in how to do it well the new release just misses the mark being a bit flabby on the palate and overall more barleywinelike than IPAlike. which fair enough is what it kinda says on the back label but yeah na its not a repeat purchase for meRenaissance Fresh Hop Black The RIPA holy shit this is a WIN. whatever befell the above release the stars seemed to align here. the tightness that the dark malts and the rye add to the palate serve the zippy nature to this years harvest which overall seems particularly zesty and kinda waxy interestingly very very well. fruity fleshy balanced if youve not had it get your hands on this IMMEDIATELY because it will disappear when everyone realises what genius it is.Three Boys Fresh Hop Golden Ale last year was a total winner for me. its exactly the style of beer that to me best serves the character of fresh hops. this years kinda like the Funk Estate is just a little tightly wound presently but i think  weeks will see it drinking beautifully.Tuatara Conehead sat at the top of the fresh hop league table for me last year and again its right up there. a hint of malt sweetness nice body once it warms up in the glass a wee bit and great hop aroma that carries through into a little more bitterness on the palate than pretty much everything else. RIPA aside though thats helped out by the rye etc this for me was the beer that brought about the realisation that this years hops seem to have quite a waxy character. not bad not good just a function of the ripening and season as a whole. would be interesting to understand the chemistry behind it in some respects but really lets just drink the shit outta this shit before it disappears in the very near future while fresh hops allow us two of the best month of the whole beer calendar.what have you enjoyed so far?,NZBeer,cqhbi84,2,t5_2vm34
