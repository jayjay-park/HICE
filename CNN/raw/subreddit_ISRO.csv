5286174,0,t3_3ner0k,gt We are  progressing steadily. The engine was tested successfully in July. The next stage of the development is the integration of all the systems that make up the whole  cryogenic stage. The fully integrated stage will be ground tested within six  monthsgt IPRC will test the stage as a whole on the ground for up to  times the duration for which a mission will require it fired. The next step will see the stage tested at  Sriharikota with complete autonomy of systems. Once that is done the project can be taken forward. We actually hope to have the Mark III developed by next year. However that is only a target not a prediction said the official. The initial version of the GSLV Mk III however is likely to have a payload capability of  kg with the systems being optimised in a staggered manner.,ISRO,cvndcwx,2,t5_2u3ww
5631395,0,t3_3rz1o0,Found this in the new book Fishing Hamplet to Red PlanetIn section Initiatives on Indian Human Space Flight by S.UNNIKRISHNAN NAIRgtA committee of experts undertook an initial study to assess the need and requirements for an Indian manned mission both short term and long term. A report titled Indian Manned Space Mission Initiative  A Project Proposal was prpared in November . The report suggested that the manned mission can be carried out using a variant of GSLV with human rating. The proposed programme envisaged developing a fully autonomous orbital vehicle to carry a crew of two to a  km Low Earth Orbit LEO and safely return to a predetermined destination on Earth. The orbital vehicle named as Manav an acronym for MANned Access Vehicle consisted of two parts Crew Module CM where crew would be residing and Service Module SM. The SM would be discarded after deorbiting. A semiballistic aerodynamic configuration was proposed for the CM as the aerodynamic lift generated could be effectively utilised for reducing the heat load on it and also for being flexible in selecting the landing site. There was provision for aborting the mission and rescuing the crew during any phase of the ascent mission. This report was discussed in various forums. Finally in August  the ISRO Policy Planning Committee IPPC unanimously endorsed the programme.  In June  Director VSSC constituted another study team to bring out a comprehensive document on human space programme covering all aspects such as the need for an Indian Manned Space Mission cost of undertaking such a mission infrastructure to be built and the overall schedule. The study team prepared a detailed report titled Proposal for Indian Manned Space Programme. This proposal went through a number of reviews and modifications. This second study team did detailed system engineering and arrived at a configuration with humanrated GSLVMk II as the launch vehicle as it had adequate margin to meet future mass growth in orbital vehicle and payload reduction due to human rating of launch vehicle.  Taking inputs from various reviews the document was revised and presented to the ISRO Council in October . After incorporating appropriate suggestions in November  the modified proposal was put up for debate to a national committee comprising about eighty eminent scientists and technocrats of the country. With wholehearted enthusiasm the committee shared ISROs view that this was a programme which would instil fervour into the scientific and technological community of the country and would fetch both direct and indirect benefits in many areas.gtSELECTION OF CONFIGURATION OF CREW MODULE Studies conducted indicated that the aerodynamics of the Crew Module was primarily governed by its forward base diameter and the side wall angle. Therefore a comparative study of four typical manned capsules with varying base diameter and side wall angles was undertaken to arrive at the baseline configuration. The final configuration was selected after a detailed examination of many attributes like aerodynamic characteristics structural and thermal protection system mass volume needed for crew and various subsystems etc.  The objective of the HSP is to carry a crew of two to LEO and return them safely to a predefined destination on Earth.  The main features of the mission are  Mission duration is a few hours for the first mission and extendable up to seven days.Emergency mission abort and crew escape provision is provided. CM has capability to manoeuvre in atmosphere along both down and cross ranges.Deceleration acceleration is within  g considering crew comfort.gtA National Committee was constituted by the Prime Ministers Office in February  with Shri Montek Singh Ahluwalia Deputy Chairman Planning Commission as the Chairman to examine the desirability and need for HSP.  The committee had a comprehensive look at the project report including the rationale need desirability technological capability progress made so far and the preparedness for implementation. The committee unanimously recommended that the project report submitted by the Department of Space DOS may be processed for further necessary sanctions so that the programme which is a part of the approved eleventh FiveYear Plan could be implemented without delay.  HUMANRATED LAUNCHER ISROs next generation launch vehicle LVM is gaining momentum and the first experimental flight with passive cryo was a total success. The first development flight of LVM with the indigenous cryo stage is scheduled for . LVM has fewer numbers of stages and more payload capability than GSLVMk II. Moreover with LVM payload capability longduration human space flight with a habitat module can be configured in future. Humanrated LVM is now identified as the launch vehicle for Indian HSP.,ISRO,cwv4lyj,1,t5_2u3ww
5656642,0,t1_cwxxqfm,No more details on boosters..The only time they are mentioned is on that official HLV page... About too many vehicles well... this is way far into future so why not take out PSLVgeneric version will get phased out as per book GSLV and LVM and replace these with ULV which interestingly isnt mentioned in book as far as I see! The point of ULV should be to phase out these hypergolic using LVs and haul upto  tonne range. Dont know where RLV fits in all this. They say test article is th or th scaled and it is around . m in length.. slides show TSTO upper stage with staged kn cryo engine which we know nothing about...go figure.Where else that C would go if these stages are not for same core. Interesting note on fairing and yeah makes no sense in depicting that in this manner may be try and make some size comparison based on volume LHLOX tankage must take...also note that there is no intertank truss structure in HLV like GSLV and LVM. On projected capacity people said same thing about LVM too that  tonne appears less. I really dont know enough on this hence the reason I put it out so some people can debate over it PGoing by Isro naming convention.. these future vehicles would end with LV or LVM ,ISRO,cwy9f8p,2,t5_2u3ww

BTW this development is also very interesting Conceptual Development of Pilot Scale Green Propulsion System for Future Space Application in Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO .Starting March With the advent of manned and interplanetary missions to space as envisaged by ISRO development of a noncryogenic simple and reliable advanced green propulsion system has become a necessity. With increased space launches the continuous development of propulsion systems with environmentfriendly propellants with low emissions has become imperative. The current project is about designing and modeling a  kgs flow gas generator based on hypergolic ignition of Ethanolamine amp Hydrogen Peroxide with a concentration of with a catalyst of copper  chloride. Open cup drop tests were conducted to study the effect of an amount of metal salt catalyst in fuel and initial temperatures of fuel and oxidizer on the decomposition delay time. In order to study the viability of the proposed propulsion system a pilot scale rocket engine studied with the hypergolic ignition of bipropellant formulation in real rocket engine environment. Configuration for a pressure fed Ethanolamine amp Hydrogen Peroxide based Rocket Engine  EHPRE  has been realized and developed.source!,ISRO,d4przs3,2,t5_2u3ww

8484224,0,t3_4vwc2j,How many concepts do they have under study ? We have heard about the several designs for the HLV The design on VSSC page.S  SC  C The design referred in the book From Fishing Hamlet to Red PlanetISRO is designing heavylift launch vehicles with capabilities in the range of  tonnes inGTO. For this purpose the following propulsion systems are being pursued A  tonne propellant loading LOX and kerosene booster stage powered by a  kN thrust semicryogenic engine operating on stage combustion cycle. A  tonne LOXLH propellant loading cryogenic stage powered by twin CE  cryogenicengines. A  tonne LOXLH propellant loading cryogenic stage powered by a CE  cryogenicengine. The partially reusable HLV ?As regards heavylift vehicles we are in the process of discussion. It will be a TSTO vehicle whose first stage like SpaceXs will be a fiveengine semicryo cluster. This will have a modular structure. With one core semicryo stage we can simply go on adding any number of strapons and different payload requirements can be met. The second stage will be a cryostage. After the first stage is separated it can be recovered in sea like SpaceX has done. this one would can have GTO payload of some  tonnes  if I remember it correctly.Earlier they were targeting for a payload of  tonnes to GTO now it seems theyre targeting  tonnes. I hope the LVM SC is separate from these projects. We need to achieve capability for launching . tonnes to GTO soon enough to achieve selfsufficiency in launching IK class satellites amp their heavier successors.,ISRO,d622nus,4,t5_2u3ww
