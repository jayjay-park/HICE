5495527,0,t3_3qbsru,Well meatloaf is my favorite thing. Have you tried a frosted mestloaf? It brings meatloaf to a whole new level. But if you want some else try rice dishes. Rice and mixed veggies add some shrimp or chicken or ?. Those are easy. Another option is dishes that can turn into multiple meals. Pot roast done right will get you  or  meals. Meat and veg st night. The saucegravy left over will go great over egg noodles and chopped leftover meats chickenshrimppot roast. Pasta dishes are the easiest. I have hundreds of recipes I could share numerous I have created. Whats some things you like? I can get you some more ideas.,StayAtHomeDaddit,cwe3tao,1,t5_37q4l

We go everyday rain or shine unless lightning or extreme weather.Find a good new hobby something that you failed at in the past or never tried but wanted to. Do some soul searching on your hobby so it aligns with personal and family ideals.Find a MeetUp group that aligns with your new hobby and be the humble new guy. Experts love to help honest newbies. No MeetUp group start your own and seek experts to coorganize.You could start a MeetUp group for dads to watch stimulating Netflix shows at your home followed by discussion. You sound like a cinephile so embrace it and make it constructive.You didnt mention anything above about exercise. Its the biggest help to my ruts and pulls me through dreary winter days. I started small and realisticwith only  pushup  ab exercise amp  squat. I was super weak and thin from a previous desk job. After time I naturally raised my reps one by one and added other exercises. Biggest gain was my sense of accomplishment.Hope this gives you some ideas. Thanks for venting and being honest with redditors about yourself.,StayAtHomeDaddit,d7ej1sr,3,t5_37q4l
