277987,0,t1_cf9bek1,You make a good point about a lot of the big contracts but Jamaal for instance is pretty locked in and I doubt his number is ever going to change TOO much.  And we already pay Smith something like  or  million a year and its not like he is going to demand  like aaron rodgers or something so I doubt he makes a big impact on it.  Tamba is a bigger worry but Ive seen speculation about trading him for exactly that reason.  And I thought the defense did damn well last year EXCEPT for Dunta Robinson and Quinton Demps.  Cooper played lights out for a guy with only  years at corner and he improved in every single game.  Flowers took some adjusting to get good at slot coverage but by the playoff game he had his head on straight.  Smith was probably our best corner all year and he never even had any safety help.  Demps needs to get replaced back there though and Berry needs to step up his coverage on tight ends.  In that playoff game he missed as many plays as anyone else and just because he is a big name doesnt mean he should avoid the scrutiny.  If he continues to whiff on big plays next year I say we trade him while his value is high.,KansasCityChiefs,cf9kqs8,1,t5_2s3ft

973687,0,t1_chen6pi,I think youre pushing the panic button prematurely and Ill tell you why. While all that youve been saying about these being financial moves could be true they also could all be considered football moves in terms of keeping the team young and keeping options open down the line for players that might have to be replaced for performance not financial reasons. Alex Smith was freaky good last year and may not keep this up. Hali is getting older and might need to sit at some point. Flowers has been underperforming a bit and it may be to the point where they want the pressure of a young rooke breathing down his neck to motivate him or replace him. But the main reason I think you are wrong is Andy Reid. He could have had his pick of jobs around the NFL and chose KC. Hunt brought in Reids guy Dorsey to be the GM. After the turnaround of the Chiefs last year Andy could have gone anywhere else again. He has no reason to stay in an organization he does not believe is committed to winning and has the personnel management experience to know if CH was playing money games instead of trying to build a winner. I kicked and screamed on this sub at every decision CH made when he brought in Reid and Dorsey. I was wrong and have admitted it on this sub repeatedly check my flair. Id say wait and watch during this season before making any judgements.tldr I didnt wanna downvote you and move on like everyone else but I think youre wrong.

I agree that the deficiencies of our OL have contributed to an already bad passing situation but theres a certain point where if you dont have WRs that can separate the OL doesnt matter.We have slow WRs who dont run crisp routes and only Bowe has reliable hands. We have no deep threat and no consistent Redzone option besides Charles and Kelce. Chiefs FO made a massive mistake in letting Sanders go to Denver. Not only did we miss out on a quality  WR whod be our current  with those stats but we let him go to our  opponent.

I didnt mean it in a way to offend gays. To me its just a synonym for stupid. That  would be the equivalent of white being a synonym for redneck.

Also Alex Smith wont make it through a season if he is getting sacked  times a game at some point he is going to get injured.  We can still lose to the Steelers Broncos Vikings Browns Raiders.

And as far as that bears game went that was bad on everyone involved. The secondary was bad and the pass rush was worse after that first TD anyway . Our o line had one of its worst days all year against a team that doesnt even have an elite pass rush. Plus the play calling in that game was pathetic. Reid went super conservative from the very first drive because the defense put us up by  and that ended up screwing us when we lost by  point.

ANd we lose  or something.Honestly all three of these things could happen and I wouldnt be shocked. The confidence I have as a Pats fan largely stems from the Pats  record in this round in the BB era but if they have lost twice they could lose a third time. ,KansasCityChiefs,cyyj3vq,5,t5_2s3ft

Become the two three? headed monster with Charles and DavisWest.The biggest potential future issue is probably quarterback  Need to win soon before Smith shuts it down because finding a good serviceable quarterback is not an easy thing.And Id note that even without Charles and Maclin the Chiefs onfield presence did just fine it was the coaching that wasnt up to par or prepared in that game.,KansasCityChiefs,cz138jj,1,t5_2s3ft

7468817,0,t3_4hnurb,Honestly I think DorseyReid did an amazing job. There are two things I wouldve done differently There are a number of wide receivers I wouldve taken over Hill and not because of the controversy stuff. Jakeem Grant is a similar prospect that I think will be a better pro and he went a round later. I wouldve gone with him instead. I dont like Kevin Hogan very much either. Given his Shrine Bowl performance I wouldve liked to see a chance taken on Vernon Adams. At that point of the draft youre not expecting your picks to become starters and Id rather have a QB with the higher ceiling IMO than the QB with the higher floor.Outside of that we got  WRs and  CBs which is awesome along with a stud DL and another OL for depth Im unsure about Ehlinger but I wasnt a fan of the Morse pick initially and that turned out very well.

7631984,0,t1_d39ox2z,...I didnt counter shit.  I said middle of the draft at best.  You act like a team has to be top ten for it to matter which is patently untrue.The only piece we brought in on the o line was Mitch Schwartz and Grubbs and Schwarz are not the same situation.  Grubbs had been to two probowls but hadnt been to one in  years when we got him.  Schwarz was the best RT in football last season and hes only  where Grubbs was .  Morse was a rookie last year and did nothing but get better all season.  Even if he plateaus where he is at we are fine at that position.  Fisher has become a solid starter.  Hes no where near old enough to start declining yet.  So Im not using wishful thinking...Im using the most current state and info.  You are being blindly pessimistic.My assessment of Houston matches up with what the doctors have said.  His recovery window is  to  months which means he could be back as soon as September or miss the whole season.  Based on most ACL injuries in the last  or  years he should be able to play again around the  month mark or near the middle of October.... or  games missed.  Again you are being blindly pessimistic.At least you back tracked on that receiver comment.  Smith has never used more than his main receiver as a major piece of the offense and Reid loves to draw up passing plays to non receivers.

Before the white people came the idea of owning something as intangible as an image would have been pretty much inconceivable please correct me if I am wrong here. So in this particular case the argument is completely based on Eurocentric logic rather than taking into account the values of the culture being discussed. I want to say that I am personally horrified by what my country did to the Native Americans and I do feel the residual guilt. However I think that focusing on issues like improving education eliminating poverty combating addiction and crime and protecting the remaining landwaterresources of the presentday descendants is far far more of an issue that the intellectualized slacktivism I love that term regarding team logos.

9629589,0,t1_da011z1,I told my buddy before the Panthers game Our defense should destroy the Panthers.  At half time he said Hows that defense theory going for you?  I said Theyll adjust.  And theyll fucking win. The Chiefs needed Gaines against the Steelers.  Their receivers are just too fast for Nelson and Peters was trying too hard to make up for everyones mistakes and ended up making too many of his own.  if Gaines and Peters stay healthy adding in Houston and with NFL sack leader Dee Ford feels so good to type that I really dont think a single team can beat the Chiefs even with their offensive woes.  Because no matter what their offense still better than Broncos was last year and that horrible offense won the Super Bowl.  Funny because Im not worried about the Raiders at all.  Their defense cant stop us.  Their offense cant beat us.  Theyre overrated.  Theyre not bad mind you just not great.  I think the Chiefs are built specifically to beat the Raiders.  Same with the Broncos actually.  Hell I fear the Chargers more than the Raiders and Broncos.,KansasCityChiefs,da01meq,3,t5_2s3ft

There are some yes but not as many as will wear the jersey of a Super Bowl team.On top of that the Chiefs owe it to themselves to win the Super Bowl.  You know why?  Because theyre a small market team.  If they can continually make the playoffs and the Super Bowl they can convert into a large market team look at Green Bay.NOTE  Im using me as a random fan.

Johnathan Stewart isnt getting and younger so maybe Carolina needs depth.  Washington has Rob Kelley who shows promise but could maybe use a veteran presence.  Minnesota to replace AP.  LA to mentorsplit with Gurley.  Awful but Denver needs RB help.  Anyways point in JC isnt going to have trouble finding work.

10357671,0,t3_5obmaf,In regards to our poor defensive line play. Dont forget we were starting a rookie and a rotational guy in place of Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey. We didnt have very good line play all year because our defensive line was injured. I love Rakeem but he hasnt proved to be a reliable starter despite our dependence on him this season. Chris Jones has played well as a pass rusher but his run defense needs some work. Poe also doesnt seem to be playing nearly as well as he has in the past.
