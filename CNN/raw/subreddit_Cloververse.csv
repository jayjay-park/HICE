9492084,0,t1_d9j3br2,Agreed. I was done with Swamp Pop until I found that subsubpage today by accident. Im prepared to be done with them again but I just wanted to run this new to me development past some other people first.I just dont understand why IF they were done with it why would they make it a permanent fixture on their site  with the hidden page that makes it appear as if it is about to become available  instead of just removing it from their shopify.,Cloververse,d9j3p37,2,t5_3cxaz
