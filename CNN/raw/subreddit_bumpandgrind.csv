6468713,0,t3_448wyu,Just discovered this guy Ade Blacow from Blackpool and his project VHS Head. Found by way of Com Truise and a mixtape.To me this hits somewhere between Aphex Twin and Oneohtrix Point Never. In some parts its just as chaotic and challenging as OPN at his usual level of intensity but this album at least tends to retain more of the melodic throughlines that feels much more Aphexy than OPN.Very excited to relisten a few times and develop more of an opinion but I love love love this album at first and second listen.He does have one more full LP that released in  that I am now just cracking into less melodic but a bit easier to listen to at first blush and several EPs Ill be checking out as well.Here are a few other tracks I want to highlight from this LPMotionsSunset Everett Gianasi   warning pThe Murder Cycles Seen Enough? And heres a video introspective from The Snapshots Foundation ,bumpandgrind,czoest3,1,t5_31dm6
