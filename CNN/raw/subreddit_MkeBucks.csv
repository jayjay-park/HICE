786781,0,t3_234esy,The guys at the top all have very noticeable red flags that makes it difficult to pick an order for me but Ill give it a go.Parker his excessive baby fat slows him down laterally which will make it difficult for him to defend perimeter players. He can also occasionally rely too heavily on his jumper when better options may be available.Exum  Questionable competition compared to other top prospects makes him hard to place. Jumper is flatEmbiid Already an injury concern. Lingering back issues particularly with big men are scary. Offense is good but has recently been overrated. Wiggins The fact that you can honestly ask the question does this kid have a passion for the sport of basketball? concerns me immensely.

1737761,0,t3_2ecb3g,When it comes to classifying players by position the guys who present the most trouble are the elite players such as Kevin Durant LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony.What position does James play anyway? The past two seasons he has spent the bulk of his time playing power forward in Miami just as Carmelo has done in New York. Now James and Anthony have slimmed down considerably to gear up for their respective new environments. James is headed back to Cleveland where he joins a roster with plenty of traditional big men while Anthony is prepping for his role in New Yorks new triangle offense. The guys youre used to defining as small forwards are indeed classified as small forwards while we await the next evolutionary turn in NBA lineup usage.Below we continue our NBA positional ranking according to forecast WARP with the projected top  small forwards for the  NBA season. An explanation of the statistic can be found at the bottom of the page.PG | SG | SF | PF | CJames. LeBron James Cleveland CavaliersProjected  WARP . | Win  percentIt takes more than one season to usurp the King. Last season Durant led the NBA in WARP ahead of  gasp  James who had finished first in each of the five previous seasons. James might have finished in the No.  slot but it was the th straight season he has finished first or second. That simply put is amazing. His scoring efficiency and volume were right on target but his rebounding steals and blocks were all down. This shift was reflected in RPM where he was as lofty as ever on offense plus. his highest with the Heat but dipped below average on defense minus.. Its the type of off season almost any player in history would kill to have.Durant. Kevin Durant Oklahoma City ThunderProjected  WARP . | Win  percentAfter leading the league in WARP for the first time and ending James reign as league MVP there is but one box left unchecked on Durants rsum an NBA title. During the regular season Durant was as good as ever posting the best winning percentage and WARP of his career on the strength of eversharpening passing skills. Consider this Durants assist rate was exactly the same in each of his first three seasons at . percent. It has been on the climb since and last season was double his  rate . percent. He did this while cutting his turnover rate from the previous two seasons. Durant is one of the most valuable players in the game and hes just entering his prime.Anthony. Carmelo Anthony New York KnicksProjected  WARP . | Win  percentIt cant be written often enough that Anthony has gotten a whole lot better as a Knick. Indeed hes never been better and is now a top player by the numbers not just reputation. Last seasons . WARP was . more than hes had in any of his  other NBA seasons and ninth in the league. His RPM plus. was also a career best so his impact shined through to the team level. Now at the age of  Anthony will be playing in a system that might enhance his efficiency even more and could heighten his profile as a passer as well.Hayward. Gordon Hayward Utah JazzProjected  WARP . | Win  percentNot every young player gets a chance to see what its like to become the focus of his teams offense but thats what happened for Hayward last season. His careerbest WARP was based more on volume than efficiency. As the Jazz improve youd expect Haywards usage rate to ebb a little but even if it doesnt his point percentage should be better than last seasons . mark and that in itself will boost his profile. His abilities were recognized by a restricted free agent market that paid him well over the summer.Batum. Nicolas Batum Portland Trail BlazersProjected  WARP . | Win  percentMaybe it has something to do with being French but consider Batum Joakim Noah and Boris Diaw. All three provide immense value to their respective teams and all three do it with a fullfledged skill set that does not feature a prolific scoring arsenal. Batum had an . WARP th in the league even though his usage rate . percent fell to its lowest level since his rookie season. His true shooting percentage ballooned thanks to the increased selectivity and he was never better as a passer or rebounder. Hes just entering his prime and there is time to work out the rough edges.Antetokounmpo. Giannis Antetokounmpo Milwaukee BucksProjected  WARP . | Win  percentThe system sees Antetokounmpo as a likely contender for the leagues most improved player a statistical observation that one could also have made by watching how his game blossomed over the summer. The chief aspect of his profile that stands out is his positive offensive RPM which combined with his point shooting burgeoning floor game size and tender age mark him as a standout prospect. Can he really go from replacement level to . WARP? The best players make the leap at a young age. This could be the time for Antetokounmpo.Iguodala. Andre Iguodala Golden State WarriorsProjected  WARP . | Win  percentIguodala actually had the worst season of his career in his first one with the Warriors though that might have been by design. Iguodalas projection in this methodology . WARP is much rosier than he looks by our usual WARP formula .. Iguodalas offensive role shrunk considerably in Golden State but it was all in service of winning. His plus. RPM was one of the leagues best and his defensive RPM of plus. marked him as a true superstar on that end. RPM was made to recognize the talents of players like Iguodala.Leonard. Kawhi Leonard San Antonio SpursProjected  WARP . | Win  percentLeonard continued to grow across the board last season by hitting new highs in volume and efficiency while providing an elitelevel contribution at the defensive end. His WARP . put him in the rd percentile and you still get the feeling hes capable of so much more. Gregg Popovich has said Leonard will be the new face of the Spurs and who can doubt him? Leonard was a standout performer in the regular season raised his game during the playoffs and was a big reason San Antonio won another championship. And when the regular season ended he was still not yet . Wow.Parsons. Chandler Parsons Dallas MavericksProjected  WARP . | Win  percentParsons has been a very good player during the first three seasons of his professional career but his WARP over that period slots him in the rd percentile of all players. No shame in that but its not at the level to justify the dollars he got on the restricted market this summer from Dallas. He seems like an ideal role player but hes now getting paid to be more than that. However if Parsons can be deployed in a way to provide AllStar production Rick Carlisle will figure it out.Gay. Rudy Gay Sacramento KingsProjected  WARP . | Win  percentThere was a stark difference between Gay as a Grizzly good and Gay as a Raptor bad. As a King Gay settled into more of a middle ground and he was an effective player on both ends of the court for Sacramento. On a highfunctioning team Gay probably wouldnt have a usage rate over  percent but if he continues to attack the basket like he did last year hell be a talent the Kings can work with.Next five Trevor Ariza DeMarre Carroll Draymond Green Michael KiddGilchrist Danilo GallinariCarroll was quietly one of the leagues most improved players. KiddGilchrist is still young raw and far short of his ceiling but hes already providing positive value on the defensive end.Also notable Luol Deng Kyle Korver Paul Pierce Paul GeorgeGeorges injury takes him out of the rankings but his projected winning percentage . would slot him third behind Durant and in front of Anthony.,MkeBucks,cjy7j1t,12,t5_2t10o

2691492,0,t1_cn9oxt6,If its me running the team I dont pay him a dime unless he accepts the role as a th man I think during his  years in the league he has proved that his is incapable of running an NBA offense and is too small to play a guard. I think as a th man he could be a good asset on a contending team but seeing as how the bucks arent contenders I would trade him for a first round pick if we can or a young player that could develop. His stats have bobby box scores going wild and trying to talk him up that hes the best bucks player but if you actually watch the games hes actually a net negative on the offensive end imo. ,MkeBucks,cn9wbmt,1,t5_2t10o
2767300,0,t3_2rrbd3,I mean it was now or at the end of the year with the team option on his contract. Its pretty clear Kidd favors his rotation of BK Bayless and Marshall at this point and we could use help in the frontcourt with JabariLarryErs not playing.,MkeBucks,cnimqu6,11,t5_2t10o
2777855,0,t3_2rw2ou,First off so glad to hear you are getting excited about the team!To put the dissenting opinion of the WoltersMartin transaction in perspective you have to look into the recent history of the franchise The Bucks have been a middling team for about a decade making a whole bunch of roster moves trades mediocre free agent signings focused on immediate success. The motto for the Bucks has basically been th seed or bust since they flamed out in the conference finals in . The previous owner Senator Herb Kohl a huge proponent NBA basketball in Wisconsin and the primary reason the Bucks are still in Milwaukee it should be noted really pushed this agenda. Luckily everything went wrong for the team last season and they found themselves with Jabari Parker. Couple him with Giannis Knight Henson Middleton Sanders sort of and you have an awesome young core built to contend in  years. The big push by the franchise and the fans is to realize this goal of future title contention and get past that th seed hurdle.In terms of the arena while the fact that the team is winning is certainly generating buzz it probably wont make much difference regarding the arena at this point. A few years ago it might have but public opinion isnt going to swing enough by the time the funding is sorted to make a massive difference. The stadium will almost certainly be built in Milwaukee anyway so its a bit of a moot point.That being said the extra buzz that the current success has generated stands to help the franchise fill that stadium once it is completed. Getting people like yourself excited about what the Bucks are building is a huge part of not just having a franchise in Milwaukee but recreating the success of the past. A winning culture and an involved fan base are two big requirements for longterm success in small markets and thats where the real value lies in winning games now. Its also worth noting that Nate Wolters is NOT an important piece for the team in the present or the future and may well be resigned after Sanders returns and Martins day contract ends.,MkeBucks,cnjtzim,4,t5_2t10o
2861024,0,t3_2st2er,His trade value is not zero. There are teams that will take him but they will want more than just Sanders. Likely picks or a seasoned vet like Jared Dudley. And we may not get anything in return maybe a scrub? Another Nate Wolters who is good but not good enough to keep..,MkeBucks,cntat3b,1,t5_2t10o
2915500,0,t3_2tfyfh,Thats the million dollar question. Weve had  coaching staffs now that never seemed to give him a real chance. When he has gotten minutes usually because of whoever is in front of him gets in foul trouble or injured or suspended Henson has put up some gaudy numbers. Nobody outside of the organization has been able to figure out why. He was said to be very lax and lazy in his rookie year but we have heard since then he is a really hard worker. He works hard in the off season between his rookie and nd year he put on  lbs of muscle and in this previous offseason he has put on  lbs of muscle. It may not show because he has grown although the team wont confirm that when we drafted him he was around  now you look at him when he stands next to a  footer and he stands equal if not taller so hes probably around .The biggest knocks on him is he hasnt developed a midrange game and he is out of position at times on defense. But i think if he gets reps in game he can work on developing the defensive positioning as i feel that is more instincts rather than technique. Where as his midrange game may need some work in the gym as well as taking what he learned and developing confidence in game.Whats mind boggling is why Kidd has not given him more time considering that him and Zaza are the only  centers left on the team he is still only getting  minutes. There has been reports coming out since we cut Wolters that Kidd had his mind made up before he had even seen Wolters play that he didnt like Wolters and his game hence why he never gave him a shot at playing and why he cut him at the first chance. I hope this is not the case with Henson as well because i think he has great potential to a better character and better overall version of Sanders. ,MkeBucks,cnzi0gd,2,t5_2t10o

If they really needed to shed salary why not do it at the positions where we have too much depth like PG and C?

7023076,0,t1_d1c6e1a,I actually couldnt disagree more about teams that pick high are picking for instant impact. Most of those teams are a few years away from being competitive as it is. Buddy is older than Giannis. Also I think youre really really overrating him. This draft has been notoriously referred to as pretty bad. People are even doubting Simmons now. So Buddys wellpolished game in scouts eyes must not be worth much more than an alright rotational player for the first few years. Its not like people expect him to come onto the NBA floor and still put up  ppg. He very well could turn out to be a GREAT player but if people thought he would definitely become that he would be much higher on mocks than he is right now in this specific draft.Also Id like to say I think Buddy will be a pretty damn good player. But Im not a pro scout so Im only referring to the situation as how the professionals seem to be viewing the situation.,MkeBucks,d1cf15b,2,t5_2t10o

8181082,0,t3_4rdabx,Id say Monroe for Jrue Holiday both their contracts expire in a year if New Orleans are up for it Monroe is from New Orleans as well and then go for Ezeli. This is what Id go for personally. Alternatively just wait for next year and trade Monroe in February maybe Bucks will be in playoff range so they could go for a good trade with a team that didnt. Plus I think Monroe could help the substitute squad with his scoring if he can accept coming off the bench.Allen Crabbe and Dion Waiters are the only interesting free agent guards right now. If Bucks dont chase them then Brodgon will get to show what he can do off the bench and Vaughn will get some playtime as well. As of centers only Ezeli is relatively interesting and Bucks can get through a season with Henson and Plumlee. There is always next year. Bucks can keep the cap space and go for something then.

8852341,0,t1_d7bvek0,You can have depression and still be a good person to the people around you. Larry Sanders was not. Larry Sanders was the most UNPROFESSIONAL basketball player to ever play in milwaukee. Also the recent stuff he said about Milwaukee proves he is absolutely full of shit with that depression garbage. I feel sorry for anyone that believes his bullshit.gtBut Sanders didnt know how not yet and so he turned to marijuana to cope. At first he smoked to ward off the encroaching waves of anxiety. Then three months after the nightclub fight he fractured his orbital bone in a February  game against the Houston Rockets. He chose not to take his doctorprescribed painkillers worrying that the pills could be addictive. Sanders is hardly the only athlete to endorse that line of thought but the impetus had as much to do with his surroundings as his own research. He knew after the brawl and the resulting injury that the Bucks were scrutinizing their investment more than ever. Sanders believed they were more concerned with his being on the floor to justify his new contract than his overall wellbeing. He still believes he may have been concussed but the team never tested him.gtThey kind of let me go to sleep on the training table and sent me home and didnt really think anything was wrong he said. And then the next day I find out I blew out the orbital in my face. That kind of went into the box of why I had to get out of here just for your health. I didnt really feel safe with themthe league or Milwaukeeafter that point.gtIt would be another year before Milwaukee would buy him out of his contract but his Bucks career fundamentally ended that night when James Hardens elbow crashed into his right eye. Sanders lived for those contested rebounds but after the injury he grew tentative.gtI felt that if something did happen again I wouldnt be properly taken care of he said. I wouldnt be properly tested. Maybe it would be ignored and I would be pressured to go back and all these things when they havent even addressed the issue yetBS. The dude is just coming out now and saying this. Why didnt he say this  years ago? Larry Sanders you made over  million dollars a year to be properly taken care of??!!! Like seriously. Trying to get people to feel sorry for you. I feel sorry for the people that believe every little ounce of your bullshit.gthis career went terribly askew. Sanders tore a ligament in his thumb during a nightclub fight a few weeks into the  season was revealed shortly thereafter to have been cited twice for leaving dogs out in the freezing cold suffered a seasonending broken orbital bone in February  and refused to apologize when he received a fivegame suspension for marijuana use that April. He left the Bucks and the NBA in January  and hasnt hooked up with another team although he made vague gestures towards possible deals on social media this summer.And the article doesnt even mention how many times it was reported that he was fighting in the locker rooms with his teammates. This guy was the most unprofessional basketball player that I have ever seen.,MkeBucks,d7bxcig,2,t5_2t10o

9223822,0,t1_d8l5x2q,Moose finished with layups not lobs.  Worth the same number of points.I kinda doubt Giannis averages  assists per game this season but Delly sure as hell aint averaging  assists per game this season either and it would be a disaster of the Bucks if he did.  Delly has to take shots for that to happen and he sucks at scoring when he is creating.  He is good at scoring on open jump shots.Giannis is going to bring the ball up a lot.  His role this season will be pretty close to his postASB role in which he played PG with the starters but was a playmaking wing for the bench.  Just like Giannis played PG with Bayless on the court and wing with Ennis on the court this season he will be PG with Delly on the court with Delly taking turns at PG as well and playmaking wing with MCW on the floor hopefully MCW isnt a Buck much longer.Delly averaging a lot of assists would be garbage offense.  I dont want that.Ideally the team wouldnt have any really high assist PG as those guys never win when it counts.  IMO Giannis probably does average  APG this season though.  Delly maybe .  Im not sure Delly has the conditioning to play huge minutes.Delly may produce preseason highlights.  I dont give a shit about that.  I want to win games.  I see zero correlation between lob dunks and wins or points in the paint and good offense.  Hopefully Delly doesnt get benched for Jason Terry like he got benched for Mo Williams last season.And if you want more dunks dont you want Giannis handling the ball?  Both Giannis and Jabari got more dunks after he started to play PG.  Jabaris postASB offense was so dependent on Giannis.  An obscene amount of his offense came from his defender helping on Giannis.  Against OKC Jabari had a full  points come directly from his man helping off of him and onto Giannis.,MkeBucks,d8l6rfz,0,t5_2t10o

9538955,0,t3_5bi6x2,A few quick things on the Milwaukee Bucks.  Quick History The Team was founded in  won a championship in  behind Kareem and Oscar Robertson appeared in another but lost in  and havent been back since. Theyve ranged from mediocre to bad since about  excluding  where they made the Eastern finalsRecent The Bucks are truly entering a new era in Milwaukee. In April  the Bucks were purchased by Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens from longtime Bucks owner Herb Kohl who made huge contributions to the Bucks and kept them in Milwaukee even if he should have left basketball stuff to the GM. Lasry and Edens helped keep the Bucks in Milwaukee and a new stadium was promised. In July  The Bucks traded for a new head coach in Jason Kidd. The very next season the Bucks went  and made the playoffs during their series against the Bulls this after Dunleavy had been playing dirty all game hence why Im sure youll see Fuck Mike Dunleavy all over this sub. They had a disappointing season last year but are looking pretty good so far this year.  In order of relative importance just my opinion heres the team rosterGiannis The star of the team. He plays either point guard or small forward but can really guard almost any position at  and at only  years old is proving to be one of the best players in the NBA. The heart of this team no doubt.  Jabari A gifted scorer with great athleticism with size and strength  lb to pair with it. Is kinda a bonehead on the defensive side of the ball but entering his third year its exciting to see what this  year old will be able to produce.  Khris Middleton A career   point shooter that plays hard defense and creates offense. One of the best and most underrated SGs in the NBA and is just the kinda guy that makes his team better anytime hes on the floor.  Nickname Khash Money Middleton  Matthew Dellavedova A point guard that compliments Jabari and Giannis by playing hard defense and shooting s. Scrappy gym rat high motor intelligent player that knows his limitations and plays within his role. Nicknamed Outback Jesus Delly.John Henson Has been here since he was drafted  years ago so the longest tenured buck. Blocks shots and put up lefty hooks. Plays Center.Greg Monroe skilled but DefensivelyAthletically limited Center. For all the hate he gets hes been a true professional despite being benched and the only max contract player on this team right now. Also always yells AND OOOOOONNEEEEE after every single shot. Nicknamed Moose.Mirza Teletovic Shoots as many s as he can.  forward in his first season with the bucks th in the league. Nicknamed Telly.    Miles Plumlee Athletic Center who finishes lobs. Just a guy. Think a poor mans Deandre Jordanlite but white. There you go.  Tony Snell Was just traded here from the Bulls but so far seems to be a pretty good role player. Shooting Guard that hits s and plays D.  Malcolm Brogdon A rookie point guard but with the poise of a vet.  years old but has shown he can hit from range and finish off the glass nicely. A nice backup PG right now that plays hard on D.  Nicknamed The President.Rashad Vaughn Had one of the worst seasons ever last year but might be turning it around this year. Hes supposed to be a shooter but struggled mightily in his rookie season. Still only  years old and has time to work things out.  Michael Beasley A forward that takes questionable shots. Strange guy. Played in China recently. Has  dogs. Not sure how to feel about him yet.  Thon Maker Shot taker. Rookie.  probably?  and straight out of highschool in Canada. More to come.  Jason Terry  years old so a real vet. Plays Guard. Nicknamed Jet.  Steve Novak Went to Highschool in Wisconsin played for Marquette and now plays garbage time for the Bucks. Milwaukee loves him.  Biggest rival would be the Bulls. Memes include Fuck Mike Dunleavy and JOBIII circlejerking. Overall this is an exciting young team thats getting better and is going to be dangerous very soon. ,MkeBucks,d9ovi2x,24,t5_2t10o

I see his ceiling being Shawn Livingston a guard who can come in and capably run the offense without too much of a drop off. The problem for the Bucks is that he and Delly are basically the same type of player Brogdon being the better version I think. We need a point guard combo guard who has a quick release from three and can stay in front of the uber athletic point guards of the NBA like John Wall and Russel WestbrookEdit This is why comma use is important. I only meant that the hypothetical pointcombo guard be able to stay in front of the uber athletic guards such as John Wall not actually be John Wall or Russel Westbrook.

11144445,0,t3_5z3blr,ESPN preview writeup Milwaukee has won six in a row.Memphis has lost five in a row.Fans dont have to look too far to see why each team is on its current streak going into the BucksGrizzlies matchup on Monday night in Memphis Tenn. In a word its defense.In Saturday nights  win over Minnesota the Bucks had six defensive stops over the final  to secure the win.In Saturday nights  loss to the Atlanta Hawks the Grizzlies  allowed an opponent to reach the century mark for the eighth time in the past nine games. While the Hawks were connecting on  of  pointers the Grizzlies shot an abysmal . percent from beyond the arc  of .What once was the hallmark for the Grizzlies earlier in the season  defense  has now become a liability. And theres plenty of blame to spread.We need to get back to trusting each other on the defensive end said Tony Allen one of the NBAs top defenders. If we get some defensive stops we can let our defense dictate our offense and build from there. Obviously its been a rough time for us.Coach David Fizdale has been tweaking his starting lineup looking for the right combination to get the Grizzlies heading back in the right direction. Mediocrity is not an option he said.Ill continue to shuffle until I find something that works best to give us the best chance to hold the trophy he said Sunday.Against the Bucks the Grizzlies who are hanging on the seventh spot in the Western Conference will have their fifth different starting lineup in five games take the floor.That means Allen will be inserted into the starting lineup. His No.  directive is to stop Milwaukees AllStar Giannis Antetokounmpo who is coming off a relatively quiet night against the Timberwolves.But while he scored only  points Antetokounmpo played a key role defensively down the stretch with two blocked shot as the Bucks  held a fifth consecutive opponent below  points.Down the stretch we didnt hit any shots we had some shotclock violations Bucks coach Jason Kidd told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But we got stops on the other end. It just shows our maturity and not worrying so much about the offensive end. If things dont go well we come back and try to get another stop.Kidd has received high marks for squeezing as much as he can out of the Bucks who remain in the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference playoff chase.With Saturdays victory over the Timberwolves the Bucks are onehalf game behind seventhplace Detroit and one game behind sixthplace Indiana in the East.If the Grizzlies expect to remain in playoff contention everyone must start playing better AllStar point guard Mike Conley said.We all gotta look in the mirror and see what we can do be better to help the team Conley said. We have to lean on our leadership lean on our vets to get this thing headed in the right direction and not let go of the rope.The Bucks defeated the Grizzlies in November. That game was a signal of what was to come for Memphis as the Grizzlies defense collapsed in the second half giving up  points in a  loss.Fizdale employed a zone defense in that game and Antetokounmpo torched Memphis for  points.Mondays game in Memphis is the first of a seasonlong sixgame West Coast road trip for the Grizzlies. And they head out with a ton of confidence after Saturdays victory over the Timberwolves.It was a good win for us against a team thats on the rise and trying to make the playoffs as well firstyear Milwaukee point guard Matthew Dellavedova said. Its good momentum going into this West Coast trip.,MkeBucks,dev7lw7,7,t5_2t10o

11800419,0,t3_68bz91,Ibaka in Monroes spot would be a big upgrade for us I think. That being said no idea what Monroe is planning to do  probably opt out and seek a starting spot.Oh man as I wrote that I was thinking Thon at  Ibaka at  Giannis at  then any of the Brogdon Midds Snell Delly  any for the other two.  Would be a blocking galore all season long ,MkeBucks,dgxm9q2,1,t5_2t10o
