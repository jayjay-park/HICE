4822831,0,t1_cu2g0ma,Interesting. Hank Green actually made a video called How much is a Human Life Worth?. Its really interesting you should check it out if you havent. Although the way you posed your question I suppose you mean any life at all including animals and plants. And of course the cost of buying plant seeds pets etc. greatly varies. Hmm. This could definitely be a great discussion!,conjecturevlog,cu2ghae,3,t5_38tt3
