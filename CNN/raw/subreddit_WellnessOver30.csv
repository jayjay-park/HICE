10198535,0,t3_5lyirr,Started with strong lifts x went to  and ended with a PPL. I really enjoyed hitting  lbs on my DL and Squats but as I have gotten older I am switching to a more balanced program.Started Tactical Barbell this year which brings in a aerobic aspect I have been missing in my workout.And I really like programs because I can just look at the day and do that exercise. No thinking its just reflexive at this point. I did a lot of programming during my PPL time and it got to be too much yeah I know lazy lol.,WellnessOver30,dc0270o,1,t5_3i2lx

11176791,0,t3_5zgy3p,Love it! Chicken breast brown rice and broccoli can get very boring after awhile. Last night I made bison steaks for the family. Bison is the really in meat in San Francisco. Low fat tastes great calories arent bad. Its easy to find it ground form or in steaks. I got sirloin yesterday and seared them  mins a side for a medium rare. Sirloin is a little tough and chewy I prefer the New York strip but theres more fat. I used this recipe but substituted cremini for trumpet mushrooms. I think if you leave out the butter and cut back on the olive oil youd have a pretty healthy and tasty meal. I also got some ground bison recently and browned it with some onions and garlic threw in some Trader Joes marinara and mixed it into spaghetti squash. It was very good!,WellnessOver30,deyvkjx,2,t5_3i2lx
11431933,0,t1_dfrsjzm,Exactly. Ive been doing the current routine for about  weeks my body has adjusted time to change things up a bit.I track things pretty accurately I expect a normal fluctuation of  lbs but I should be at the bottom of my fluctuation not the top which is why I was frustrated. Thank you for your encouragement,WellnessOver30,dfrsqbq,2,t5_3i2lx
