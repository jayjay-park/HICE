I have had phones come still in the plastic wrapping that were missing screws on the EMI shield for the LCD and Digitizer connectors. Phones with screws from nonapple devices in them and some with replacement parts that were installed by a third party. Most commonly I have seen screens and charging docks that arent OEM installed.

11588920,0,t1_dg9k77n,Why are you continuing to ignore the load switch which contains overvoltage protection? I have provided the part number and documentation on the family of ICs. The one Apple uses does not appear to be available outside of their supply chain but plenty of information is available for that product line. Here is a picture of the difference between the two types of cables. The one on the right is an oem cable. The larger ic is the nxp and the smaller ic to the right of that is the authentication related ic. The one on the left is identical to almost every cheap cable you can find on AliExpress eBay or your corner gas station. What we have found in testing is that even with a messy ripple noise input voltage the OEM cable will have a smoother output.Also Apple does pay for component level board repair they just send them to China to have it done. Ive seen the refurbished devices myself. They are easy to identify by certain visual cues adhesives not used in new devices flux residue left behind ink markings on the board combined with the model number starts with N rather than M. At the height of the  touch disease epidemic  of the devices I saw were ones customers had received as replacements which had obviously had board work done. Weve also seen a handful of oow replacement iPad minis which have had the PMIC replaced.What I was referring to is that Apple Certified Technicians and Apple Authorized Service Providers are not even allowed to change the dock flex in an iphone  something that takes nothing more than a screw driver. We had a good time talking with AASPs all over the country about what they can and cant do in regard to repair  turns out the can is screens and batteries in an iPhone and the cant is everything else. I assume you already know all of this being one yourself.,iphonehelp,dg9m0wa,2,t5_2sco1
