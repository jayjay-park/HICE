2136477,0,t3_2jdj48,Yes they really did and still do exist. A fact floating around my academic circles I am a grad student in Intelligence Studies is that right now Russia has more spies on foreign soil than they did at the height of the cold war. I have very little reason to doubt my professors claims on this given his other job when he isnt teaching.As someone else mentioned there was the Anna Chapman spy ring that was busted open a few years ago. There were also countless other spies throughout the th century. Wikipedia has a list but this is only those whose existence has been declassified and turned over to the public. I imagine there are many many more who remain classified. Of course the show is sensationalised a bit but there have been spy stories that are just as crazy to read. I will point you in the direction of Sidney Reilly who was a British agent during and just after WWI and the Russian Revolution. His story though probably somewhat embellished mostly by him reads like James Bond flick. I would also point you to the Cambridge  who were a group of Oxbridge boys who were turned in the s and went on to hold various high level government positions one was a cousin to the Queen Mum including head of British Intelligence in the US Kim Philbey. ,TheAmericans,clbe5vx,2,t5_2us0e

It will be more interesting ifwhen Beaman finds out who it is.. Even though they are russian spies they really are a perfect couple. During that tooth scene I was thinking how I wanted to have that kind of relationship but then I remembered that it would suck to have their lives..

Its a shame that Phillip never got to star with Kimmy in a John Hughes movie before the great man died. Soviet Spys Day Off? Weird Russian TopSecret Science? Pretty in Crimson Red?

7371522,0,t1_d2g2ko4,Its interesting what you brought up about PampampampEs patriotism. Its something that has been on my mind recently a bit especially since Paiges initiation has been an issue. Theyve always had a bit of a different approach to their jobs but its been clear from the start that Philip doesnt have quite the same love for mother Russia that Elizabeth does. With Elizabeth you can tell that shes a patriot for mother Russia through and through. Philip though its not so clear. I get the feeling that hed leave his allegiance to Russia behind if he could and just be an American. Of course he knows he never can and that he his wife and his family are in a situation that they could only escape by leaving the country which he very much doesnt want to do because he clearly likes living in the USA.We dont know too much about PampampampEs pasts in Russia but what we do know about each is that Philips was much more unpleasant than Elizabeths. Hes obviously experiencing a much bigger improvement in his quality of life. To him being a spy is probably much more of a job than than the life mission for his country it was at one point. Its clearly wearing on him and maybe thats why hes getting a bit sloppy.But Elizabeth is committed and rocksteady. She is focused on the job and the plan and she knows what needs to be done. Its a good thing shes there too because Philip really needs her stability right now.,TheAmericans,d2g3aiy,2,t5_2us0e

7679351,0,t3_4jd8b8,I never really thought of Philip as being committed to communism. I always kind of get the impression that he wants to fight against injustices he sees in the US but that he is also very aware that the USSR commits injustices that are as bad or worse. He just happens to be Russian and therefore does his fighting for the KGB whereas if he were American he could just as well do the same for the CIA. He doesnt enjoy what he is doing and oftentimes doesnt even agree with it. However he does it anyway because the alternative at this point is just too terrible for him to contemplate and he is able to justify it all by telling himself that if he doesnt do it then someone else will. Elizabeth on the other hand is a true ideologue. She drank the communist koolaid and it has all but blinded her to the reality of the cause. For her the cause is everything and even more important than the wellbeing of her own daughter. A reasonable clear thinking person would never want to turn their teenage daughter into a spy and willingly put her life and sanity in danger but Elizabeth jumps at the chance to do so. So I dont think the reality of living conditions in the USSR would do anything to change Elizabeths commitment since she has already sold her and her daughters soul. Philip on the other hand might have a different view on things. ,TheAmericans,d3f3h4h,1,t5_2us0e

Like with Young Hee it wasnt a question of whether elizabeth would use the asset but in what manner it would be or even in the case of William who I never thought would live past this season who died in basically exactly how I thought he would  it didnt make his death any less interesting to watch. When it was predictable the emotions were able to carry the scene instead I feel like. this is also why the philip or elizabeth in jeopardy works even though you know they wont die yet.I think the season was quieter than the earlier seasons but much more tense and eerie because it was a culmination of a lot of ripples from previous seasons all coming to light in this season. It feels smaller than previous season finales but much more significant.,TheAmericans,d428z06,5,t5_2us0e

9047893,0,t3_53jv75,I like seeing actors in roles that are completely different from how we imagine them or what their current body of work is.Example Allison Janney who is just an all round American patriot as CJ Cregg in the West Wing.  Shed be great as a KGB spy.Elizabeth Moss who played Peggy in Mad Men and is also in Top of the Lake.  She has this understated diplomatic quality that just screams spy.Uzo Aduba who plays Suzanne in Orange is the New Black.  The actress has a ton of range and something about her probably her opera singing background just makes me think of DC.  It would be cool to have a roll for her that highlighted her singing and put her in circles with DCs rich and powerful making her an excellent spy for the KGB.  I also think the show has some redeeming to do after Gregory their sole legit black character was the worst casting ever.  John Slattery would fit right in to the FBI without skipping a beat.Almost every character other than Viola Davis who would be a bad guest star because she steals the show from How to Get Away with Murder would be great.  Especially interested in Liza Weil.Tony Shalhoub would be great.  He could even bring a bit of understated humor to whatever his role is.

10529781,0,t1_dd16ybw,Im not really sure hes lost all of his feelings for the Motherland just yet. He was pretty pissed off when the submarine propeller flew off and sank the sub. Actually his reaction was pretty hilarious in the sense that he was POd because the Americans planted fake plans for them to steal which resulted in sailors getting killed. Dont steal the stuff dumbo and bad things wont happen. In fact if he didnt have any sense of loyalty left I dont think he would have reported Williams reluctance to Gabriel.Hes also a pretty staunch atheist. I think what hes not OK with is the means to the end. I think theres a moral compass in him that objects to killing civilians and sexually exploiting young girls or leaving people like Martha out to dry.But I think he does take commitments hes made seriously  in fact he says so at the EST meeting. Thats why he keeps going back to work  because hes made commitments to people.But realistically what is he supposed to do given Elizabeths gungho attitude. He cant quite stop taking orders  the KGB will whack him for sure. He cant just up and defect without Elizabeths acquiescence. I guess he could try work out a deal for the both of them but she would probably hate him for evermore. Hes trying to do everything he can under the constraints on him to keep his family safe. Hes been trying really hard since the end of Season  to keep Elizabeth away from the possibly rough situations. Hes doing everything he can to keep her away from the honeypot situations. He does talk about how all he wants for his daughter is for her to go to college get a good job get married be happy. Hes been constantly listening to the BBC for news of Afghanistan since he found out his son was there. I just dont think his hearts in the hardline spy stuff anymore. That doesnt mean hes antiUSSR or any such thing. I just think hes not quite thrilled about the work hes being made to do.I suppose there is a parallel that can be drawn between Philip and some of the folks we had in our armed forces in Vietnam. They didnt want to be there they probably disagreed with the principles behind why we were there but once drafted into the Army they did their jobs in a manner they thought was the best they could do. They were not there of their own volition they were conscripted. And yet they were not antiAmerican.In as far as his love for Elizabeth goes I disagree that it isnt  a blinding passionate portrayal. The way theyve depicted it on the show it is extremely deep seated. I think the writers on this show do rely a lot on subtleties as opposed to smacking you across the forehead with a x. Keep in mind Philips pretty much been in love with Elizabeth for almost  years by the end of season . He did tell Gabriel that what he felt when he first saw her was something hed never experienced before or since and he did have another lover before  Irina. Thats a pretty strong statement. And for  of those  years all shes done is spurn him. Yet hes marched along pretty steadfastly. His expressions of his love are  depicted infrequently in the show  but whenever they do show them they are strong. Subtle but so very strong. Seems a pretty passionate love to me.,TheAmericans,dd1nyt8,3,t5_2us0e
10561255,0,t1_dd54vwl,There will always be a question about whether or not Reagan was a racist or maybe just didnt have certain sensitivities which is why I used the word probably in my statement. There were definitely aspects of racism raised during his presidential campaign using what is known as the Southern Strategy. This is a well known political trope used to appeal to a certain slice of the population and Reagan used it to great advantage Check out if you will his use of some young buck ahead of you buying a Tbone. Whether this was merely a political ploy or a heartfelt sentiment is something I dont know. But it definitely makes me question things.You also must look at his policy with respect to South Africa. Reagans constructive engagement with the Botha Government in South Africa. Despite worldwide condemnation of Apartheid the Reagan administration continued to support the South African Government and its ravaging of its population. Their purported concept was that if you engaged the SA Government you could convince them to undertake reforms and also keep the Soviets out. However years of this support showed no tangible results or even an inclination on the part of the SA Government to do anything. In fact it went the other way tightening down and getting harsher on the black population. Even when Botha declared that a one manone vote situation would never arise under his Government Reagan stuck by his side. The Congress finally passed a law that imposed sanctions on SA  and Reagan vetoed it which the congress promptly overrode. So his engagement of the SA Government and reluctance to take proactive action against the most virulent racist situation on the earth could only be one of two things  abject incompetence or a complete disregard for the plight of SAs black population. The first would point to a policy blunder  the second to something worse. Of course I cant read his mind but his actions tend to make me think that racism could be a factor  and hence my use of the word probable.The MLK holiday was passed Congress by a vote of . A veto would have been nigh on impossible to uphold. Reagan himself opposed the holiday before the bill was passed  he claimed it was due to the cost of adding another holiday to the Federal roster. Again I cant read his mind but I assume all his advisers told him this wasnt a battle worth fighting. It isnt an issue of being a liberal or a conservative  history speaks for itself. For all the admiration Reagan gets there are still certain aspects of his Presidency that bear questioning just as there are for each and every president this country has ever had  Liberal or Conservative.The point I was really trying to make is that you can still be a true American and not be enamored of Reagan just as you can be a true American and not be enamored of Obama or Clinton or Bush or Nixon or Kennedy or Trump or any other elected official. If not at any given time somewhere between  and  percent of this country is not enamored of the USA.,TheAmericans,dd58k6y,4,t5_2us0e

On the other hand they have these kids who Stan really likes and the kids havent really done anything to deserve the bad stuff that could happen to PampE. Also Stan does seem to like Philip and even though Philip has nurtured that friendship towards his own ends I sometimes get a feeling that he does actually get along with Stan. So I suppose if Stan finds out its going to require some soul searching on his part. Getting PampE locked up or worse will definitely have an impact on Paige and Henry. On the other hand I suppose Stan could also feel that PampE played him for a long time. Should make for interesting stuff if and when he finds out.

She is also credited on IMDB as being in  more episodes. Granted she may be a future hostage or someone may threaten her to get Stan to do shit he doesnt want to do obviously its all speculation.

11547050,0,t3_64ql5y,Ive been thinking for a while that there is something amiss with Philips story. It doesnt quite add up. You would assume of course that the KGB knows the allures of American life and so they dont send just anyone to go there. With Elizabeth its obvious shes as much of a zealot as you can get. However Philips real opinions have been pretty ambiguous he doesnt believe so strongly. So why did they send him?The recent flashbacks to his parents seem to have been the final piece of the puzzle. Philip was born in approximately  assuming hes about  at the beginning of the series. His childhood falls firmly under Stalins rule. Essentially he was a kid when the GULAG was at its height. He must have turned them into the KGB for something. He never talks about his parents it clearly isnt something he wants to mention. The flashbacks clearly bother him. He has conflicted feelings. Stalin definitely encouraged kids to turn in their parents so thats why I think it is likely what happened.,TheAmericans,dg4uzno,4,t5_2us0e

11652393,0,t3_6674lp,I thought it got better up until S. This year so far is a noticeable step down. Its just too slow  and pointlessly slow just padding out scenes for the sake of filler. I think someone told them its great that youre not rushing through things! and they took that to mean the slower the better. But there are limits. Its gotten to the point where several times an episode Im reading something else while listening on audio because I know that whole minutes are going to go by without anything happening and if anything is happening the music cues me to pay attention. And not in a Better Call Saul way with minutes of silent plotting but just with minutes of... digging holes. If it were a scene or two Id watch it but now its almost every scene that could do with being cut substantially. Or you know interrupted by SOMETHING HAPPENING. Yes the people talking quietly to each other scenes were always good often the best scenes of all  but now its JUST people talking quietly to each other and almost nothing else and the monotony is damaging it.Its like... before their method was to ratchet up tension. Thered be one ratchet of drama and then wed sit for a while at that level anxious about the next ratchet and then it would come from an unexpected direction. Now it feels like were sitting at the same level for whole episodes at a time and thats not exciting.Theres also a problem for me with characterisation. Which is weve had it. Normally you establish the characters in depth and then tell the story with them. With The Americans it feels as though the further we get into the story the more attention is being given to nuances of characterisation except... we already know it by now. Its just repeating itself. Sure individual scenes still work where theres actually some development  like Elizabeth this week. But overall the ratio of amount of time fixed on closeups of people emoting to actual amount we learn from that emoting is going up and up. Im sticking with it because in past years theyve done a good job of having the plot explode at the end of each season. But this year Im more worried than ever that the showrunners have just sworn off explosions  and excitement and pleasure and anything audiences might like  and arent going to have everything just fizzle damply and Artistically.,TheAmericans,dggta7o,2,t5_2us0e
