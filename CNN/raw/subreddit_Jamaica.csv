534896,0,t1_cg0ypja,There is nothing cool about Ricks.  Its a tourist trap.  I dont know where people get the idea that its cool.   Dives  awesome.  Jus Natural  super cool.  I wouldnt go driving around in Kingston either.  I cant get a taxi that is willing to take me there.  They all say its too dangerous.  Spend a few days in Negril  a few in TB and a few in MoBay.  Rastafarians be definitiondont like white people.  There is a little Town kn south of Negril called Little Bay.  Go spend a couple days there  I promise you will have a whole new understanding of Jamaicans.  The trick is SLOW DOWN.  Relax.  Walk good.,Jamaica,cg12or9,-1,t5_2rn39

African American Chinese American Italian american... it never ceases to amaze me how addicted to labels they are. Ive never heard a Jamaican call themself anything but Jamaican.

10229017,0,t1_dc2n8h4,I see. The thing is I remember when the Contractor General had infact advised not to grant them any spectrum licenses and to revoke what was already given to them. Even if the principals may possibly face drug and lotto scamming charges now why didnt the Government take head from the Contractor General. Its his job after all to advise accordingly. I can see how that the benefit of a new Company providing competition jobs etc for economic growth and what not but I feel as if the government havent looked at it with as much detail as they should have. I wouldnt be surprised if there are actual Chinese related concerns though. As much as they want to invest into Jamaica etc there are already environmental problems with some of the work theyve done. Not to mention even more buy outs of Jamaican soil and businesses. ,Jamaica,dc3ilha,1,t5_2rn39
