1600106,0,t3_2cg40p,The request for evidence will likely arrive by mail with detailed instructions on how to reply.  Think of it as a road map to approval.  Ive seen F RFEs that were used to indirectly attack the school which although accredited was a university with majority foreignnational enrollment and an emphasis on curricular practical training at the grad school level.  We had all the info they sought but it was obvious they were hoping to catch the school in act of technical noncompliance. ,USCIS,cjgv27b,1,t5_2udts

People in nonimmigrant status were never supposed to want to immigrate aside from dual intent work visas but thats beside the point. Pretty much all bills in congress that propose a path to legalization for unauthorized immigrants have an eligibility clause saying anyone in nonimmigrant status isnt eligible. DACA was created using presidential discretion. Im not a lawyer but I dont think the president has the power to grant further status to already legal people. All the president can do is say were not going to deport you. Heshe cannot give anybody permanent resident status.,USCIS,ctxs59u,1,t5_2udts

Are you planning a fiance visa? You can just apply for her green card after marriage. ,USCIS,cu4bfp8,1,t5_2udts

10781584,0,t1_ddrzy9y,Thanks for the info! If Im from Colombia essentially what this means is that for EB the filing is current meaning that if the Certificate of Labor is approved I could apply the I and I concurrently correct? Hypothetical scenario my employer applies for the certificate of labor now and lets say it takes  months to get approved.  It would get approved in October of this year. If in October the filing is current for my country I could then apply I and I concurrently and receive a work permit and ability to stay legally until the process concludes right? Not sure if Im reading it right. So if my OPT then is good through August  my only problem would be if lets say the certificate of labor is approved but the filing status is not current and theyre backlogged because then Id be in danger of not receiving the temporary work permit before my OPT status runs out?,USCIS,dds1irs,1,t5_2udts
11196248,0,t3_5ybypy,I agree with what StuffedWithNails said  Your girlfriend should be fine as long as she brings whatever evidence she has. They will most likely not ask for it however. I recently traveled on VWP Sweden twice myself and all they ask is what your reason for visiting is who youre staying with and how long youre staying for. She just needs to say that shes visiting her boyfriend and your contact information and address will be on the ESTA application anyways as I assume shell be staying with you  If they were to question her evidence in the form of apartment lease employmenteducation in Latvia and her NOA of your application should suffice. Just dont volunteer more information than needed but be honest if it were to come up. Hoping for a speedy approval! ,USCIS,df12xnm,1,t5_2udts
11215460,0,t3_602tm1,You can apply for a fee waiver for the N Naturalization application through form I.The civics test is a part of the larger portion which is the naturalization interview where your eligibility to naturalize is assessed by a uscis officer. There are  total questions to study which are available online on the uscis website in English and other various languages.The interviewing officer will ask you at most  of the randomly selected questions and you have to answer at least  right. The English test if you are required to is a short  word sentence you have to read and a short  word sentence you have to write. The whole test is very brief. If you fail the test you will have a second chance scheduled by the officer about a week or two out  and even a third chance. If you fail three times you must refile. Good luck! ,USCIS,df39bta,2,t5_2udts
