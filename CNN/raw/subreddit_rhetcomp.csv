I hope this helps!I think someone with interests in those areas could draw on our considerable strengths in several interconnected subfields. For example one of my TampT advisees Valerie Kasper is studying an early th century newspaper  print tech  by reference to cutting edge work in DigitalSpatial History my fields Theories amp Technology of Lit Study Tony Grajeda and RhetComp Stacey Pigg.
