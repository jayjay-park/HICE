3059802,0,t1_cocq4q0,The feedback is appreciated.  Ill repost on on rColumbus in a few days if there arent a lot of responses here.  No pitches because its easy for salesstaff to make promises but fail to deliver when the pressure is on.  I want to hear from those who have experiences with a company they like not hand picked clients setup to make the company look as good as possible.  Though I suppose itd be easy enough for someone to fake it in here posing as a satisfied client.  So maybe thats pointless?  Theres got to be a decent way of weeding out the badmediocre ones.  ,ColumbusIT,cof595b,2,t5_33127
