It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble or economic bubble  although some researchers have noted that the Kipper und Wipperzeit episode in  a Europewide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare featured manialike similarities to a bubble.  The term tulip mania is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values gtThe  event was popularized in  by the book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds written by British journalist Charles Mackay According to Mackay at one point  acres  ha of land were offered for a Semper augustus bulb.  Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackays book is a classic his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.  gtgtImage i  A tulip known as the Viceroy viseroij displayed in the  Dutch catalog Verzameling van een Meenigte Tulipaanen. Its bulb cost between  and  guilders florins depending on size aase. A skilled craftsman at the time earned about  guilders a year.

VIP first night demo at their studio and then Bomdiggidy was hosting Joes  day workshop.One of the employees was in contact with Joe dealing with just about all of that mess. The boss was the one paying for everything. The recently mentioned employee had got into it with the boss one day and went a little to far and got himself relieved of his duties.He then managed to steal the show and brought it solely to Bomdiggidy. All while telling people who they had been doing business with for cool stuff for the show that the boss would still be paying for it. What a dickhead.    ,glassheads,dac4rba,1,t5_2sc99

Elbo does very little sculpting with tools on his brontosauruses compared to dan Evans he adds many indentions for detail.holy fuck how many times do I have to say that I dont own elbos work I absolutely dislike it and Im not riding his dick in the slightest just telling you that youre and idiot if you cant see how similar they are. Elbos have way more detail than dan evans dinos you have that backwards..... everyone in this sub has said the same thing too. go post on Instagram or the facebook groups and youll get the same shit Im telling you. the community at large does not approve of dan evans the only people who do are the broke bois that cant afford the real deal and have to try and justify buying knock offs of the pieces they actually want....gtIm just giving you some things to help you see here not fucking identical like your sayinglolololol youre and idiot they look absolutely similar shit even our esteemed krunk collectors here think so mrebb gtThe legs all have work on them. There isnt clear involved in the piecesthere is no work in the legs of your dino. work is not a single color pull hell even clear can be worked..... you misunderstand the definition of work in heady glass. work means that there was significant techniques used such as wig wags disk flips encalmo etc not just using a single color to make a foot or a leg....gtSo those fat undetailed limbs that you love so much were actually coil potted before by a talented apprenticeyou mean like in every other fucking studio with a decent glassblower? you act like coil potting is some sort of difficult and out of the ordinary technique to make color and that if the artist doesnt do it himself its a detriment against the work..... you couldnt be more wrong. gtSo those fat undetailed limbs that you love so much were actually coil potted before by a talented apprentice... there is a million reasons why I choose dan Evans over elbo... I could go on for a while.you could go on for days with your bullshit excuses. dont worry the value on your dino will be plummeting with the rest of dan evans work....... all in all you are a complete and utter moron who should stick in rtrees until he can see the similarities between these dinos..... hahaha fucking hell the amount of ignorant and uneducated people that are coming to this sub lately..... ,glassheads,dda79bh,2,t5_2sc99

11286311,0,t1_dfa090l,We sell Liberty where I work and absolutely love their work and the people that make it. I must add though that give the nature of Libertys work they wont be as durable as some other American brands. They remove a good amount of glass which weakens certain points. We do a demonstration where I work where we drop a pipe on the floor because we know they wont break. The one and only time I did it with a Liberty pipe it broke which I should have know would happen. ,glassheads,dfbac90,2,t5_2sc99

11696886,0,t1_dglqryf,LOL k how is what he said not true?
