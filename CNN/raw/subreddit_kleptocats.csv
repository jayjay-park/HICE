7732833,0,t1_d3l5wd0,maybe if you move the folder of the game with it but it is not as easy to achieve.,kleptocats,d3l62kd,2,t5_3dacd
8314835,0,t3_4hp9pq,I have been making my own theories about this game ever since I saw the HELP message on the fridge. I havent seen the mirror yet but the cat with the knife was a bit suspicious to me. There are a lot of references to different games that come off as weird or suspicious if you dont know the game like the black hand which is a reference to the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim. However you put the pieces together so well that the references might even have meaning! Keep being suspicious your not the only one!,kleptocats,d5gwsve,1,t5_3dacd

9054979,0,t3_547v67,it seems to me the more items you have the more likely they bring just money  like instead of a duplicate item its a money bag. Im not sure how the percentages of chance work but I think I remember reading that in a patch note somewhere? Try making sure your cats are all at  love before sending them out to improve your odds.,kleptocats,d809icd,2,t5_3dacd
