769272,0,t3_22y63j,Never drop this silly experiment.So after a quick google weve got to suggest wheat bread poppy seed black sesame salt caraway seed sesame seed onion and garlic. The Everything Bagel doesnt sound like a mass explosion of thick flavour in your mouth from what Im guessing it sounds like a pretty complex and savoury experience that still packs a wallop of umami taste with hints of saltiness and sharpness. As the enzymes in your mouth break down the bread itll turn sweeter perhaps this is something to take into account.On to primary ingredients Bread will be suggested by an appropriate rye whiskey not overly rye in the mash bill. Good call. The softness of the bagel might be suggested by rounding off the rye a little with water so it sounds like were already going down the Old Fashioned route. I like your infusion idea with the seeds. Keep the umamis with the umamis. I like Bockbocks suggestion with the yeasty beer but think the strong umami flavour of beer would overpower your bready rye before you got a discernable yeastiness out of it so I think you could probably achieve that with a lighter yeasty champagne top as well.Salt will bring sharpness to the Everything Bagel but we can probably suggest that sharpness with bitterness. Similarly onion and garlic add acidity and bite. Being that umami tempers acidic sourness and bitterness I feel sourness and bitterness are closely enough related that to suggest these flavours requires some custom bitters. You could make homemade onion and garlic bitters using something sharp and overproof.What are the filling flavours youre going for? You mentioned prosciutto.,cocktails,cgrpys3,3,t5_2qpco

Its counter intuitive but sometimes its safer to work with liquid nitrogen bare handed thick rubber gloves are best though.  Your skin is so hot relative to the liquid nitrogen that as soon as it touches your skin it vaporizes so the droplets roll right off your skin like water droplets on a hot pan.  As long as the droplets dont fall into your shoe or the cuff of your shirt its fine but if you wear any fabric gloves for example the liquid nitrogen maintains contact with your skin longer and thats when you get burns.  Never dunk a gloved hand in liquid nitrogen.That being said I tried making liquid nitrogen ice cream in a plastic cup and it was too cold to hold when I initially poured it in.  So maybe a thick rubber glove would be best to handle the glass while stirring.Let me know if you have any specific questions.

On the plus side they float and that might be interesting.I am guessing the drink is a muddy reddish color. If your goal is to be visually striking the best thing to do is probably to create a garnish that contrasts against the color of the drink rather than matching it.Skewered blackberries would fit into the fruitiness and flavor profile of the drink probably. The color of the aviation is supposed to represent a blue sky so an egg white foam might be reminiscent of clouds. The redness of your drink might be more evocative of a sunset so a lemon peel cut into the shape of a circle could look like a setting sun.Alternatively you could try to make all of the flavors lighter and use less Pama to produce more of a classic aviation color.,cocktails,cia7vsu,2,t5_2qpco

Eleve sous bois meaning under the wood is aged up to two years in previously filled barrels usually exbourbon edit usually more neutral barrels either larger in size or refilled a time or two before. Eleve sous bois is typically used in cocktails due to the barrel rounding off the intensity of the rhum still plenty flavorful and yet affordable. A VSOP is overkill in my opinion tho Im sure it tasted great. I would recommend Clements new Select Barrel for cocktails.Also I was told Duquesne is distilled by La Mauny in the southeastern part of Martinique inbetween Clement and  Trois Rivieres.

The Negroni is a cocktail at once sharp and smooth lean and lush brusquely bitter and slightly sweet.

First noted in print in  in a slender volume called Barflies and Cocktails and forgotten almost ever since the Boulevardier takes the Negroni formula and gives it a twist by substituting whiskey for the gin. A simple substitution? Hardly. The bittersweet interplay between Campari and vermouth remains but the whiskey changes the storyline.

Years after the craft cocktail boom the ABC started enforcing and some lobbying quickly got an exemption for bars. I believe caterers still cant legally infuse spirits though.Similarly there was a recent law requiring bartenders and cooks wear gloves when prepping food or bartending. I cant remember whether it was only San Francisco or statewide. A lot of people were upset about it since it was extra hassle for little benefit and was really wasteful.

There are some really nice cheap cocktail shakers usually with jiggers hawthornes etc on eBay check em out.I like the idea though but as a way of simplifying consider adding the correct amount of water for dilution and then tell her to put them in the freezer until she wants them then just pour however they need to be.

3274797,0,t3_2xmt9f,I dont have a great suggestion for research but my  tip is to figure out what you need to make the drinks you want. Heres the flow that led to my first set of home bottles If I had to drink only one cocktail for the rest of my life it would be the Sazerac. So a bottle of rye a bottle of absinthe and a bottle of Peychauds Bitters. If I add a bottle of Angostura I can make an Old Fashioned.  With a bottle of sweet vermouth thats enough for a Manhattan.  A bottle of Campari gets me to the Boulevardier which I enjoy a great deal.  At this point I think it makes sense for me to add bourbon for variety.  And then gin for a Negroni. Which also incidentally unlocks the Gimlet Gin amp Tonic and Tom Collins.Thats the core of my home bar and thats where Id recommend anyone else start build your collection from a handful of drinks youll be happy to make more frequently and then branch out. You wont be able to make every drink ever showcased on this sub but its a good way to get a collection of booze that will keep you happy. ,cocktails,cp1jy3h,27,t5_2qpco

If they dont...thats not your problem theyre in the wrong job I havent tried them backtoback but my guess would be the balancing act of getting it right. Things that I think off offhand. You may need to add more simple syrup to gain the same intensity of the mint. That may throw off the sweetness factor.. Never underestimate the power of fresh mint.. You lose the look and feel of muddled mint in the bottom of the glass mingled with the ice cracked or otherwise..

A decent bottle isnt cheap but you dont need much for most drinks if St. Georges ml is available it goes a long way for dashes in a Corpse Reviver  Modern No.  and similar. St. Germain elderflower liqueur is a really unique one that Im quite fond of. It goes well with citrus or gin and other lighter drinks.On the subject of gin have you considered an Old Tom I use Haymans or a Genever? Theyre more specialized than London Dry the Genever especially but theyre fun to play with.Im a big fan of Tiki so for the rum collection add a a rhum agricole for sure maybe a demerara. The Appleton is solid for jamaican but consider Don Q over Bacardi for your Puerto Rican its the popular brand over there and cheaper than the bat for a better product. I dont have enough experience with Cruzan to comment there. Lastly tikiwise find or make some orgeat for your syrup selection.For the brandy section consider Lairds bonded apple brandy over their applejack for more flavor and less neutral grain burning. A modest calvados can also take you in some interesting directions.Lastly how does that orange liqueur youre using compare to other dry tripple secs? Im not in the THERE IS ONLY COINTREAU camp but replacing my cheapass orange liqueur with something serious a few months back made a world of difference.,cocktails,cq4esrq,10,t5_2qpco

Proof the spirits can cause somethings to just dissapear the more you stir it. I played around trying to make a white version of this using Hakushu Hendricks Calvados after that deciding on the fourth ingredient was harder i tried Strega White Rums  Soju and a bunch of stuff. Apple bitters and angostura. Sweetener matters a lot too. I could just never get it right with some iterations tasting amazing and others heading straight to the drain.

4516587,0,t1_cszxe7k,Interesting I hadnt heard that.  To the Google!  Turns out that both were terms for gin at different points.  Blue ruin was common in the s and mothers ruin or mothers milk were common in the s.Blue ruin also became slang for complete and utter destruction  since it was commonly drunk by the poor who couldnt afford anything better.  So if you were drinking blue ruin you were at rock bottom.Mothers ruin may be due to the fact that gin was also favored by women as much as men so there was much concern that young mothers were being driven to dissipation. I think back then there was a stronger divide where men and women drank different beverages so the fact that women were drinking it made it particularly problematic.  Again this is largely knowledge derived from a ton of historical romances where the hero always runs off to fetch his date a proper ladys drink like ratafia which I recently just discovered is pure brandy mixed with fruit and sugar.  No wonder they were always swooning.Sorry for the meandering  this was a crosssection of two of my favorite things  etymology and booze.  ,cocktails,cszykff,2,t5_2qpco

It is a very cheap way of getting around.  Eurail passes give you a certain number of travel days my  day pass was  US dollars and you have to use them within  months of activating the pass at a train station.  You just write down the date youll be on the trains and if youre riding regular trains youll probably have to hop trains on regular rides you dont have to pay anything.  You can also reserve seats on trains which I recommend for longer rides.  That costs a bit of money but your pass should give you a bit of a discount on those.  The Rail Planner app will give you rail schedules all over Europe.  If you tell it your starting location where youre trying to go and what time youre departing it will give you a list of trains or series of trains that will get you there.

What youre really getting by putting orange liqueur in cocktail is the flavor and aroma of orange peel which all good orange liqueurs have. Some are more bitter some are sweeter.

6913780,0,t3_4afulg,This cocktail is an update on the classic Old Fashioned by Jack McGarry the cofounder of The Dead Rabbit Grocery and Grog in New York. This drink subs in Irish Whiskey for Bourbon Benedictine for Simple Syrup and adds Orange Bitters. About the only things that remain are the Aromatic Bitters and the Orange Twist.This variation may give the original Old Fashioned a run for its money. Its really complex and herbal and spiced and citrusy and its extremely easy to drink. If you love the taste of Whiskey youll like it. If you dont love the taste of Whiskey youll like it too. It really meets at a great nexus of flavors.One of the keys to getting it just right is to control the level of dilution. You need to make sure its diluted enough to take some of the sting out but not enough to totally thin out the flavors.Obviously for the Benedictine make sure youre using actual Benedictine and not BampB the premade cocktail. The problem is that the bottles and labels look pretty similar. But just make sure its Benedictine.I guess if you use a nonIrish Whiskey for this drink Im sure it will still be awesome but I guess youll have to come up with another name for it.For the Irish Whiskey I like using a Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey or what used to be called a Pure Pot Still Irish Whiskey. The distinguishing mark of an Irish Whiskey is that it is made from both malted and unmalted barley as opposed to a Single Malt Scotch for instance which is all malted barley. Most Irish Whiskeys Blended Irish Whiskeys start off as Single Pot Still Irish Whiskeys but then neutral grain alcohol is added to help stretch out the product and make it cheaper to produce without sacrificing potency proof. This results in the Blended Irish Whiskey having a thinner taste to it. The Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey has a much bolder meatier flavor to it. Red Breast Green Spot Powers Signature Release Powers Johns Lane etc. are all good Single Pot Stills. I like Green Spot for this one but use whatever tickles your fancy.

American style gin will have less of the pine needles taste but still have a good strong floral character. Old Tom gins are sweet gins. Genever is a weird hybrid using a partial malt bill in its mash. I bought a bottle of Anchor genever and it seemed yo me like a cross between a gin and unaged whiskey.Someone will probably come along and correct me or clarify what was said. Gin is the base liquor I am probably least interested in.The main opinion I was trying to express in the above post was that gin varies greatly and the styles are quite different. I dont feel like the styles are very interchangeable. If I were to make myself a drink with rye I feel like I could use most ryes and be satisfied. Sure I would prefer certain labels to others but I could walk into a bar and say make me a Negroni but sum the gin for rye and be happy with what I got. If I order a drink with gin I will want to be very specific about what gin is used.My recommendation if one was learning about gin would be to pick a specific drink like a gin and tonic. Go to a bar and have the bartender make you that exact same drink with various different gins and see which appeals to you most. That way you wont end up like me and have a bottle of gin around for removing stickers.,cocktails,d59m9sz,1,t5_2qpco

Caramel Apple        Shot of Berentzen shot of your favorite caramel whiskey or vodka whiskey ends with more substance vodka tends to be sweeter and fill the rest with had cider.

Shot of a decent whipped cream vodka McKenzies pumpkin cider.                            McKenzies is actually an amazing ciderespecially with flavored versions.   It makes it a great filler for a cocktail good flavor with mild alcohol content but not enough to add to that burn.

I literally only use them in Sazeracs and I feel bad and guilty every time I see them sitting there collecting dust. Again this brings fruit flavors out more than the Angostura and brings the whole drink up a level lighter instead of the darker Angostura seems to encourage. Rose water? I literally have no idea.

Old genever has to contain more than  maltwine and young has to contain  or less.  Maltwine is as I understand it a grain mash distillate distilled to a relatively low proof.  The balance of the genever that isnt maltwine is made up by grain neutral spirits in the case of old genever or by grain neutral spirits andor sugar alcohol for young genever.So the overall result is old genevers taste more like a white whiskey and young genevers taste more like vodka. ,cocktails,ddvu5tu,1,t5_2qpco

Less Campari or equal parts with the Vodka or Gin. Campari and grapefruit have a fantastic affinity for each other. ,cocktails,demmlrr,1,t5_2qpco

Very few people actually responded to the question and were eager to jump in with thats too much effort and destined to go terribly awry.While I agree with the sentiment and the fact that the OP shouldve included more detail I attempted to explain that I do in fact know what Im doing here.  Im well aware of the expense the effort and the complexity that something like this entails which is half the point.  What Im actually looking for is drink ideas.So sure its arrogant to say its okay guys Im really fucking good at making cocktails.

So technically flavored vodka is not vodka according to the law.  Its in its own category that happens to have a name in common with vodka.  Confusing? Welcome to TTB .

11508459,0,t1_dg0fmyc,Do you have a favorite coffee drink? Personally Im a chai latte drinker so Id start there. Maybe do a chai syrup or a chaiinfused bourbon. If peppermint is your thing you could do a similar concept theres an awesome liqueur called Wondermint if its available to you and you could garnish with the peppermint straws you can drink through and then eat the soft ones. Bourbon would probably work best although Irish whiskey is wonderful as well or depending on the flavors you pick a good molassesy rum would be great. I dont have a particular cocktail here but do some research into Irish coffees and then pick flavors you like. I work at an Irish whiskey bar now our recipe isI spoonful brown sugar oz Irish whiskeyTop hot coffeeTop whip cream for ours we just take heavy cream and hand shake it which takes forever. Dont do thisFresh grated cinnamonSuper classic but a great base. Make and chill the coffee beforehand. Find a liqueur that compliments your idea peppermint schnapps creme de cassis  Averna or Foro both richer style amari theres an awesome company out of Mississippi that does a chicory liqueur called Hoodoo Cathead is the distillery. Infuse a bourbon or have the bartenders make a syrup if they can infusing will probably be easier though as its something you can do yourself ahead of time. Again use your favorite Starbucks order and go wild! Itll be a lot of fun for you and your fianc to make at home too while you find a recipe that you like.  ,cocktails,dg0hhe5,2,t5_2qpco

11562429,0,t3_64z259,First a lot of this is hyperbole and extremism because its fun. At the end of the day were all enjoying drinks.Now when I was bartending I noticed I picked up customers for how I made drinks not the menu. They were regulars whose loyalty was to my craft not what the bar manager decided to put on the menu. These drinkers were not adventurousbut they were very particular. They couldnt care less about our fresh herb garden that we would pluck ingredients from to order. They wanted their martini to be the same each and every time without having to tell me anything other than the usual. Im one of those types of drinkers and I think this article speaks to our kind.However a good bar needs to cater to both groups and a third that simply doesnt care about craft at all and needs an approach to make all happy. If I order a Negroni without even looking at the menu and the bar has a bloodorangewhatever on the menu I expect the bartender to clarify what I want classic or house. If I say Negroni I should not be served an drink inspired by the drink I said.,cocktails,dg6ltvf,3,t5_2qpco

Its pretty smooth too. I enjoy it straight and it makes really good manhattans boulevardiers and old fashioneds.Insanely Dark Rum low Cruzan Blackstrap . There is no bottle of liquor that offers so much weirdness and flavor for  bucks. Its heavy sweet dark and bitter. Sounds unpleasant but float this shit on a Daiquiri or Hurricane and come talk to me. Aged Rumlow Appleton Estate Reserve . Excellent rum for the price. Sweet smooth caramel vanilla tropical fruit flavor. Mix it with tropical juice drink it straight or make rum old fashioned. Aged Rummediumhigh Zaya Gran Reserva . This will spoil you.
