537138,0,t1_cg127f4,Theres a beginning middle and end basically the only things needed for a story.  Its just that theyre kind of implied The couple falls in love.  This implies a point before that when they werent in love.  Beginning. The couple falls in love.  Implies the event of falling in love.  Middle. As a consequence of the couple falling in love someone suspects gravity.  The end.So Ive got as much of a story as that Hemingway story in the sidebar.  Maybe not as much emotional resonance but thats not a requirement for a story.,sixwordstories,cg1bvi3,2,t5_2rfom

1844367,0,t1_ckbfga4,If that was their intent then they could have used quotation marks. And again someone saying this to another person isnt a story. It doesnt hint at all towards any sort of character or story. Someone feeling down isnt a character. Theyd need to hint at why this person is feeling down why this other person wants to help them or how theyre going to try to get better. That gives it story and movement. I cant make a story by just putting up Hello good morning. That isnt a story. By your standards that implies character and an event. But again theres no start or finish its one thing happening. One scene is not an entire story. This is why this exercise is so hard having a start and finish to a whole story in six words is hard. And yet Hemingway outlines what could be a childs entire life. To be left thinking What happened to the baby that was suppose to wear those? is very different from this person is sad. The Hemingway story gives you a big question to think about and imagine where as the OP doesnt nearly have the same kind of weight. If there is a question you already answered it. Theres a person who feels sad the end. ,sixwordstories,ckbfxfk,2,t5_2rfom

3290771,0,t1_cp34qcz,Can I ask you guys some honest questions? Are you really any different from your armie persona at this point? How long have you been staring into the abyss? What else do you do online? Where else do you go to be a good person? Do you spend any time what so ever making positive comments anywhere? When was the last time you actually stood up to support the opposite of what you parody online in real life? Youre a walking Poes Law at this point. No one likes you. No one wants you. You seem to to think you bring some sort of avantgarde elite quality comedy to the table and the plebeian hordes simply dont understand your particular panache for the extreme ruse. That you are better than those racist or lowintellect comments and that your presence is necessary to maintain a quality standard. In truth you are not better you are worse. Infinitely worse. You are people who threw away your intelligence to act fools and in so doing no one cares to differentiate you from the idiots you pretend not to be. I dont care if you dont change I just want you to be a little more aware and perhaps try to foil your irony with the actual representation of what you would like to see. I mean look at Berta Lovejoy. She produces full on videos at this point but at no instance is she ever making anyone aware she is a parody. Whatever he or she was before they are now Berta. They ARE that radical feminist caricature they hated infinitely worse than any person who was perceived as that caricature. WHATEVER Berta thinks about his real identity online hes Berta through and through so you can only assume it bleeds down into his actual human character.

E.G. the big red ball vs the red big ball or even ball the big red and so on. A better thought for word order in English would be to construct a series of ifthen rules and then apply those to word order.
