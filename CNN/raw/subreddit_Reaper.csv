4202653,0,t3_38wco0,I often dont have a fine enough resolution to draw in my automation for example having my left guitar track being delayed from my right guitar track by ms at the start of the song and ms by the end of the song for that neat widening effect. Instead of drawing it in I make an automation point and then click it bringing up the menu window for that particular point. Then I write in the value I wanted manually.Often I find myself doing this in Reaper setting parameters to a finer point or indeed past the end of where theyre supposed to go by manually writing in the value Im after. You can have as many automation points as youd like too. The worst culprit Ive found is the ReaEQ which can actually go well beyond the values marked in the graph and the sliders. Often to add a pitched element to a noisy sound I need something like a dB very very narrow notched boost of a particular frequency. It took me a long time to realise that the EQ could actually go well beyond its bounds. Those bounds are there not to limit the user but so that the fields and sliders have more positions that are useful on them to the average user. Theres no point having a slider that goes between  and  when youre usually only wanting to work between  and .But sometimes for those of us that need extreme values which seems to happen to me all the time we just have to manually input the numbers ourselves. Hopefully Reaper  wont fuck it all up for us.,Reaper,crzaky4,1,t5_2rm0e

5391493,0,t1_cvxj3td,You want to export them as regions then not stems. You need to make a time selection defining a region of your project and choose make region or whatever. Do that for all your regions. Then go to region manager I think its called that it will show a list of all the regions you just created. You can then select which tracks within reach region to export. Its confusing and is one of the few things pro tools does way better and faster. ,Reaper,cw0to06,1,t5_2rm0e

6752978,0,t1_d0ffbi5,EDIT Im saying the same thing as RedditYeti.I think an even better way would be to record the adjustments you do as the recording happens. If youre changing say a volume fader you can actually set the details of those movement to be recorded at the same time as the audio recording. On playback of the audio the recorded data called the envelope will tell the volume fader to automatically repeat the instructions you gave it previously. This is called automation.Actually I lie i think whatever works for you is the best way to do things but I want you to know this stuff is an option. ,Reaper,d0htcqu,1,t5_2rm0e

8673461,0,t3_4ykrai,The first thing I suspect is a problem relating to a plugins. If you were organized enough to keep all of your plugins in one folder then rename that folder so Reaper doesnt try to scan it when it opens. Try running reaper and see if it starts up correctly. If so then you need to figure out what plugins are causing Reaper to hiccup. My first inclination would be a VSTi since those seem to be more problematic in my experience.,Reaper,d6psz37,1,t5_2rm0e
