Even considering we were playing in a different formation than usual I still think we made too many silly mistakes. Also tonight you could really see how our offense stagnates without Pipa in the center moving the ball from the dmids to the forward players. However Finlay was able to get himself involved in the majority of the attacking plays and it gives me hope that his good form is sticking. Ive got high hopes for us after we come back from break. ,TheMassive,ci21rcg,3,t5_2s7xm

3400414,0,t3_2z2vpm,My brief recap  feedback would be greatNew Crew? Mission accomplished.    Columbus Crew SCs  home opener which doubled as the first home game with the new name and logo and the first game since Crew Stadium became MAPFRE Stadium saw a poised Columbus cruise to a  win over rivals Toronto FC.  Adding an accomplished striker to this team is like night and day. The Crew consistently channelled their buildup play among the best in the league last year into legitimate chances throughout the night. Kei Kamaras size quickness movement off the ball and awareness are major assets to this club.  Similarly new signing Hernan Grana showed flashes of excellence on the right side especially when combining with Ethan Finlay early on. Although Grana had several unforced errors throughout the match when he was on he looked the perfect compliment to Waylon Francis at the right back position. Last year Hector Jimenez Chad Barson Eric Gehrig and Josh Williams all competed for time in that spot and at various points each held it down well but Grana is next level. Keeping him healthy and in form will be helpful for the Crew.  Speaking of Finlay I joked that he couldve been up for Man of the Match for drawing the foul that led to Justin Morrows red card and completely changed the game. With Morrow gone it became a matter of when not if the Crew would score in the second half having dominated the flanks in the first half.  Justin Meram as always was BOOM or miss. Meram has always been a bit of an enigma for me just as likely to blast a through ball out of bounds as he is to beat two defenders and cheekily chip a keeper from a tight angle as he nearly did late in the second half last night. Keeping him confident again will lead to significant payoffs this season.  Wil Trapp was his usual self. Although Torontos Michael Bradley had a significantly harder job last night after the Toronto red card it was Trapp who looked the part of poised U.S. international. Partnering in the midfield with Trapp was Mohammed Saied Columbus new Swedish signing of Eritrean descent filling in for the suspended Tony Tchani. Saeid was lively quick and confident especially when compared to Tchani who often uses his size and strength to hold off defenders and slow things down. Regardless Saied and Tchani can both get the job done it will be interesting to watch the battle for minutes between the two if the coaching staff decides there will be one.  My only defensive worry came just before the final whistle when the Crew deserved to be scored on from a Toronto free kick. Several Reds ran free as Columbus defenders remained planted in the ground. Whether that was due to the scoreline or a misguided offsides trap Columbus would do well to work on that.  Overall Game  of the Trillium Cup wasnt much of a challenge for Columbus even before the red card. Apart from Giovinco running free from Trapp a couple of times in the first half the defense looked solid and the Columbus midfield was its usual fluid self under Berhalter combining well in the final third and utilising support from both outside backs. Toronto has boatloads of individual talent but did not mesh whatsoever and Columbus capitalized on their lackluster performance.,TheMassive,cpfvfu6,2,t5_2s7xm

Pipa played with a lot of passion and was everywhere he needed to be but he let his emotion get the most of him near the end. I still think that Grana is one of our key players this year because he does a great job of winning possession and fucking around in the corner until he somehow clears it straight to Kei. Outside of those  the squad was pretty average but I think that having Trapp Meram and Francis back will fix a lot of our problems.,TheMassive,cpu61xw,0,t5_2s7xm

8736509,0,t1_d6wrg49,Im definitely on board with the idea that making the playoffs is an awfully low bar to set for someone to keep their job. In this league its evident that most teams including Columbus ebb and flow. We do well we stop doing well we make changes we start doing well again.Heres my take and this might get a bit exhaustive. If you want a TLDR  If we finish dead last or next to last fire him at the end of the season. If we make significant improvements and I mean real not oh we won two more games! or Oh we finished third from last! then reevaluate. I dont want to set a bar like making the playoffs because thats silly and really doesnt mean anything in this league. We are on the same page there.IMO our team has a serious mental problem right now. I think the talent in terms of soccer ability is there to do whatever we want to do. Its our managers job to well manage the mentality. If we need psychologists get us psychologists. If we need to fire players fire the players.So with all of that said if the ownership is still bought in to Gregg and wants to keep him around the only way I will be renewing my season tickets is if there are significant roster changes and I mean  of the starting lineup gone type of significant. I mean keep Ola Naess maybe Trapp maybe Higuain and trade everyone else away. Not because theyre not good enough technically but because the mental state of the club is woeful and the quickest way to change that is to change personnel. ,TheMassive,d6xpmz2,1,t5_2s7xm

10725809,0,t1_ddl21ia,If Steffen works out then Berhalter will look pretty good for bringing him on.  But it worries me that the spot hasnt been locked down at this point.  If Steffen is really the next big thing youd think he would have beaten out Stuver for the spot already.  Right now GK seems to be the weak spot on the roster.,TheMassive,ddmacs3,2,t5_2s7xm

It probably has a lot to do with how much they have on their plate at work this week and maybe they just had a major breakthrough on a product upload template spreadsheet that theyve been working on for a long time and are spending every waking minute finalizing something that will unquestionably revolutionize the entire material handling industry.
