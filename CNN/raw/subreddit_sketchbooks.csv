I just sort by top submissions from the past week pick out the top  and go with those. If the submitted picture is too dark or low res or your face is obscured then I move out of the top . Can you draw me?Post your picture here and Ill do my best to get to it just make sure the picture is clear and well lit and your whole head is in frame. Am I supposed to roast your drawings?You can if you want to but thats not the reason I do these. What materials do you use? Prismacolour Colerase pencils in a Moleskine sketchbook.Where can I follow you?Instagram Facebook DeviantArt Tumblr ,sketchbooks,d4hedum,1,t5_2rkol
