11550120,0,t1_dg4vvh2,I turn my head as I hear the clank of steelshod boots on the wet paving stones. Three guards looking as though they are ready for battle approach me warily. Well I would approach cautiously too if I thought there might be some killer with a gun on the loose. The horse belonged to Thebin Thinwick who I caught fleeing the city with stolen property of the Baron I announce as I get to my feet. Unfortunately his partners in crime managed to get him away. I look at the horse again that gun of Tanyas was quite impressive. Im not the one who killed the horse that would be the other witness. And thats the gist of it though Im sure you have a lot of questions I say with a hint of a rueful smile. I am perfectly aware of how the situation looks but I have plenty of others I can call on to back me up.,Frontiers2017,dg57jif,1,t5_3j9fr
