979764,0,t1_chfn9kr, In real life a CAVE room is a cube shaped room that you stand in the middle of. An image is projected on each of the  walls plus the ceiling and the floor. These flat images which surround you create an impression of a D environment. Youre going to recreate that experience in a JanusVR room. Here are some sample imagesYou could make a cave out of Minecraft Team Fortress  Garys Mod or anything that is plausibly mainstream. Id hope someone would see the images and recognize the environment. The game title screen would be the main menu for a hypothetical or real D game for the Oculus Rift. Sure the nicer the better but it doesnt have to be terribly challenging. This does not need to be animated and it should not be interactive.,janusVR,chfnopc,3,t5_31czo

1322098,0,t1_cii1ku3,Thanks for looking into it.As for the resampling I dont actually know if it does that. But potentially it does. If for example your sound card supports playing back with  Hz sampling rate and the sound files have for example  Hz then a naive conversion does not produce the best quality because of frequency stuff. So pulseaudio supports some different algorithms that can be more cpu intensive for better quality. By default it isnt much I just thought it may add up... Or maybe it doesnt.Video is fine. Except for the upsidedown thing... But I havent heard from anyone else whether this is the case for them... Maybe its only for me? ,janusVR,ciicpts,2,t5_31czo

2577713,0,t1_cmut96o,Thats an interesting method. The reason for the x y z was on the idea of like video or image spheres where you dont have to move to the correct location as your vision will be exactly where its needed. Id assume some JS function would then take that and make it even more user friendly with different interfaces.,janusVR,cmv1n0a,1,t5_31czo
2585305,0,t1_cmvd26h,After a little research  this might be a little more trouble than i thought.   Still maybe doable  but you may need to specify alternate characters manually.  Probably worth it for the common accents e graveaigu  o umlaut  etc.   Dont think its worth messing with Cyrillic and certainty not asian characters  unless James adds the appropriate character sets.,janusVR,cmw1ciw,1,t5_31czo

3104929,0,t1_cojspyo,If seen a system in boost that lets you throw any errors into a sinks then you can control of how many output streams come from them. Lets you say throw all errors into a global sink but have  outputs  to the console that is only severe or above and  to a log file that contains everything. QT likely has something similar.,janusVR,cojtp32,1,t5_31czo

3135434,0,t3_2vyuhs,gtWhat if you put the door as a huge sphere around youIt happened one day. A person with no avatar created a spherical portal to a nice terrain room. I went into it. Its quite beautiful. I explore it. The trees look very moist and the terrain is very welloptimized. The shaders on the trees make it alot better and the relaxing music is well relaxing. After spending some time in this beautiful room I look up towards the gigantic spherical portal surrounding the world and begin flying towards it. Suddenly Harold Lotts head appears in the portal. His eyebrows move up and down and his eyes are glowing red. Harold Lotts head melts and Thomas The Tank Engine appears. He smiles. The screen begins shaking and everything is distorted. JanusVR crashes and I see a text file on my desktop. Its called MONEY.txt. I open it. It says    LODSOFEMONEThe Notepad window is fullscreen for some reason. I close the window. What I see next sends a chill down my spine.Its Thomas The Tank Engines face merged with Harold Lott with bite wounds everywhere. There is a hole in the forehead with bits of brain oozing out and half of the faces skin is peeled off gore sticking out. I hear a long loud beep my screen starts flashing rapidly and then my computer blue screens. My computer starts to overheat and then my computer literally melts into a pile of goo.,janusVR,comzgf9,1,t5_31czo
3235670,0,t3_2x1xjj,A few glitchs Ive noticed with saving out rooms.When you press control S to save out a room it removes the server  port  fields of the ltRoomgt tagThere is also a glitch with the way it saves out the tex fields of ltAssetObjectgt tagIf you have both a texcompresstrue and a  texlinearfalse it will save it out as  texlineartrue and a  texlinearfalseFor examples see my new stairwell www.thevrbar.comnewstairsnewstairs.html,janusVR,coxdtrt,1,t5_31czo
3270134,0,t3_2xl1ib,It looks intriguing.  Cant wait to hear more over the coming week.  If it is reasonably affordable Ill probably order the developer version which was on the htcvr.com site before they took it down used to have many details now just says coming soon.,janusVR,cp10sq2,2,t5_31czo
3273503,0,t3_2xm1xt,Looking good. I wonder if it should include the default values even though Janus deletes those on CNTLS.  Without that I feel people wont realize some of the options available. Another method would be that clicking on an Asset or Room code would reveal an example line.Also shouldnt those be quotation marks  and not apostrophes  ? Anyway getting closer to the day where editing an HTML and the room itself inside of Janus will merge.,janusVR,cp1en3z,2,t5_31czo
3310896,0,t1_cp5nyb8,ya probably around fridaythis weekend ill be doing the full server write.  If it doesnt work out with socket.io which is unlikely ill keep my ws version and just work off of that.the main server is simple enough its just a rewrite of a few things.,janusVR,cp5o4dr,1,t5_31czo
3340260,0,t3_2yet6y,Great video! Shows off Janus really well! I think the default chibis should be changed to something a little more professional. I worry that their presence gives the wrong impression to site owners that may be interested in setting up a VR presence That Janus is a game for children rather than a serious alternative to D web browsing. Maybe make their proportions more anatomically human? Or replace them with something more in line with the modern aesthetic of the new translated rooms perhaps? Just some thoughts from a master chief with a surfboard ,janusVR,cp90isx,3,t5_31czo
3365820,0,t1_cpbu6n0,Point taken and on a traditional browser Id agree but the Janus JS implementation is so heavily restricted that beyond potentially crashing the other client I dont thing you could hurt much.  There is no access to either the filesystem or to external web assets like you have in a normal browser even the janus websurfaces cant talk to the js so you could still only manipulate assets already loaded and specified by the room code and only while others are in the same room.,janusVR,cpbxfz4,1,t5_31czo

4345635,0,t3_3arysp,Turns out that you can get the ghost to show up with an invalid ghost.txt file in the AssetGhost tag... you cant use scr or just not specify src you have to specify something even if its invalid url.However it seems to only get the ghosts positional data from the ghosts.txt file so if you have an invalid one it doesnt actually read the pos attribute on the Ghost tag. Bug?It would seem you should be able to not have the src attribute on the AssetGhost tag and it should be able to read the pos data on the Ghost tag.EDIT I also cannot edit it in edit mode try changing position on this  macampwinEDIT Oddly enough I can change some of the other attributes just not pos or xyzdir.,janusVR,csfhgud,1,t5_31czo

6626234,0,t3_46cjpd,More importantly is a crash reporting bug. It may be the only metric you get of dropping user base.I have a set of rooms that consistently crash despite all the attempts to mitigate on one machine while others are fine. Ill link those later. But the key is that I have no clue what angers Janus to freeze. A crash reporter could at least tell you and if you have really bad bug in the wild.,janusVR,d04pk8m,1,t5_31czo

8632514,0,t3_4y07ir,This idea boils down to Click a link on the browser the world around you changes based on the target URLs HTML. Those that used JanusVR back when it was Firebox will remember that it used to be going to ANY webpage that didnt have Firebox code would have Janus assign a random room and skybox from any of  or so rooms. It would then randomly place images and links around that room. This suggestion about Browser Mode harkens back to that however template rooms are less about links to other room and instead about the visual appeal. Whats more I remember three years ago the excitement of creating my own little VR room using existing templates. VR Sites made that all the more easier to share. This can be recreated leveraging the new version of Janus. I think giving the average user that doesnt want to learn complex HTML JML or Javascript a method to simply assign a template room to a URL could be enough to create excitement. It just needs to be kept simple.,janusVR,d6ko64o,1,t5_31czo
9085945,0,t1_d83dob1,Right.  Once you go multiuser orientation state needs to be kept consistent between them i.e. common world space users have their own local spaces.  This is completely possible to add in  weve got a ton of other things we are working on now as well.,janusVR,d83zfwf,1,t5_31czo
9429676,0,t3_59ebqk,Personal space and the ability to control what one experiences in VR is very much in line with where JanusVR has been heading. In the multiplayer social experience users should have the ability to mute aspect of other users. That can be audio avatar text name live room edits etc. This does not have to be solely to prevent trolling. It could be a simple as a persons avatar is too large and blocking the view or a player has a hot mike. VR is supposed to generate a visceral reaction. If Dreadhalls can virtual monsters and sound can make you react in fear why not expect that virtual sexual assault can generate a visceral reaction. Now one can opt out of such experiences altogether but why not give tools to prevent the latter for those that would like the social without all the getting close.,janusVR,d9b9y1n,2,t5_31czo
