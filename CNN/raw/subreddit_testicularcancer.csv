5289833,0,t3_3mv3yh,Took about  weeks for me to start feeling normal again. After  week it was not too bad but a little sore.  If your job is very physical I would say plan for about  weeks to recover if you can take it easy at work  week might be enough.I was just prescribed Tylenol s took them for a few days and didnt really need them after that.,testicularcancer,cvnu6xe,1,t5_348dl
8301938,0,t3_4sygxa,Hey really glad its benign!! That must have been a huge relief. They havent found anything else that has been of note for me haha.,testicularcancer,d5fat9k,1,t5_348dl
10232678,0,t1_dc3w2nx,Thanks for the reply man. Yeah I thought only two round of chemo was odd but they said that it looked like such a small amount in the area leading to my lymphnode they just wanted to do two rounds for preventative purposes. Dont really know enough to dispute it with them so Ill just do what they tell me. Ive got a few syringes of RickSimpson Oil to take during chemo so thatll definitely help me in the long run.Yeah weve already discussed doing the port in fact I have the surgery scheduled for this coming up Monday. Is it uncomfortable? I sleep on my stomachchest every night so its going to be really hard switching up how I sleep. ,testicularcancer,dc3xjne,1,t5_348dl
10232941,0,t1_dc3xwj3,Well they said they wouldnt have even of done chemo except for I have just a very very small amount of cancer cells left in the areas that could lead to my lymph nodes my markers are all very low and within the normal range but they just want to do these rounds to take care of the very small amount leftover from the orchiectomy. I feel lucky to only be getting  rounds but of course if they feel like I need to do more theyll set me up with a third round. Yeah hopefully youre right about the weed. In addition to the RSO I also smoke highgrade pot so thatll most likely help negate most of the negative symptoms Ill experience. Keeping my fingers crossing that my experience is like yours.Yeah the percs I got after my orchiectomy were pretty nice for a week so itd be cool to get a little more after the port surgery. They helped me sleep a lot better which will be crucial during this time ,testicularcancer,dc3ym90,1,t5_348dl
10248897,0,t3_5mibo3,These drugs work. Esp the BEP although Ive never heard of just  rounds it should be . Oct last year I was diagnosed b nonseminoma. Had my lefty removed and immediately started x EP chemo. Lost my hair  weeks in. Started feeling like shit after the second round plus they give this Neulasta that makes you real sore. By round  I slept through that entire week. I was weak as hell. Never really nasueas though as I was smoking a lot of pot and taking their anti nausea drugs. For the first  rounds I was well enough to work as a cook at Outback in between treatments after about  days. I would do chemo  Monday thru Friday with  weeks off in between. It cured me BUT I still had a mass in my abdomen so I had to get an RPLND which was the worst part. Youll do great dont worry. This shit works very well for TC. I highly recommend smoking weed tho. The worst part of chemo for me was weird cognitive distortions. Ringing ears couldnt play video games cus it was like everything was flat. Couldnt smell or taste anything. Im  months in remission now and I have all my strength and feel great.With  rounds you should breeze through it buddy. Id ask about why theyre only giving you  rounds tho. Everything Ive read says xBEP or xEP.What state are you in btw? Im  and in FLEDIT it did cause some depression so I took an anti depressant and mood stabilizer for about  months. Just got off the anti depressant a month ago but am staying with the mood stabilizer Lamictal,testicularcancer,dc5rp0y,1,t5_348dl
10292291,0,t3_5n9yre,Good luck man. I go next month to get blood work and Xray on my chest to make sure the lesions in my chest are gone and dont need further treatment. I had laparoscopic RPLND and my pathology report came back clear ,testicularcancer,dcaoqod,1,t5_348dl

10663275,0,t3_5ralgr,Took me a while to get back to normal after  x BEP. I think it was close to a year until I would say I was  that last  was not easy to find again. Remember that chemo is poison and while it does the things you need it to it does stuff your body around.  You will get back to you again it just takes time. ,testicularcancer,ddfu363,1,t5_348dl

11159267,0,t3_5z9vaq,When youre driving avoid potholes. Go over speed bumps slow. Dont let him get up too much the abdomen is real tight. Offer to clean his area if needed. For me I didnt look down there for like  weeks. I didnt want to see how my sack or surgery looked btw doesnt look that different only having one ballBut yes. Avoid potholes lol. Overall the experience really isnt that bad. ,testicularcancer,deww2ym,5,t5_348dl
11312965,0,t3_61gh2u,No tumor markers is a good thing but some pathologies of cancer dont give tumor markers. What will happen is that theyre going to check out the testicle they removed and direct you into two paths.They were wrong you didnt have cancer. Enjoy your day.You had cancer. The testicle proves it. Everything else checks out but youre on surveillance for two years. If you have cancer but removed the testicle the majority of reoccurrences happen in the first year or two which is still unlikely but if its gonna happen its during this time.   year for me,testicularcancer,dfeb20m,2,t5_348dl
