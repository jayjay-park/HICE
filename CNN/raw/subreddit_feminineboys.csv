5933095,0,t3_3lq9u9,Youre sixteen so you have to put up with the family BS for two more years.  Be happy you didnt live  years ago when family didnt simply annoy you but Dads would beat you trying to beat the sissy out of you like mine did when I was your age.  Since hair is the only thing they seem to be hassling you about I suggest then around them keep it tied back and as neat as possible.  There are people who have an aversion to hair in general.  My mom kept her own hair in what she called a pixie cut which meant her hair was about an inch long for most of her life.  My Dad was ex military and believed all boys should maintain a military buzz cut.   So my Dad insisted me and my brothers have hair about a quarter inch long.  Even my sister wasnt allowed to have hair longer than two or three inches.  But then the Beatles invaded America and suddenly boys started growing their hair long.  By the age of twelve my hair was down to my waist.  I was a stubborn rebel so I endured almost daily beatings from my Dad who considered the only good fagot was a dead fagot.  But he died of a heart attack when I was sixteen.  After that I was free to be who I wanted to be.  The only haircut I got after that was when I had chemo.  If all your family is doing is annoying you then just grin and bear it.  Keep it neat and tied back and just Keep doing what you have to.  And be happy you live when you do.  ,feminineboys,cxxcxrr,1,t5_2vmuo

6212705,0,t1_cyv4kfr,That kinda depends on what what of kind of attention I want I guess I dont exactly go out of my way to hook up but Ill go to a club havent been to a gay one yet but there seems to be a lot of gay and bi guys in normal clubs if youre close to a uni or at studenty things and then get fairly drunk and dance not exactly something Im skilled at at said club with friends possibly make eye contact with someone someone possibly comes over we dance and then make out or whatever and then we could exchange numbers hookup whatever. Downsides of this method are depending on the club bad stuff could happen Ive got hit pretty hard for making a brief second of eye contact with people who are dicks and not exactly into the fact that I look and dance pretty girly. Secondly you have no control over the attention you get until it happens so you could be dancing with a genuinely sweet person or you could be getting ground on by a fifty year old who hasnt washed in... Ever. Coupled with low self esteem drunkness and lack of ability to say no to people this can end up badly. So you need to get good at shutting people down even when youre very drunk or high or pretty close to being gone definitely go out with a group of friends and have a hand signal for when youre unhappy they pretty much saved me a few times when I was very new to this stuff and you can save them back if they have problems. Another point to make is that this has only ever got me the attention of a girl once... And that attention didnt exactly last very long. Then theres the fact that a lot of girls in clubs expect you to spend money buying them drinks... Which I find icky and expensive I happily buy anyone drinks but it shouldnt be an exchange of money for their time.. Thats not really what Im into and it makes me feel shitty about myself like the only thing Im worth to someone is a drink.As far as dating goes Im not exactly that experienced. Ive met up with people in furry meetups that Ive met online and then kept seeing them and that sort of thing furries are pretty open to all sorts of stuff which is cool . Then theres people from my classes and stuff that Ive dated. I mean probably the best way is just being with people doing something youre both interested in like sports or classes or whatever really. Then theres always going out with people whos number you have from nights out which I havent done but Ive heard it has some mixed results. ,feminineboys,cyvtg1x,3,t5_2vmuo

When you say you were looking for meetups did you mean the furry kind or another kind?

From my experience its a common theme because even IF you post just looking for a relationship please do not send dick pics etc.  of what you get back are dick pics and people looking to hook up.  It doesnt matter where you post because Ive done them all OKcupid craigslist Match etc.  Ive gotten people on ALL of them that are just looking for sex. They see that you dress up and it becomes fetish territory and they disregard everything that you write. Ive never had a single date from one of those sites with someone who was accepting.  Hell most gay men immediately get turned off total top or not and say If I wanted to be with a woman I would be.  So people like me are stuck in this awful middle ground.

8551662,0,t3_4ww6g5,Sort of depends on what youre going for I guess. Generally speaking a feminine hairstyle tends to feminise you quite a bit its also not too hard to control that. Mostly people grow their hair out for a feminine cut but there are also short hairstyles that look pretty good on some people. Clothing is another thing that effects how femininemasculine you look. Its quite hard to teach style to someone though what I think looks good will probably be different to what another person thinks looks good. A lot of womens fashion has also shifted to be far more androgynousmasculine as of late. Generally speaking you want to look at what other people are wearing follow people who you think dress well on instagramtumblrwhatever and then take inspiration from that. For feminising your face it starts to get tricky you cant change the shape of your face so youre stuck with what youve got. if youve not got a basic skincare routine you can improve your skin with that rSkincareAddiction is good for some advice on that then theres makeup which can definitely make you look more feminine if you know how to use it rMakeupAddiction has some good inspiration for that. Body is another story because thats very difficult to control. uilbcaicnl mentioned hormones but theyre not really a good option unless you have some kind of gender dysphoria. The side effects are very serious and mostly permanent. Theres not a huge amount you can do about body shape apart from losing or gaining weight and muscle. Most of your body shape is down to genetics. Hope that helps!,feminineboys,d6aj47b,3,t5_2vmuo

I dont mind dating non binary people at all and definitely wouldnt think twice about dating that person as long as they were cool and fit my type. Thanks again. ,feminineboys,dasyzng,2,t5_2vmuo

10066890,0,t1_dbhz0i2,i think i need to apologize. i dont think i did a very good job of explaining my situation. I tend to be a little reclusive and shy in everyday life so that helps. I was being a little dramatic when I said I gave in entirely to apathy. Closer to reality would be to say that I started to try really hard on ignoring the world and people around so that could focus on those little things that actually make me happy. Im scared of where things will end up but after my breakdown at work i decided the harm i had done myself when i was a little younger is worse than what could be done to me. I meant this both physically and mentally speaking. Self harm wasnt the only damage i did to myself i let my mind sit in a dark place for a very long time and im still not entirely sure whats going on in there. I have to say though that i know what you mean with the leggings. the little things i do for myself are things like buy cute socks. i have a few hoodies in womens sizes that just feel so much more comfortable. when i shower i try to take care of my skin and hair even if the results will never be what i want them to be. My favorite thing ever though is that now that it is winter i can keep my legs shaved and not have to answer questions. though having to answer questions is still the biggest factor in anything i decide to do. mostly video games and any other sort of media is what i use as a distraction. what do you use to help you cope? question directed at any one at all that might want to answer,feminineboys,dbjqlx4,2,t5_2vmuo
10203662,0,t1_dc0mug9,Eyelashes are tough for me because mine arent very prominent. I use fake eyelashes. Most guys wouldnt really notice but girls will . They can be a little tricky at first but not impossible.,feminineboys,dc0n4ng,2,t5_2vmuo
10352572,0,t1_dchhofo,If you have access to an informed consent clinic getting prescribed hormones can be fairly easy. But like you Im also bi and generally subtle about by gender expression. Hormones seems like they would cost so much financially and socially just to look and feel a little bit more feminine.  ,feminineboys,dchiw6w,1,t5_2vmuo
11148256,0,t1_desup77,Uhmm I guess it just sort of happened xPI think the main thing when you have long hair is to eat a lot of healthy food lots of protein and wash it every other day instead of every day. ,feminineboys,devn5jw,2,t5_2vmuo
11339585,0,t1_dfgp1oz,Im not an authority on the rules here so dont listen to me xPBut yep! Im sure its also fine to repost it on the next Saturday if it doesnt get much attention due to being in last weeks thread. The more photos in selfie Saturday the better I reckon. ,feminineboys,dfhblyy,4,t5_2vmuo
