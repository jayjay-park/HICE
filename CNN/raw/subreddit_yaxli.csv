10179374,0,t1_dbxnx8b,I was thinking if they dont reveal our tribe we should lie about it and try to claim another group is lying.We should also just give completely random information and once people figure out whats going on we should follow every comment with TeamChaos,yaxli,dbxvzic,11,t5_3hfkm

10184154,0,t1_dbybyn7,Oooh. So if I am alive by time the merge happens. I got an idea. Ill claim I got a pm in error from the mods revealing another players role as werewolf and the other werewolves in their group. Ill post a few random comments early on with possible clues and then narrow it down later in the day and link whichever clue fits my plot. Maybe post gifs of the yule ball and claim the person Im replying to is a Parvarti. I forget the titles of the other villains. Werewolves of chaos should vote for me that phase so it looks like my Intel might be correct. And then we can use that to work on getting the other tribes voting for those players. But maybe secretly we vote for someone else on a preset arbitrary plot so its like the ww are trying to prevent the ones I declared ww from being killed. If our werewolves wanna describe the pm they got so mine can seem more realistic thatd be good. Ill try and get as much info as I can in the ghost sub about the other tribes. And talk about the awesome role plays of various Chaos people. Unless someone else wants to volunteer for this role? ,yaxli,dbyfhwe,12,t5_3hfkm

10229149,0,t3_5mbaf7,K and DMT have been oddly quiet. Is this the hurricane coming to Green Island? The post said we would need to navigate a hostile environment.,yaxli,dc3j4ud,4,t5_3hfkm
10245558,0,t1_dc5du1g,Okay. Let me see how everyone else feels about this. If you read my comment I did mention that I would only wait till  PM if you guys are in the favor of the alliance. I see that you and k are not. Lets see how others feel about this. ,yaxli,dc5e2v9,3,t5_3hfkm
10246225,0,t3_5mosgs,Okay guys. It seems like the idea of alliance isnt flying. I was just trying see if i could survive a little longer. And you would have benefit from that for sure. But if you dont trust that Im Denise then you wouldnt trust anything I say either. In that case keeping me around wouldnt help you! Now that being said I will come clean. If you read the post of my alliance I didnt specifically mention that the person I spied on was a WW. The person I spied on last night was K. I didnt trust her for the precise reasons mentioned by utheduqoffrat . She was confident about her no werewolf left theory she asked for protection from doctor when clearly the two prime targets would be the doctor and denise. And after larixon mentioned that K emphasised in block letters that I was the biggest threat for the wolves in one of her comments. I was also very sure that our whole inital alliance with werewolves was solid until the merge which was initiated by her. When i saw that the alliance was good and wolves were on it is when I revealed myself. Not before that. But yesterday it all became just a trick to get wolves to reveal their roles. While the trick actually got DMT to reveal it also cost us our doctor today. Had it not been for the alliance doctor wouldnt have revealed himself either. So i spied on her. I found that K is a david.On the previous day I checked on Ems because my priority was to find the wolves first and cochran second and if duq volunteered himself to be spied on then he isnt a wolf for sure. So I went over the comment where larixon asked the last few people to not to reveal their roles. That list included ems hacker and FTS. So I picked Ems first. Was going to pick Hacker next but then I found K quite suspicious. So I checked on her instead.Now I dont know if we have another wolf left or not but I was trying get them to reveal themselves by forming an alliance. I have a feeling that we might still have a wolf left. But Im not sure. And if we do  then I would be the prime target. Hence I thought of the alliance. But clearly my attempt to force the wolf to reveal has backfired badly. I dont have any other proof of me being a Denise that I can share here without breaking rules. So if you still dont trust me and want to lynch me then go ahead. However if you do trust me and we dont have any wolves left then I shall continue to spy on people. P.S.gt The fifth island is licking their wounds after a devastating hurricane. Have they lost their focus for good?That is what I meant when I said our tribe is doing the worst. It was quite clear to me that hurricane came to the green island. ,yaxli,dc5gsry,4,t5_3hfkm
