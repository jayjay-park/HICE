1861341,0,t3_2fwia4,During grad school a friend of mine was a patient of one of the faculty members. From what I was told by her and the professor was they came to an agreement that her mental health status will be kept in confieldence as per HIPPA and their patienttherpist relationship would only be disclosed to the dean in order to prevent her from being able to have her therapist as a teacher. The professor disclosed to our class in an ethics discussion about their arrangement with the school but provided no identifying details as an example of how to handle ethical dilemmas. I only knew because the girl decided to share that information with me when she couldnt enroll in a class we wanted to take together.,clinicalpsych,ckdhiig,6,t5_2snee

7129648,0,t1_d1obmvc,I like your perspective! It is ironic that psychiatrists and psych. Nurse practitioners talk about providing this and that psychotherapy despite having minimal training. I actually argued with a psychiatrist and he said well anyone can be taught to do psychotherapy and you dont need to be licensed... But not anyone can just give meds like us. It requires skill.  I just walked away lol.Do you think that prescription privileges will eventually be passed and become a universal thing? The next issue I would think is the training needed for a psychologist to prescribe. Is it feasible for someone who just spent a ton of money and years earning a doctorate to pay to go get an additional masters to prescribe? Do you think they can somehow integrate the prescribing training into a specialized tract within a PsyD program such as medical clinical psychology,clinicalpsych,d1ok778,1,t5_2snee
9606374,0,t1_d9x4i6z,Paid  bucks for a middle of the road package with many practice tests and statistics workshop. Havent taken the EPPP yet but every other licensure requirement is done. The EPPP is very expensive so I figure to only take it once. Edit just found the invoice .. Test masters are very much worth it. ,clinicalpsych,d9x6kji,1,t5_2snee
