If I ever heard you ask me in real life to stargaze I would punch you so hard youd be in a comma for the next month.What gives you the right to think that you can tell us what to do? I will never be ordered around by a man. Actually I am so passionate about this I managed to get this fucking guy suspended from my work for making sexist comments about me and ordering me to get him a fucking coffee every minute. Now he has learnt his lesson and is making ME the coffee.I weep for a world without men a paradise.

My roommates are actually a couple of years older than me but they are still caught up in talking about boys and gossiping about their classmates. I am just not interested in it. Id prefer to be in a more vibrant city with more young professionals. Im used to knowing more people who have passions and enjoy talking about philosophy art and other cultures.

6847379,0,t1_d0s9f3g,There will be people everywhere who just enjoy getting drunk. If you cant find anyone in an entire city with passions that means you arent really trying at all. Its also harder to meet people after you graduate if you dont put in effort to seek them out.The reason its annoying is because of how prevalent that mindset is when we have the Manship Theater an LSU putting on artsy events and films fairly regularly. There are a few regular poetry and fiction readings in town. Shit go do karaoke. Theres a fairly good comedy open mic at The Station every Wednesday.In bars with no cover this is true but most people at Spanish Moon or Varsity are there for the music. More music venues wouldnt be bad but unless more people actually go to the ones we have there will be no market for one to open. Varsity usually only sells out for acts with dedicated followings and Spanish Moon rarely does. Atomic Pop shop shows are fairly hit or miss as well but until those shows start doing better there wont be any more music venues you say you want but arent making possible.,batonrouge,d0sggz3,0,t5_2s5z1

11091464,0,t1_dep49ir,We declined to say for the same reasons I suspect most businesses choose not to publish their salary or wage levels. Especially prerevenue. But since you asked and since were not most businesses!Our goal is for nobody to make less than k per year between salary and tips. Plus everyone will have healthcare paid time off and equity in some form. And all that while working at a brewpub...most people would agree there are worse places to make a living. Beer and pizza make for some pretty damn fun RampD opportunities as well.But we know this model is not for everyone. For example there are definitely bartenders that make more than we are going to be paying. But do they have healthcare paid time off? What happens if theyre sick for a week? Want to go on vacation? What are the career advancement opportunities long term potential? Or even the most basic  do they know their work schedules more than a few days or few hours in advance of their shifts?As Riley was saying  no were not promising anyone a new Porsche and box seats for the Tigers and Saints in yearone. What were trying to offer is an opportunity to build a career in the service industry. And not just at the GM level  top to bottom bartenders cooks brewers everyone. To be treated as a professional as professionals in virtually every other industry are. At the same time were going to expect a lot from these folks. Theyll be expected to perform at a high caliber. Were doing our best to assemble the Ateam. And our goal is to be completely transparent with our employees and any potential future employees so that they can decide for themselves whether or not this model is for them. Were about finding the folks that the model does work for folks whose eyes light up when they hear what were trying to do. And fortunately that has not been an uncommon thing. Weve currently got a team of five in addition to our two founders that have put in literally thousands of hours of work collectively over the last  months toward getting Noble Wave where we are today. For essentially no compensation beyond a meal and beers at the Chimes a few times a month. And a spot on the rocket wherever its headed Dont get us wrong. This thing is kind of a crazy experiment right? I mean yeah there are a few other restaurants nationally that have eliminated tipping that are paying living wages. Theres even a restaurant group in Pittsburgh that eliminated tips and pays all their staff salaries k I believe  no upside with tips though.But were not aware of anybody that is doing this with a brewpub that is paying their entire staff salary while keeping tips but then taking a portion of those tips that are received and reinvesting them back into the community. Were unaware of anything like this having ever been tried before. Its an experiment. A crazy one? Maybe. If we can pull it off though we think the implications are pretty staggering. Big picture were tired of watching companies pour tons of money into lobbyists and BS marketing and gimmicky product improvements and all other such nonsense. So were making a bet. That if instead we invest in our employees and our community that well have a better product and customers will recognize and reward that with their patronage. And in return well be a vessel for our customers to be a part of making Baton Rouge a cooler place...simply by eating some delicious fromscratch pizza and some dank craft beer!Whats the catch? There isnt one. Crazy beer laws might be the bane of everyone elses existence but theyre what are gonna allow us to thrive. The three tier system for beer sales? That means three separate entities have to make enough money off of that beer in order to run a profitable business themselves the brewer the wholesaler and the retailer. With a brewpub like us there is no three tier system  its just us. We are the brewer and the retailer and we dont have to go through a distributor. We keep  of the profits  two other entities arent making a living themselves by taking a huge cut of it. Now sure we could just pocket that additional profit margin ourselves. But like we said. Were making a bet. Were tired of the cynical zerosum approach to commerce most businesses today take. We believe theres a better way. Wed rather be reinvesting into the things that we believe will ultimately make us successful  our staff our customers our partners our community. If we can pull it off we think theres a lot of potential. ,batonrouge,dep7hku,5,t5_2s5z1
