4168746,0,t3_38h1a6,Traditionally Jags wereare leather. Smooth unblemished perfectly color matched leather. You could add a fabric for the seat centers with leather edging. The fabric has to be really tough to withstand wear but it can be matched or contrasting to whatever leather you choose. First you need to decide on colors. Colors are up to personal preference and white goes with just about anything. Though red is very common to the point of standard .Tans work too. Green leather was done and it was a hideous invention of the s but its still sold. Narrow down your color choices and then you can start looking for hides.  Feel free to ignore this next bit as the ramblings of a deranged mind.They tan and sell wire scarred hides. I always wondered what an interior would look like with scars. Not on every piece mind you but a few discreetly placed scared leather panels with the darkened colors and interest that the scars would bring. As a bonus leather with scars is really cheap in comparison to perfect. Tanbrown are the most tanned colors and scared pieces of these colors are the cheapest leather you can get. Im not an upholsterer but I have done my share of furniture pieces and Im waiting for the cat to die before I do another. ,upholstery,crvg1io,1,t5_2rva0

11517437,0,t3_64aljd,So I did some looking at the Herman Miller site and as a professional upholster I believe it should be possible to do this kind of job although it is not the kind of job we would typically do. Im not sure if the fabric on your chair is a mesh fabric or not but quite often these styles of chairs have specific tension pulls that are preset at the factory where they are made. As for authorised repair more than likely you will not find that as it is cheaper and easier for the company to just send you a new one if something breaks or goes wrong while the product is under warranty and they can reuse the parts. I would check around your local upholstery shops and see if it is a job they would want to take as I mentioned it is an unusual job and also determine if the price and time it will take without the chair is worth not just investing in a new chair.Hope that helps.,upholstery,dg1i4ad,3,t5_2rva0
