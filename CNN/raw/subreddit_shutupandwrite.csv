I think you were talking about a ringtone or maybe the person talking was imitating this Zakk Wylde but it really confused me when the protagonist then called the person Laura because Laura was also yelling so I thought the protagonist was actually talking to someone named Zakk at first.  That kind of thing.I do love ESL speakers because some of the best phrases and quotes come from people who havent been exposed to overused cliches or can use cliches from their other languages and in English they sound so cool and original. ,shutupandwrite,cfczsbs,1,t5_2u32d

489972,0,t3_1zpgdj,Hi OmegaMooseI think that what you have here is an outline for a pretty good story rather than a story itself. The reason I say this is that what youve written so far doesnt give force the reader to get invested in the character at all... I cant even remember her name right now! A lot more time is spent dumping information about NR on the reader than is spent developing your characters.The pushing of the button which should have been a really climactic moment in the whole story happens so matteroffactly. The main character just thinks to herself Well everyone else who was in my position did it so why not me? That isnt very interesting to me.Finally you do a lot of telling about how she has great somatosensory evaluations and then how she misses her sharp senses. Unfortunately I dont get any sense of how good her senses were before and I dont feel any of her loss. More showing is in order. There are many ways you could handle this  maybe for the loss you can have her notice a plate of hospital food or a bowl of fruits for example.Dont let yourself feel too selfconscious about your work. You write coherently and I think that manipulating tension plot etc. will come with practice I hope! Im a beginner too.. By all means attend the writing group it should be a great experience. Good luck with your writing!,shutupandwrite,cfvyoru,2,t5_2u32d

510306,0,t3_1zyhr8,I really really liked it even though I was a little lost at a few points since Ive never really followed anything in the Warhammer universe. Youve got a lot of solid descriptions thrown around and the action is conveyed in an easy to follow sort of way. Grammar word variation and sentence structure all seem to be in a very good place. Your writing style seems to be pretty solid. You did a very good job with pacing the story and it was pretty easy to read through it all. The ending was tragic and you did a great job of making it heartwrenching from Vespers powerless position. Ill just point out a few things that I think you can do to fine tune the storygt An explosion of splintering wood followed as a giant blackbladed axe penetrated the gates old oak planksboards?Why do you have boards? here? Is that a revision note?gt The gate buckled curving inwards as the sound of plate crashing against it tore through the early evenings sudden silence.I think you could make this sentence much more concise and easier to read if you cut out early evenings sudden. A few sentences earlier you already defined that it was dusk and that there was silence so it just feels really redundant here.Ill copy and paste my usual spiel about adverbs here. This is kind of something that almost all beginning writers tend to do. Its not necessarily wrong in my book its just sort of a rule for modern writing for better or worse. A general note about ly adverbs since you do seem to have a lot of them used throughout the text although a lot of classic writers were praised for their heavy use of adverbs the modern writing community seems to universally condemn their overuse. This is something I found out pretty recently from some critiques on this subreddit but Ive done a good bit of research on it and have found the same general advice from just about everywhere ly adverbs dont need to be completely eliminated from fiction writing but they need to be used very sparingly. The problem with them is that they allow you to strengthen a weak verb instead of using a strong verb or they can also be redundant. They are perfectly fine to use as much as you want within dialogue since people normally use them in everyday speech but not within the rest of the writing. Ive been told that the first thing some writing judges will do is to do a search on the entire contest submission for ly just to see if it is overpopulated with adverbs. If it is you get docked major points right there. Its not something that is very difficult to fix but well worth your time.So for instance in this paragraphgt She awoke wetly gasping for air. One gasp followed by another and another. Her senses assaulted her with darkness a pregnant silence enveloping her. She sat completely still the rough bark of the oak behind her comforting her with its mere presence. Slowly her breathing leveled out. Had Amelia been here she would have calmed her.Youve got wetly completely and slowly. Try to find a way to either replace these adverbs with something else or remove them entirely. You can use an adverb every once in awhile but you should be pretty stingy with them outside of dialogue. More than anything else try to make sure that youve never got the ly adverbs attached to a speech tag. I.e.gt No she whispered quietly to herselfWhispered implies saying something quietly so the adverb quietly is redundant. This sort of stuff can drive some readers crazy.gt Her fragile mind constantly threatened her with wandering back to the events of a few hours agoHow does she know it was just a few hours ago? From the sounds of it she blacked out and is just then coming to. In order to keep things entirely from Vespers perspective I think you should just change your wording here to something more generic.gt Raucous laughter began to become audible below the chanting with the sound of skin against skin coming soon after.Not quite sure I follow what is happening here... are they clapping their hands or is this referencing rape of some kind?Hope the feedback helps.

Considering you wrote it a year ago maybe coming back to it now will give you fresh eyes? One example would be Its vocabulary was as bad as like whatever. where you use the wrong for of its. This phrase is also something of a cliche to begin with and avoiding it might make your overall piece stronger. I think that the story seems interesting but I cant completely get my head around it. I understand that youre capturing the viewpoint of a cat and the narration will be sort of disjointed as its following what the cat thinks but this piece could really use some more concrete details.

What Id like to say is that I like the cerebral writing style. Nothing in the story was confusing and though I did pull back an ponder the implications of a few things I like it when authors make me do that. Is it going to sell to the general public? I doubt it. Youd write like Stephanie Meyer if you wanted a bestseller.My advice Keep at this writing style until you perfect it. Make it your own.

843673,0,t3_23laec,Lets get to it shall we?Firstly your language needs a lot of polish. Theres nothing technically wrong with it just sometimes the word choice and sentence structure feel awkward on the tongue. Im not going to go over it in detail as that doesnt seem like the critique you are after but Id be remiss if I didnt mention it. If you want to talk about it hit me up on Teamspeak or chat.Now to your questions!gt Do you like the main characters? Hate them? Indifferent?He feels a tad generic a stock hero like Robin Hood. I realize theres not a lot of space to really do deep characterization but so far Im really reserving judgement on him till I get more info. Maybe do an infodump in Chapter ? I just want to know MORE. gt Does the tiny bit of lore I tossed in interest you?I do admire a world built on observation vs. exposition so hats off. The lore itself is a bit familiar but hey its high fantasy so theres gonna be some overlap. gt What are your thoughts on the Grendian? Could his description be improved?Maybe. I do kind of want to know more. When I describe a character I usually like to note three distinct attributes. The man was short pasty and wore glasses seems like the perfect amount of descriptors. gt And finally what are your thought on the names of the characters?The names are cool but I think sometimes you need to remind people that Baskar is the Grendian as I got confused a few times. Maybe call him Baskar the Grendian at random points or say something like Baskar raised his enormous Grendian fists. etc.Hope this was helpful!,shutupandwrite,ch06gc6,1,t5_2u32d

994302,0,t3_2586lz,DISCLAIMER for when you get there Afterwards I realised you had actually mentioned what the man was wearing.As for enjoying reading it Ive only just started and Im already intrigued about what this is actually going to be about.I think it should be younger than his voice suggests because I know with the past tense of suggested youre referencing that he just spoke already but it still feels like mixing tenses. Ill look through the comments to see if anyone else pointed that out though because I dont know  if Im right on that one.It also slowed me down for a second when he says shes tricky because she has been used to describe the protagonist twice already particularly in reference to us not being told her name yet so I think its tricky would solve that potential small issue and sound more realistic as well. I dont know who this guy is or what hes like yet but she would usually be used for boats or cars and a vending machine would be fine too but I feel like most people would need a lot of emotional investment in an object or have to spend a lot of time around something to personify it in most cases so if hes referring to the machine as she I have to hope that this vending machine is a very notable part of his life. Christ Im rambling now sorry.gt The night classes have finished and she worries about her unattended bag in the room down the hall. I wanted to suggest changing it to ...her bag unattended in the room down the hall. to make it a little less awkward but Id suggest maybe mentioning when the night classes finished to give it both a sense of time and because dont know how to word this really this feels like the narration mentions a past event like its still happening... like its a continuation of something finite. They finished but right now they still have finished. Dunno how to explain myself here sorry.gt I have I think awk said it on a podcast a while ago and I enjoyed hearing it because Ive always thought the same thing maybe its just me but it always seems like a bad idea to me personally to cut characters off mid sentence. That hyphen seems just as clumsy as an ellipsis would be and she didnt necessarily have to get cut off. Dunno.Sidenote The smoking dude for some reason I imagined him like some typical cool guy James Dean type or something now I think he might be a janitor or something and Im picturing an oldish man. Could maybe benefit from some establishment of the characters appearances or something. If he is a janitor or something though then theres no need to worry about all that shit I said about him referencing the vending as she could that would make sense if he was the janitor.gtsurprised by his straight white teethAny way you can elaborate on how shes surprised rather than just saying that she is?gt looks around nervously. Same question again.gt His lashes become more intense.Like lashes of a hammer? Not sure lashes is the right word. Could be though.gt and says Alright.should be and says alright.gt then he walks to the stairwellLose the thengt and while continuing to watch himwhile continuing is redundant and messes up the timing same as then then from before. I would suggest taking a long gulp as she watches him but Im not sure if the syntax of that suggestion is actually perfect for prose because taking is nonfinite and watches is finite I think. Ill get back to that one....gt his face doesnt emulate her laugh.Not sure what this means. Im guessing its to do with him not sharing in the laughter but it doesnt quite sound like it makes sense.gt WellPointless.gt but again he doesnt respond in the way she expects.Fair enough I guess but Im only guessing she would expect him to laugh with her although maybe after the its Coke remark she might not necessarily expect him to laugh? To me her response dialogue and with whats happened so far Id expect her to start feeling a little awkward more than anything rather than expecting him to laugh with her but moreso you havent actually told us how he reacts instead youve only told us that his reaction isnt what she was expecting.gthe says face serious.Serious how? What is the expression? What does he look like?gtDont do what.Needs a ?gt Dont selfdeprecate. You insult us when you do that.gt gt Us?gt gt Biochem. Thats smart.gt gt She nods tracing a line through the condensation on the side of her silver can.This is brilliant apart from selfdeprecate seems too smart for what hes getting at even if hes not supposed to be very simple but it just sounds a little OTT for this kind of dialogue put yourself down or something similar would work a lot better I think plus that damn hyphen again... Also think condensation sounds a little clinical or something personally would have preferred droplets or cold droplets or something.gtHe brings his fist down onto it and when he pulls back the can is crumpled flat. More important than seeing it after is that we would hear it crush as he does it.gtThe fluorescent light flickers off and for a moment hes gone and she breathes then the light comes back.I feel like this sentence messed up your paragraph and its a wonky this happens then that then the opposite version of the first thing I just said. Thought about maybe putting it in a new paragraph and splitting it up into three different short sentences?gtNo. I really shouldgrrr PgtPardon?For me in the UK this probably isnt even common parlance anymore though it might be. Is it used elsewhere? Either way I feel Im sorry? might suit better plus Im guessing Im sorry? might be more universal too in a way.gtIts not until the step is littered with ashlittered here makes it sound like its covered but its only one cigarettes worth of ash not a lot. Dont forget too that it doesnt get to a point where suddenly its littered. Its one drags worth of ash at a time so the until doesnt really work if you see what I mean.gtcrumpled can in itinside would work a lot better and sound a lot cleaner in my opinion.gtwalks away from herRedundant.Theres an awful lot of she in that one paragraph and you sure you need a new line for each sentence afterwards?And the line about hearing him playing with something maybe the remote. Those buttons are quiet. What sound would that be? I dont think there is one.Lose the italics thats cheating though I dont know why youve chosen that particular sentence for them anyway to be totally honest.gta small gulley sandwiched between the university road and the road with the bus stop herThis sentence I feel like youre picturing it in a particular way and want to get that same description across but I think you could simplify it so it reads easier. I cant think what a gulley is and if I did I feel like there could still just be a small hill down to the bus stop or something without worrying about slanted ground and such. I dont think there should be a comma after road either.Whats bitumen?Just got to the end and I got to say fair enough but I dont quite see his intention. Was he angry because she was modest about being smart even though hes a janitor?Anyway I think theres some kinks to iron out but I like the objectivity of the writing and whatnot. I think you said you intended it to be kind of minimal so thats cool but in my opinion certain areas did need some more description and maybe it could do with some extra flavour maybe slow down at the end a little to give a clear idea of whats happening and why. I think it needs some work but its a cool idea and I definitely enjoyed the build up and the conversation with the janitor.Hope that helps in some way or something.  ,shutupandwrite,chhb57n,1,t5_2u32d

I know the shadows are growing longer but let me know anything else that isnt relative. Give me something foundational. The sun was  feet off the horizon would be better then It was later which doesnt make a whole lot of sense in the first place.General ThoughtsAt first I thought that the narrator was far too cruel but after reading to the end its pretty clear why. You have a lot of really long sentences that seem to go on but that seems to be your style. However I am really not sure how well this style will transition into a novel as in longer works you will need to transfer a large amount of information over the course of the book so you really dont want to overwhelm them with overly verbose sentences. This style works well in this case as it gives us a more clear view of the surroundings and adds a grittiness to an otherwise childish scene excepting the end of course but keep sentence length in mind if you want to write a full blown novel. ,shutupandwrite,ci4dy1h,2,t5_2u32d

I will give my final thoughts at the end. here we gogt Thomas and his friend Chris sat idly mulling about the train waiting for Oxford Circus.I personally do not like weak opening lines. Waking open open eyes doing daily chores idly mulling none of these grab me and want to make me read more. The other thing I am not sure about is putting character names in bold. I have not seen this done before and I am not sure how I feel about it just yet. gt Almost all of them were like our two protagonists bored out of their wits with little to entertain them.While again personal taste I do not like this kind of metawriting where we acknowledge that I am the reader and someone else the the writer to this story. This also kind of comes out of no where and then goes away. Im not sure why it is even there really.gt ... if our reader pities that poor sod who dreams and is so far from attaining them and moreover if he pities his boredom his heart would rend in two if he saw the abject suffering of these commuters. Never tell a reader how they should feel about a character. Do not do this.gt This was the new chichipster style of wearing them not over ones eyes but over ones hair. He had dark skin but not black like the colours of the people in west AfricaAt this point in the story I am very confused about what time period we are in. People are riding trains back and forth to work could be trains or subways some lines like Mississippi hobo good sir dapper suits  and comparing skin color to west Africans makes it feel more early s but language like beta and hipster makes it feel modern. gt ...never at any other stations in London.That explains the language. Nothing else had jumped out at me as British up until this point.gt In the beginning my parents died in a freak gasoline fight accident when I was an infantMore personal taste I hate pop culture references in narrative.They suck the seriousness out of the tone. gt But even though we were in love Ava was unsure of whether we should marry or not. She didnt know whether to say yes or no. And now my friends we come to the critical question would you have a guess how she went about determining the answer?I really liked the way you tied all this back I was worried the story got lost there but this is good. gt Well how shall I explain it? Let me tell you a story I was once out bushwalking in the outback.So... at this point in the story the Indian man is telling a story and in his story someone is telling him a story? I feel completely disconnected from the piece. gt Her joy on seeing him enter brightened her countenance and she leapt into his arms and the two lovers passionately embraced her legs straddling his muscular frame.I love everything about these  paragraphs. Heart wrenchingly painful. gt How can you even come here and not even feel a tinge of emotion for her?You got me here. I did not see it coming until it was just about to happen. Very good writing.It took until page  before you really had me sold on the piece. I frankly had to really slog though a lot and only though sheer force of will did I make it. Having said that I am sure glad I did because the ending was very well executed. You tell a very good tale and the reveals land like a punch to the heart. At the end of the piece you have a few notes and I want to address them specifically.Foreshadowing. You do a very good job of this. I spent the large majority of the piece thinking you were rambling and to see everything tied back together was a joy.Framing. I understand what you are going for but I would do it different. Think of Disneys Aladdin. The whole movie is a story but we know nothing about who the story is being told to. I would strongly encourage you to removing everything outside of the primary narrative. The two guys on the train serve nothing to the tale. Story within a Story. I did not care for it I think more so because it seemed forced and irreverent. I am not saying it cannot work but I did not care for it in this piece.The concept of a sudden revelation. This by far is your strongest suit. You did it very well and to great affect. I loved the reveals.Overall the biggest thing you need to work on is cutting the story down to what needs to be said and getting rid of the rest. I personally would cut that story down to  pages. There is so much that is not needed to get the message across and some many other small stories within the story that serve nothing but to increase word count. I would look at what needs to be set up to land the big reveals I think there are  which is amazing and cut everything else.,shutupandwrite,ckedx1f,1,t5_2u32d

2696537,0,t3_2qw6ui,Alright. So first! I think this piece is a huge info dump. I like the world. It sounds very interesting but I was very confused many times. Not that it all didnt make sense. It was just very difficult to remember all of that. I personally wouldnt start a book like that unless that whole piece is something that you absolutely want to be read before continuing. I do notice there is a lot of information that would nice to digest as I read the story. There is lack of action here. Very little show and a lot of tell if you know what I mean. But I do believe you have built a cool setting here and theres a ton of ammunition for you to continue. I would draw out the information you have here within the story itself! Have fun. Hope this helped. ,shutupandwrite,cnak1dh,1,t5_2u32d

Being able to be involved in more than just one way and being able to speed up the critique process through the wiki will I think make this sub a lot more engaging and more community events will doubtlessly make it more accessible.Just a quick opinion question what do you think about the SUampWs size? Do you think were too small and not reaching enough people or do you think that if we grow much larger well see a decrease in submission and critique quality?Anyway thanks for running a great sub. Ive done a few critiques here so if youd like me to help out with writing some stuff for the wiki or anything else like that Id be more than happy to. Just ask!,shutupandwrite,cpmklu2,1,t5_2u32d
3459272,0,t1_cpmklu2,I like the size as it is but then Ive always liked this being a smaller sub. If we end up growing Id definitely want to make sure we had more automation and a welltested reputation system in order to handle it.In my opinion the main reason this sub works at all and most critique subs dont is because of the rep system keeping things balanced. If we could manage a bigger but still balanced rep system it should prevent the sub from going off the rails even if we got a lot of subscribers down the line.As for reaching more people  thats what I want a blog and podcast for. We used to have a very messy podcast and the featured content system was kind of an attempt at a communityrun bloglike thing. Im planning to have a much better organized version of both.,shutupandwrite,cpmkzck,2,t5_2u32d
3686886,0,t3_32loao,Overall this scene held my attention well and I enjoyed the action. The two issues that stood out to me were punctuation dialogue tagsSo looking at punctuation first. Particularly in the dialogue itself there are commas missing. This article and this article explain the issue well. Basically when youre addressing someone or a group of someones a comma should be used to signal that youre doing so. Taking an example from your scenegt Were almost there gentlemen! Agnar screamed to the fleet of longships.Agnar is saying Were almost there to the gentlemen he is with so it should begt Were almost there gentlemen! Agnar screamed to the fleet of longships.Now onto the next issue dialogue tags. A lot of people are of the belief that said is almost invisible when reading so it should be used rather than trying to switch things up every sentence. You might agree with that or you might not. I noticed in your scene that Bard chuckles a lot and it stood out in a bad way. Id recommend having him chuckle or chuckle nervously perhaps the first time and delete the other times. Another issue with dialogue tags is using descriptive words instead of said. Again people have different opinions on this. I generally go by the rule that if you cant speak like that yourself then dont have your character do so. For example can you smile something?gt I dont need luck kid he smiled while holding up his axe.Not really. The words dont come out of your mouth because youre smiling smiling is just something that you do. So it could be changed to something likegt I dont need luck kid he said smiling while holding up his axe.gt I dont need luck kid. He smiled while holding up his axe.There are plenty more possibilities. My point is the dialogue tag should make sense. Can Agnar scream a sentence? Sure. Could you laugh or chuckle a sentence? Eh...I tend to say no to that one. Read up on some grammar pick up a novel and see what the author does play around with it and then decide yourself.There are a few more instances where youre inconsistent with punctuation but I think its fixable if you reread and do a proper edit so I wont try and edit the whole scene myself.Now in terms of the writingscene itself Dan stood out to me as a name because it didnt seem to fit with the others. I thought it was a bit unlikely that a group of experienced I assume guards would approach a green boy and not only would he easily stab one without the guard getting in a hit of his own but the rest of them ran away. Superstition could have something to do with it sure but it still pulled me out of the story.I hope some of this was helpful!,shutupandwrite,cqcj2ru,5,t5_2u32d

The line before She thought I was joking. I ran out of pans to catch all of the leaks in the roof. says it all the weirdness the confusion.It leaves you with so many questions. Is he mad? Who are they that allegedly sent a boat?  Is the motherinlaw madlying?gt mucky brown waterI would change to murky brown waterTheres a certain pedestrian factual tone to the writing that sounds quite authentic to me. Its like hes trying to record all the facts to figure out if hes going mad. Or to leave some record behind if hes about to diedrowndisappear too.  I see that others have complained about remember it was Tuesday but by the end of that it makes sense its like hes clinging to any truths any facts he can.The one thing I might adjust is the alteration between x days ago and x days later. It might be better to stick to one. Or change to two days later fifteen days ago or whatever. Likewise the seventh day of the storm needs reworking perhaps.

4839152,0,t3_3h4l1n,Multiple issues. Taking it outside in I dont find the events credible. Why would a ruling monarch permit a hostile force to enter his throne room  bringing their own torture chair forsooth!  without any kind of fight? You dont show any reason the king would be suicidal or have no dignity no honor no pride whatever. Or common sense. I could accept some kind of parlay but a defending ruler would never agree to one without guarantees hostages formalities of some kind. So that whole thing the king meekly submitting to torture abuse and murder just makes no sense.Moving in diction. These people dont have consistent voices and especially not the consistent diction of dignitaries. I found the kings Its okay especially jarring. Read some Cabell some Eddison even Tolkein who is especially good at matching the diction style and vocabulary of speech to each characters social position and history.At the micro level there are dozens of syntax and spelling hacks. Good syntax and spelling are not just academic goals the lack of them is like interference with the signal passing between you and the reader. Static on the line interfering with transfer of the narrative. Here are the first ten. of his pasteypermanent mark of grief you probably want mask although mask of grief is triteolden paintings oldheavy guardsman armor guardsmansYes i heard comma capital Imade quit the  quiteDont they know DontYou dont havethis! Cried Daniel lowercase c not a new sentencelooked at his guard straight in the eyes at superfluousOK thats enough. The global situation with the freed slaves ungratefully fighting their old masters has possibilities. You need to establish more reasons for both sides valuing the McGuffin the relic. And it is just narrative death to open a story with a wimp like Ozulmus  who besides being a doormat how did he ever get to be king? is going to be dead for the rest of the book so for that reason alone should not be presented as the protagonist at the outset.,shutupandwrite,cu4ihkk,2,t5_2u32d
4850541,0,t1_cu26isj,Simply I dont like some of your uses of hyperbole as a literary device. Writers will say things like it was the harshest winter ever to add weight when really for me the reader all I really get from that sentence is that its cold. But at least I have been notified it is in fact cold. The problem with the he will never forget it device here is that while it strives to make that beat more dramatic it is also completely non descriptive abstract. The hero never forgetting a sound does little to explain the moment to me. This is just that example explained.On the story level the hyperbole makes sense but needs context. The tone is ambiguous but thats not a problem in this short intro. What I wish is that it hinted at the tone of whats to come which would in turn clarify the broader purpose. If i had to take a stab in the dark I think what this is building to is a look at how myths themselves grow through word of mouth and media etc.  ,shutupandwrite,cu5y36m,1,t5_2u32d

Critique is as suchgtApartment number four Im grateful when I finally find it a narrow mintgreen building nestled between countless others. I cast a quick glance behind me before I make my way insideThis part gets a bit confusing. Think about the order in which this plays out... the main character sees the apartment number... and then the building... and then steps inside. Its a bit backwards innit?gtI used to bite my lip until it bled watching them whimpering as the tears trickled down their cheeks and stung their chapped lips.Two things do your lips get chapped when you cry frantically? Usually I notice people sending spittle foaming or drooling. Their lips would be soaked wet if anything. It should also be split into two sentences. gt I used to bite my lip until it bled having to watch them. They would whimper as...Etc. gtMany people wonder what death really feels like I dont feel like muchIm assuming this is a Death pun... but it reads weird if you dont capitalize Death.

5370809,0,t3_3ofd17,A lot works.  Only a few things dont.     He is only three pages in the chapter of the book he has had enough of it already.  Also these are two independent clauses.  Separate with semicolon make the two independent sentences or join them.     He looks out of the window. Leaves are falling fall down the trees and the autumn sun lights them making the scene them look like embers whirling through the air. Its just something that has to be done because we have to not because we actually like it. This is awkward.  I would rewrite and reduce length.  Something like We do it because we have to not because we actually like it.  You might even consider getting rid of actually.Yep same here. And most of the times you dont actually gain benefit from it Garrett says. It is hard sometimes having no motivation but still having to do lots of studying.This is also a little awkward.  The first line of dialogue doesnt seem to jive with what was just said but its dialogue it doesnt always have to. Something like Yep I feel the same way.  Second part is too wordy.  Try to prune your sentences.  Something like its hard to keep on studying when you have no motivation. or even Its hard to study when you have no motivation.

5518628,0,t3_3qos94,Hey Mirwolfor!I would like to say that I enjoyed this truly short story. I was curious  about the title and you kept me until the end. I have a few comments about the piece and I took into consideration that English is not your first language but I quickly forgot about that as I read it. Aside from grammatical mistakes punctuation and tense which can all be fixed in a later edit you could have something here. You have a lot of long sentences which can feel runon and could lose a reader. Your second paragraph is almost made up of long sentences until the last few. To me it felt like it had a strange rhythm. I enjoyed the metaphor of the cage but I think you could be more subtle with it.In some parts you seem to contradict yourself. Sentences like ...Lived with my mother next door or coldest warm day of Spring feel like youre saying two different things. The repetition of the pronoun I in the last paragraph worked well.Also I was curious about this protagonist who says that he had only known two homes his and his mothers. He also says he doesnt know how to live. How could he buy a camera? Or know about the beach? The beach aspect could be fixed however with a photograph of it in the Mothers house? Something he saw and thought was beautiful. Now the ending. It came out of nowhere and that could be good or bad. For me it felt terrifying. As you were able to provide imagery and I could see the photos with the ghost mother lurking nearby. So I cant say much about it.Hope you keep improving on this piece and maybe see an updated version in the future! Keep writing!,shutupandwrite,cwh1zff,1,t5_2u32d
5564227,0,t3_3ravvh,Read through your story. It looks like a pretty great start. But Id suggest a couple things before you go on with this. Your pacing. Really its going way too fast that I cant even follow through nicely without trying to figure out whats happening. I could say this piece would easily make a  word part from the scene you described alone and not .And the prose. Id say the prose goes along with how your pacing is moving move too quick and it disturbs the prose and flow. I would call for a redo if you want this story to take shape. Give yourself time to take a nice good look and get back to it.edit Id gotten the word count mixed up,shutupandwrite,cwmsjwo,1,t5_2u32d
