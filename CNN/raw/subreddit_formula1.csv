3781,0,t1_ceercyw,They were also aided by being out of the title hunt in  whereas McLaren and Ferrari had to concentrate a large amount of their resources on a soon to be redundant car.  Whilst they were busy fighting that battle Newey was able to put Red Bulls considerable resources into the following years car.  They only really missed out on the  title because he missed the double diffuser he wasnt alone in that and the FIA gave out conflicting or ambiguous advice.  All the subsequent years cars have been evolutions on that design with ever refined aerodynamics but the same basic lineage.  McLaren and Ferrari have been playing catch up ever since with now smaller budgets and fewer resources at their disposal.This is the big reset that the sport needed.  Red Bull still have the most resources and largest budget of any team but the need to start afresh and theyre as likely to be caught out as they are likely to excel.  If you look closely at the start of each of the last few seasons in general RB and Newey have actually been slightly slow to react to changes but then come along with a better and more optimised solution even with the coanda exhausts.I also think Mercedes gave them a little bit of a scare going into the summer break last year and hope that they actually put a little too much resource into last years car which now wont carry over whereas Mercedes stuck to plan a and were shifting most of their resources to  before that point.,formula1,ceev9ez,3,t5_2qimj

38119,0,t3_1ujqyv,gtThis years major Formula  regulation change is perfectly timed for Williams according to deputy team principal Claire Williams.The team has new technical leadership from Pat Symonds which combined with a switch to Mercedes engines offers Williams the chance to make a big step forward.In  the team finished ninth in the constructors championship and scored only five points but while Williams still expects the established frontrunners to lead the way she believes the new rules allow struggling teams to improve dramatically.It is very timely as if you dont have that level of rule change it would be much harder to try and improve year on year Williams told AUTOSPORT.I dont think that the competitive form will change too significantly but what it does offer is an opportunity for teams who are a second or more off the pace to look at what they are doing and look at doing things in a different way.Thats what we are trying to do and all of the changes we have made this year have been about making the most of the resources we have to embrace the rule changes for next year.MASSA KEY TO IMPROVEMENTWilliams also believes that new signing Felipe Massa will be key to the team improving in .The Brazilian moves to Williams after eight seasons with Ferrari and is expected to be a driving force for the team.Williams F One of the things that we were so impressed by when we first started talking to Felipe is his enthusiasm to help build the team and drive performance said Williams.He was so enthused by that and that is what we wanted. Its about coming into the factory as much as he can talking to the engineers all the time.So yes obviously we expect him to do that at the racetrack but we also expect him to be back at the factory helping to develop.He is not one of those guys who just wants to turn up at the race track  he is an integral part now because of the experience he has. He should be able to help the process.He wants to muck in get his hands dirty and everyone knows we love those kinds of drivers at Williams.,formula1,ceirrh8,9,t5_2qimj

No Formula One driver has received worse injuries while racing in nearly  years those that did all died.  If he does ever wake and manage to walk and talk again he will not be the same person.  Nearly ever neurologist interviewed agrees on that.  Thats not speculation thats realism.Here are some more unfortunate truths.  With the large amount of anesthetics hes receiving his risk of organ failure is high.  With an open skull cap his risk of infection is significant.

169222,0,t1_cexp5lz,First of all its pull rod not push rod.Secondly you are drawing a conclusion and basing the cars poor performance on a single part.gt  its likely due to the timing of the change and the resultant issues that this resulted from issues getting pullrod suspension working for them at the front and so had a poor year.Likely this is your conclusion.  Jenson had balance issues the yera before and the year before that and every season he has done F. I urge you show a source as right now you are simply drawing a conclusion and calling it truth.gt I know all about the difference and resultant suspension dynamics but its more than likely a huge part in both teams issues and McLaren seem to have cut their foray short after a year and gone back to pushrod suspension at the front.I dont think you do again you say likely with nothing but a conclusion you have drawn. Lower noses and bulkhead mean there is less room to package dampers under the drivers arse.I urge you to read the threads at Ftechnical about last years car.Again pull rod and push rod have NO DIFFERENCE to the suspension dynamics of the car.  The location and placement can effect the balance of the car though.  But the end results at the wheel are the same.If you understood suspension dynamics as you said youwould know this.There is a wealth of information on Ftechnical about this I urge you to read because youre causation does not imply correlation.,formula1,cexphfu,3,t5_2qimj

273860,0,t1_cf8vdnq,Food for thought for you and others what about as the cars approach the grid at the end of the formation lap? Many drivers give full throttle and let the rear loose to get heat into the tyres and I am assuming the tyres are spinning. However I dont recall seeing any smoke or noticeable amounts of it and the car seems to snake around as the drivers keep it under dynamic control.This could go for as there is no smoke therefore traction control is working to prevent wheelspon or against as there is wheel spin apparent but no smoke leading to the idea that the current generation of tyres need more work to create tyre smoke your argument but thought Id bring it up either way.In the below at about  the cars start to come onto the grid doing their gettingreartyretempup routine at high revsHere is a HamiltonMcLAren demo where he some some spins. I noted the smoke takes some time to appear properly.Im not necessarily disagreeing with you because the engineers are intelligent and have the initiative and knowledge to do some of this stuff but again I thought I would bring it up in any case. I guess the point Im trying to make is perhaps the reason there is no smoke at the start of races is somewhat due to current generation tyre construction and make up.EDIT At about  a Sauber comes onto the SF straight with a big slide but no smokeEDIT  Disastrous grammar and spelling.,formula1,cf95blc,1,t5_2qimj

It cant be done. Theres nowhere to sneak anything in. As for this years new exception for the rear wheels to have their brake pressure reduced by a powered unit it gets plugged directly into the standard ECU which has a its every output logged and monitored.Do you think subverting the standardized and homologated electronics is just a matter of sneaking a little chip onto the car where nobody will spot it? Youre taking this a bit far mate. Just because Exhaust blown torque maps are helping drivers keep from spinning the rears under power? Sure thats common knowledge! They write articles about it in Racecar Engeering! Regenerative braking helping drivers manage balance to the rears? Sure. Cyrptocomputers placed inside counterfeit wiring harnesses designed to subvert control inputs from FIA logged ECU? Bollocks.

410809,0,t1_cfmuxha,Horner? Thats hurtful  Its been the case on multiple occasions. In the s. Again in the late s. Most recently between  amp  between Michelin amp Bridgestone. In either case it has never worked well. Unless the tire specs are frozen which really makes having more than  supplier pointless what you end up with is an arms race with tires which creates two potential issues. . The enormous cost with development just adds on to what is already a major issue. To be completely fair the current limits on testing would probably mitigate a lot of this but it would still add in a lot more expense vs. today. Ultimately this leaves smaller teams out in the cold or ends up pushing some of the tire manufacturers back out of the picture if they carry the bulk of the costs themselves and you end up back with one tire supplier anyway completely defeating the point.. In the extreme it would distract away from what should be the stars. The cars drivers and engineering teams behind them could fall in to the background as it becomes less about who has the fastestmost reliable car amp driver and more about who can slap on a tire that can do  laps without needing to pit.

Electric motors are less efficient at maintaining cruising speeds than combustion engines for instance and rangerecharge time will continue to be a problem for pure electrics for a good while.  I think theres a lot of potential for hydrogen engines if we can get the fuel production tech right i.e. not require a ton of fossilfuelsourced electricity for electrolysis.  Hydrogen ICE uses a lot of existing tech beefed up currently about  more expensive than gasoline but would come down a little with volume.  Id almost say were more likely to go hydrogen ICEelectric hybrid than pure electric.  And of course on the pure electric side theres HCEV vs. other LiIonetc. battery again depending on tech advances.I think the next  years will actually be very interesting because its the first time since the early s that theres actually going to be genuinely competing engine techs again.,formula1,cfnecgm,1,t5_2qimj

Many many things can happen this year but I dont think well see a future where Red Bull goes from losing due to poor reliability to losing because their car somehow has terrible aero or balance.  The only way I see them having a McLaren  level of crash and burn is if Renault gets the engine to finish races by severely neutering it powerwise.  Which actually could be quite interesting.

502088,0,t1_cfx70dw,Fun way to look at it the drivers back then were the best.  And they were slowly replaced by a completely new breed of drivers and they were now the best of the best having been raised in this new era of technological racing.  The drivers back then probably couldnt keep up with this generation because the sport is completely changed and youre going up against the best racing drivers of this generation.  One day our beloved drivers will get replaced by a newer and better generation of drivers and our kids will think back to the days of Vettel VS Alonso and they will complain about how soft the drivers they have in the future are in their selfdriving F Google cars.,formula1,cfxca60,5,t5_2qimj

511417,0,t3_1zz5c4,Completely agree. Bottas is vastly underrated. I feel like hes the driver Williams really needed in   Maldonado was too error prone and Senna too slow. Bottas is neither. He appeared to be a solid wellrounded driver last year which is very good for a rookie who didnt race the previous year.He outqualified Maldonado  last year and weve all seen what Maldonado can do in the right car. Bottas can win races Im sure. Massa is quick too as evidenced by the fact he outqualified Alonso  times last year. He can win too I just think that he is far too inconsistent and his racecraft too suspect to compete at a high level throughout a season. People say Ferrari held him back but I think  will expose the fundamental flaws he has. If Bottas is the talent I think he is then he should beat Massa.,formula1,cfyeg29,9,t5_2qimj

559928,0,t3_20jjno,The thing that is terrible about this is not that he is being disqualified. Every series has rules and if you exceed those rules you get DQed this is comparable to using a higher flow air restrictor in the races that run those. It is not legal because it is exactly the thing keeping the playing field level. The shitty part is one redbull had to know and hope to squeak by two all the performance we saw from Ricciardo was effectively a performance on steroids three this is going to make Ridcciardo feel a little shit about his own performace knowing it wasnt just his driver skill keeping magnusssen at bay but rather an unfair technical advantage. Magnussen never had a snowballs chance in hell to pass him because Ricciardos car could accelerate faster.best course of action?DQ Ricciardo from the race and throw a few million dollar penalty at redbull. This is either egregious oversight by the engineering team wanton disregard for the rules and actively attempting to subvert them knowledge that they might break the rule but running any ways hoping that they wouldnt or wouldnt be caught or total ignorance to the regulationtheir infringing with the regulation. none of which are acceptable at the level of F.My best guess as to why this situation occuredSince the FIA altered measurement code and Ricciardos car had the fuel flow meter replaced at some point after practice but before the race my guess is before Qualifying it is highly likely that RB didnt know they might be in trouble until after qualifying aka the first time they ran the car with the new meter and code. At that point it was too late to make a change and they were just hoping on luck. Assuming this scenario last changes made before Q i am quite disappointed that the FIA did notwas not able to DQ Ricciardo before the race even started.,formula1,cg3x53b,1,t5_2qimj

580534,0,t1_cg5vhym,Its funny you bring up Abu Dhabi a race in which Vettel was DSQ in  because of insuficient fuel for testing. RBRs response in the end was that the Renault engineers got the fuel flow wrong even though Vs were not a new thing to anyone. This was after they stopped the car on track citing and proving that there was a technical difficulty with the car which was initially accepted based on provided evidence. Later they found that the RBR car didnt have enough fuel this was probably the real reason they had the car pull over.   This was only  years ago. Now we are in a situation where RBR state that they  guaranteed know they did not exceed kgh hour fuel flow and can provide the calculations to prove it. I wouldnt accept their calculations as they can just fudge a rounding factor to make it look right. Its going to be hard for RBR to prove with out a doubt even with testimony from Renault who have vested interest in not having RBR DSQd. It is a case of he said she said and the FIA sensor will triumph unless after the offset it was massively wrong and that can be proven somehow with third party information and the FIA technical delegate was completely unreasonable.

Other changes included the introduction of a speed limit in the pit lane. Some of the changes acted to slow down the cars such as reducing the engine capacity from . liters then to . liters. Stepped bottoms to the cars were introduced to help reduce the downforce generated by the underside of the car. Other changes to cars included a reduction in the size of the front and rear wings wheel tethers to help prevent wheels flying of following an accident. To protect their drivers constructors had to build stronger cars.It was all down to the fact in the  season the cars had no driver aids at all like With active suspension traction control and launch control no longer available,formula1,cg9oxtz,2,t5_2qimj

A Ferrari Challenge team was practicing there the same weekend and one of their mechanics who had worked for Ferrari for  years said that it was his favorite race car. I actually got to stand up against a barricade about  feet from the F after it braked into a  corner and then went into another turn the noise and feeling was incredible. If anyone is wondering it was the Ferrari Club of America Central States Region track weekend at Gingerman Raceway in South Haven Michigan. Entry for spectators was like  for the whole weekend and there were many former and current race cars there. They are returning again this year June th and th. It was incredible. I got to sit in a Ferrari Challenge  race car and hang out in the pits all day. And FYI most of the cars are there to put in hot laps. Some of my friends didnt go because they thought it would just be a bunch of old men talking about their parked cars and that was not the case at all.Double edit I almost forgot the best part. At lunch they did an hour of open track parade laps and allowed anyone to go out and drive on the track I have done track days here before anyways. I went out on track and was slowly cruising around and the F and a  flew up behind me and blew past me on one of the straights while I was on bluetooth telling my friends how bad they messed up not coming they clearly were stretching the definition of parade lap.,formula1,cgsbmsm,5,t5_2qimj

The FIA ones that are faulty think Ric is on his rd one this season already though may be wrong on that unreliable and causing problems for other teams are the ones that show him to be above the limits. His faulty sensor and other peoples from what I remember reading were gradually drifting up further and further despite the fuel rate not going up. RB couldnt trust the FIA sensor to be accurate or reliable.The very next race the FIA sensor failed yet again and RB had to use their own instead with FIA permission. I fully believe all the evidence is there to show the FIA sensor was faulty and Ric was not above limits...but the FIA are pissed because RB didnt follow their instructions.

797483,0,t1_cgurj7m,The split turbo gives additional inertia due to the weight of the shaft and the log type exhaust manifold also increases turbo lag and reduces power.  Mercedes compensate through very effective use of the MGUH.  Where do you get the HP deficit from?  Renault as far as Im aware have always claimed theyll generate as much power as Mercedes once theyre at  which they now claim theyll achieve this weekend.  I dont doubt that Merc make more power but if they do then its through a fundamentally more efficient ICE and thatll require months if not years of research from Renault.  The Mercedes does seem to have a more efficient MGUH implementation when feeding energy back into the MGUK at the end of a straight but that only affects that one small area of peak power.I do agree with Renault and Ferrari for that matter lagging in the drivability department.  Theres no doubt a couple of tenths on the table because of that and this is also where those manufacturers are liable to make the quickest gains but again thats not the whole picture.Red Bull have only been competitive in the wet.  In the races at best theyve been just about nd best but usually with other teams breathing down their necks.  In Australia they should have been further back due to being legal on their fuel consumption.

I know this is just a rewrite of what I said above but its not like Mercedes are going to focus less on downforce because they have a more powerful engine.

If Jensen decides to stick with HondaMcLaren then the older driver could be someone like Kobayashi or van der Garde  someone that cares more about sitting in an F seat than caring which seat theyre in.  I dont think Maldonado would be wanted and I think he carries too much money to want to drive for a new team.  di Resta is racing DTM but would probably happily come back to F but again he has a bit of an attitude and thats not publicity a new team wants.  Perez is probably very happy at Force India and wont move down in constructors.  If Hulkenberg leaves Force India for a top drive in the next year or two then Perez would be their  driver a spot hed likely be very happy with.

This is what most people associate with active suspension. What was proposed is moving away from mechanically adjustable suspension which is complex expensive and time consuming and moving towards an electronically adjustable one. Using the same type of technology as traditional AS but in this manner would allow teams to very quickly set up the car and introduce some very interesting damping curves. So instead of swapping partsspringsvalves you just put in the parameters on a laptop and off you go.

896837,0,t3_24dzw1,Found this online.gt As you may know after the deadly accident there was a criminal investigation in Italy to assess possible criminal charges as to the responsibility of Sennas death. That court case lasted a few years. During those years all the parts of Ayrtons car were kept in Italy as legal evidence and strictly guarded. After the conclusion of the investigation where no convictions were made all the remains of the car were returned to Williams who decided to destroy everything for reasons apparently not made public. gt EDIT Speculations are that Williams didnt want to be subject to further investigations. Main accusations ranged from bad suspensions to a faulty installation of the steering column which would have implied manslaughter charges to Williams responsible team managers and engineers. Although cleared by the Italian authorities the chance of having the case reopen with evidence still existing was not smart. Therefore in order to prevent additional drama and legal ramifications the destruction of all the parts seemed to be the most sensible way to handle the issue. gt Controversial to say the least. Perhaps Frank Williams and Adrian Newey knew all along something that the rest of the world will never know. And evidence could only open up a can of warms. gt Additional details  Extract from wikipedia ltltAt the conclusion of the Italian trial Sennas FW chassis number  was returned to the Williams team. The team reported that the car was in an advanced state of deterioration and was subsequently destroyed. The cars engine was returned to Renault and its fate is unknown.gtgt,formula1,ch683to,16,t5_2qimj

944107,0,t3_24tdbw,As others have pointed out  the prior generations of drivers didnt have todays fitness levels.  They also didnt use the cars as weapons against their fellow drivers.  So physically and psychologically  theyre would be handicapped.But if you ignore those things  and ask who simply had the driving skill to compete or vice versa...Senna And Prost  Who Could Go Back In Time To Battle Them?Prost and Senna are Top  Greatest of All Time.  All.  Time.  Which of todays drivers could you send back in time to do battle with them?  IMHO  only Alonso has consistently demonstrated the drive anything fast skill of Senna and the technical acumen and strategy of Prost.  Hes also the mentally strongest of the top guys.  Put a relatively fragile Hamilton in a team with Senna or Prost and they would mentally destroy him. Senna And Prost  How Would They Do Today?What about timetraveling Senna or Prost in their prime to the modern era?  The cars those guys drove were more powerful than todays cars.  And early in their careers they drove cars that were less technically advanced than todays cars  while later in their careers their cars were more technically advanced than todays.  No doubt at all that those guys would be competitive today.BUT  Prost drove in a time when he could do boatloads of testing as did Schu in is heydey.  Im not Schu fan  but I do believe the lack of testing hurt Schu in his comeback.  It could handicap Prost as well.  Weve seen both Vettel and Kimi have trouble adapting to this years cars  while Alonso has consistently been able to jump in anything and drag a time out of it.  That ability Alonso has which I believe Senna had as well  could be more valuable than Prosts ability to test and test and test and get his perfect setup.Mansell?Mansell was not in the Prost  Senna pantheon.  He was teamed was Prost for a year at Ferrari.  Not only did Prost firmly handle him  it messed with Mansells head so badly that many observers believed Mansell intentionally broke his car during at least one race.Hamilton likes to compare himself to Senna.  IMHO  the Mansell comparison is better.Others?Going back in time  there were a few drivers who were simply revered by their competitors.  Fangio and Clark come to mind  and would be the first two I picked.  Lauda was a badass  one year he scored more total points than Prost in the same car  which even Senna didnt do in either of their two years together.  I might take a punt on Fittipaldi  he scored  WDCs very early in his career  and might have taken more.  But then his career derailed when he tried to do his own team.  He went IndyCar racing a full  decades later because Mario Andretti called him and told him how much fun it was and came and kicked ass.,formula1,chblnyt,2,t5_2qimj

Sure RBR may not only hire from the juniors. But they have only hired from the juniors once that program was truly up and running. They retain the option to go outside for a freeagent if it seems to them none of the internal candidates are ready to step up. Had Webber left after  or  I suspect they might well have done just that. But his hanging on as long as he did and then leaving when he did saved them a tough choice and now with Ricciardo establishing himself Kvyat in the frame and Vergne and da Costa as backups they seem set to keep it all inhouse even if Vettel jumps ship.,formula1,chd2ntq,1,t5_2qimj

The real pace of the Red Bull is shown by Ricciardo who drove well had a clean race and finished s behind.Red Bull will not be competitive with the Mercs this season because Renault cant upgrade the engine enough.

Many people considered it a soft punishment as taking away Michaels second place in the Championship clearly meant very little to him anyway...he got to keep his race results etc.  A  place grid penalty at the following race Melbourne  may well have been more of a consequence for Michael had they used that instead.I think that the general derision of Michael by the majority of fans and journalists even the loyal German press savaged him did more to make him regret the action than the FIA did by stripping him of second place.

995289,0,t1_chhez15,Yeah thats true but nobody could have expected a rookie Hamilton to be so close in pace and Mclaren were juggernauts in the pre era. Almost always up there in the championship battle.And yea Kimi was unfairly ousted. It was a mix of situations that led to the outcome. Ferrari wanted Alonso  year early. But then who to drop Massa or Kimi? Seeing that Kimi was WDC and pretty even on performance with Massa having  WDCs would be very appealing.But Massa had that accident in . It would look very bad for Ferrari to drop him after an incident like that. Santander Alonsos big sponsor is also a Spanish Bank with a large presence in Brazil. So the decision was made for Santander to buy out the remaining year of Kimis contract and pay him millions of dollars not to race.Anyway interesting developments in this sport.,formula1,chhf6nr,2,t5_2qimj

He answered some of the questions the nonretard questions pretty well and adeptly sidestepped the question about Alonso and the Barcelona finish by saying that the team would like to improve. I thought his answers to good questions were good.But stupid questions get stupid answers. I agree with some of the above comments that these press guys seem to be pulling dumb questions out of their asses. I think Kimi is like some of the people in this forum really we just want questions that are pertinent and not what if this what if that it is pointless. Kimi doesnt like things that have no use to him one of those things are press conferences. Press conferences dont win races or points. That said Im pretty sure if you met him not under the surmise that youre a gushing F fan but just as a guy in a bar to drink with I think he wouldnt be a prick. Hes a practical guy who knows what he wants. From what I gather he likes to have a good time and drive cars to the limit.

Saubers a team I really love and in the past they have made driver talent a priority. Its sad to see them in such dire straits and with perhaps the most uninspired driver lineup on the grid.

Once all of the CFD parameters have been set and the model drawn up the model then needs to be put through a solver which takes a huge amount of time to do unless youve got a very powerful setup.

Driving a race car isnt as difficult as you would believe dealing with pressure of the situation whilst trying to deliver consistently on the limit is however what its all about. Gt academy picks very deserving winners after a long process that lets the guys with the real passion and determination float to the top. After winning it is arguably even harder again as they must deliver and prove they have what it takes. HOWEVER they now have no financial worries have all their training accommodation fitness tests and races paid for by Nissan so in a way it becomes easier on that front. Im sure most people would argue it would be easy to work hard with all of that stuff sorted for you? I personally feel it would be anyway but Im not really in a position to say for sure.

1157225,0,t1_chzr506,Actually it does. If one track doesnt have to follow safety rules supposedly the most stalwart rules in the book why should any of them? Example Technical Directive For the upcoming Canadian gp no cars are obliged to run the regulatory crash structures. Traditionally there are very few serious incidents at this circuit which would warrant their use here. Teams are still obliged to run the regulatory crash structures at every other circuit on the calendar. Ok Robert Kubica did have that one a while back which may throw doubt on todays technical directive but the extant crash structures in his car really didnt do very much to protect him in that incident if you could even call it that. ,formula1,chzszie,1,t5_2qimj

It might... as far as I know Perez hasnt offered any public explanation of what happened. But its not that he probably shouldnt have moved off his linehe definitely shouldnt have moved off his line because its illegal. And its illegal because its dangerous.Massas pass was only risky in that it didnt allow much margin for Perez to make a major mistake by changing directions at the wrong time which is what he did and that is why he was penalized. If Massa had allowed an extra  inches of clearance on the pass he might have been able to dodge him but its still Perezs fault.Its ironic that you and some others are calling Massa out for making an aggressive latebreaking inside pass on Perez at an unusual corner for passing when this is exactly the sort of pass that Perez does all the time aggressive latebreaking inside unusual corner... and usually hes counting on the other guy to take evasive action.

1200663,0,t3_27v3x0,Im not sure whether I agree. Hamilton does have a tendency to make a mistake or two but there are some years    this year so far where his mistakes are very few and far between. Because of that we know Hamilton has a very high peak level that he is able to reach for entire seasons.Rosberg has completely proven me wrong. I remember  amp  when he was alongside Schumacher. In  Schumacher made a ton of mistakes and yet was right behind Nico at the end of the year without Nico suffering any considerable misfortune.  woukd most lilely have been a similar story if not for all the bad luck Schumi had early that year.Considering that Schumi was demonstrating fundamental weaknesses and still remaining close to Rosberg I thought a legitimate top driver like Hamilton or Alonso would destroy Nico. But lo and behold he has been very closely matched with Lewis in equal machinery.I do think that Rosbergs racecraft is not nearly as strong as Lewis. Bahrain was a great demonstration of this  Rosberg kept trying to pass Hamilton in turn  but trying the pass there was always going to give Hamilton a chance in T. And not once in T did he try a switchback pass nor did he hang Hamilton out to dry on the outside. His one dimensional approach that day cost him a win he shouldve taken with ease. Additionally there were some races last year Germany Hungary USA where Rosberg found himself out of position on the grid although Germany quali was a team error. In those races he was unable to make up many positions and didnt do his car justice. I think Hamilton at his best is a better and more complete driver but even then there is very little separating them. ,formula1,ci4oybd,7,t5_2qimj

It shouldnt be allowed everywhere but maybe if there were more places with a shorter distance it would make the overtaking a bit more varied instead of just this one or two straights here.There are plenty of very safe places to use it in Canada. The problem with it being in few places is that some cars are better are certain parts of a track. You could be within . seconds the entire lap have a shitty start of S and have no DRS.

Moreover what is also interesting is that there is more and more research conducted into avoidance. In other words  women are objectified gt female viewers react negatively gt after a while they try to avoid the cause of negative feelings gt viewership decreases. As for men objectification theory holds true for them as well  in conjunction with the mere exposure effect gt women treated as objects or moving attractive billboards gt norming occurs gt womens objectification in everyday life. Obviously theres a lot more theory to it and its simplified but to say its not sexism and that uEsteluk is twisting the meaning of that word isnt right. Its not about them getting paid or about admiring the human form. Its about attractive women sorry girls being paid to look attractive on camera while their bodies are used as a sexual object that helps with advertising and drawing in male viewers. EDIT Also gt Sexist attitudes may stem from traditional stereotypes of gender rolesPutting scantily clad pretty women to hold umbrellas and stand around with a permasmile on their face is sexist.Objectification is a part of sexism. From Wikigt Sexual objectification is where a person is viewed primarily in terms of sexual appeal or as a source of sexual gratification. This is sometimes regarded as a form of sexism. Nussbaum has identified the seven features of treating a human as an object as the following. instrumentality treating the object as a tool for the objectifiers purposesThis one is fairly obvious. They are used as attractive advertising pieces and certainly dont hurt viewership numbers. If this was about their functionality they could just wear jeans and a Tshirt to hold that umbrella. Or yknow. Get guys to do it.. denial of autonomy treating the object as lacking in autonomy and selfdetermination. inertness  treating the object as lacking in agency and  together  they are literally paid to stand still and smile. And to be quiet. Occasionally flirt with attendees and take pictures with them.. fungibility  treating the object as interchangeable with other objectsWho cares which pretty girl is holding the umbrella? There are plenty of them to go round.. violability  treating the object as lacking in boundariesintegrityPretty selfexplanatory again.. ownership  treating the object as something that is owned by another can be bought or soldThey are hired by their respective teamssponsors hence they do as theyre told.. denial of subjectivity treating the object as something whose experiences and feelings if any need not be taken into account.This goes back to point two and . I highly doubt their idea of a good time is flirting with sweaty overweight middleaged men. But at least they get paid for it.,formula1,ci72ti1,1,t5_2qimj

In some cases it is certainly justified but in many cases it is ambulance chaser lawyers looking for quick settlements from insurance companies by blaming someone and trying to force them to defend themselves because they know that it is cheaper and easier for them to settle a claim for some amount of money than it is to try to fight it and demonstrate your innocence in a protracted legal battle that will eat up years of time and lots of money.,formula1,ci7c2jf,5,t5_2qimj

Lewis lifted on the straight to let Kimi through crossed the startfinish line in nd place and then overtook him going into the next corner resulting in Kimi damaging his front wing on Lewis rear right tyre.Stewards ruled that Lewis had gained an advantage and had not done enough to give it back despite him giving up the place. McLaren attempted to appeal the decision as they had telemetry which demonstrated he both lifted and was travelling slower than Kimi over the startfinish line however the courts ruled that an appeal was not applicable as the punishment was a drive through penalty served after the race by way of a time reduction and an appeal is not applicable to drive through penalties.All in all I have to say the handling of the situation was quite poor I believe that Lewis made the right decision the rules state only that he needed to give the advantage he gained back and he did.

Your claim that things are the same and should therefore stay the same is not only a logical fallacy but also disputed by your own claim that grid girls look less salacious these days than in the past. The culture is changing whether you like it or not. Plenty of people in past generations have held tight to their views that women arent suited for voting for higher education or for various occupations. You have the right to your opinion but be aware that you may be held in similar esteem by future generations.I keep watching such a chauvinist display because I watch the sport for the racing the drivers and the cars.

1299769,0,t1_cifss45,F has always by necessity involved saving fuel tyres and otherwise not driving on the limit. The fuel regulations in the turbo era of the s meant that fuel was marginal much more so than now and it wasnt uncommon to see drivers pulling off the track  from a podium position even see Keke Rosberg in   due to running out of fuel. Same thing goes for tyres drive too hard shred your boots and hey you just screwed up the race strategy or worse  remember Raikkonen at the ring in ? Lastly F engines have long been capricious beasts Brundle has talked about the pucker factor of the long straights at Hockenheim where hed be flat out and just waiting for the engine to give from the stress. And often engines would! The last few years have been unusually reliable for engines. Driving below the limit at points  during the race to keep the engine from blowing up was common practice for years.As far as the tracks being boring goes I cant argue that some of them cough COTA cough arent overzealous with the runoff areas. But its a safety thing and after years of experimenting with Armco catch fencing and gravel traps runoff areas have proven to be the safest.

You want a V good. Want to run a giant  cycle engine with  HP of electric motors great. V you got it. Jet engine okay.. Bring back the active suspension and ground effects.. FIA defines a box that the front and rear wing have to fit in with respect to the hard mounting points on the chassis for the suspension. Anything goes inside this box.. Minimum rim size of  inches.. Annual homologation. You can change your package every year but once you declare your parts youre married to them for the season. Homologated parts are engine power unit or whatever gear box and chassis. . The points system is now        . Reward the victors.. Bernie is sacrificed to Sauron.. All Ferrari qualifying times are reduced by . seconds and their race times are reduced by  seconds.. Smoking is bad for you but tobacco branded cars to painfully awesome looking. Allow tobacco sponsorship.. Any homologated part is subject to claim by any other team. Chassis claim is  million engine claim is  million and gearboxdrive train claim is  million.,formula1,cigxylv,3,t5_2qimj

I can understand not allowing full races from current or recent seasons to be put on YouTube but all the other stuff will only have a positive impact on growing the fan base who might watch or attend races in the future.

1409569,0,t1_cisgz1a,Points for everyone eh? I think Caterham gets nothing this year. If they survive itll be due to allying themselves with Red Bull.I think Mercedes and Red Bull are obvious nochanges and Williams certainly shouldnt be in a hurry to throw anyone out given how well theyve been doing this season.I also agree with Ferrari. With Bianchi getting the test day for them and Raikkonen looking and acting decidedly past his prime Ferrari will be happy to put one of their own in the car.I can see FI keeping both drivers but I also wouldnt be surprised to see one or the other leave for a variety of reasons. Supposedly Hlkenbergs deal at least is for two years but as with all F contracts it could be bought out for the right price.I also agree with McLaren. Button will race one more season to bring Honda back and then retire. Magnussen will stay for the forseeable future.I dont agree with STR. I think Kvyat will clearly stay but Vergne is already setting records for longest stint with Toro Rosso. I think he will be gone if they have anyone else at all they want to try. I also dont think Red Bull are afraid to run two young kids in the junior team unlike most outfits would be.Lotus is a bit of a question mark but I think youre correct that there will be no change. Grosjean has nowhere to go and Maldonado would only leave if he thought his money could get him a better seat elsewhere. Given the lockedup state of most of the top teams its unlikely.Sauber does have a terrible season but they dont get dead last. Sutil is gone for sure why did they ever take him in the first place? and Van der Garde gets a seat for . Not sure whether Gutierrez stays or not.Marussia have their best season ever but score either no more points or just a couple. As you said Bianchi to Ferrari although I dont follow GP so I know nothing of Marciello. At any rate someone Ive never heard of will replace Bianchi next to Chilton.Caterham get dead last again with no points. They have easily the worst car on the grid. As I said above if they survive at all itll be because of strategic alliances. Kolles said the team must change to survive and hes right. Kobayashi will be dumped in favor of Frijns with newfound Red Bull backing they can afford to have one actual driver sorry Koby and Ericsson will stay because .,formula1,cisyw7a,3,t5_2qimj

On a side note Irvine was tied in points with Schumacher after Silverstone. Id say that Schumacher couldnt have  Vetteled to the championship without the crash Hkkinen would had been able to challenge him. Nevertheless i would give Schumacher the edge just because the Ferrari was way more reliable than MacLaren. I would agree with your statement if the  season was played  times Schumacher would win most of them but there is still a chance that Hkkinen would be able to win it.Anyway this is pure speculation and crashes that cause long term injuries are part of the sport.

Engine is Ferraris problem but still he must have had some input in it and that engine sets a new level of crap.McLaren struggled with their design direction but button claimed the  car had his influence we all know how well that went.Look at RBR theyve got second best car atm that chassis has been influenced by both Vettel and Webber read somewhere MW is really good with feedback  of the reasons Porsche hired him amp watch road to Formula   Vettel different people say similar thing about how good Vettel is with   development.He is struggling with Renault PU thats pretty evident and race by race he is getting hold of the cars characteristics since he is used to EBD. RBR is second only because of Renault if they had a built a engine that could at least match Mercedes PU  this year wed have seen a  way fight.Coming to Alonsos point Hamilton makes too many rookie mistakes even in the most dominant F car ever qualifying out of P running off track while leading running too close to other car for more than laps.... and so on. ,formula1,ciy17s0,-2,t5_2qimj

Now on to the matter of DNFs. What a shame the faster driver Hamilton is losing to his teammate because the Mercedes is unreliable. Did it ever occur that perhaps Nicos driving style doesnt destroy his race car as Hamilton does in order to be quick. His brake suppliers even his brake bias is geared to be a more practical choice thatll get him across the finish line as much as possible. As well he doesnt destroy his gearbox nearly as much because he has a more practical approach to gearshifting than Lewis who treats every corner like its an adventure. Nicos driving style is smoother and often he leaves it a gear over Lewis in certain corners to avoid strain on his car. Lewis would rather downshift and leave it in a lower gear for more power regardless of the fact that driving as such will do much more harm to your vehicle for small gains seeing as how you only have a few K revs to work with. If you cant notice those differences in driving techniques than its no wonder youd rather descend into personal attacks on a users character whenever you find things to not be in keeping with how you would prefer them to be.

It just seemed like he got to second and never pushed any harder because he had a  chance Kimis engine would let go and if it didnt he only lost two points. Im bitter from that because that McLaren was so quick and Kimi should have been WDC. Then you have the whole  season when it seemed like he whined about being  and then cost the team M and left when he didnt get his way. I guess i just never let any of that go.

1553116,0,t1_cjatlpa,Lewis must have some of the most over worked PR people and interview coaches because he goes through all the steps right. But Ive got a strong feeling all of that is fake. And while its only a feeling lots of people agree with me and it would be pretty close minded to call it silly. You can see it in his body language whenever something goeswrong and how he answers tough interview questions that theres what he wants to say vs what hes been coached to say. Regarding your point about the friendship with nico... remember that all of a sudden they are friends again. At the end of the day you are right.  I just dont like him but thats as a combination of what limited view of his true personality I have and the obstruction to that view as a result of PR and handlers and coaching by the team.  However I think his driving is fantastic. ,formula1,cjayg0l,0,t5_2qimj

Youve laid out his motivation and made it clear hes made a choice and if youre right about his reasons and I agree with you then its also likely to be premeditated that he wasnt going to back down next time they were wheel to wheel.  In fact thats most likely what happened in my view he had decided before the race that he wasnt going to back down no matter what and then applied it in the wrong place to the wrong move and came away looking stupid.  That does make it deliberate though no matter how boneheaded it was with hindsight.It wasnt Sennaesque though.

While Alonso is a good wheel to wheel racer I think even better than Schumacher and he has a very good race pace though not as good as Schumacher he just doesnt qualify fast enough. I also think that Schumacher was more ruthless which probably would play in his advantage. Lastly Schumacher probably worked harder than Alonso. Im not saying Alonso is lazy here but Schumacher was on a different level. He was working with his team ALL THE TIME.

But when I watch the races and look at the points table Im not seeing someone who is beating Lewis. Im seeing someone who is getting very close but lucking into being ahead.I think Rosberg can still turn the tides he needs to beat Lewis on track from now on in in outright performance.

Ive been so impressed with Ricciardos onboard footage recently. He makes the car look so supple under downshifts and on power application at corner exit. I look at Vettels work behind the wheel this year in what is supposedly the same car and wonder whether he has a Ferrari in the back. Its little wonder then that Ricciardo is getting better life out of his tyres without having to sacrifice speed. Vettel is surely studying his data but Ricciardos style may be very difficult to imitate since its all based on feel.One thing Ricciardo hasnt fully overcome is his bad starts.

1932141,0,t1_cklxslh,This is usually how all the big websites cover F and more serious racing games.  They all play with assists and sometimes even review them like arcade racers with max assists while using controllers. They usually do end up giving favorable scores but theyre not something to go by. Only recall Giantbomb using a steering wheel during the F  quick look besides that I think most websites just use controllers unless they have a racing fan on board.  looks really disappointing but I think this is just the way transitions from old to new consoles goes. Because of Codemasters release schedule and developing they are behind on all the other sports games who released minor updates last year mainly Fifa  and NBA K for PC and old consoles.

1952424,0,t1_ckogt1i,gt Stoner likely would have won titles had he stayed he was on the best bike on the gridYeah but his results were already waning. Just tried to calculate  even without DNfs IF he had finished all three DNSs in first place Lorenzo still would have won. Lorenzo was  points up on Stoner. With two retirements to Stoners one and the  DNSs. Add to that the constant media outrage to which he added for a Red Bull sponsored rider he clearly missed out on PR training his wife getting pregnant  he just didnt have that passion for the sport like you said. And there could have been a whole list of other issues he had that well never know about. Lorenzo was barely beaten by Marc in  while Stoner couldnt even beat Pedrosa in . And somewhere Honda would have made room for Marc in  or  on a factory bike. Probably by booting Pedrosa out. And then itd definitely have been game over for Stoner. ,formula1,ckogykz,1,t5_2qimj

We should however keep in mind that this is really nothing compared to what Lewis has had to contend with. He remains an additional DNF down through no fault of his own and we must also accept the lost points ergo points boost for Nico that those additional catastrophic failures in qualifying have cost Lewis. By a conservative estimate I have Nico still  points plus in credit which really hammers home the reality of this battle between the pair.

It creates a low pressure zone immediately downstream of the exhaust and helps accelerate the flow upwards to reattach and smooth the wake of the rear wing.

1974564,0,t3_2haytr,Nothing personal OP but asking this sub to rate drivers is the worst way to rate a driver unless you only want to rate them based on popularity in this sub.  We are mere fans of the sport. People who actually work in F have a better understanding of each F driver.  Some drivers excel in some aspects and dont in some where other drivers might excel in. Its not as simple as end result. F is complex and  understanding drivers just as much. Ive said it numerous times and ill say it again. This sub is extremely biased. Circlejerking at its best.  Many new users come in and get the wrong idea about how F is to be enjoyed and how drivers are rated. You say you want to get insight on drivers but doing it like this is the worst way possible. Youre just asking for whats been circlejerked throughout the season.

1976168,0,t1_ckrbba0,gt Firstly stop talking about the teams as if they are one unit who will act in each others best interest they wont.Theyll act in their own best interests but they have to be aware that other teams exist and what other teams might do under various circumstances.Its not that the teams will collude but they all have similar business models aka get as much money as possible from sponsors and WCC winnings especially the smaller teams that dont have giant corporations backing them.  With similar business models they will make similar business decisions.gt This means bernie has the whip hand and can intimidatereward them if they bend to his will.Only so long as he can guarantee a reasonable chance at profitability for enough teams to field  cars.  The teams wont race if they just lose money every moneylosing team eventually exits the sport or gets bought out so while Bernie can offer them incentives they ultimately decide to stay or go based on whether its a sound business decision.Bernie can provide incentive but he cant stop teams from leaving that dont think they can operate profitably.  So ultimately Bernie can make it worth their while to stay but he cant force it but the teams can force his hand by leaving.gt The points issue can be addressed by giving drivers points won for third but not for constructors. It is all very possible.The constructors interest in the WDC is minuscule compared to their interest in the WCC.  There is no money for the teams in the WDC so its only WCC points that have any bearing to the teams.The WDC is good for fans and good for drivers so the teams have to care by proxy but if the rd car gets WDC points and no WCC points theres no incentive for the teams.  If those WCC points just go poof it plays to the strongest and bestfunded teams but it directly disenfranchises smaller teams by getting pushed further toward the back in pointscoring finishes there is a smaller gap between the smaller teams and goodbad luck at even a small number of races can have a huge impact on WCC standings and thus prize earnings.gt Anyway we will soon see either way. I believe it will happen.Im not sure that it wont happen but I dont see it as a foregone conclusion.  It doesnt benefit anyone besides FOM really and the teams would have to decide that continued FOM dominance is better for the sport than failing to put  cars on the grid and the FIA gaining the chance to reorganize the whole shebang.Well have to wait and see but the main point is that Bernie isnt holding all the cards and that he has to appeal to the selfinterest of enough teams to put  cars on the grid.  That will be a distinct challenge in a car world due to the costs associated with running  cars and everything that comes along with that.,formula1,ckrbtnq,2,t5_2qimj

1979172,0,t1_ckrm2ww,Im bothered by the toxicology investigation statement and now major media headlines that there was enough marijuana in Wards system to impair judgment.  That sounds like an awfully damning and conclusory statement on an issue that doesnt have a scientific consensus.On what scientific basis can they make that statement?  As far as I know there is no known direct correlation between the amount of marijuana metabolites in ones blood to the level of altered mental state one experiences  as exists with alcohol.  This is why Washington state and Colorado found it a somewhat difficult task to establish a legal limit for marijuana with regard to driving under the influence.THC unlike alcohol is fat soluble.  Meaning that it can be stored and released in your blood stream for relatively long periods of time after its mental effects have worn off.  There is simply no level of THC in a bloodstream that has been scientifically proven to determine whether a person is high.I cant shake the feeling that Ward is being posthumously characterassassinated here.,formula1,ckrovzx,23,t5_2qimj

1988571,0,t3_2hhaju,Okay fuck it. Im about to reveal the details of my fucked up autistic childhood here to complete strangers on the internet because TBH I think OP is genuinely hurt.Guys I know youre all trying to be civil and I dont think any of you have actual malicious intent but I dont think any of you are seeing what youre doing here.First of all nobody actually wears a fedora in real life. Secondly there are people in this world who are delicate beyond imagination because theyve been made to feel like outcasts all their lives.Remember that weird kid in school? Imagine things from that kids perspective. Everything theyve ever said or done for whatever reason a psychological condition a different perspective or maybe theyve just never fitted in from the start gets poorly received by the people around them. Imagine what that would do to you if its all that youve ever known and you cant understand why. You cant understand why other people wont like you everything you say seems perfectly fine to you  at least!  So you begin to lose confidence in your own social mannerisms and everything about the way you interact with people becomes less and less surefooted. That causes a vicious cycle.Eventually you begin to accept that youre not like the others. Maybe youre just fundamentally different to them. Maybe youre not human.I know this sounds way too melodramatic but I actually thought that when I was a kid. I actually thought that there was something seriously genetically wrong with me... and that everything I did and everything I was was wrong. Everybody else was a proper human and I wasnt.Its taken years and years of introspection therapy and hypnosis to get to where I am now. It still feels like Im learning everyday how to build up selfesteem take criticism etc.ualpass isnt trying to be pretentious hes just not as surefooted as you are when it comes to this sort of stuff. Again youre all being civil and trying to reach out but just remember that criticism can seem like so much more to the most insecure of us.overreactionaryrantover if nothing else writing this will tell me what to say the next time I see my therapist...

Why would they have cut away a large part of the car ahead of that time?  And where would they get heavy cutting equipment from at such short notice its hardly standard issue.They wouldnt have attempted extraction of an unconscious driver without medical supervision  I think thats opposed to FIA rules.But yet there was definitely that other picture... hang on a minute that other picture showed the Marussia car with tethers attached for lifting.

The statement that force equivales to the lifting over a distance of a body is so wrong i must cringe..... you are talking about a potential energy and if you want to speak about the disspiated energy you have to take half times the mass times the velocity squared which is the kinetic energy pre impact,formula1,cl1xaxe,1,t5_2qimj

2075809,0,t3_2in3c9,So this is a bit out there but I am going to stick my neck out and say that hes going to Williams. Heres my thinkingAlonso screwed himself by not committing to Mclaren sooner.Ron Dennis may quite likely not sign him now that Vettel is going to Ferrari. Alonso has lost all negotiating power. Mclaren seems to be the only team that can offer him a solid drive. So all the chips appears to be in Rons hands and I am sure that he is going to try and screw Alonso contractually or think that he can make him sit out a year. Mclaren may think that they can move up on the grid anyway assuming that Alonso will not be able to find a drive for .With all the Alonso and Dennis history this feels quite likely and possibly an attempt at payback from Dennis. No way they could have cleared the air! With Rons cryptic comments about divers not being under contract for  it really feels like a setup. Remember Alonso was not even on the Mclaren site until a week or  ago.So that leaves the rest of the field for Alonso to approach. The only real option is Williams. They have been so close to the winning this year and Alonso could be the man to take them to that next level. I think a driver at Williams is going to get seriously blindsided  probably Massa.,formula1,cl3oicf,2,t5_2qimj

The very long turn  at Sochi is an interesting new challenge. Its similar in length to turn  at Istanbul or turn  at Buddh but very different in character. Whereas Istanbuls turn  is made of discrete chunks this is a continuous bend that seems almost constant radius but gradually tightens. I like Hamiltons very patient wide line to a late quasiapex lots of other drivers are coming in to an earlier apex hugging the inside then drifting out wider at the end which I think compromises turn .There might have been some room for improvement in getting the power down or tweaking some lines through the slow technical last sector thats the only place Rosberg was quicker but overall its a very impressive lap.,formula1,cl6k0km,16,t5_2qimj

That means each cylinder on the Ferrari engine was cc and each on the DFV was cc so the Ferrari parts like pistons bearing caps and connecting rods could be smaller and lighter the head could be narrower if it had a smaller bore andor the deck height lower if it had a smaller stroke.Also the flat has a very low center of gravity in comparison to the DFV which was much taller which would benefit the handling characteristics of the Ferrari.,formula1,clfy9n5,49,t5_2qimj

When Mercedes bought Brawn they bought in  Schumacher to help develop the car and invested hundreds of millions of dollars.If a bottom feeder or mid fielder team is purchased without hundreds of millions behind it then it will remain where it is or fail. Even buying a top team like Renault did not help Lotus as it did not have the money to compete at the pointy end.Really the only teams that get bought and sold are generally rubbish anyway.For the last  years the same  or  teams have won the WDC and WCC with Brawn being the only anomaly. Other than it has been Williams McLaren Ferrari Red Bull or Renault for  long years. In fact other than a single win to Benatton you have to go back to  when Lotus won the get a winner outside the big .Basically since modern F started in the early s we have watched just  teams battle for the Championship every other team has been an also ran grid filler.,formula1,clm71xt,1,t5_2qimj

But they will work through the problems and likely be the ones to beat by the end of the season.Vettels smooth style and heady driving is going to benefit him on the Pirellis more than other top ranked drivers.Well start to see some chinks in Buttons McLaren armor which will bring rumors of change for  but he will still likely beat his teammate in points.Ferrari will likely win the WCC but they will not have the best car and will consider it a frustrating season with  bringing big changes.Lotus will be slower than the Williams and Force India and dare I say it... Sauber.While Ill stop short of putting any absolutes on Sauber I feel theyre the dark horse out of the mid field teams. They really figured the car out at the end of last season and while this season is very different theyll have a lot of confidence coming into  and good team harmony.Mercedes will be the team to beat at the start of the season.McLaren will have another underwhelming year but will be better than last year.

2268441,0,t1_cls1u5h,Excellent writeup! Also I would add to that breakdown that Lewis is also well known for not being susceptible to bowing to pressure. Some drivers can be forced into making mistakes when their car is not performing well and they have opponents on their ass. Lewis has not shown himself to be one of those guys. He has immense self confidence and make no mistake  top tier motor racing tends to require hefty egos even arrogance ontrack like that to be successful.He has made mistakes sure but very few of those mistakes can be chalked up to him being pressured by the competition. His worst enemy on the track is himself overextending on rare occasion and losing focus. Hammy KNOWS how good he is and is not afraid of battling with anyone. He and Fernando share that trait that makes them so damn good and both those guys have the seat of the pants driving skills to back that attitude and arrogance up. ,formula1,cls3kvy,7,t5_2qimj

He caused a lot of accidents and even got a race ban like Grosjean. Hakkinen was brutally precise and quick over a single lap but he wasnt always so great under pressure in a race. Bottas by contrast seems incredibly composed and errorfree. In that respect he reminds me more of a young Raikkonen  everyone expected Raikkonen to wreak havoc after such a limited junior career but instead he just kept his nose clean and consistently went very quickly. Bottas looks like such a complete package already and alongside Ricciardo is in my opinion the best candidate for a future champion in the sport at the moment.Bottas also had a brilliant junior career. I think people have been waiting for the next Flying Finn and some people prematurely jumped on the Kovalainen train even though his junior results indicated he wasnt KekeMikaKimi quality.

2358402,0,t1_cm37fxn,I think any driver would flip out if he was bluntly told to let his teammate by. Drivers are very high strung when they are in a race. Instead the teams try to be political and carefully point out what is best for the team.Valtteri is faster than you  dont hold him up. Your teammate is on a different strategy than you  dont stay in his way. Nowadays sometimes a driver is told he cant fight in order to save tyres or fuel. Sometimes this is true and sometimes it is a careful way to tell him to let his teammate by. Back before team orders were banned there was a famous incident when Barrichello was told to pull over and let Schumacher by.

2419166,0,t3_2n6ac1,This race proved that actual speed difference is quite little between them when they are both comfortable but because Alonso was opportunistic on Kimis exit before the straight he finished ahead and that was well earned. It has been hard season for Raikkonen but lets be fair the car was shit in terms of performance and shit in terms of handling and being able to change characteristics to it  Alonso had much more experience with hard handling cars since he has been driving one for  seasons or he simply seems to be more adaptive.

2439806,0,t1_cmctxbi,Yes there are road same type of suspension Push rod or pull rod. The parameters they work in are completely different though and again that is one example of technology transfer to road cars.The pull rod system in a Zonda R for example wasnt taken directly out of F but influenced by it and other systems. They use pull rods on a lot of WEC cars too. You cant design parts for an F car and hope they will work exactly the same on a road car the same goes for tyres. Whatever they do it should be a test bench for how to improve road tyre technology.So far the only reason I have seen Michelin give for wanting  inch wheels is because they are already using it in WEC they want to use a similar tyre for F. For them as far as I can tell its a cost saving exercise that will force F teams to spend shiploads of cash redeveloping their cars to suit the larger wheels. If thats the only reason they want to change the regulations then Im not in support of it. ,formula1,cmd9khl,1,t5_2qimj

2488759,0,t1_cmjc5e1,Thats why I think standalone events may have too much emphasis in the analysis. Raikkonen wins  seasons than Button Button scores better in  standalone events Raikkonen scores worse in  standalone event. This causes Button to have more than double points because of  single races.  However Raikkonen only sits  single raceI can understand Hulkenberg getting higher points than Hamilton but not with such a large difference.The most interesting one is Vergne. Comparing his results to Hamilton conveniently my driver.. are his results really that much better for him to have so much more points? Surely a thrdstthstst  for HAM is equal or better than JEVs stthndthndstnd? HAM takes  season longer in  category and JEV is more successful in the first sitting of a season but is that then not balanced out in some way by Hamilton achieving the overall better results? Or it could be the case of as in the first paragraph that with JEV getting better results in  standalone events with Hamilton better in  and worse in  that there is too much emphasis on standalone races.Or similarly with Vandoorne vs JEV his strdthstndnd is pretty equal to JEVs stthndthndstnd? Surely with VAN taking  resit and JEV having two resits and failing to win them balances additional firstseason victory by?I think overall I dont actually disagree with the ranking of the drivers relative to each other I think I just disagree with the points gaps between them I.E I dont think Buttons results should net him more than double of Raikkonens that JEV should have so many points etc.Edit Sorry I missed your other comment typing out this wall of text. I dont like JEVs position on the table still but I think Buttons points haul relative to Kimis is much more reasonable than previously. Maybe the first season multiplier should be x instead of x? Or the second season multiplier be x. or x.,formula1,cmjf3i6,2,t5_2qimj

2491708,0,t1_cmjsoeq,I see that point as well it may come across as a waste of money and resources into RampD but it will cost a lot more money for backmarker teams looking to make minuscule changes to their power units to make up minuscule ground to the big players like Merc Ferrari and Red Bull who would be advancing that much more anyway. Merc are already claiming  extra BHP IIRC? What message does that send to the lesser teams who do this for the passion of racing at the pinnacle of motorsport? If you cant spend then too bad so sad? What does it say to the fans of those teams as well? and not to mention the sponsors of those teams who are throwing money at these teams to languish at the bottom of the table and barely scraping into the points. I get the need for modern power units and hybrid technologies as the way of the future but not everyone in the general public can afford nor drive modern Mercedes Ferraris or what not. Honda coming back im imagining will be huge for the consumer market advertising affordable cars with F hybrid technology would be a huge purchasing point for many people. Hence why i feel by simplifying the power unit regulations more manufacturers can enter ie Ford GM and a long shot AudiVW? By creating a sustainable long term regulation where all teams can adequately survive and perform against each other we wont see new teams or manufacturers looking to gain an entry because its simply not viable. I cant speak for everyone on this subreddit but i certainly would like to see a much higher level of competition between the big teams and smaller teams scrapping for wins and championships with many more manufacturers and teams. ,formula1,cmjsymf,1,t5_2qimj

People were afraid that teams would cheat really in F? thus the need to draw the lines by the poor schmuck with the marker.

Commentary is an unnecessary hassle believe me I tried it and the text being at the bottom is just coincidental for this video. Oh and pro tip dont hover. The only media of the MNR is photos and when using photos that dont fill the whole frame its easier just to keep them still otherwise it looks odd.

2719982,0,t1_cnd0fp4,To me this race highlighted a problem in mentally adapting to a new situation. One minute Rosberg was coasting to a victory in the best car from pole the next he was set back through no mistake of his own. From there he could still have won but needed to fight hard and pass several cars in tricky conditions. It seemed as though he was still in the mindset of I should be winning and assumed that he could breeze past other cars. When that didnt happen he got frustrated and began making mistakes increasing his frustration.Theres an analogous psychological situation that is wellknown in chess. A player is in a commanding position that should be easily winning. They then make an inaccurate move that changes the assessment of the position. Now they are perhaps still theoretically winning but it will take a great struggle to achieve the win and avoid a draw. Often in this situation even very strong players fail to mentally adapt to the new demands of the position. Through a combination of frustration and playing as though they ought to still be winning they will often completely collapse ultimately losing the game.,formula1,cnd90qd,16,t5_2qimj

Bottom line is that the FT was not as bad as Raikkonens results show.It was probably not quite as good as Alonso results show either. Not that Alonso outdrove the car in terms of speed but like Button Alonso just manage to bring home the car consistently in a good midfield position.So over the season the FT was probably about the same level as the McLaren and a bit faster than the Force India.

2759662,0,t1_cnhp5qj,Of course any driver wants to beat their teammate and there is no doubt that Kimi was disappointed in his performance and that he lost out to Fernando by such a big margin.

And of course he tried his best at this level you always try your best it was the same in  when people said that Kimi didnt care anymore thats why his performance dropped but of course that was a bullshit he simply wasnt comfortable with the new tires easy as that. But I do think that champions have a different mind set than other regular F drivers. In my opinion once they won the WDC from then on all they see is  WDC or try next year. That is why probably they dont care if its th or th or whatever. But dont get me wrong the second best thing after championship is at least winning a race and third probably is beating your teammate.

2910325,0,t1_cnxemqt,Thats a very interesting idea. To get an idea of how useful it might be Ive done some extremely terrible math. Making a few horribly imprecise and notveryscientific guesses about fuel composition pretending its  octane intake charge F and exhaust gas temperature F and using mol for units the max fuel flowrate of kghr equates to molhr so this equation would repeat itself . times per hour or once every . seconds.Using the equation CH  O gt CO  HO then your precombustion volume would be L of reactants and L of inert nitrogen gas and your postcombustion volume would be L of reactants assuming no loss of volume due to one dissolving into the other plus L of inert nitrogen gas hotter coming out than when it went in for a total of L before and L after.For a NA engine you could probably assume that the before figure would be almost the same for coldblowing since the pumping action of the engine is the main thing moving the air through the engine but a turbocharged engine such as these wouldnt be able to do nearly as well without the pressurization given by the compressor and since spinning the MGUH via the turbocharger is the goal of the exercise you cant blow your own sail.

If this claim were applied consistently Hamilton fans should have been saying that Button was clearly the superior driver at the end of  since  was just him adapting to a new team and therefore not representative.,formula1,cp1877h,-2,t5_2qimj

3272130,0,t1_cp16rcx,Race simulation during practice generally refers to the team running the car for X amounts of lap pretending like theyre acctualy racing. With pistops  high fuel and whatever else theyd do during a standard race.This is done simply to practice and see how the car performs during certain periods of a race.You can conclude basically nothing biased Vettel fan because this is testing done on different days where the track were known to differ a lot between days Mercedes drivers. ,formula1,cp18zv8,7,t5_2qimj

3272854,0,t1_cp1brr7,gt People were saying that at the time Perhaps we were reading different forums but I recall things differently. There seemed to me to be loads of excuses Lewis is only losing because he has issues because hes having problems with Nicole etc..gt Why would fans of the driver say someone else is better fans tend to support the driver that they think is the best.Because it is possible to support a driver while still being objective about their faults. I supported Hakkinen but recognized he didnt hold a candle to Schumacher. I supported Senna but thought Prost was every bit as good. I supported Barrichello even though he was nowhere near Schumacher. There are many reasons for supporting a driver besides thinking theyre the best driver on the grid. Looking at F from a neutral perspective today if you believe your driver is the best you must either be an Alonso fan or facing some impressive cognitive dissonance.,formula1,cp1bz3p,1,t5_2qimj

If he did Sauber certainly would have used it. I can only imagine GVD not getting a seat cause of some clause fine print lawyer thing that technically allows them to not give him the seat. Which is a dick move.Lets not forget Sutil was probably also in the same boat. Guaranteed a seat for next year but taken out on a technicality or something. Only difference being hes had his career in F unlike GVD. So we can kinda understand why hes so hell bent on the seat.Now I dont know if GVD is fighting for the seat or the cash.

Taking these numbers at k rpm for easy math    V     cylinders firing per revolution    V     cylinders firing per revolutionNow sound transmits through vibration or pulses through the air.Converting these into pulses per second you get . for the V and  for the V.Now these final numbers are what give you the tone of the engine. These numbers are the first harmonic of the sound an engine will give so as you will see the Vs harmonics will always be at a higher pitch than the Vs.Also exhausts play a huge part in tuning the sound by essentially setting up various standing waves from an acoustical perspective and may emphasize the higher harmonics or the lower ones.,formula1,cpj4jv7,7,t5_2qimj

I will happily agree that its more difficult to really optimize your chassis with an underpowered and inconsistent engine but the greater relative stability of Toro Rosso with what is almost certainly a less complicated chassis indicates that there are issues on the chassis side of the house at Red Bull as well as engine difficulties.If they built their chassis around the engine they were expecting rather than the one they got thats fair but then Id hope theyd focus on working with Renault to get the engine they were expecting or at least have the grace to acknowledge that their chassis doesnt mesh well with their engine maybe not go so far as saying that its a bad chassis which it likely isnt but that their design exacerbates the engine issues theyre facing.,formula1,cpnzrm6,3,t5_2qimj

If you have a general admission ticket Non grandstand you can check out the best places to sit The esses after the first corner might be a great spot if you can get a good spot.If you are in a grandstand you can use the day to just get a view from other places buy merchandise at the F Village etc.Id recommend doing that on the Friday If you have a day ticket. Also they have some stalls for example Sky F had one in  I think and I got a few freebies. Got a Silverstone pen for free one year too stuff like that.One year I think  I got a free piece of a McLaren car or race suit I think very small piece for being a Vodafone customer. So you have to walk around the entire track. On race day if you dont have a grandstand seat you need to get there pretty much for when it opens to get the best spot.

3550170,0,t1_cpwwcqr,They had the same engine last year its the second year theyve had the same engine.  They are not allowed to use the same chassis or aerodynamic package theyve been independently developed to similar ultimate effect.Cyril Abiteboul was specifically hired late last year to spearhead closer integration between Red Bull and Renault.  They enacted a program of installing Red Bull engineers and processes throughout the engine program in a bid to promote knowledge sharing and in order for RBR to be able to speed up Renaults development processes.  The end result of that program was the rushed developments that have failed to reap benefit thus far this year which is why Renault are so indignant at the criticism from Red Bull and are now distancing themselves from the team and insisting on a return to typical engine development processes.It is also why I personally have been so critical of Red Bull  they specifically interfered in Renaults processes and then blamed them very publicly when it didnt work whilst accepting no blame.  The underperformance of their chassis adds to the hypocrisy where they should be focusing on their own deficit instead of expending energy in publicly and classlessly admonishing their partner.,formula1,cpwxxto,2,t5_2qimj

You will thank yourself later from the lines and also knowing u will not have to stand on the trip back to Nagoya. Especially so if its wet!Same goes for the bus shuttle. Get all  days tickets that Friday morning when u get off a shiroko.Also pro tip. If your a big spender on merchandise do all ur shopping Friday morning and take all ur crap to one of those courier tents. They will have all ur stuff delivered to ur hotel within  hours for only a couple of bucks!I normally rock up around when the gates open at ish. Have a beer and one of those stick steaks.

As another commentor notes in a different question Malaysia and China are basically the same track.

Generally speaking there was a decade or so when we would get another such cookiecutter looks like a a repurposed parking lot track every year. I say cookiecutter because all of these tracks seem to have exactly the same character e.g. long straights with hairpins at the end.

3752613,0,t1_cqjyla5,I dont believe its spelled out anywhere in the FIM regs.  The regs simply say the stewards and race direction are empowered to apply this or that penalty. What actions besides those that are spelled out  when one can enter or exit the pit lane and so on  deserve what penalties is left open to the discretion of the stewards  race direction. That said in bike racing the old standard is whether rider Behind has a wheel on rider Ahead.  The meaning should be obvious but I should probably say it  if the rider behind has a front wheel beside  more or less a full wheel but see the above caveat about it not being written down  the front rider then front rider cant cut him off force him out etc. without risk of penalty. Up to that point the rider in front really has little or no obligation.  As I say its not spelled out specifically anywhere thats just the old time rule of thumb I think they probably go by.    Of course here Marquez took himself out by getting into Rossi from behind.   Had he taken Rossi down  out or even made him lose position then Im sure the stewards would be singing a very much different song. ,formula1,cqk0w7a,2,t5_2qimj

Bad qualy  lower grid position  more traffic  still not comfortable with the car  a lot of lost time.Now he can put okay qualy lap  better grid position  less traffic  comfortable  one of the fastest drivers over the race distance.In Spain Bahrain Brasil Abu Dhabi they were very evenly matched on race pace Kimi finished  seconds behind Alonso and that was with a car with which he felt somewhat comfortable on those rare weekends. So yes I have no doubt that he and Vettel are extracting nearly the maximum at the moment. Fernando isnt the fastest driver out there on pure pace Hamilton and Ricciardo probably are my opinion. Fernandos strength is that he is great at everythingany condition and when the day comes where one of them struggles with the cartrack be sure that Fernando would have done much better there but when they are comfortable with the cartrackconditions not really.,formula1,cqmz26e,1,t5_2qimj

Even if he never got to race in F again because he refusedreported it he would have integrity. I was surprised he seemed to quite easily find a career in the US. I guess money talks.

Thats a strategy choice from the teams.gtDrivers these days cannot drive at the limit anymore where they want to be. Mark Webber has talked about this and said he knows that F drivers these days are unhappy with all this management stuff they have to do to win races  winning by strategy not by driving as fast as they can  which is what they really love.Thats always been the case.  It really doesnt matter how fast you drive if you run out of fuel or wreck your tires too quickly.  Thats nothing new.gtEngineers tire strategies and computer programs doing race simulations win races these days not drivers.As opposed to....?  Tell me how are you going to take that out of the sport without banning computers?  And even then theyd just do it by hand.gtThe gap between F and the lower categories shrinks every year and the fact that a yearold can make the jump with no problems kind of bears that out.An exceptional yearold who has thus far shown the racing maturity of some of the more experienced drivers on the grid.

3908547,0,t1_cr1r3ou,gt You use prior experience as a negative though and you shouldnt be. Im not using it as a negative Im using it as important context. Given Ocon and Verstappen performed similarly well with vastly different amounts of experience Verstappen would be expected to perform much better with the same amount of experience. His comparison to Sainz Jr. so far strongly supports that hypothesis  he has been closely matched with a driver with  years of singleseater experience including time in much more powerful cars FR..gt Theyre the same age so theyve had the same amount of time to develop their skillsYeah thats not how it works. At all.gt Youve done a very very good job of explaining why Max looks like hes going to be good. You have not done a good job of explaining why Ocon wont continue to be better than Max.Verstappen reached the same level as Ocon in much less time so he is obviously on a steeper trajectory. Indeed if you watched the season you would realize Verstappen appeared to have eclipsed Ocon by midseason. He was comfortably the better scorer in the second half of the season  from the Norisring onwards.Whether that will continue to be the case is unknown but it is the natural expectation. Time and again we have seen that drivers who adapt extraordinarily quickly to new cars as juniors tend to be the most successful F drivers and tend to peak higher given their greater potential unsurprisingly. Those that take longer to reach the same level like Ocon tend not to reach the same peaks unsurprisingly.,formula1,cr1t589,3,t5_2qimj

The Nissan is a frontwheeldrive frontmidengined car with a front weight bias  and bigger tyres at the front than at the rear. The Porsche is none of that. Nissan had announced a WD car with monster hybrid boost but as it appears now will start with a FWDonly car in the  MJ class the lowest hybrid class. That means if they aimed for a system power of  hp it would be available for less than  sec around Le Mans.               The Porsche has just one the one MGUK at the front to power the wheels the Toyota has one at each axle. That means the Toyota can split their  hp hybrid boost between the two axles. Porsche cant. They would need to have a single electric motor to deliver  bhp but still be compact enough to fit in the small space at the front all without overheating. This engine would then have to put all  horses on the road through the front axle in a car with rear weight bias. And you would of course need to recover enough energy from the one MGUK and the GUH to make that  bhp useful for any significant amount of time. Some of these aspects seem possible but the combination of them does not. I still has over  bhp just not  bhp. ,formula1,cr2bust,1,t5_2qimj

If you read the article as well as the DC one over at BBC they want real overtakes where drivers are on the limit of their car and tire and also being able to follow each other closely. You simply cannot deny the fact that WEC drivers are more like F were  years ago in terms of pushing the car. Its just that they now have also been able to lay very close to each other.DRS simply made it a free pass if you were behind.

3974110,0,t3_35vjhy,Times change. For a while race organizers didnt want to install barriers to keep drivers safe. They would say if you think its too dangerous then dont drive. Its a mans sport. But after so many of our heroes died we changed our attitudes and now we expect to see them climb out of their wrecked cars shrug it off and carry on.The same is true about the engines. Lets face it  fossil fuel is not a renewable resource. It will run out one day. And theyre not that efficient to begin with. Electric motors are far more efficient at delivering torque across the band and our energy conversion and delivery methods are nearing  efficiency. Our biggest problem is energy storage. We will solve it soon enough. When that day comes combustion engines will be obsolete. Simple as that. I hope we still use them on track days etc. Theyre fun no doubt about it! And I love the noise too but their time and place in prime time is coming to a quicker than you might expect end.But there will always be racing. It will take some time for some people to realize this but eventually theyll understand that noise is wasted energy and racing is racing no matter the method of propulsion. Hell I hope we get to see some proper spaceship races before I die! There better be good commentary because there is no noise in space...The point is that noise doesnt matter. What they should be focusing on is the racing. Allow the engines to catch up hp doesnt sound too bad with upped fuel flow and do something about the aero and tyre regs so that drivers can follow bumpertobumper without taking such a huge aero hit.Once the racing is close and exciting and F will always have controversy the fans will flock right back! ,formula1,cr9a5q0,1,t5_2qimj

And if this is the end for him I would rather have it be at the track. I know this sounds horrible but right now everyone in F seems to be ignoring the fact that he isnt getting any better and try to convince themselves that he will get better so they dont have weight on their consciences. If he had died at the track we would see some safer rules ones that do not force a driver to push in a situation like Jules did. Thats a huge flaw in the rules it cannot be allowed to happen.

4050559,0,t1_crhw1kn,EDIT Not sure why youre being downvoted for asking for a source. Its a perfectly reasonable request.Here are the quotes from Jock Clear over the radio to Villeneuve.gt Hakkinen quite quick and very helpfulgt Be aware that Hakkinen is now in position two. He probably wants to win. Very helpful.gt Hakkinen is immediately behind. Last lap. Last lap. Extremely nervous. Hakkinen has been very helpful. Jacques position two. Dont let me down Jacques. We have discussed this.Source news article from the timeLast year this agreement was confirmed by David Coulthard in an interview with Autosport. He was quoted as sayinggt In Jerez  Ron had made that deal with Frank Williams which none of us knew anything about that if we helped Williams in their quest to beat Ferrari they wouldnt get in the way of helping McLaren. Ron would probably still deny it today.gt Thats what happened then they asked me to move over.gt Apparently I was running behind Mika and they told him to come in to clear the way for Jacques Villeneuve but that meant I jumped him at the pitstop.gt I see it differently because I was right with him and they wanted him to be realigned for  laps and then tell me to move over. Eventually Dave Ryan who was on my side said Look youre compromising your position within the team which I saw as another way of saying youll get fired so I moved over and Mika won the race.gt Then there was that ridiculous finish where I let him past and Berger almost overtakes as Jacques slows down.gt I remember explaining immediately afterwards to Heidi my girlfriend at the time and Peter Windsor was standing there. Ron walks up and says we cant say anything and Heidi turned around to Ron and said Youre a fking asshole. And then Ron just walked off he didnt react.gt There were all sorts of fun and games that went on at that time. And it took energy time and emotion. I could have ignored that instruction but they were paying me to do a job and I needed the opportunity to do the job.And to quote Mikagt I didnt really win that race by racing. But next day I looked at the results and my name was first so I thought OK Ill take that gift.,formula1,crhzu2d,6,t5_2qimj

Yes Seb beat everyone is those Redbulls when did Alonso beat Lewis in a Renault?I never said Seb isnt a great driver but i dont understand how people can forget what Ricciardo did to him the first time he had some strong opposition. Mark Webber was  kilos heavier so if you got  tenths in your pocket every lap every race...thats beating someone with one hand tied to his back and the first time someone else steps into the car you get your ass handed to you your not a great driver a la Fangio Senna Lauda Novulari Prost etc. Doesnt happen. For that alone i will never rank him among the best ever.As for his win in Monza. Great drive from pole.

4269784,1,t1_cs6sv5q,Hes no Alonso Thats right. He doesnt require preferential treatment and has equal status with his team mates while Alonso doesnt. Thats why he is clearly a better driver. He gets the job done while having to deal with the pressure of having a competitive teammate alongside him who picks up race wins and vital championship points against him. He is a true battle hardened and tested driver who has gone against guys who have a fair crack against him........so whens the last time Alonso faced the same challenge?   and he blew his fucking lid and exploded into a fit of rage when he was not given status over the rookie.  He got thrown out of a title contending car for trying to blackmail Ron Dennis and has clearly been too afraid to go up against anyone with equal status since.Alonso better than Hamilton?

Lewis Hamilton gets . because he is unlucky enough to have a bad start ends up in the turbulent air and has to nurse his tyres longer.bias towards you favorite driver is normal but thats a to much in my opinion. this guy makes it sound like lewis wasnt at fault at all for that result. he calls the bad start from lewis unlucky. says nico had luck because his start engineer set up the car right he had the best car and he had clean air. no lewis isnt at fault that he had to run in the dirty air and the fact that lewis made a rookie error in driving over the white line isnt mentioned at all.over the whole race nico had the pace on lewis. if its the other way around the same guy would probably have said that lewis destroyed rosberg today on track but if it is the other way around its just luck  for lewis may be a bit harsh. probably a  or  but not more in my opinion. he had a bad start hadnt the pace to challenge nico on track and made a silly mistake which led to a  second penalty. everything but a good race in my opinion. it just shows how far the mercedes is in comparison to everybody else on the grid.,formula1,csenfxt,9,t5_2qimj

4342690,0,t1_csf20br,All the teams do do that to varying degrees at different times.  The big teams run split design teams with some people already working on the next years car prior to the current car even launching.  Smaller teams will pick a point in the middle of the year where they switch focus.  Red Bulls folly by their own admission was not doing so early enough in  so they had an incredible run of dominance in the second half of the year but were behind on their  program which added to Renaults problems.As it stands time isnt going to help Renault.  They need a fundamental shift in methodology and resourcing which I suspect they are starting to put in place behind the scenes as theyve gone very quiet recently.  The token system still allows plenty of scope for development and I wouldnt be at all surprised if there was an opening up of the regulations whereby they scrap the freezing of certain elements and continue giving the manufacturers a handful of tokens each year to spend when they want to.But most of all Renault need another year or two of RampD.  Engines have exceedingly long lead times and there are no short cuts or risks that are worth taking.  Red Bull pushed them into a different approach heading into  and it ended in disaster.  I take their quietness and lack of tokens used thus far to mean that theyve changed back to a traditional approach and are only focussed on taking a big step forward for next year.  Hopefully they can catch up to where Ferrari are this year by the start of next years campaign giving them something positive to build upon.Mercedes and Ferrari will be facing diminishing returns from here on in so whilst theyll still move further ahead it will be by a smaller amount than we saw between last year and this.Honda are harder to read.  They appear to know what needs to be done and have publicly stated that theyre now putting more resources where theyre needed.  Its surprising its taken them this long but public statements can lag action so hopefully thats the case.  Again they need time but at least appear to have some innovations in their power unit upon which they can build.,formula1,csf5hh7,2,t5_2qimj

It is not necessarily easy to call off a race since you have thousands of people and tens of millions of dollars tied in to it imagine flying from another country and spending thousands of dollars to be told that the race is cancelled.  It may have been the right thing to do but not an easy call.   The discussed starting the race earlier in the day but that would have greatly hurt the television audience.   They were running out of daylight so they were trying to run the race and finish before dark so a red flag was even less appealing.   The lack of any real major accidents likely has led to a feeling of invincibility.   The fans love a wet race just look at the people getting excited at the possibility of rain during a grand prix.  It was a huge mistake to run the race as they did but it is understandable.  Formula One is a complex sport that is full of many different and often conflicting interests.

Those are the rules does not mean the rules are at all justified. I think its a ridiculous rule.gt We get to say no because thats all it is just saying no we dont set rules we dont mandate anything its just a reflection of peoples views nothing more. Demanding is a strong word for people liking something thats easily associable.You can like whatever you please  so can the driver. The difference is its the drivers helmet not yours  why do you get to decide what he does with it? Why do you even get a say? You shouldnt neither should I neither should anyone except the driver himself.gt And individuality is not the same as personality being fickle is not the same as being creative. I do agree that people do expect a champion to exude certain traits but I dont think any of them are that old s womanising mansman you describe nor do they want someone who advertises his personal life on a daily basis. Theres a middle ground somewhere in there that I think people want. People want a champion who speaks his mind about the sport nothing more nothing less.Again  why should drivers have to care what people want? People on this subreddit complain time and again that drivers are afraid of speaking their mind afraid of upsetting the media afraid of being anything other than corporate automatons. I argue that whether or not we dislike them is not something they should overly concern themselves with. Their job is not to be likeable media personalities. Nor is it to do what the fans would like them to do. Their job is to drive cars fast and its an incidental fact that when they do it it makes for good viewing and thats what makes them famous. If they want to have lots of different designs on their helmet  why do the fans get to decide? If they want to engage with particular types of music or put themselves out there in the media or get involved in fashion like Hamiltons currently doing  why should they care what the fans want them to be when they do that? Why should they not instead go with what makes them feel fulfilled what fits their identity as they and not as we see it?The drivers are not there in order to be the fans proxies their wishfulfillment. Theyre human beings same as you and I and theyre adults and theyre sportsmen  and they have their own agency and the right to behave in a way that satisfies them. We dont get to demand that they behave in a way that satisfies us. If you think that a driver changing his helmet design a lot makes him fickle then whoopdedoo you still shouldnt get to stop him doing it.,formula1,csjx1j0,2,t5_2qimj

Above it is concluded that Ferrari are probably running around kg and a kg difference would account for only . seconds of the . seconds discrepancy.I also find the inferred fuel masses of kg a little strange. All the teams in the race stopped around middistance meaning they began their first stint around full fuel kg and began their second stint around half fuel kg. An FP run beginning on kg would correspond to a simulation of neither stint. Yet the conclusion that Mercedes and Ferrari were probably running FP simulations with only kg difference in fuel suggests they were simulating the same phase of the race.,formula1,csmquuv,3,t5_2qimj

Bruce McLaren didnt join on some opportunist move because he knew the next round of regulations would benefit his team.gtMercedes road cars have about as much in common to the Formula  car as a can of Red Bull.I actually think Merc is equal to RBR in this situation. They very clearly entered the sport on an opportunist move to specifically benefit from the new regulations...  and its hard for me to imagine them still in the sport  years from now.

Basically he was saying that politics forced him to change his article rather than it being because he was lying.

I think so. Most top level athletes dont fall of the face of the earth in terms of absolute performance but instead lose that ability to keep their edge at all times. I believe that this is just time catching up and this doesnt mean he sucks or that didnt deserve his WDC.I think the reason why this receives more attention than it would for other drivers is because of the mystery Kimi Raikkonen is. There will always be what if with him. Be it what if the McLarens held up a little better what if he didnt leave Ferrari what if he stuck it out with Lotus what if he put more effort in. I think Kimi will be talked about for a long time after his career. Some will be a cautionary tale of wasted talents others he will be of a man who was only interested in racing and not the glitz and glamour.,formula1,ctf4xdl,13,t5_2qimj

After that he caused a collision with Ricciardo similar to that of Maldonado on Perez and he rightly got a penalty. Hamilton had a shit day in the office Rosberg had bad luck on top of the fact that his car has been slower all weekend. Something to do with its setup from FP that the team apologised for. Rosbergs start while poor still kept him in P and he stayed there for the rest of the race.

In addition I havent been very impressed by his performances relative to Verstappen given the huge gulf in their relative experience levels.Regarding Nasr he had quite a strong junior career. He belongs in F on merit. You seem to be mistaking him for a typical paydriver simply because he has a lot of support. That support could also help him progress up the grid which is needed to ever challenge for titles. Ive also been quite impressed by Nasrs results relative to Ericsson given he is a rookie. Ericsson is not a strong opponent but since the testing restrictions in  even strong rookies have struggled against relative weak teammates.As I said though I wouldnt jump the gun and call him a future champion.

4797279,0,t1_ctyyh4y,The Button outscored Hamilton statistic was intended to be cherry picking as an indication of how misleading team mate comparisons can be.  Theres no doubt of their usefulness in many if not most circumstances.  The fact is however most of the time people do not take into account the variety of factors which produces a certain outcome some of which I am about to mention.  The Massa of   present by most accounts is not the same Massa we had pre accident.  I would also claim that the Raikkonen prime was in his Mclaren days.  His results and apparent motivation seemed much more sporadic after that and the Massa of  was easily the best weve ever seen of him.  Just to be clear I am not a Raikkonen fan.  He should be replaced in my opinion.  These cars are not for him or vice versa.  The driving style required for the Lotus of  and  with its strong front end perfectly suited him.  He was as strong and consistent as hes ever been.  Now onto Grosjean.  A glance at his junior record is a clear indication of true natural ability.  Winning in everything hes driven including sports cars is an ominous record for others on the grid.  Few come close to matching him Hulkenberg being the closest.  Based on that alone he deserves a top drive along with Hulk and Bottas.  His time in f has certainly been up and down.  He jumped into a car he hadnt driven against the best driver on the grid still finishing th in GP having missed half the season and had a torrid time in .  In  his raw pace was evident but mistakes and bad luck took their toll whilst Raikkonen always brought the car home.  In  he suffered from chasis issues and reliability problems at the start of the season while his team mate continued with his previous seasons form but his performances later on notably in Germany Japan Austin and India are clear indications of what he can do in a top car.  He even performed admirably in last years pathetic Lotus and is comfortably beating Maldonado again this year in a sub average car.  ,formula1,ctz8i5m,1,t5_2qimj

Should they regulate the cars have a single paddle that the driver controls themselves set at its point before the season begins so that no one can change it race by race. Ok thats fine thats up to the drivers. But this just sounds like the team with the most flexible clutch system will benefit. The cars arent designed to start this way.I should be happy with this because Ricciardo is already one of the worst starters on the grid so mixing up how the cars start could benefit it but I dont really see the entire grid being mixed up every race as entertaining for the show.

4934736,0,t3_3igtbw,Many of the arguments here are based around the difficulty of separating the canopy from the structure of the car for extraction of the driver. Everyone should be aware that there are linear shaped charges specifically designed to cleanly sever structure for crew escape. These are designed to open large openings in composite or metallic structures and can be detonated in close proximity to a human wearing a flight suit or equivalent without them receiving serious injury. They were developed for the B escape system if memory serves. You dont have to saw through anything. Push a button and  milliseconds later the whole structure could be parted in two. These pyro devices are some of the toughest hardware elements around and can survive sustained vibrational loads into the hundreds of Gs and shock loads into the thousands of Gs.  They can be initiated automatically as in an eject sequence or manually using nonelectric initiation.  Making an escape system that can push an obstruction out of the way is not a problem. You can also deploy elements that prevent intimate contact between cars so there is little danger of the lockedtogether scenarios described herein. They are not cheap like a pyrotechnic bolt or nut but they are super reliable. The big issue will be the weight of the canopy and how hot the drivers will get without some element of environmental control. Strong impact resistant canopies are not light thin things. Also be aware that it is almost trivial to inert the entire compartment with nitrogen via azide canister pyrotechnics. If the driver had a short term breathing air supply you can make pretty sure that no fire will erupt within the drivers compartment or other areas for that matter. ,formula1,cugk9rj,1,t5_2qimj

If Pirelli go through the trouble of testing and analysing data to find safe ranges for pressures and the teams go out and break these rules its a bit of a slap in the face for them. Not only that but we all nearly saw two drivers put in dangerous positions at Spa. Not to say either Mercedes or Ferrari were cheating the system but that the implications are serious. While Pirellis tires arent perfect its certainly not helpful for them to improve their design or safe for the drivers if teams do this. If it potentially protects drivers from accidents helps Pirelli pinpoint their problems and makes things fair amongst teams by closing a loophole I dont see why it shouldnt be changed.

Friends playtime school girls sports dances graduations college etc is not something he got to experience like everyone else. To get to this level of motorsport complete and absolute dedication had to take place since he was a kid. Acting out in your teens and early s like normal people didnt happen for him like it did for many of us. Now he is a world champion he is in the best car he has the best teamand that wont change anytime soon and he has made more money that he knows what to do with so its only natural that he has the ability to relax and try and relive some of the moments he wasnt able to before this. It happens with child movie stars it happens with athletes and now its happening with me. F doesnt make him any more mature or immune to the world and what it has to offer. Especially when hes rich and famous. Has it gone too far? I dont know. There are foot ball players soccer players and celebrities that are way way worse.

5058579,0,t1_cuvgoio,OMG Super GT! In my opinion it is the best motorsport series out there. The best thing about it is they have  classes as youve probably read from others. The main Manufactuer in GT  are Nissan with the GTR Honda NSX and Toyota Lexus RCF. They have really high quality racing due to success ballast. I know people on rformula are not fans of success ballasting but it makes for great even fighting and promotes skillfull drivers instead of being able to pay for wins such as what happens in formula . In my opinion even though these cars are the more powerful of the two classes the GT class in the best.In GT to my understanding its very complicated and some cars dont technically fit in any of these specifications you have  diffrent types of classes. GT a generic Super GT spec GTThe FIA spec GT cars and JAFGT the Japanese Automobile Federation spec cars. This class is design for nonmanufacturer team Although BMW and Suburu have nonworks works teams in GT.   This class allows an incerdible varied amount of cars in it that all have there upsides and downside. Juust because I love GT so much ill give you some examples A Lotus Evora with a Nissan engine A couple of Mercedes SLS A Lamborghini Gallardo  BMW Zs A Toyota Prius Its a sick car one of my favourites A Honda CRZ with a Honda F MGUH in it. Lower power versions of the GT cars. An Audi R A Ferrari The racing is amazing because of success ballasting. When they have pitstops they swap drivers each team has  drivers some have  in the Fuji km  hours. And man watching the  GT cars lapping the  or so GT cars is a site to behold especially if you get a few GT cars battling for position but then they come up behind a few GT cars battling within them self and no one wants to give away position or move so the GT can get past as they might lose position it gets proper intense to watch.Shout out to  Nismo TV who have live english commentary of every race and shout out to rsupergt a great place but a bit bare of redditors,formula1,cuvqzxc,3,t5_2qimj

5075661,0,t1_cuwo5lx,Im going to add this as a reply here as frankly Im not sure which thread to respond to.The article is a little wooly in terms of FACTS something that one of my Spanish followers on twitter was keen to pounce on Andrew for and we had a little debate about yesterday on my timeline.  Andrew admitted and I quoteSomersF bueuF Massively appreciate the input  but piece is already more than technical enough for a general audience!This is the problem with the way the sport is represented from a technical platform IMO half truths and hearsay making my life more difficult as people assume that as the source is the BBC it is a FACT.Ill cover a few things briefly but I do have my own piece coming up on the Honda situation most probably during or after this weekend.The MGUKs maximum deployment is kws roughly bhp it can either deploy energy stored in the ES upto mjs per lap or use energy supplied by the MGUH via the controller ie missing out the ES instantaneously.So why not send it through the ES? The matrix was designed in such a way that efficiency was key.. You have to pay the piper to store energy so to speak this is because there are losses in energy during the transfer from ACDC amp visa versa a requisite of converting the energy to be stored these losses also create heat as a byproduct.  This puts an emphasis on controlling the energy flows not only storing energy for deployment but creating a symbiotic flow between both MGUs.The figures used by Benson in terms of the MGUH arent relevant as it powers the Turbo as a byproduct it will increase power provided by the TurboICE however you cannot compartmentalize them.The other key thing that is seemingly lost in the myriad of inaccuracies purpetuated by the media is that you dont always spend kws or kws when it was KERS this is the peak operating load.  Remember that the MGUKs response is triggered by the throttle and the specific map that is currently being utilised meaning only when you are at full throttle and full engine mode is the K delivering kws. At any given rpm the K will be supplying what kws the throttle pedal and map desire... That is just one reason why the drivers arent tapped out of energy after . seconds As I said this is a little brief but answers some of the questions ive seen below if you have any supplementary questions Ill try to keep an eye on the topic and answer when I can.,formula1,cuxt4bl,2,t5_2qimj

5100870,0,t1_cv0rxbh,I gotta tell ya I honestly respect your position. I really do. I however am loving this season. Not ONLY because my favorite driver is taking full command of this season and working hard towards a third title but because Ive been there for the years when things werent as they are now. When Schumacher was dominating  and  it was just rewards for the years he really had to fight hard for success he earned a year or  at the front. I had to endure that period of F and fell out of love with the sport at the time... relax dude. Its part of the cycle. Stuff changes theyll tinker with the rules the tyre style amp width the engine regs whatever they have to do to break Mercedes dominance they will. Look at Ferrari after  the next year the rule changes  tyre set lasted all thru qualy amp race only pit for fuel but push the tyres as much as you could during the race because the compound is so hard caught them hard and Alonso became the new WDC. Be open to surprises. Maybe not many for this year but I bet you next year Ferrari will be RIGHT on Mercedes pace or within . to . tenths... enough to make EVERY race close enough where the driver can make a difference again and we get an epic duel between Vettel and Hamilton with Alonso somehow as a miracle participant ala  Anything could happen next year. Be open to surprises. ,formula1,cv0ufna,2,t5_2qimj

Nico didnt take Lewis out at that race. Lewis put both of their races at risk and ended up paying the price. First words? Nico hit me. He hit me No he didnt.

We do everything from  weekends to Master cabins on Super yachts during the Monaco Grand Prix. I also used to work for Silverstone for a long timeOk so having done quite a lot of Grand Prix myself over the years my favourite races taking everything into account like price ease of getting there fan participation the fever levels closeness to cars and how cool the city is are. Monza. Abu Dhabi. Hungary. MonacoSpa is brilliant too but its a different experience. Its one more akin to camping and getting wet. Its definitely one to do  no doubt but I wouldnt put it up there in my top . Now I know Abu Dhabi is not in Europe but the flight prices and hotels are actually superb value for money and it is closer than you think. Hungary flight time is  hours from the UK and Abu Dhabi is  hours. Not enough in it to make any real difference. The reason I really liked Hungary  Budapest is because the city is so great. Good food good bars and a great fever from the fans. Theres lots of them too. Its also easy to get to the track. Milan is the same as is Monaco. I would also add in Barcelona in Spain as a worthy contender for your attention. Austria is good but.... its all a bit local yocal. Its hard to find somewhere to stay and its a bit more of a bus trip which is fine if youre into that sort of thing.While youre thinking about it take a look at my photo essay from Hungary last year.

This is because when you crash a kart you usually get thrown out and along the ground just like a motorcycle rider.Of course there are nasty accidents but they are few and far between. People driving these things tend to be older than your standard  year old karter who just throw caution to the wind and YOLO overtakes. People tend to understand these things are insane and crashing at mph is not what you want happening.But then this is motorsport.

For me its a bit amusing because people who try F cars in sims tend to think theyre broken or something is wrong I hear this all the time in iRacing and AC when the truth is theyre just so different than anything theyve ever driven before it makes them feel like amateurs. Brundle alludes to that point in part  of the video you posted when you first drive these types of cars you fight them so much you have no choice but to think its impossible to do what the top guys are doing in them.  Waiting on the throttle feels almost comical.  But theres a narrow sweet spot where the car goes from terrifying to glued.

Its not anyones fault that female drivers havent been as competitive. Even if its because theres very few of them you shouldnt go promoting them based on their gender. Lewis Hamilton didnt get into F because hes black he got to F because of his talent. Btw. Have you noticed how theres only  seats in f at the moment? That means that in f theres th of drivers who arent white which is way more than ..And finally. No one is being a jerk towards the . on something they cant controll. Theyre being jerks to people who get priviledges for something no one else can controll. No one said it isnt for them.

5435273,0,t1_cw6edh7,Thats an utter misrepresentation of the rules.  Between now and next season they can change  of the engine.  Last year Renault and Ferrari were able to change nearly  of the engine.That there are some restrictions in intrayear developments to help keep costs under control is debatable as to whether its working as intended or not but its a falsehood to suggest that changes cannot be made.Honda its true would have benefitted from being able to lay out their turbo and some ancillaries differently later in the season but I think most people severely underestimate how long it takes to make basic changes to an engine.  When it takes three and a half months to even receive a crank shaft after youve placed the order  let alone designed it received the first copy tested it on the dyno refined it tested it again and then placed your final order  the development cycle is an order of magnitude slower than with the chassis.Can you not see how worse it would be to fuck up in getting the basic formula of the engine wrong.  If I engines ended up having a basic advantage over a V for example and you had to start your engine project over from scratch.  Either costs would go through the roof or youd end up with baked in problems that teams would be unable to get out of unless you artificially limit the engines in some other way to try and bring balance to them.,formula1,cw6esna,8,t5_2qimj

He isnt saying dont show the human side or just make a joke he says other teams made a mockery out of themselves and the sport when they debased theirselfs to silly antics for a cheap laugh.I would agree that they are making a mockery of themselves and the sport if it was in the middle of a qualifying session or a race and they walk out into pit lane and start dancing but when it is their job to be there at the track and they cant go back to their hotel or to a bar until Charlie Whiting tells everyone to go home and they cant be doing their jobs anyway I see no harm in them having a little fun.The fans paid to see cars driving sure. But in the absence of that there is LITERALLY nothing going on. If I was in the grandstands waiting for Quali to begin something ANYTHING wouldve been better than seeing a bunch of engineers and mechanics falling asleep on folding chairs in the garage. It goes a long way as well to improving the likeability of a team to the fans.Sure Ferrari doesnt need the average joe shmo fan to like them when theyre selling exotic cars to rich people because at the end of the day theyre in the business of Formula  because they want to win. But so are all of the other teams and having seen them having their fun during a rainedout weekend does not make me think any less of them as professionals or make me think that theyre at all incompetent.Even Mercedes notably Nico Rosberg and Niki Lauda stepped out and kicked or threw in Laudas case a soccer ball around both to keep themselves entertained and the fans. And you know what? Mercedes has just won a second Constructors AND Drivers championship in a row. They can clearly be good at what they do and have a good time when theyre not working which goes a much longer way for looking good both to fans and potential business partners than Ferrari who despite significant improvements this year hasnt won a WDC or WCC since Kimis victory in  even though theyre the nononsense team.,formula1,cwf3z4b,6,t5_2qimj

So hes talking about this being a warmup lap his engineer doesnt want race control to know that otherwise they might get a penalty perhaps at least no reason to confuse them so he repeats that its a timed lap. I think Hulkenberg didnt get why he was emphasizing that so he kept repeating that its a warmup lap and engineer lost it a bit. Of course they might been deliberately trying to hold Bottas up.

Button can actually barely see but the Mclaren guys around him particularly the guy in front of him who was moving away from him and turned around and looked should have also seen that a Lotus car was on its way out.In either case if the Lotus guy is already waving his guy out then Mclaren should have held Button likewise as soon as Button pulled out a little he should have seen the Lotus guy and not accelerated as much he also expected the car to be faster pulling out IMHO so didnt feel the need to slow whereas had he been slower it wouldnt have been an issue.Ultimately two cars both left at around the same time one car had a fastereasier get away due to the position of the car shit happens.,formula1,cwyxgf3,-11,t5_2qimj

Its questionable if F should fulfill that role.gtYeah... that kind of idea is not worth two years of knowing which team is going to win every race.Well thats up for discussion. If you constantly change the regulations all you do is increase cost and have some kind of fluctuations. If the regulation changes are massive it will lead to one team being significantly faster than the other again see .gt the last two seasons have generally been predictable as hell.Especially  was a good season apart from Mercs dominance. There was so much going on in the midfield teams. FI being strong then Williams emerging.gt Also why exactly should I not expect parity? Is that not the point of the formula?There was never a significant change that didnt lead to a team emerging as a clear favorite. I have NEVER seen this ever. Look at Brawn GP what in the world was that?! You can expect smaller disparities the longer you keep to rules constant or the more standardization you implement.

He dominated the race with a  second gap to Nico and Seb and lost it in the final laps with a bad strategy call.No wonder he as pissed. I still think he was way over te top but still.

However because the season was so bad they needed to highlight and refer back to something which was interesting and slightly controversial i.e Verstappens activities on track. Alot of the media circus got on the bandwagon of  is this the new sennaschumacher?  Eddie Jordan.

This really does seem like a solid model capable of analysing driver performance purely and individually.But I cant help notice a few weird things the biggest of them being how you assumed the Marussias and the McHondas to be just as fast aka having the same predicted constructor scoring which in turn boosts Alonsos score for him to be yet again close to the top same thing goes for the  and  seasons in which the predicted scores for the Ferrari and Renault were far far below what they actually achieved.

That said Brundle is a fantastic commentator.NBC team is pretty good though I think.  Buxton and Matchett are really the best at what they do.  Hobbs has been around forever and is hilarious at times but perhaps lost without Varsha there to set him up anymore.

5960308,0,t3_3x0bq7,Ferrari is bigger than F. I dont say that as some of hand remark either Ferrari is the only sports team in the world that is more valuable than the series in which it competes. Further still Ferrari is often voted as one of if not the most influential brand in the world. So make no mistake people take Ferraris threats seriously for good reason.On top of this Ferrari doesnt need the exposure. Take Lamborghini for instance. They have no F program yet their cars are still highly sought after and heaped with prestige. Leaving F may shorten Ferraris waiting list but they are still going to be selling every car they make.

Coupled with the fact there have been several complains about Johnny  Herbert and Skys quality now seems the right time for them to at least consider him.

6210380,0,t1_cyv70cp,Young drivers are overrated constantly. Will Stevens was once the next Lewis Hamilton In Verstappens case however I think the hype is almost entirely justified. I have been watching motorsports for well over  years and its very rare to see something as impressive as Verstappens career to date. In fact Ive never seen anything quite like it.I watched his whole F season last year and was blown away by his immediate pace. Its highly unusual for drivers to step straight from karts to F and even when they have a karting record as strong as Verstappens they usually initially struggle. Verstappen looked phenomenal all season  his ability to hustle the car and create overtaking opportunities from nowhere was something Ive only seen from drivers who go on to succeed at the highest levels.Even after seeing that performance I was a complete skeptic regarding his F debut. No driver in history has ever debuted so young or with so few racing seasons under their belt. With so little testing available I did not expect great things. Realistically I thought we might see another Mike Thackwell. Obviously Verstappen was fortunate in having another rookie as a teammate but his composure relative to his experience was unprecedented and his racecraft was absolutely phenomenal. I think Verstappen has future world champion written all over him at the moment.,formula1,cyvjxeq,12,t5_2qimj

Bernies role in how F is run is a major debate point in an environment where were all discussing the sports future. The time to debate Bernies role and how he manages the sport is now. Especially while theres simultaneous discussion going on regarding his successor.Further to the point the teams dont actually get anywhere near a third of the actual revenue generated by F.  For starters Formula One Management gets  of TV revenues  goes to the teams and  to the FIA. FOM additionally receives all the fees paid by promoters. And thats just the tip of the iceberg. Ecclestone is the highest paid CEO in the world but he operates a business empire that makes nothing contributes nothing isnt a participant in the sport he manages etc...gt its that particular kind of wanton misinformation that causes people to think there are problems when there are no problemsYour definition of misinformation must be different than everyone elses.

While they struggled throwing countless setups on the cars Earnhardt and his crew rolled out a car put right side tires on the left side and viceversa. Giving vastly superior grip and also being illegal. They did a lap or two which of course was much faster than anyone else. They packed up and left leaving Roush Martin and the  crew scratching their heads and eventually going to such desperate measures as to buy a rival teams car for the race.Martin finished th and lost the championship.Edit Guess Sauber in the  preseason tests did some lowfuel runs to appear fast and possibly lure in some sponsors.,formula1,cywmn5f,22,t5_2qimj

Theres no way Webber would be able to compete if he didnt have self belief so by extension he has to believe that Vettel is something truly special. If you thought you were pretty good at your job never really meet anyone that could best you then watched someone do your exact job in exactly the same circumstances with the same equipment but consistently did it better than you especially when it mattered to the point where you couldnt even begin to match them youd probably think they were one of the best as well. ,formula1,czabmls,2,t5_2qimj

Want to play in the NBA? The only way that you will be competitive will be if you are honestly above . Minumum.

6645613,0,t1_d04p663,I always find it interesting to see the response this minimum driver weight controversy stirs up. When engineers spend years and years perfecting a rake angle of a winglet of a rear vision mirror thats ok but asking the drivers to be elite athletes is suddenly frowned upon. Jockeys swimmers riders runnersthey all have physical limitations that either help or hinder their performance so the same should work for formula  drivers.                     Take Dan we know hes  hes .m tall and wants to weigh around  kgs.           His BMI is calculated as  within healthy weight And yea he probably needs a lot of muscle to withstand G forces. Like tour de france riders getting themselves up the alps. Take Cadel Evans  stocky aussie rider his height is .m and weight is kgs BMI  ..            His body fat percentage is calculated using Deurenberg et al.  Adult Body Fat   . x BMI  . x Age  . x gender  . using gender male  female . to be .. There is a bit of a peer review of this relation to be found here that corrects this figure to a range of . As an aside  take any professional athletes and youll find their body fat to stay around .             The whole BMI isnt accurate because of weight lifters thing is bs when you take out the plebeian population using it. Consider the similarities that many professional sports have such as cycling and f they both require endurance strength and low weight. Tbh I look forward to formula  driver requirements being heightened into the standard that other modern elite sports are already at.

The engine is still not at its full  capacity so we have a lot of performance still in the package. There is a lot of mapping and things which we can improve notes Boullier.Qualifying mode from the enginegt Honda has an aggressive engine mode for qualifying which was one of the key defining features of the Mercedes last season in the final stages of Qualifying . Its an area where Ferrari has been working hard. These maps can provide up to hp more than standard qualifying mode for short periods but Honda is a little way off being able to maximise it. The mapping on these engines is amazing he says. You can play with the knock and get dramatic effects.Not getting super excited This probably means MercFerrari engines can deliver bhp boost in qualifying mode and this is something Honda can exploit as season progresses. And it seems data from CFD correlates to the data from testinggt The numbers we have at the track now are the numbers we had in the computer this winter. So Fernando knows what we are doing as does Jenson. They know that when we promise we do what we say.

Sainz needed  laps or something like that Max just  corners...Do you know anything about racing at all? Are you being blind on purpose?

7112644,0,t1_d1mlv5g,gtYoure free to have your opinion but you need to concede that its misinformed and well built off of incorrect information. This is part of why motorsports fans tend to dislike people who only watch Formula .I think its quite a ridiculous point of view to say If you dont like oval racing youre misinformed and only follow Formula . Ive always followed nearly all forms of motorsport Indycar being one of them and Ive seen plenty of oval races to understand why I find them extremely dull.gtThis happens in oval racing too.Find me a footage of an indycar race were cars decelerate from speeds like kmh to say  kmh go side by side into a tight corner only for through the next corner sequence the other car to have the inside line with the initial driver having to hold it around the outside at high speeds with them then moving into another tight corner complex. It doesnt happen. On ovals most passing is done at incredibly high speeds  kmh with just driving around either the outside of the inside. There is no major deceleration or tight corners. Even the smaller ovals still rarely go much below kmh. The driver who has the inside will always by the laws of physics on an oval have the inside at the next corner and the corner after that.  ,formula1,d1mlza7,-7,t5_2qimj

Give him a car capable and youll see what hes capable of.    I also find it interesting that Herbert says nothing of Button except that hes done a better job. In a year when Alonso was new to the team and still managed their highest points finish and had more unreliability iirc could be wrong and took part in  fewer race than Jenson.

7117852,0,t3_4d2lht,While yes technically it doesnt matter when is the most of the action concentrated it is more climactic to finish under the chequered flag and having no cars out for the last  minutes of the session just looks bad on TV and for the spectators at the track. You mentioned less laps.. while yes it may not matter as much on TV there are tens of thousands of people at track in grandstands watching empty track for the most part which is terrible. And lastly with this elimination qualifying you watch the clock more than the actual laps happening on the track. You constantly have to check the countdown does he have enough time to finish the lap or he went out too late. But I think the main point of everyone that dislikes this qualifying is actually this post. You have to defend it you have to try and find some positives whereas with the previous one nobody complained everyone knew what was going on and the fastest drivers just battled it out right up to the chequered flag. Maybe it could be better with some tweaks for example minimum fuel limit so they can run one hot lap after another with just quick tyre changes inbetween but lets test it in GP or GP or wherever.

7187355,0,t3_4dvwj3,I only know from what I know in amateur racing and also working with one of the car clubs that we were investigating in purchasing a road course race track. Somemost of the amateur racers had car insurance for firetheftvandalism saloon type race cars and jr. formula type cars. So when the car was sitting or being transported it had insurance on it. But once the cars were on race track there was zero insurance on the cars and from what I was told there was none available. I did some amateur saloon type racing and my car had no insurance on the track but did have sittingtransport insurance for firetheftvandalism. It was expensive for what it covered. The car club held insurance for the amateur races that it put on. It was mainly liability insurance to cover if someone got hit by a car or if there was damage to the venue that we were responsible for. If a car hit damaged a barrier or catch fence it would pay to fix the barrier or fence but not the car. There was a large deductible with the insurance and only once in  years that I was there was the damage to the venue enough to be able to claim any insurance on it. The race track had liability insurance to cover if someone in the crowd or a track employee getting hurt. Anyone that was a driver or team member or team guest and in the pits was not covered by insurance and had to sign a waver. The track liability insurance spelled out what events were covered under it and basically it was just for amateur racing with under X amount of spectators. If the track hosted a professional race series event then the track needed to get special insurance for that event. A insurance person would come out and do a walk around the track discuss concerns track speed where spectators could or couldnt be etc etc. They also specified that the cars had to be in good working order with no defects etc etc etc. I think this is where the USGP with the Michelin tire blow out problem probably had their biggest issue. Track liability insurance would have had a shit over that and probably denied any claim against them based on teams knowingly putting unsafe tires on cars and racing them. Obviously I dont know exactly what F does or does not have insurance for but Id be extremely surprised if the cars had any insurance on them to cover crash damage. There is an old joke in car racing... If you want to make a small fortune racing car start with a large fortune. ,formula1,d1v52it,1,t5_2qimj

What the model does not account for is that Schumacher was likely well past his best at that stage. Excluding those years would probably put Rosberg around tier .The methodology used to produce the other list is not totally clear to me but from what I have been able to surmise it uses average laptime based comparisons of drivers to estimate performance. Im not sure whether this accounted for agerelated decline of Schumacher I would guess not and timebased comparisons can run into myriad problems if the analysis is not very carefully designed e.g. drivers who are leading choosing to coast traffic safety cars etc..,formula1,d1v7czi,2,t5_2qimj

7198805,0,t1_d1wffsh,From wikipediagtbecause aerodynamic forces increase with the square of velocity downforce increases with the square of the cars speed and requires a certain minimum speed in order to produce a significant effect. But some cars have had rather unstable aerodynamics such that a minor change in angle of attack or height of the vehicle can cause large changes in the downforce. Angle of attack of the wing has a lot to do with how much downforce or lift it can create at various speeds.

7231402,0,t3_4eggnd,I think there comes a time when a sport loses it raw enthusiasm. This tends to be when it is elevated to a high profile privileged event. Put it this way. Fs decline can probably be mapped precisely as the inverse of Fs gradual move into pay to watch television. In the past and for many a fan a year outlay on the sport would be to go to the national GP. Otherwise the sport was there on the telly to watch year round. But gradually Sky and the like have bought their way into the TV rights and hyped it up to attract more viewers. In one move enjoyment of the sport now costs many times more than saving for that ticket to the years home GP. F used to be made up of three crucial elements Racing. Just racing. Dont be surprised. Just a bunch of teams you could follow the fortunes of each time out.  Quality public broadcasting. Some cameras around the circuit. Enough of them to cut between them especially when two driver were at each others heels like terriers.  Murray Walker. A person neednt actually enthuse about F to turn it on to be entertained. If you wanted to know what was exciting to a true fan of F you just switched on to be engulfed by Murrays limitless excitement and enthusiasm. The sport wonders where it is going wrong. Its simple. Its become  TV grandeur information overload and an elitist global event and bloated far beyond a two hour racing car event per fortnight. People have to pay for the channel in order to see full races then feel the need to justify the cost of the channel and people are just getting bored of the constant immersion and wandering off to do something else.,formula1,d205o5k,51,t5_2qimj

7239200,0,t3_4ekmfp,It would be very unwise for Redbull to let him go. Not only is he fast and aggresive he is making headlines almost every race now and given a lot of TV time. Some bad headlines but mostly good. He is a popular topic among F fans and journalist. He kind of embodies youth in F. Bernie said Max has been good not only on the track but also outside the track for F. Marketing wise he is a better posterboy holding the Redbull can than Kvyat and Sainz who are also fast drivers in their own right but lose out on this hype. That aside his learning curve and consistent point scoring on top of his aggresive attacking style of driving makes him wanted by others. Nowadays youd fully expect him to be in the points and even a th place at Bahrain was not as much as a big deal as it would have been a year ago. The STR also helps him but still he has to deliver. Where we can only judge him from his driving and his results we have no insight on his datatelemetry that the team does. Ferrari will also have his telemetry this year. With this the teams are better at judging his real driving skills compared to others. I fully expect to see him in Redbull next year unless he underperforms the rest of the season. ,formula1,d211lsd,4,t5_2qimj

7274528,0,t3_4f1535,The cars have a titanium plate on the bottom to deliberately create the sparks.I see no problem with the flags and safety cars. In Australia imagine if another car had a failure or the driver made a mistake and flew in to the gravel trap where two cars two drivers and numerous marshals were dealing with the accident. It was absolutely the right thing to do.A car stranded on the side of the track like Hulkenbergs is an automatic yellow flag  partly for the safety of the drivers both those on track and the driver of the stranded car and for the marshals that then need to recover the stranded car. In this case the red flag was warranted because the car was so close to the edge of the track.Watch this. Morbidelli has already crashed. Brundle in the Mclaren aquaplanes in the same place goes off hits a marshal breaking his leg. If you want any more proof just have a think about Suzuka .

7406434,0,t3_4gq95p, This is the part  from the FWB that they are talking about. It had a set of bargeboards coming from the front wing that extended through under the suspension. That was banned when that area was made an exclusion zone. Honestly i dont think it would have made a difference and it looked like Pat didnt think so either.But really its not surprising the heavily regulated F cars of today are so sensitive to wake from other cars. The teams are only allowed to work on specific sections or virtual boxes in the cars to help you visualize what i mean.  So in those small sections they go crazy with complexity to produce as much downforce as they can and like Pat said not just there but how it shapes the overall air flow... for example using the front wing airflow to improve diffuser performance at the rear of the car.Now if F was regulated much less the cars would look more like this Red Bull F concept  thats the standard version without a fan  but bigger wigns. As you can see instead of having a small area in the front wing with a bunch of drag inducing elements and high angles of attack they have big simple wings and other elements with low angles to produce nice and slippery downforce with low drag. I have no doubt this concept F car would be less affected by wake.,formula1,d2k2a8y,11,t5_2qimj

The other manufacturers who have deep pockets unlike independent teams feel they can catch up if they are no longer restricted in the changes they can make. They believe the above scenario have seen it happen before and trust their engineers. Now given that there is not unlimited testing and there is a limit on the number of power units you can use per season this wont work perfectly.

Both drivers made several mistakes during the season and had room to improve on that front.I can agree with that.

If they make it down to their feet which are moving then theyll get scrunched up. A couple or more scrunched up tear offs under the pedals could well have an effect. I seem to remember one of the drivers saying the throttle pedal only moves about mm Brundle I think and a scrunched up tear off could easily be a couple of mm thick. A couple of scrunched up tear offs under the pedal and youve lost  of the travel. I dont think the brake pedal travel is much different. How likely is this? Well how often is it acceptable for this to happen? We have  races a season each with  cars. Each driver might pull off an average of three or four a race maybe another five or six during the other sessions. So over the course of a season youve got over  times that a tear off is put in the cockpit. And youre saying that theres no way you can imagine that one time in  one of these tear offs could make its way under a pedal or between the drivers foot and the pedal making their foot slide off?There Ive given you more than just it might be bad I dunno.

7492682,0,t1_d2tkf1d,If this is true what are your thoughts on why they decided to keep Kvyat on for ? To only give a driver  races to prove his pace in a season is a little ridiculous to me. For example the car setup might not be quite to Kvyats liking at the moment. Also I cant help but feel its a little more than opportunism from RBR and more Helmut Marko acting impulsively in the heat of the moment. I always thought he seemed like a cutthroat businessman and this whole furore only supports that idea.I also greatly dislike the idea that RBR havent treated Kvyat with any ounce of respect. The move by Red Bull could potentially be careerending for him. For that reason I really hope Kvyat smashes it at STR but I worry his confidence is going to take a massive hit from this.,formula1,d2tvlhn,1,t5_2qimj

Imo the angel at with which Lewis was approaching the gap was to aggressive. He had to steer to the left quite massively twice after going for the gap. When you watch the video frame by frame you see that even after Hamilton steered to the left for the first time his car still went to the right. The camera angel makes it hard to tell the exact point at which Hamilton is no longer behind Rosberg the rules say something about front wing being on the same level as the rear of the other car as far as I know. I think he was still behind Rosberg after steering to the left for the first time. There is still a closing gap to go for it he has to let the car go even further to the right. Then he reached the point of no return at about the same time he stopped being behind Rosberg he steers to the left for the second time but its to late. Id say it was a hard move by Rosberg but Hamiltons move was too risky.Another point. What if they avoided the collision somehow.

He was slower than Hamilton throughout the turn as he wasnt on the optimal line and had to slow rds into the corner to get back on a better line before putting the power down.It seems absurd to me that everyone focuses on the power mode when he was in that mode during a corner and no where near full throttle at the time and he needed to slow because of how he took the corner.,formula1,d37m6uh,-2,t5_2qimj

Their rear wing is visibly skinnier than front runners  McLaren has made it clear that they cant run optimal downforce and setup that they want because of engine being underpowered. They were losing .. just in sector  in Spain. I dont think anyone will deny that they have to run lower downforce setups because of that underpowered engine which is still worst on the grid  more so than ferraris  PU .Also in slow turns the aero and downforce dont matter as much as the actual mechanical grip and thats why  I think that the McLaren is a very good car hindered heavily by Honda.

Might be okay as long as youve got a single wheel on the track. Leaving the track entirely that is having your left wheels on the inside of the yellow bit in the chicane youre referring to is corner cutting and will get you a penalty especially if you passed another car while doing it. If youre by yourself youre only going to get penalized if youre doing it constantly.EDIT And a chicane is simply an artificially created corner designed to slow cars down so its not specific for Monaco thatits called the cicane,formula1,d3nz0oz,1,t5_2qimj

Due to his arrogant flashy persona Hamilton is my least favourite personality in the sport. I like Ricciardo. Hamilton did cut the corner but the fact Ricciardo managed to gain on him enough to make a move shows that Hamilton gained no time. Also Hamilton did leave space for Ricciardo there are plenty of angles showing this. Hamilton probably only won because of DRs terrible pit stop but equally on the track Hamilton won fair and square and defended fantastically.

7769362,0,t1_d3oqow8,Just googled it and its far from cheap . There is an entrance fee of  per car and  per driver . Even if there are  drivers and divide everything per person that is  of the car  to  plus  entry that is  per person excluding the price of the car. And that is for a one time  hour experience . Assuming that you always drive  hours you need  for the equivalent of  hours of training experience which is freaking pricy . In comparision the only need to play football is a pair of shoes  you get can for as little as  new or get a better pair of used ones for the same price or less  and a  for a ball which you can buy with friends and start playing.  If you want  you go in football training even for free at a lot of places and if you do that you dont even probably need a ball . You can start as early as  go to training for free around  times per week for  hour . That is  hours per month and  hours per year not counting hours you could spend just casually playing with friends on the park  for the price of  football shoes  which you will need to change every year considering  that you will get bigger. Also as you age training frequency and duration will increase which gives even more training time per year . In contrast to get in this race you need a min of  just for the entry not counting safety gear and price of the car ect  also you need to have a driving license which means you have to be   by the time you are  people who have been go carting since young regularly may very well have thousands of hours of experience more than you which practically gives you a small chance of competing . Also this can be a one time thing when the race is near you  if you want to try more than once you would provably need to travel which will push the cost even further  that is assuming that you dont have a job to worry about so you can travel . This is pricy as hell and by the time you are  and can do it you will probably be too late to start driving proffesionally and will never get the required experience to be good . Unless you are sone kind of exceptional talent . Imho the only way to train driving remains go karting and i just did a search  the closest place near me needs  euro for  hours for kids which is even higher for older ages . Practically to get the same  hours of training that a kid gets for  a year in football you need to spend  which is    times higher .,formula1,d3pbbox,1,t5_2qimj

Simple  Dont fast or  Dont participate. Two very simple and effective solutions.

Spa and Hungary are awesome for views they are set in natural bowls and hills. General admission is suffice for those two. Milan to Monza is a train and coach ride followed by an hours walk through the park. Its a  hour round trip each day. The race is usually quite processional. General admission areas are packed on quali and race days  unless you are willing to stand in the middle of the straight. Also the track is flat so you dont get an good views and from any one part of the track you can only see a small bit. There are parts of Spa Spain and Hungary were you can see  to  of the track. It is expensive Hungary we spent half the amount in the weekend and it was much much better.  minute ride to track from a very vibrant cheap city.

In races the mean difference . and the median is ..Spa is indeed the track where LMP is closest to F and even then they would fail to qualify if the  rule was applied to the pole lap although in reality it is applied to Q only and LMP gets within  of that at every track. Although LMP were closer in the Silverstone race than at Spa the second half of it was wet for F meaning the fastest lap was set in the early stages where the cars were still heavy with fuel. So that figure is kind of unrepresentative.  F cars are significantly faster than  . faster in qualifying and . faster in races so far whilst  LMP is slightly slower than  so far Im not sure why I dont follow it.

Intermediate  is at the end of sector  which is the end of the Kemmel straight. This means that the maximum speed intermediate  gives you the top speed on the Kemmel straight. There is not much point in putting the speed trap on the startfinish straight and the Kemmel straight is already covered by the intermediate  measurement so putting it on top of Raidillon does make sense.

8026232,0,t1_d4hlr5v,For me and Im not per se a red bull fan here are some things that I really appreciate  They have some of the best engineers and engineering in the sport.  Their ability to create an aero package has been amazing for nearly their whole time in the sport.  They are really committed to their young driver stable.  They start early and promote from within.  It took them a few years to build up the young driver talent but now that they have it and basically since Seb was promoted from STR they dont go shopping in the open market.  They are trying to make the sport better overall by doing some free development on things like lower profile tires an alternative to the halo thing and lots of media  fan events  letting Tom Cruise drive their car.Things I dont like  Theyre very good at getting right to the edge of the regulations and maybe a milometer over the rules.  All the teams do this but RBR is the king of finding loopholes in regulations.  But as soon as something doesnt go their way Horner is complaining about other teams finding race pace by bending the rules or throwing their engine supplier under the bus.  It strikes me as whining.  If you think the Renaut engine sucks build your own.  ,formula1,d4i82dt,3,t5_2qimj

Ferrari claim they use  of the same ingredients as the Shell VPower you can get at any gas station. So competition wise it makes a huge difference but if you would actually own a F car to drive around at your own leisure you could probably put regular gas in it without any big difference since your skill driving the thing would be the biggest factor of speed loss while the fuel would be neglible.,formula1,d4j43rm,2,t5_2qimj

And it turned sour because of a mix of misjudging Hamiltons response hence the surprise and the loss of his brakes. I think his punishment is fair.

I really respect Sabine for her driving skills and she is technically proficient addition to the team but her on screen personality is too dry that might be due to the language barrier.  Bring her in for special races or challenges but leave her home for the on stage bits.  Chris Evans I couldnt stand him from the first episode of what appeared to be a drunk overgrown pixie dancing around and yelling.Chris Harris is too nice I do enjoy his reviews because I like me some sideways driving.  But come on not every car you drive is perfect.  Pick them apart a little and tell us what is wrong with them.  Most of us will never get to drive one but at least we can niggle of the imperfections.  Matt Leblanc give us some life something he has been too deadpan for me to enjoy.  Give us some Joey.  Rory is the only guy who I think does a great job at this point.  Eddie Jordan is a great character but not a great supporting character.

The buildup of rubber is where the inside right tyre goes which regularly locks up and causes the build up. This is also why the inside has a far larger amount of rubber as they lock up more often due to the wheel being less loaded.Posted this earlier which is the line the drivers take for as far as I could find shots of it.,formula1,d4z3zwf,5,t5_2qimj

Although Gut has outqualified Gro on  occasions the only time he has seemed to have a genuine pace advantage in the race was Monaco although even that was blurred due to the weather.  In Spain Grosjeans front wing began to fail before Gut passed him and in Canada his front wing failed again prompting an additional pit stop while he was again ahead of Gut.

8210726,0,t1_d52gjno,The story and rumours are just that. There have been no stories regarding lawyers that is entirely internet chatterThe original story came from an Austrian tv show where Niki claimed that Hamilton had trashed his room after Baku qualifying and that the story of Lewis and Nico being on friendly terms were lies from Hamilton. It seems he was using hyperbole to explain the team mate situation and what Hamilton did after Baku qualifying. He claims he was misunderstood by people who misrepresented what he was saying in the informal interview. I think only a native German speaker fluent in English and someone who knows Nikis character can only truly explain what he meant. It seems the nuances and inside nature of Nikis role were lost in translation. Some would say he was just exaggerating small truths to make it seem more spectacular or selfaggrandising his position as a weary boss of two reckless employees. The fact that he and Mercedes released a statement not retracting but refuting the comment attributed to him means that he did not want them to be construed in the way they were.Lauda is either an old dickhead or a great F insider depending on what he says. He gives no fucks and will say anything he pleases regardless of who it pisses off or if he is even right or wrong. He routinely clarifies what he meant after it has been reported because he knows how much gets twisted or just misunderstood.If he were to leave Mercedes it would mean very little he is a nonexecutive chairman. He observes and reports to the Mercedes board but has no executive power only advisory. I f they can survive Ross Brawn leaving theyll do fine without Niki too.,formula1,d53w9c9,1,t5_2qimj

8233229,0,t3_4s5763,How much is the tendency to do SC restarts in wet conditions down to the Bianchi familys lawsuit? I really think that FIA are under pressure to show that they do everything to ensure driver safety in wet conditions so theyre defending themselves if the family claim negligence. Its such a sorry state of affairs. I was so hyped and excited for this race but Ive never had that turn into anger so quickly. Its no wonder F is losing fans by the droves. The drivers are supposed to be seen as superheroes and amaze us. SC starts completely mitigates this theres no drama or skill and most casuals or new fans are saying well so what?. Charlie Whiting needs to come out and tell us exactly why theyre doing this and address the fans because its quite frankly robbing us of great racing and most importantly losing potential new fans. ,formula1,d56pjtv,6,t5_2qimj

8248032,0,t1_d58hzgb,Thanks for the feedback and apologies for not being clear enough.  I was just trying to make a point that IMHO the whole radio driver coaching argument is a bit weak because giving advices to a driver doesnt mean that he will be able to convert it to laptime or any other kind of advantage. That is why I tried to pick up an anecdote when a professional driver wasnt afraid of giving out his onboard camera for the benefit of his competitiors because he was convinced that even if the others see what and how he does they wont be able to copy it. There is a difference between knowing how to drive and to actually make it happen.Of course in F every driver is way better than that but it doesnt eliminate the differences just probably make them smaller. Hope this time I manage to add value to the discussion. ,formula1,d58k5rc,7,t5_2qimj

Everytime I see someone from Ferrari talking about how their competition is still Mercedes Im like no Ferrari... just no. I think Ferrari keeps fucking themselves. They gave Aldo Costa the boot three or four years ago and now cars designed by him have gone on to win two presumably going to be three championship doubles. Granted Mercedes had invested over half a billion dollars into the development of the PU and everyone else is still at a disadvantage in that department but by all accounts not even the Ferrari chassis has been class leading for years. Most pundits seem to think that next year is going to be another disappointment for Ferrari as the rules change to favor aerodynamic superiority even more.

Must say though I was only a small child then so my information comes from the history books not memory.gtWhat about the ferrari car  when schumacher was winning a lot? The big advantage that the  Ferrari had was reliability Schumacher was the only driver to finish every race. The majority of the drivers retired from half to three quarters of the races that year. McLaren had a fast car that year unfortunately it wasnt particularly mechanically sound. If all the cars were reliable that year then the championship would have been a lot closer. They werent however so Ferrari won that year not to take away from Ferrari that year they managed to build a car that combined speed with reliability.gtIts interesting that in  every single race has been won by a mercedes except when they both crashed each other out and rosbergs and hamiltons GP wins dont seem very remarkable because of how good their car is.Its not particularly unusual to have one team win a majority of races it just tends to change each time the regulations change.,formula1,d64900l,1,t5_2qimj

Basically anyone with a job of some variety can afford to race in it.You will notice as experience goes up so generally does performance. However there is a caveat. Take  different simracers say each has competed in  races with no real prior experience there will be a fairly drastic ability difference between them. However the interesting question would be how much could that difference be flattened if they all had access to top level coaching and training especially in their formative period. Max has top level racers in his family and there does seem to be significant carry over. Motorsports is weird like that because everyone has different hardware its extremely difficult to get a read on who is performing and even then the barrier to entry is so high you assume that if everyone in the world had a chance there would be drivers significantly better than anyone we have today.,formula1,d68tqqk,2,t5_2qimj

8553176,1,t1_d6ao1uk,gt DOTD isnt really a good measurement to use when rating drivers. DOTD is mostly a popularity contest about who had the best race besides the race winner in most cases. And having  times the best race according to a seizable part of the public doesnt tell anything?gt When rating drivers you have to try to rate them based on raw individual skill not machinery.A decent part of the public of course realizes there were a few races where Verstappen outpaced faster cars including his own teammate and he held on to extra points in races not everyone is blinded by favouritism of other drivers.gt In my mind I see Max as a great driver with his racecraft but he still lacks the one lap pace that Ricciardo has along with his racecraft.Max had a lot of bad luck in qualifying lately but that doesnt equal to him being bad at it. However if the end result on Sunday is the maximum what a driver could do despite not having a good qualifying result how important is qualifying really?...could Verstappen have done any better in Spain Canada Austria Silverstone and Germany?...Baku yes his race pace indicated he could have ended th at Hungary he might have gotten a better result too at Monaco of course also but such a circuit came a bit too soon for when a driver isnt  comfortable yet with a car too difficult to correct anything...and how has worked all those times qualifying better for Ricciardo?...just as good as they have worked for Rosberg.gt Max is a great driver but its too early to rate him above the proven results of Alonso and Ricciardo.Its difficult to tell how fast Alonso really is relative to Verstappen however we do know Verstappen was faster as Ricciardo in the second half of the race in Baku Austria and in Silverstone wet and dry. The other races where Ricciardo and Verstappen have been teammates its too difficult to tell if one or the other was faster because of strategy and traffic.All that counts is the end result when the finish flag drops on Sundays because thats how you get points and Max is actually really good in getting the best possible result given the cards hes dealt even more so as a lot of other drivers.,formula1,d6apygy,0,t5_2qimj
8554616,0,t1_d6amizr,They were but if Im doing the maths right...  If all  laps are comparatively  seconds faster than the same lap from this year it about works out. Remember all were talking about is a  minute difference between  and     and itll probably be closer to about  . minutes after this year.    Four seconds every lap over  laps is about . minutes. Starts to get petty close. All depends how much the slight bit of extra fuel and the extra drag will affect next years cars.      ...if Im doing the maths right.    Now if you were to have  spec cars with refueling... those would be some crazily fast machines. The lap times you could get would probably blow  right out of the water.

What is the connection between FOM prize money and using your own team to promote yourself?Lets see if I can explain why they havent signed the FOM contract.. They will recieve money for this season if they finish in the top ten of constructors but they have to execute the contract first.  Further payments are contingent on starting for two years.. For Haas to race next year they have to pay the  million entry fee plus around  per point scored in the previous year per the contract.. If Haas were to not score any points this year they would execute the contract next year and would still be eligible to receive their legacy payment in their third year.  .If they had points but didnt finish in the top ten Gene would still have to fork over the  million to go racing but would not have to pay the money per point dollars.  He would then execute the contract..If they stay in the top ten as they are now it is likely the award would cover the  million he spent last year and the entry fee for next year.  Maybe a little left over to give Ferrari.  So no matter what Haas will sign the contract when it benefits them.  Its just good business and Bernie understands this. ,formula1,d6joq1m,3,t5_2qimj

Tell me if i got this right so when Raikkonen overtakes and even if only barely touches all is fine but when he overtakes Verstappen and he defends and there is no contact at all there is blame because there couldve been contact? How the hell do you come up with that logic?gtI agree on that one. Perez just pushed him too far off track for my liking. But the stewards were sleeping today in general it seemed. It was right on theBut you must agree with me that if they dont penalize both its simply allowed and people need to get their feelings in check?gtThat was because of another abnormal change of direction. Had Max taken the corner as he normally would there would have been no contact. But it was right on the limit Ive always maintained because there was a corner there.

Maxs moves this race were dangerous and Allen is ignoring this fact for well I cannot figure out why hes ignoring just how dangerous Max was this race. First corner not so much but everything beyond that was stupid and dangerous and we should rely on journalists to call out the facts not to try to hedge their bets to not upset some fans.gtHes young and hell learn from these experiences. Just give him time to get past his teenage rebellion phase.Hows he gonna learn from these experiences if he does them but then gets no punishment?  You cant learn from a mistake if no real authority figures actually tell you its a mistake. And this is Maxs second year in F. And this is like the th time hes done dangerous moves like this just this season alone... hes not going to learn unless the FIA comes down hard on him but given his massive fanbase I doubt thatll ever happen. ,formula1,d719nr2,5,t5_2qimj

And you need to think about next year I agree that what would make the more sens is to fire Massa and take a youngster the problem is that next year car will be totally different and a guy with experience and tire management like Button is the guy you want really on a middle field team like Williams. His experience will be unvaluable I believe. Off course this is only my opinions. I do like Massa hes a cool driver that dont seems to take himself too seriously which is awesome I think.

8856150,0,t1_d7bvorw,gtHowever traction and launch control can massively improve acceleration too as would a more automated gear box that could always shift at the perfect moment but both are banned.I think youre trying to think that a more automated transmission would result in better traction.  It might to a point by programming something in the TCU to change torque delivery but I dont understand how a transmission can directly give better traction.  Are we considering that the differentials as part of the transmission?gtAre semi automatics the best of both worlds and a perfect half way house between automation and manual control? Maybe Im being too specific here but the seamless shifting semiautomatic transmission is the fastest now with most benefits now or are we assuming that semiautomatic  seamless.  Nonseamless semiautomatics like in the Ferrari  were fast at the time but still needed a  millisecond to shift.  That means during those  milliseconds car was not powered and slowed down by downforce.  Seamless shifting transmissions used now shifts in I think within  milliseconds.  There isnt much information around this.  Ive heard or may have read it somewhere on the internet... so it must be true s it doesnt shifts via forks but some kind of cam like control rods inside the countershaft that actuates swingable pawls and locks itself on the countershaft when the gear is selected.  I would LOVE to learn more about it.  Next currently available technology that might be viable for a true zero shift is probably CVT... but thats banned.  ,formula1,d7cdu2j,1,t5_2qimj

Red Bull traced the cause of the fault to an electrical surge in the gearbox control system although they couldnt explain what caused the surge. The Toro Rosso of Sebastian Buemi suffered a similar fate in free practice. In   cars inexplicably went into neutral during the race.The exact cause isnt certain but the most popular theory is that its caused by the Singapore MRT lines which run under the track in the area of Turn  the end of the Anderson Bridge and turns . Either theres a direct magnetic interference when a train passes or theres a residual static charge after a train passes depending on which version of the theory you read.

Just start watching races and dont forget the pre and post race coverage. Thats always a lot of fun if you want to learn more about the technical and strategy aspects of the sport. And you get familiar with the drivers as well. Its not mandatory to like a certain team or driver but to be honest if you watch this sport long enough youre gonna get sucked into the politics of it. Which can be fun but sometimes it can be frustrating as well. Like any sport I guess. But thats what makes it kinda complex for new viewers. Also try and watch the qualifying on saturdays. That way you know whos on pole the next day and you get a rough grasp of what the pace is gonna be for the race. I dont know if youre familiar with KERS and DRS. If not you can read up on it on the internet. Or ask us. Hope you enjoy the pinnacle of motor racing!

8962321,0,t1_d7p2xf7,For a F car to work right it needs to be moving fast very fast. So to drive a F car effectively you need to drive in a way that in any other car would be considered dangerous and possibly suicidal this was especially so in the old V era.What do I mean? Well in order to make a corner you need downforce and grip as well as effective brakes to slow you down to make that corner. Here is the catch though downforce only comes when there is fast enough air going over the wings grip only comes about if you are driving fast enough to heat up the tires to their optimum temperature. Lastly F brakes only work well above a certain temperature and if you are not driving fast enough before the braking you wont be able to put enough energy into the brakes to where they hit that optimum temperature.In short for an F car to be driven effectively you need to be pushing it to its speed limit at ALL times then when you approach a corner you need to hit the brakes at the last possible moment beyond what you might think is possible and hope that there was enough air speed and energy in the tires and brakes to take you around it safely. If you go too slow you will spin out and possibly even crash this is why it is so damn scary. PS. In the old V era drivers basically had their foot all the way down on the accelerator on every straight as the torque in the engines was more linear. You cant do that with the current cars because they have way way more torque on the lower end so when you are now accelerating out of a corner they have to play with the accelerator whereas in the past they just slammed it the moment they came out of a corner. ,formula1,d7p4wrk,9,t5_2qimj

And I think its for the best.From this site  I recommend reading the whole thing it sets up an amazingly tragic logistical nightmare that goes far beyond the death at the track. But this is the relevant partgtThere was only one photographer at Tamburello that afternoon. Angelo Orsi a close friend of Sennas and the picture editor of Autosprint the Italian racing magazine leapt over the wall when the car came to rest and started snapping. He took closeups of Senna in the car and after his helmet was removed and then when he was being treated on the ground before marshals blocked his view. Galvao Bueno was watching Orsi on television and said He aimed and shot without even seeing exactly what he was getting.gtAround midnight Angelo Orsi was back in the developing room at his office. The pictures were not pleasant. He was doubtful any magazine would publish them. Representatives of the Senna family told him immediately they that did not want anyone to even see them. Orsi respected their wishes. The pictures have never been seen except by the family and Sennas girlfriend Adriane. Today they are believed to be still in a safe in the Autosprint offices. Both the magazine and Orsi have turned down significant offers believed to be well over US for the rights to them.,formula1,d7w45qe,1,t5_2qimj

Just the shape of the tires had them going be to square  in relative terms. No mention of the kinematic qualities read differences between them. Of course there are other reasons but to me the change in tires stretched their resources further than they had expected.

9075859,0,t1_d82er1s,I dont remember the car but the track was Silverstone. Of course within those  years were long stretches of not playing.The main thing I keep in mind when playing with setup is that youre adjusting how weight is transferred through the car. More weightmore grip.So for example if youre getting understeer on corner exit that means too much weight is being transferred to the rear wheels under acceleration. Stiffening the rear springs or dampers will prevent the rear end from squatting so much and keep more weight on the front tires helping the car turn. Alternatively you could stiffen front rebound also known as bump so the front dampers will resist the rearward weight transfer.The inverse is true if youre getting corner exit oversteer or you might just have a lead foot. The first thing you should start playing with are the antiroll bars. Very generally softermore grip. Car understeers? Soften the front ARB or stiffen the rear. A lot of tuning can be done with just the ARBs but they can also help guide setup. If softening one ends ARBs works set them back to their original position and install softer springs or increase compression damping. But always keep in mind that what youre doing is adjusting how much weight transfers from one wheel to the others.,formula1,d82rrmp,2,t5_2qimj

9184325,0,t1_d8fzh49,Its debatable. All about perspective I guess.For Rosberg to be the favourite he needs to convincingly extend that  point lead in the next few races to put Hamilton away by the final race. Inversely  All Hamilton needs to do is close that gap to within  or  points and then win the final race to claim the title  assuming he finishes with more wins than Rosberg of course. Plus in  race Hamilton would take the lead if Rosberg has a DNF.  Personally I think your viewpoint isnt giving Hamilton enough credit.  He turned the tables easily earlier in the season swinging the championship  points a  point deficit to a  point lead in  or  races. He then had  consecutive races with issues that has put him  points behind.  Engine penalties in Spa inconsistent clutch in Monza hydraulics and suspension issues in Singapore practice that clearly derailed his weekend and then the engine blowout in the last race.Give him a car that works for the next  races and Hamilton is the favourite.  Give him more reliability issues while again Rosberg is relatively reliability issue free and Rosberg is favourite.  Thats the way I see it. Rosberg is the favourite if Hamilton has more reliability issues while he doesnt. ,formula1,d8g6ies,1,t5_2qimj

9208524,0,t1_d8j5rwi,Autobild indeed arent particularly reliable but what theyre saying isnt impossible. The most notable thing is that Ocon whos been considered a nearcertainty for  at Renault all year may end up not going there after all. This would give Mercedes a bit of a headache as theyre probably going to want to promote one driver but they have to pick one  my moneys on Wehrlein mainly by virtue of experience. If Ocon ends up not getting the Renault seat theres suddenly another free spot at Renault. Like many others Id like JEV to return but Ill believe it when I see it. Gasly though? Red Bull dont like their drivers going elsewhere and theyd basically have to drop Gasly from their programme entirely for Renault to pick him up. That seems rather unlikely even with recent rumours of RB not quite rating him. Theyll need to sign a replacement for him because right now they have nobody else in the pipeline with their only over driver being Sergio Sette Cmara who doesnt seem to be future F star material and has nowhere near the super licence points.Of course theres also the possibility Autobild are being their usual somewhat unreliable selves and nothing in the article actually is true.,formula1,d8j8z4q,13,t5_2qimj

9241359,0,t1_d8ne2z5,gtThe problem is that youre pretending that you dont understand that the reason he was closer was because he wanted to try a pass where he tried a pass.    Im not saying he certainly wasnt but Im likewise not saying he certainly was. You are saying it with certainty which youre free to do but you have nothing to categorically back that up with.   For instance in the previous comment you said anyone watching the race knew that was his intention. Thats not true at all. I immediately thought oh hes caught him up a bit sooner in the lap than he intended hell have to adapt into the triangle or keep close behind to maximize DRS. Not at all did I personally think it was his intention because he was close but not that close. Not close enough that Id automatically assume that was his intention. And as it proved he wasnt close enough to get it done. Thats why to me it seemed like an adaptation and not a premeditated overtake into the triangle itself.   gtIt was a deliberate choice to close up behind Verstappen and pass him before the DRS zone because he couldnt pass him in the DRS zone.   Again you dont know this. Youre assuming this and presenting it as fact. To me I assumed the exact opposite. All we know is that it was his intention to catch up to him because thats obviously what any driver would do.    gtI am certain because I saw it happen and Im not being deliberately obtuse like you are.   As for nonsense arguments simply seeing someone do something means that was their intention does not make much sense to me...   I saw Hamilton have a bad start. Does that mean he intended for that at that specific point in time?   I saw Gut spin. Does that mean he intended for that? No in both cases.   So again my initial point is and only is that Hamilton would have had a better chance passing under DRS on that lap than any lap before. This is a fact.

The thing that differs is the resting position of the plane which is purely setup based  this is why DRS is quite ineffective at Monza as the top plane of the wing is already far more horizontal than at a higher downforce track. That means that when DRS is activated the change in drag off the top plane is really quite limited.

Not because theyre torpedoing but because the Ferraris took T so poorly.gtAre you saying that one whole car length is not good enough in racing ? Thats stupid. That is not what I am saying. I am saying two spaces was required as there were two cars at the apex.

Because of this he missed out on Q by .s and qualified th. Then he got a place grid penalty for changing his gearbox with dropped him down to rd. He finished th in the race. Spain his KERS failed in Q so he didnt set a lap time but still qualified th. In the race he ran into the back of Bruno Senna and got a place grid penalty for the next race. Monaco qualified st but because of the grid penalty started th. Grosjean crashed into him at the start he dropped behind Rikknen to th place and stayed there until he retired due to fuel pressures. Canada at the end of Q he set the fastest time in the first sector despite passing Massa and was then told by his team that he crossed the finish line a few tenths too late  qualified th instead of top. In the race his DRS got stuck open which should have been impossible so he had to retire. Europe missed out on Q by a few thousands because of a tiny mistake in the last corner. Came through to finish rd in the race. Great Britain qualified rd in the rain while Rosberg qualified th. Dropped down to th in the race because his car liked munching on tires too much. Germany qualified rd in the rain while Rosberg qualified th. Dropped down to th in the race because his car liked munching on tires too much and because he had a problem with his gearbox during the last few laps of the race. Hungary got distracted by a puff of smoke caused by Maldonado and only qualified th. Stalled on the grid because he didnt know that theres a new formation lap straight after an aborted start. Got a puncture while being pushed to the pitlane. Got a drive through penalty for speeding in the pitlane while driving towards the pit exit. Then his telemetry failed completely and he was forced to retire. Belgium qualified th was running as high as nd in the race then dropped down to th in the race because his car liked munching on tires too much and because he had a problem with his gearbox during the last few laps of the race. Italy qualified th finished th. Nothing special. Singapore qualified th in front of Rosberg neither got a lap time in Q. Drove into the back of Vergne in the race and got a place grid penalty for next race this crash was similar to the one he had with Perez in  at the same track Japan qualified th and started th finished th.

Abu Dhabi qualified th finished th. Nothing special. USA qualified th while Rosberg qualified th. Dropped down to th in the race because the car just didnt have any pace. His first lap in particular was awful because of the lack of grip in his tires. Brazil qualified th got a puncture at one point and dropped to last and a lap down fought back to finish th in the end.Make of that what you will.I think he was improving every year and it would have been interesting to see what he could have done if he had signed the  year contract extension he was offered by Mercedes. ,formula1,d9e5egj,25,t5_2qimj

9460357,1,t3_5abfy0,If the telemetry showed he lifted off before the SC came out then thats fine I guess.   I still think if you go off track you should not gain an advantage of any sort for any amount of time lasting or not but you should instead gain a disadvantage. Simply put you should not go off the track and then rejoin in a way thats faster than if you had not gone off track. It must take longer because its not a shortcut its a run off. It no longer part of the racing track.   Run offs need some sort of weird coating that just make the current set of tyres useless for a lap or for good. Not that they destroy the tyres or cause punctures or anything unsafe but that they just take the good performance out of them. Then no ones gonna go off. I dont know.

I kept opening my visor and trying to wipe it but its never happened before and it held me back. Its a shame as the car was a lot better than eighth when we had a clear track our speed was good. It was tricky out there for example with Kimi I didnt see him crash in front of me. It wasnt until I got back to the pits and saw a replay I knew hed crashed. Earlier when Ric was on inters he was  sec quicker per lap than Max on wets which is what caused Max to make that bad pitstop for inters himself.

9629735,0,t1_da01gid,I think Rosberg has internalized the philosophy of to finish first you must first finish possibly too much. I think Nico has managed the season to capitalize on Lewis misfortunes and now intends to do nothing more than he has to in order to not jeopardize his position.   This is kind of like camping in a video game a perfectly legitimate strategy but when you lose to it its very frustrating and not satisfying.  I say this as a Rosberg fan. I want him to lose and I want him to beat Hamilton but Id like to see him do it in a way that silences his critics rather than giving them ammunition to say hes too cautious or not aggressive enough to deserve it. ,formula1,da029ql,41,t5_2qimj

9662348,0,t1_da3yqm9,Lets just keep on trend and call Verstappens drive the youngest best wet drive ever.On a serious note people will vote on what is freshest in their mind. Many people wont have even been watching F in    etc and will just have voted with what they know. Ill admit that I watched all  races at the time and still found myself caught up in the hype of Maxs race plus it was fresh in my mind and the details of the other races were a bit lost. Once I went back and refreshed my memory Id say that Maxs drive probably deserves to be mentioned when talking about great wet weather drives but I wouldnt like to rank it above the others. Also yes Hamilton put in an amazing drive but is unfortunately again a victim of Mercs success. Nobody cares about a dominant drive at the front when you have someone passing  cars in  laps or whatever it was. You could say that Hamiltons success is also down to having a great car. People seem to undersell just how good the car is and focus all the attention on the engine. Both had great races that were aided by a great car. It just happens that one was far more entertaining to watch.We shouldnt take these polls too seriously anyway. People vote for what they like and while it doesnt really bother me I also dont put any value on the results really. Its a bit like the pointless Best ever driver poles when respected journalists all try and list the reasons for their top  drivers ever like there is really any way to compare the likes of Fangio and Hamilton for example. Too much has changed in the sport to ever get close to a proper decision. Anyway getting off on a tangent here. ,formula1,da434pb,0,t5_2qimj

Theres Perez continuing to show his ability to get a midfield car to the podium and Hulkenberg getting close to winning a race in Brazil a few years ago. I remember I used to look forward to Monaco because Sutil was just freakishly awesome in that track. Im also glad they kept giving Hulkenberg a chance even though interest in him has been greatly reduced. It was also generous of them to let him drive Le Mans.,formula1,dacxmam,7,t5_2qimj

The biggest one is the expected load on the tyre. Tracks with lots of high speed corners e.g. Silverstone the cars generate much more load on the tyres and so need harder tyres.,formula1,daf33bz,2,t5_2qimj

They also want all their mechanics to be as good as possible to get the most out of whichever driver is available whether its Lewis Nico or someone new. With two championships under their belt and reasonable confidence that they had a car good enough for either of their drivers to win a third this was the perfect opportunity to expand and improve their mechanics experience levels.

I get it theres not much you can do if youre country doesnt show F but many people do get F in their country and still choose to stream Sky. If you dont and have to stream then fair enough but stop bitching about it and be greatful you are being provided with an option. Also it would be a bit rich for me to go and watch say the German broadcast and then complain its too German focused. When I watch Indycar and American Football I get the American feed but dont get upset because it aimed Americans. Its just ridiculous to complain about that kind of thing. TV networks will pander to their own audience.Look I get it. I said before that Crofty and Sky have their issues. I can be critical of them myself but its got to circlejerk levels.

9775508,0,t1_daho184,It is crazy to think they will be definitely be ahead of either of those teams next year. That Renault engine wasnt great but Red Bull showed it was a race winner with a good chassis. And the chassis will be effectively rebuilt for all teams next year. And Renault have a works team budget to develop their chassis. Sure anyone might get it all wrong next year but no sane person would pick FI over Renault. And its probably a toss up between FI and Williams. th would be an enormous accomplishment. Teams that would be massively favored to finish over them would be Merc Ferrari and Red Bull. Teams that would be favored would be Renault and McLaren. Teams in the mix for th would include Williams FI Haas and Toro Rosso. That means they would have to be best of the midfield and jump a team with significantly more resources. ,formula1,dai1pth,3,t5_2qimj

9778178,0,t1_daicnly,gtYou could argue that Rosberg should know what to do in such a situation you could also argue that it is unrealistic for Rosberg to know exactly what to do when he doesnt know the exact issue I like how this didnt apply to Lewiss issue in Baku when even Mercedes basically said that it was nigh on impossible for Lewis to have known how to fix the issue. Theres so much more but I couldnt be bothered to point them out for someone thats not going to change their view. This post is hilarious though its basically saying that Hamilton had worse reliability but it wasnt a big deal and didnt decide the championship as much as it really did. Reliability is part of racing and good for Nico but I dont understand why people have to undermine what Hamilton achieved this year in the face of odds. Whenever anyone says Nico got lucky that Lewis had his issue they get downvoted for undermining Nicos championship. Well from what I see youre doing the same to Lewis.

9836513,0,t1_dappcqn,Are you the OP? Its not easy it is hard maths but thats the point. His model produces only  WDCs out of all F history as the number  driver. That means his model weights something more than just points which is good. I personally feel there is too much weight placed on team mate comparison this is why RIC HAM ROS were punished. Now it does help that it somewhat normalizes the car benefit but it discounts the rest of the field too much in my opinion. Theres no simple answer. Personally I would start with a subset of WDCs who are unanimously considered the best drivers of that specific year. Now you ignore their first places they got but find data points that otherwise show why they are great drivers. Then you attempt to control for any car benefits. With that logistic regression and score past WDCs. Review results. Rinse and repeat until you get the desired output. ,formula1,dappxrt,2,t5_2qimj

I wasnt trying to being aggressive you started with Dude which I object to.Coming back to your original question On a personal level yes he regrets giving the team orders. He said this directly after the race on Sky. He has two minds about it a racers point of view and a team managers point of view. The racer understood Hamiltons action the team manager saw a breakdown of their systems and discussions they had before the race. See However going forward into the new season in hindsight Sunday evening and Monday he knew he had to put his team managers perspective ahead of his racers points of view for the good of the team. Until Rosberg quit and he cant really upset Hamilton. Although he rightfully in my opinion cant seem to put it to bed see Lets also not forget Totos comments were made in line of the search for a new driver not regarding the team orders. However I will concede to you that his I say that meaning AbuDhabi opens up your line of speculation. Because perhaps unwillingly he links the equal statusopportunity to the team orders of AbuDhabi. Also if you read into his body languagelook at his face you can see he start to smile when he says it. So I wouldnt read too much into it. My apologies if I appeared aggressive.

Red Bull Ferrari and Mercedes are the only teams testing basically because of the costs. Williams have stated that they would have liked to have been involved but the costs were too prohibitive. I would say the same is true for Force India etc. Williams has also said that they believe the  teams testing will know more than the others about the tires which will give them an advantage. The cars are not a true  car but a mule car designed to mimic the downforce levels of . Pirelli has said that none of the  teams managed to achieve their desired levels of downforce though.The big thing around using this years car goes back to  when there was absolutely no inseason testing other than Pirellis tests which they would select a team and ask them to do blind tests for them. All demo days PR events etc had to use a car from at least  years ago. The same was meant to apply to the Pirelli tests. Mercedes were having issues understanding the tires were asked to do a blind test for Pirelli which they did using their current car which they claimed was at the request of Pirelli who of course denied it. Miraculously they stopped having issues with the tires after that test Red Bull and Ferrari were not happy at the turn of events theyd both run  cars for their tests IIRC and petitioned the FIA to investigate. The FIA found that they had breached the rules and were excluded from the end of year young driver test as punishment.So to avoid that again the teams have been instructed to base their mules on a  car instead of the .

Maybe it doesnt go well and not like with the father. This is clear there is always the possibility.

The point i should have made is McLarenHonda will go with a livery that will bring money to the team. I dont see them going with a livery for nostalgia sake or notional colours. Just my opinion though feel free to downvote if you dont share it. ,formula1,dbgogjo,2,t5_2qimj

10123372,0,t3_5kwb40,Heres the post gt Liberty Media the new owner of Formula One plans to overhaul the elite motorsport including selling race naming rights and staging ancillary events around its  Grand Prix with the aim of making each one the equivalent of the Super Bowl.gt Liberty intends to turn each international Grand Prix into a week of events to engage spectators and attract new sponsors according to a senior executive involved with Formula One. It is also exploring expanding the contests US presence with the launch of new Grand Prix in big media markets. New York Los Angeles Las Vegas and Miami are under consideration.gt The US media company wants to draw more fans to the sport around the world lift television ratings and increase commercial revenues.gt Liberty which is controlled by John Malone acquired Formula One from CVC Capital Partners this year in a complex deal that valued the sport at bn. Chase Carey the former executive vicechairman of Rupert Murdochs st Century Fox has been appointed Fs new chairman replacing Peter BrabeckLetmathe the chairman of Nestl.gt Bernie Ecclestone the sports longtime chief executive will take a revamped role although details have yet to be hammered out. He said in September that he would continue to be involved in the sport for two to three years.gt Liberty plans to do more to promote the rivalries between teams and drivers building a marketing department and new digital platforms. Theres no marketing no research no data no digital platforms the F executive said. This sport has unique global content and hasnt done enough to take advantage of that. We need to build the rivalries and enable people to understand the technology that goes into the sport.gt Broadcasting revenues account for up to  per cent of Fs annual revenues of more than .bn. Race promotion accounts for another third  per cent comes from advertising and sponsorship with the rest made up from hospitality TV production licensing and other sources.gt After completing the purchase Liberty believes Formula One has considerable potential the executive said. Theres probably no sport more associated with technology and yet we dont have a technology sponsor. He added that there were untapped opportunities in merchandising as well as virtual reality which would bring the F experience closer to fans.gt Formula One has faced criticism for failing to modernise amid a longterm decline in its global audience. Changes this year to rules on race qualifying were derided by fans and media while sponsorship revenue is under pressure the competing teams earned m in  down from m three years before. Meanwhile the switch from free to air to payTV has hit broadcast audiences in key markets such as Asia.gt Relations between teams and Mr Ecclestone have been fraught in the past over the distribution of prize money. Liberty intends to improve those relations the executive said. We need to have a shared vision.gt Liberty which has stakes in SiriusXM and Live Nation Entertainment also wants to beef up Formula Ones presence in western Europe  it feels like it did  years ago he added  and then explore the launch of more US races in coming years. It operates a Grand Prix in Austin Texas but is keen to have races in larger media markets.

The suspension was damaged from a wall brush and would have made him retire within laps.  As Prost said hed have soon abandoned the race and Bellof was driving an illegal car the first likely winner was Arnoux.Being retired means being not classified  Its actually a pretty widespread misconception from what I see. If you dont cross the line on the last lap you started you didnt finish. Its that easy.Masahiro Hasemis fastest lap  It was a timing error the organisers corrected it to Jacques Laffite but FIA never changed the official results.

10481726,0,t1_dcua763,Actually its pretty easy. Just establish a clearing house between teams and suppliers and require each supplier to supply a minimum of two teams at the same price. Then Mercedes F can either by their engine from their RampD parent for  but take a loss when RedBull buy one for  as well or Mercedes can charge full price for the engine to Mercedes F and also to whichever other team buys the engine. Corporate pride will prevent the likes of Ferrari putting a Mercedes engine in their car so thats not an issue. The remaining costs can be calculated by auditing the team accounts.

10612604,0,t1_dd99w56,Fair enough. I suppose I rate variance in a different way. I tend to think because Hamiltons emotions are so vulnerable he becomes very inconsistent very quickly. There have been phases in recent seasons where he has just looked like a spoiled school boy in a huff. I hate that. Im not a fan of Nico either. In terms of rating I always thought in terms of raw talent and skill hamilton was much better that Rosberg and it was Rosbergs consistency despite obviously not being as good a driver that won him the championship. In the ROS vs HAM battle I had to support HAM simply because he was more exciting to watch. Im really happy about Bottas. I think hes excellent. Remember how competitive he and ricciardo were with each other prior to f. Both were big prospects. I expect him to push hamilton more than rosberg did and my basis for that is I rate him comparably to RIC and I rate RIC as much better than ROS ever was. I suppose only time will tell. Ill be supporting Bottas over hamilton this year for sure. ,formula1,ddalxwx,2,t5_2qimj

Ollies team RX Racing ran a livery competition early last year and I was fortunate to win. Then it was just a few rounds of back and forth to get the finer details like sponsorship positioning right.    I mainly put things together in photoshop. Ideally I should move over to Illustrator and keep everything vector but sometimes I can work quicker in Photoshop. The designs mainly start with a template. A Ford Fiesta RX template was provided by the team possibly originally designs by builder MSport from then its a case of setting that to Multiple in Photoshop then literally mark out all the areas paint will appear.

The investigation if there is one will look at any anticompetition activities that have prevented some teams from being able to compete fairly. If any practices are found to illegally hinder these teams the EU will instruct FOGLiberty and the FIA to make changes or face fines and sanction. FOM and the FIA will not want to let it get that far and will almost certainly make changes before any ruling has been given in order to avoid any official ruling. Neither side want this to go to court. This is even if a serious investigation actually happens. The complaint was lodged when FOM was the owner and if FOG make all the right noises and moves the EU may just let them get on with it.

When we consider that the actual runnerup turned out to be Philippe Adams one of the very worst F drivers of the decade then it again doesnt look that great. Also Marcel was young but not that young at .One other thing is its fascinating how little is available on his accident given that it was a race with a TV crew present. Ive only ever seen  photos and it was a real tough job to find the nd.Oh just realized you are Dutch.

10962574,0,t1_dean7fv,gt Yes Higher cornering speeds means higher straight entry speeds we agree on that.I love that I agree with you and youre still saying I ignore you. I love the internet.Yes. I agree. Faster corner exit speed  faster straight entry speed  theoretically faster at the end of the straight at least faster average speed down the straight. Thats beautifully simple in theory. Problem  reality doesnt give a shit about theories. Most tracks yes I  agree with you. The straights are short enough that the increased drag will not be enough to eliminate any gains.Im talking very specifically about Monza here which is basically all straights. Monza punishes drag harder than any other track on the calendar. Red Bull typically struggle more at Monza than any other track because they favour a high downforce design philosophy. The best the Bulls could manage in Quali was P and P because they were mixing it with the Williams who run a very low drag aero package typically.Again to clarify youre not wrong. The wonders of physics do indeed confirm that if you enter a straight faster you will start that straight faster. I agree. Im not saying youre wrong.

But they always came back stronger the th place in the team ranking  was simply amazing.I was heartbroken when Sauber stopped being independent and BMW came in but not half as much as when they left and tried to kill Sauber on their way out.I am so happy that the people at Sauber can continue their great work and that a longterm solution seems to have been found.

If the rule is that pedestrians have to look out for cars then you are putting yourself and others in danger if you wander around without paying attention. On a live F circuit that applies if you enter under any circumstances without race control authorisation. Maybe a more liberal standard could be safely established. Enter the track so long as you dont stand on the asphalt? The track limits? The racing line? Maybe. But there is no place in an environment with as much potential danger as an F circuit for people to invent their own alternative safety standards and take responsibility for the risks on the spur of the moment.,formula1,dffiisp,4,t5_2qimj

Thats more or less what I dont get about Mercedes strategy. If they were worried about an overcut the last thing you do is pit first especially given that a tyre advantage has to be very significant to attempt an overtake on track.And if they were worried about the opposite an undercut strategy from Ferrari Mercedes could have seen that Verstappens Red Bull was still an ally to them in that regard. On the lap that Hamilton pitted an undercut strategy wouldnt have worked out for either him or Vettel because they wouldnt clear Verstappen.

He sees the UK as his home.I mean Commonwealth bond and all but Webber gives as good as he gets with the British love.Which helped. But also. Mark Webber was an experienced F driver whose partner was a driver managerPR person. Seb Vettel was a  year old kid whod been brought up in F. Add to that he was German and the British media had just finished reporting on a German superstar with dodgy sporting morals. Seb was always going to be judged more harshly because even the slightest slip and the press could triumphantly write about the legacy of German ruthlessness that Schumacher had left behind.I think the Red Bull success story was written as much by Mark Webbers PR and the memory of Michael Schumacher as it was by Seb Vettels actions.

It might be all right for the likes of DTM but Id like to see F fix its problems through other means. Im going to digress a bit here Highdegradation tires may be criticized as artificial by some but at least they still offer for strategic variance teams can opt to use them in many different ways.

11378975,0,t3_62dkdk,I agree with your idea but disagree with your methodology.I dont think that any of the big teams would agree to anything financial and they have so much clout that it is basically a non starter. If Ferrari says no then so do Haas and Sauber the teams Ferrari provide with engines. Equally if Mercedes says no then so do Williams and Sheilas Wheels.Before we had a limited token system irrespective of results.Now we have an unlimited token system irrespective of results.I think we need a limited token system with respect to results a relative token system.In this kind of token system the lead constructor for an engine manufacturer would serve as its representative. A nominal amount of tokens would be given for the following season lets say  but this varies depending on your results. It cant be  relative  if there was an engine manufacturer who scored  point then the big teams would be entitled to  tokens regardless of their results. Mercedes  points     tokens Ferrari  points     tokens etc. So there would need to be a threshold and I think that  of the top points scorers is a valid threshold. The teams above this threshold will be awarded tokens relative to the lowest scoring team above the threshold.Also to incentivise engine manufacturers to join and stay in F teams falling below this threshold should be given additional catch up tokens  up to  tokens depending on how few points they score. .. of top scorers   catch up token .   catch up tokens ... ..   catch up tokens.It sounds super complicated but its not that hard to grasp in practice so I am going to do the last few seasons to see what difference it would make.

Both teams would have at least  tokens more than Mercedes each year in order to try and catch them.Honda instead of being punished and pilloried for their performance would be allowed margin to improve the engine and bring it up to scratch receiving  catch up tokens in their first two years rather than the none they currently have.,formula1,dflsda3,2,t5_2qimj

11418093,0,t1_dfq7g7q,Thats a big generalisation but the more cylinders an engine has the better it sounds. It also depends on whether it is naturally aspirated how high it revs etc. During the V era the engines had reached over  rpm giving them the unmistakable scream that everybody loved. The Vs before them also sounded godlike but they hadnt yet reached such high rpms. The Vs after them were OK too but with a deeper sound. Current Vs maybe could sound better but the turbocharger and the fact that they rev at about  rpm make them a lot quieter. You can find videos on Youtube to compare for yourself.Such engines are by no means irrelevant. You can find Vs and Vs in supercars today and Vs even in passenger cars. edit And of course for most people there is the nostalgia factor myself included.

11431097,0,t3_636db7,For anyone not able to read german these are the main talking points MGUH the electric motor coupled to the turbo may be abandoned. the current MGUH regulation is seen as a major cost driver and its abolition creates simpler engines that also can be louder. Nonworks teams in particular favor a standardized KERS MGUK unit. Mario Illien advised such an engine could be made for  million a piece. Volkswagen involvement could favor a push towards  cylinders instead of . The  rules were intially about cylinder engines as well but vetod by Ferrari.As for myself I can understand wanting to get rid of the current MGUH formula. This part has been the major engineering headache of the  engine rules ask Honda and Renault... Especially because the compressor and turbo still have to be physically connected with a shaft. I think the current engine regulations with their strict restrictions on the configuration of parts actually has driven up the cost a lot while resulting in less competitive engines from the different manufacturers.The regulations surrounding the  token system longevity of engines and MGUH implementation are the major problems of the current and    rulesets regarding engines imho because it has forced the engine developers down a single path that takes a lot of RampD to get right and not easy to catch up on.I can also understand the push for  cylinders. This has nothing to do with costs but with marketing. Engines that are superficially similar to the downsized engines of road cars provide engine manufacturers with a more marketable participation in F.If the engines in F the most extreme motorsport are also downsized that could help VW Alfa Renault and Mercedes sell their . litre cylinder engined cars as still being cool despite having lost their Vs or Vs because theyre superficially the same as their F counterparts.Thats also the main reason why Ferrari has been opposing it. Theyre not yet in the business of selling cars with cylinder engines.,formula1,dfrpbcn,89,t5_2qimj

I therefore draw a parallel between what I know well to what I dont know so well and fill in the blanks. The trick is I am always open to adapting that generalization. As I get new or more relevant information Ill update what my image of the guy is.

11562981,0,t1_dg5pfat,The official qualifying headtohead was  to Hamilton. However there were a few sessions where one driver had no chance to beat their teammate due to issues outside of their control Hamilton had engine failures in Q at Germany  Hungary  China  and in Q in Russia . Also he effectively didnt participate in Belgium  qualifying due to engine penalties.Those are pretty slamdunk  discount those five sessions and its  to Hamilton. There are also some more that were pretty clear and fair to exclude Germany  Rosberg was knocked out in Q due to being held by Mercedes while the track was improving. Hungary  Hamilton was faster throughout qualifying and on provisional pole during the first runs but had to back out of his final run due to a spin by Alonso. Rosberg then set pole on an improved track despite double waved yellows being present.Discounting those two leaves us at  without having to make any real subjective calls. There were a few more incidents that you could consider for exclusion as well though  Canadian GP Rosbergs KERS wasnt working in qualifying.  Monaco GP Rosberg made an error on his final Q lap while on provisional pole by .s bringing out yellow flags and forcing Hamilton to abandon his final lap before he abandoned it he was .s up on his previous lap.  Monaco GP Hamilton had an ERS issue in Q which meant that he couldnt get out of the garage for the first runs and only got one flying lap during the session meaning that he had to be slightly conservative during it. To compound this he encountered traffic during his qualifying attempt.Exclude these and the total is . Even if you only eliminate the obvious cases the ratio is still roughly  for Hamilton being faster vs Rosberg being faster which seems pretty representative  Rosberg pushing Hamilton hard and definitely not being destroyed but Hamilton still looking like he had a definite advantage overall. Particularly during their latter years together Rosberg was much closer in qualifying during their first two years as teammates.,formula1,dg6o36n,3,t5_2qimj

It was mainly thanks to the fresh tires of course but it helped that their PU wasnt as far down on MercedesFerrari in race trim as it was in Qualifyingno real qualy mode.It seemed a bit ironic to me at the time as the fastest lap at Monza and Alonsos performance at Spa helped show that the PU was actually quite respectable unlike  or  so far and not all to blame for the teams performance.,formula1,dgde1i3,2,t5_2qimj

It went shit today Olav it went shit today. Then Olav shows him the text and where he was which makes Max realize that he interrupted him at almost the end of the long bit which makes him laugh some more. Olav laughs the crew laughs and there is some cursing going on. Max apologizes and says you can do it. They shake and Max is off.Quite a funny bit actually.

He has really good insights about whats going on in a team all the technical details even more so than Sky UK and it feels more laid back since he gets along well with Hausleitner. However they do get less immediate infos during a race due to having less presence in the pit lane  la Kratitz. I switch up between Sky UK and ORF  both are an awful lot better than German Sky.Regarding any bias they have been biased towards austrian drivers when there were any  also to Red Bull but to a less extent. Though they didnt ignore other drivers so I didnt have a problem with that. Even on both Sky UK and Germany I think its alright  especially after seeing RTL.Also when Wurz has other obligations and gets replaced by Karl Wendlinger i think? it becomes somewhat mediocre.

If Massas spring was twice as heavy but traveling at the same speed it wold have had twice as much energy. However if it was traveling twice as fast but with the same mass it would have had quadruple the energy! edit just wanted to add here that this is why yellow flags MUST be enforced properly and that once we formally acknowledge drivers wont slow down on their own accord ultimately an electronic system is the only way forward.

It may however not sell out because a Its relatively expensive no GAb people in the region may not be too much into F c the race is happening on a Weekday for them. Having said all that attendance was pretty high this year and most Grandstands were almost Full.ampnbspAnd I was there. For the second time.Its genuinely an amazing place with great facilities.The weather is fantastic the surrounding entertainment particularly concerts are very good as well.This year Race Tickets included Klingande Dimitri Vegas amp Like Mike Enrique Inglesias and Steve Aoki.In many places a single concert from any of those acts may be as expensive as an F Ticket in Bahrain.ampnbspIm also going to Abu Dhabi again and have been for the last six years!ampnbspAbu Dhabi has it all stunning weather possibly the most impressive facilities in the calendar from the georgeous Marina to the concert Arena from Ferrari World Theme Park to the Yas Water World Water park. Amazing hospitality wonderful people and local culture.  Huge Concerts included in the F Ticket even double booked with stunning concerts free of charge! at the Corniche Beats on the Beach.Unsurprisingly it did sell out for a few years now so I dont know if you track your attendance in Forza  or how youd get the idea that theyre driving on an empty track.I havent been to Azerbaijan yet but Im likely looking to go soon. Azerbaijan had exactly one race and therefore hardly counts. Give them a chance.So while I live in a country that has  had two F Tracks nationally and am even only about  minutes away from SPA Im not too interested to go there.I want to travel and explore places that I probably wouldnt go to otherwise making Azerbaijan a wonderful proposal!.I want entertainment to surround the race and enjoy a huge event not just the action on track and go home.And I completely understand and respect that F is primarily a business. So in principle Id even agree with you and F If places like Germany dont find the Money to host a Grand Prix while others offer  and  figure amounts to not only host a Grand Prix but make it great  of course you go after the money!Theres nothing wrong with that.,formula1,dgtbbza,5,t5_2qimj
