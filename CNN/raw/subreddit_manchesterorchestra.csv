To me its a top five song of all time.Im not upset or judging anyone else or anything like that. Different strokes for efferent folks. Im just a bit surprised.,manchesterorchestra,cf8qne1,2,t5_2twqj

749510,0,t3_22qeqd,I live in New Zealand so there is about zero chance of me seeing Andy Hull. I first heard Virgin a few years ago. I was at a friends place getting high and she put the song on. It was an amazing experience. We all just sat there in silence. It felt like time had stopped. And from that moment on I have a deep love for Andy Manchester Orchestra and Right Away Great Captain. I dont know how I could possibly convince you to pick me. I dont even mind. I take every opportunity to talk about them and have been so lucky to have shared the magic with others. ,manchesterorchestra,cgph4zp,4,t5_2twqj

1917723,0,t3_2gl5pw,I guess Im also in the minority when I say that I enjoyed HOPE just as much as COPE. Listening through HOPE with the perspective of COPE still in my head really hit it home. I think the album brings perfect closure to COPE. Honestly I love the softness of this album. Im a huge fan of Andys Right Away Great Captain material and Im glad you can kind of see his heart in HOPE a lot more and the band seems to be onboard with that. My only sadness is that the two bonus tracks didnt make it out on this album even though After the Scripture seemed like it was headed towards this direction of their sound for this album.tldr   I loved the album way too much and tried to give too many highlights,manchesterorchestra,ckk9tmm,20,t5_2twqj

10495705,0,t3_5qarks,My best guess would be an album art similar to LAVLAC in the hipster if you will random found photo sense but it will be an outdoor picture possibly much older.As far as musical style I would love to see a mix like METN where we can get some I Can Feel a Hot One River Pride Shake it Out The Only One feel. I love it when an album really shows its depth and range. Not that I dont appreciate them but I hope we dont get too many Sleeper Dont Let them see you cryesque. Andy does these beautifully but I would love for those to be on a solo album. Interested to see what theyve learned from the last few years and what the lack of Chris Freeman will bring. I have faith in the boys theyve never let me down. ,manchesterorchestra,dcxsrb9,2,t5_2twqj
