7964616,0,t1_d4b84kg,gtI am conscious so the unconscious is not me.I recently arrived at the conclusion that the idea of the unconscious is a fallacy. Everything is consciousness. So we may not make conceptual sense of the drives and memories that we classify as unconscious but that doesnt mean we dont experience them. For instance even in deep deltawave sleep when were not dreaming I still think theres awareness there.gt But if all systems are self by process of influence then self still has freewill... just not locally.In other words the Universal Self has free will..Hmmmmm,TheTranslucentSociety,d4barmg,3,t5_3eya7

8199885,0,t1_d52hgmf,The two simulated events of the jakealonzo interactions are only one real event from the perspective of the Jake and Alonzo that experience them. If u jake gets turned off and on again this has no effect on the experience of Jake.I called the capital J Jake an algorithm but its not precisely correct. You are correct the algorithm is common to both machines and comprises all of Jakes experiences. But the experiences themselves are Jake not the code. Language fails here because were drawing an analogy its a simulation not an actual experience. Maybe you could say an experience happens inside of the simulation but theres certainly no experience of the bigger world the simulation happens in. Rather theres no awareness of the bigger world.Yeah the teleporter thought experiment is definitely similar. My reasoning is what allows me to say that Im the same person after Ive teleported. If I want to say that Im a different person after Ive teleported then I would be forced to come to terms with being a different person after every individual moment of experience in my normal waking life which might not actually be that hard.The last part of what you said is a pretty good description of why Im you but dont remember being you. Its a hardware limitation.,TheTranslucentSociety,d52jffi,1,t5_3eya7

But hes such an ego maniac and thought so much of himself yet preached about no ego!See Crowleys chapter Onion Peelings from the Book of LiesThe Universe is the Practical Joke of the General at the Expense of the Particular quoth FRATER PERDURABO and laughed.But those disciples nearest to him wept seeing the Universal Sorrow.Those next to them laughed seeing the Universal Joke.Below these certain disciples wept.Then certain laughed.Others next wept.Others next laughed.Next others wept.Next others laughed.Last came those that wept because they could not see the Joke and those that laughed lest they should be thought not to see the Joke and thought it safe to act like FRATER PERDURABO.But though FRATER PERDURABO laughed openly He also at the same time wept secretly and in Himself He neither laughed nor wept.Nor did He mean what He said.Perdurabo was one of Crowleys magical names. Perdurabo Latin I Will endure to the end.,TheTranslucentSociety,d536t2x,2,t5_3eya7
