63261,0,t3_1utsfs,Well you see the fun of doing the PS disc upgrade is that the install takes forever. The trouble is that the system is trying to integrate the install from the disc and the stuff you downloaded. As for the Multiplayer the data is being downloaded from the internet so that is why it is taking so long. Hope I cleared some of that up. ,battlefield4,celmrdx,1,t5_2s641

4346338,0,t3_3aqthb,I use to play Battlefield  on Xbox  for hours upon hours a day and that shit use to happen to me all the time.  My favorite was when Id be following a support teammate using the in game function to ask for ammo and theyd just ignore me.  Bitch I know you can hear me just drop the ammo. Went like that for a few months until I befriended a server admin and his  or so friends.  This  person roster had  or so pilots  or so armor and  infantry support.  Depending on the time of day would sort out the  manwoman team roster sorry we had girls in our squad dont want to be that guy.  Gotta remember Xbox is  v  so on the weekends the server basically just became a collectively we are tired of pwning the crap out of random opponents because its not fun anymore to lets just make two awesome teams and battle eachother.  This was hands down the best battlefield ever.  Both teams knowing exactly what they are doing lead to the most competitive fun game play experience Ive ever had with a video game.  My advice is to get a crew of at least  people who know wtf theyre doing and the game will be much more fun.,battlefield4,csfkbuo,0,t5_2s641
