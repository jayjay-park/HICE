2327528,0,t3_26y43j,Sorry for the extremely late comment on this post.Im the web guy for LuteMusic.org which is the new still in progress interface for The Gerbode Lute Collection a huge collection of music from the late s to the mid s.I bring it up here because Dr. Frank Gerbode aka Sarge was having some problems reading some old tabs when in performance and so decided to reformat them in a way that was easier to read. That was  years ago and the collection is now approaching  pieces all available under the Creative Commons license.All of the pieces were formatted using a program called Fronimo The pieces are made available in FT the Fronimo format PDF and MIDI. Although Fronimo is not free it can be used for free as a viewer of the FT files and for changing the style of tablature used Sarge prefers the French tab style.When the new site is done hopefully in the next few months Ill make an announcement on this subreddit.,lute,clze8we,3,t5_2s4m0
8192526,0,t1_d50rkyl,Thank you for your exceptionally detailed response and thoughtfulness. I am very seriously yearning to buy a lute and get started. All the lutes on the website you mentioned were  courses is there a certain number of courses I would want to start on? I love baroque music and I understand baroque lutes are different than renaissance ones but I wouldnt be opposed to learning on a renaissance lute first if thats the norm.Thank you again,lute,d51m8d5,1,t5_2s4m0
