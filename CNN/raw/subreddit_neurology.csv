4176233,0,t1_crw7gm7,I havent been in a good mood for a while now but huffing glue really caught me off guard. Ive been in contact with hot glue and wood glue the past few days for a build project but I promise you I didnt stick glue sticks up my nose when no was was looking. I love you you made me laugh really hard which led to another coughing fit. So I still havent seen another doctor I plan to go tomorrow since Ill finally be done with finals. Today was the first day that the numbness hasnt spreadi feel the same as I did yesterday. I still seem to have some kind of residual cough. There are no other symptoms with the cough. No mucus no sore throat just the occasional coughing fit that seems to come out of nowhere.EDIT Another piece of info is that when I first told the doctor about the numbness she did a quick examination which included testing my strength and reflexes. She couldnt a reflex out of my knee unless she hit it really hardim sorta numb on my knees and I couldnt stop her from squeezing my left pinky on my hand with the second finger right next to it. I seem to have lost some mobility in my left pinky because I can open my right hand a little bit wider that my left because the pinky can stick out farther.Im going to try to see a neurologist tomorrow or go to the ER and let them try to figure out what is wrong with me on their own. Ill eventually probably show them this thread once they have made their own hypothesis.,neurology,crwaodo,2,t5_2tjf3
4550879,0,t1_ct499hf,My clinical approach limited to primary care optometry when looking at diseases like AMD Glaucoma and MS is to utilize both structure and function as a means of monitoring and treating a disease. Recently moved to a practice with an OCT and Visual Field but no VEP. Looks like Ill be ordering out those for a while until I get them to buy me one... And a better topographer I like fitting scleral lenses.  But any information that I can provide to the managing neurologist I figure helps the patient and puts me in a position as a person of knowledge and usefulness so exchanging patients through a good relationship would be mutually beneficial,neurology,ct49fg4,2,t5_2tjf3
5516189,0,t1_cwgap74,alright so no proper answer. I am not here to argue the point. But without biological differences then this is very much an argument one that is very dangerous.Remember you are measuring people the worth of people. You better be sure your right.,neurology,cwgqrhs,1,t5_2tjf3
5634359,0,t3_3s9dch,I question what your daily life is like. For example do you spend much of your time keeping to yourself and not speaking with others? Only speaking with others a couple of days a week can lead to diminished articulation.,neurology,cwvhurp,1,t5_2tjf3

8780932,0,t3_50cquy,Neurologist in training here. I for one dont see the utility of that merger in most instances  most of neurology neuromuscular diseases stroke movement disorders and epilepsy to name a few subspecialties has next to nothing to do with psychiatry in most instances. Since neurology is already heavily subspecialized as it is due to how much pathology the specialty encompasses remerging with psychiatry would do more harm than good. I.e. more knowledge and experience with psychiatry would lead to less neurological expertise and viceverse. With that said in many cases a patient will benefit from close collaboration between a neurologist and a psychiatrist. However this doesnt mean that I find myself needing or wanting more knowledge about psychiatry in my clinical practice. ,neurology,d73aclk,3,t5_2tjf3
