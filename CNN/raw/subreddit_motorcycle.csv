11333546,0,t1_dfgfxjd,This. I have the Sena SMH. Four of us went splits on  sets of  when we started riding. Best investment ever. After the first bit of configuring they couldnt be easier to use. For solo audio turn on sena with a single button press goes through start up for a few seconds press again and audio from phone starts playing.Never had drops or issues. Easily disconnected from helmet to charge. Yes they are pricey but its worth the investment. On top of this the audio is actually pretty good too.,motorcycle,dfgmz0a,2,t5_2qpvo
11559452,0,t3_630jhu,Hey there I have a  CBS that I am converting to v. Just waiting on parts to complete it but heres what I can tell you.I have done the test by putting v bulbs on every light a v rectifier had to replace the original and a v recti works for the v system  and running a v battery. It worked.I just need a smaller gel battery that I will receive soon to complete it and hook up the new wiring I bought a completely new wiring harness off Ebay. Took a month to arrive but was worth it as the  harness is super ratty and the connectors are starting to go.Heres what I heard regarding a complete full  conversion  it requires using the stator from a s CB. The stator from that era of CB will fit directly in the spot of your old stator. You can also rewind the existing stator if you wish but thats not an option I explored.Switching the stator will allow your bike to charge the battery at lower RPMs. If you do a conversion without the stator the bike will function no problem but it might only charge the battery at higher RPMs found in the th and th gear. So if you use the bike for quick rides to the store and back never going above rd gear eventually your battery might die. For my  its not a problem the CDI will start the bike without battery power but I would be stuck without lights which aint good.So my solution will be to just remove the battery and keep it on a tender when not in use. Stators arent super expensive on ebay but  I just want to get out and ride and might fix that at a later time. ,motorcycle,dg69ny3,2,t5_2qpvo
11634691,0,t1_dge2omk,Quick question.. say right now I just want to switch out all the lights to LED for the blinkers... would that help the brightness of the current headlight?    Ive also looked around for a v LED headlight lol... not much success there p      I know eventually Ill want to do the conversions but how would switching up to LEDs compare to the current brightness.. theoretically?
