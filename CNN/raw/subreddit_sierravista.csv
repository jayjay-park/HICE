However the fitness community is worldclass in my opinion and there are opportunities to make friends pretty quickly. Thats how I got on my feet here. I also was transferred for my job here albeit involuntary and I was concerned about not knowing anyone. I found people to be very accepting considering its not a college town or anything like that. Id recommend giving it a shot!,sierravista,d4zae28,2,t5_2thli
8302708,0,t1_d5efjco,We usually have our apartment from  in the summer and like  during the winter. Our bills are usually  depending on if we forget or something but if youre more conservative and turn lights off more often than we do that number can go much lower. We honestly are not as disciplined with it as we should be.,sierravista,d5fe9ys,1,t5_2thli
