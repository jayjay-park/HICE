96215,0,t3_1v6rgz,In my experience if youve done something like Backbone you can understand application development. The main difference between web and app development IMO is that web development is stateless whereas app development is all about managing state. Within app development your view is persistent you add callbacks to buttons when clicked do this and observers to models if that updates do this and everything is just well running. Whereas in web development you have a very isolated  parse uri to resource load and ETL data render template cleanupcycle thats driven by distinct and atomic CRUD events.The V in MVC is really the most importantcomplicated part. In webdevelopment thats your browser which unless youre using significant javascript is mostly out of your control. You send the browser templates and it takes care of binding events onto links and buttons listening for user interaction and performing subsequent actions usually CRUD requests. In app development you have to do all of that. Which is difficult... but at least with iOS the app framework view APIs are much better designed than the HTMLCSSDOM.,RubyMotion,cepdtxq,2,t5_2u1q4
