7038783,0,t1_d1dtwaw,Ah yes how would I advise my friend to deal with this problem. I suppose I would say to set a small achievable goal first like freewriting for  minutes a day for  or ! days in a row. I might also advise some artificial negative reinforcement. For example setting a personal rule that I...err...my friend cannot take a shower until the  minutes of freewriting has been done.Incidentally my efforts to stop eating and drinking so many heartburn triggers and my efforts to exercise regularly have not met with much success either.I suppose one good way that my current problem is different from trying to eat healthy or exercise is that I only have to maintain this habit for a limited amount of time with a foreseeable end. Once my thesis is defended I wont have to keep forcing myself to write it any more. In fact once I get a decent first or second draft I will be mostly done with the pain of getting those first words on paper. Surely I can form a habit if the end is in sight.,BetterQuestions,d1e7asj,1,t5_2y3jt
