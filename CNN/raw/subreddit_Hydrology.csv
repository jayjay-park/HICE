The fine sediment shown in the figure gives the impression that a change in the supply of fine sediment e.g. turbid water due to runoff from construction sites alters channel morphology. In theory I suppose turbid water has some effect but its the larger material that really matters over time in terms of channel morphology.,Hydrology,d0n1n2u,1,t5_2rke5

10898737,0,t1_ddyapl0,Hey! Sorry for the delayed response. Yes it was difficult obtaining federal employment. All I can tell you is to have patience and perseverance. I applied to countless positions and utilized usajobs.gov to do a lot of the work for me. I would recommend using the websites resume formatting and also utilizes its ability to email you daily on position openings. Once you set everything up applying to an open position doesnt take much time. But keep applying there will be many applications that you will never hear anything back from but after a while you will start to get emails and calls etc. and eventually land one. I would prepare now and as soon as the hiring freeze passes start applying. There may be a lot of positions opening up soon.,Hydrology,de44lhf,1,t5_2rke5
