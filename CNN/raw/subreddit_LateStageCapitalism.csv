6572188,0,t1_czz3opr,Its a totally legal product and therein lies the rub for the cops they cant really ban people from buying cigarettes or bringing a couple cartons for personal use from outside the state. Some stores buy counterfeit cigarettes and counterfeit tax stamps most states except NC unless that changed requires a tax stamp on packs of cigarettes which is on the bottom of the cellophane wrapping for the packs as well. Evasion costs NYS .B which is more than the entire budget for DHS Department of Homeless Services. Its not real easy to get caught if youre selling them from a bodega corner store since the NYPD doesnt do the stings on stores its the sheriffs department which is much much smaller than the NYPD. The NYPD largely busts people dealing them on the street if they see them which one of those cases led to Eric Garners death. Its a whole shitty situation because capitalism makes this possible. The cigarette taxes and smuggling dont really affect higher income households but the poor because they spend disproportionately more on cigarettes due to their shitty situation and they need a buck so they might smuggle cigarettes or sell smuggled cigarettes to be able make rent or eat.

However by demanding that work is fundamentally different from your personal life i.e. the things that you value in themselves you make it inconceivable to have any work other than work for someone else.,LateStageCapitalism,d1y04z3,1,t5_39qgx

ADVERTISEMENT If you want to really change the world get a PampLas in a profit and loss statement. Those of you I hear gagging in the humanities section are going to have to unlearn a few things. Harvard recently released a survey showing that over half of Americans ages  to  do not support capitalism. Ouch. You can almost feel the Bern.ENLARGEPHOTO GETTY IMAGESDont be fooled. Capitalism is what allowed you to wander around this leafy campus for four years worrying about finals instead of foraging for food. It delivered the Greek yogurt to your cafeteria and assembled your Prius. The basic idea is to postpone consumption. Then invest in production to supply goods and services that delight customers. Next generate profits. Rinse and repeat.To succeed in life to really improve the lot of your fellow man you have to think about profits. I know youd rather clean a gas station restroom with your toothbrush. But profit is what drives change.When I buy something from you assuming youre not a rentseeking crony capitalist your profit is how much I am willing to pay over what it costs to produce the item. In a truly competitive world your profit is the value of my delight in your invention or Id simply make the thing myself. To put it in Facebook speak Your profit is the social value of the transaction. Profits create wealth not only for you but for the collective me of society. Getting a PampL shines the light on that delight.I spoke to a recent graduate who told me with a straight face no less that she aimed to be half Sheryl Sandbergs Lean In and half Tim Ferrisss Hour Workweek. I told her to get a PampL instead to try to understand the economics of whatever she chose to do. She leaned out mumbling greedy.Hollywood movies notwithstanding capitalism is not about greed. It is a system that weeds out dumb ideas from smart ones. The former generate disdain and losses the latter generate delight and profits. A PampL will point you to what society desires. No matter if you want to be an entrepreneur nurse or professor of comparative literature understand your personal PampL. Why? Because your job is not about you. Its about customers.Frontline workers know where all the waste resides. A nurse who understands how much insurance companies pay for a service versus the actual cost might be in a position to suggest ways to trim expenses and improve care. A teacher with a PampL might measure the amount of spending on each student and work to maximize learning. Thinking about your work this way helps you figure out how to increase your profits. Yet those dividends make the world a better place for all of us as they can be reinvested elsewhere. Thats capitalism .If nothing else get a PampL for selfpreservation. Technology is like a twister headed toward a trailer park. If youre not solidly grounded in your jobs economics it will pick you up and displace you.But have ambitions Its not only guys like Mark Zuckerberg who drive progressyou do too. Maybe youll get promoted maybe not. But your PampL is your guide to delivering what the customer wants and creating social value which is more powerful than any charity. Invert your thinking When you see profits dont think fat cat. Think about what delight was delivered to earn them. Thats the ultimate social value.Disclaimer Im the greedy one. When you find your PampL youll create the next wave of great stuff. I want that not for your sake but for mine. The more successful you are the more delighted Ill be. Get going.Mr. Kessler a former hedgefund manager is the author of Eat People Portfolio When the proles eventually rise up  this piece of shit hedge fund manager will be one of the first to get walled I can only hopeThis is goddamn next level ideology.

7729511,0,t3_4l64io,It is probably because your friends are overprivileged overeducated types who work in white collar jobs possibly professionals. You cannot convince such people with facts what their privileged bias wants them to ignore. Nevertheless here is research that contradicts the widely held myth that everyone has an equal chance to compete for equalityIvan Illich via schooling gtHow the long shadow of an inner city childhood affects adult success   gtgtIn a groundbreaking study Johns Hopkins University researchers followed nearly  Baltimore school children for a quarter of a century and discovered that their fates were substantially determined by the family they were born into.gtA familys resources and the doors they open cast a long shadow over childrens life trajectories Johns Hopkins sociologist Karl Alexander says in a forthcoming book The Long Shadow Family Background Disadvantaged Urban Youth and the Transition to Adulthood. This view is at odds with the popular ethos that we are makers of our own fortune.gtAlexander who joined Johns Hopkins in  and retires this summer spent nearly his entire career on the study along with fellow researchers and coauthors Doris Entwisle and Linda Olson. Together they tracked  Baltimore children from  the year they entered first grade until they turned  or  years old focusing in particular on those who started the journey in the most disadvantaged settings.gt...gtAt nearly  years old almost half the sample found themselves at the same socioeconomic status as their parents. The poor stayed poor those better off remained better off.gtOnly  children moved from birth families in the lowincome bracket to the highincome bracket as young adults if family had no bearing on childrens mobility prospects almost  would be expected. And of those who started out well off only  dropped to the lowincome bracket a fourth of the number expected.gtThe implication is where you start in life is where you end up in life Alexander said. Its very sobering to see how this all unfolds.gtAmong the most striking findingsgtAlmost none of the children from lowincome families made it through college. Of the children from lowincome families only  percent had a college degree at age  compared to  percent of the children from higherincome backgrounds. Thats a shocking tenfold difference across social lines Alexander said.gtAmong those who did not attend college white men from lowincome backgrounds found the bestpaying jobs. Though they had the lowest rate of college attendance and completion white men from lowincome backgrounds found highpaying jobs in what remained of Baltimores industrial economy. At age   percent of them were working in construction trades and industrial crafts compared with  percent of black men from similar backgrounds and virtually no women. In those trades whites earned on average more than twice what blacks made.gtThose wellpaying blue collar jobs are not as abundant as during the years after World War II but they still exist and a large issue today is who gets them among high school dropouts at age   percent of white dropouts were working compared with  percent of black dropouts.gtWhite women from lowincome backgrounds benefit financially from marriage and stable livein partnerships. Though both white and black women who grew up in lowerincome households earned less than white men when you consider household income white women reached parity with white men  because they were married to them. Black women not only had low earnings they were less likely than whites to be in stable family unions and so were less likely to benefit from a spouses earnings.gtWhite and black women from lowincome households also had similar teen birth rates but white women more often had a spouse or partner which helped to mitigate the challenges.gtIt is access to good paying work that perpetuates the privilege of working class white men over working class black men Alexander said. By partnering with these men white working class women share in that privilege.gtMost likely to abuse drugs  betteroff white men. Though young black men get the bad rap when it comes to drugs The Long Shadow found betteroff white men had the highest selfreported rates of drug use bingedrinking and chronic smoking followed in each instance by white men of disadvantaged families. These men also reported high levels of arrest. But blacks Alexander said dont have the social networks whites do to help them find jobs despite these roadblocks. At age   percent of black men from lowincome backgrounds had a criminal conviction. Of white men from the same background  percent had convictions but the white employment rate was much higher.gtInformation on the book can be found at Another article by Mother Jones on this  gt Again this facts probably wont convince your friends I would just present a summary of this study to them and a link and close the subject and not try to argue further. ,LateStageCapitalism,d3ksh0b,4,t5_39qgx

7922088,0,t1_d46gbej,Im going to speak for about  of this sub my educated guess based on content of posts here Anarchist communism. Abolish capitalism abolish money abolish the class system abolish the state end racismsexismdiscrimination against LGBTQA and create a society based on cooperation egalitarian values and decentralized power. Even the most starryeyed radicals dont think this can all be accomplished at once but if there is some revolutionary movement with these goals in mind it can be done gradually. Some anarchists will probably despise me for saying this but if everything I mentioned above were to be implemented immediately on a global scale chaos would ensue since many people whether we want to admit it or not are too emotionally attached to their associated groups whether its based on nationalism ethnocentrism regionalism heteronormativity income etc. I am well aware of this but nevertheless the end goal remains the same.Basic income and cooperative workplaces even under a capitalist system will go some way toward those goals. You are right on the need to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencywaste by the way I think hardly any leftists here would disagree with you on that. Ultimately the goal of radical anticapitalists is to end the profit motive which drives humans closer toward extinction through either nuclear war or complete destruction of the ecosystem I wont even mention exploitation here which although is a disease of capitalism is unlikely to hold much weight against the prospect of the end of times. Im convinced as Einstein was when he penned the article Why Socialism? in  that the capitalist system will cause a massive collapse or mutually assured destruction as states attempt to redraw the map based on their own geopolitical visions as we see now from the clash between NATO and RussiaChina. Humans narrowly avoided nuclear war at least  times since the Cold War. Military personnel of the USSR disobeyed commands from higherups to unleash Armageddon and succumbed to their better angels. We may not be as fortunate in future incidents.

You just asked what conditions make this impossible and youre just spouting made up hypothetical answers as to how to solve them and literally didnt address any of them as they are happening now in reality. gt In my mind govt shouldnt be involved in this stuff at all  they only make it worse.Well they are so now what?gt Get huge inefficient govt out of it! Use negative income tax instead much more simple will help people prosper and escape wage slavery.Well thats not happening so now what?gt Right! And a huge part of that is high rates of single motherhood we dont need govt to be dad we need real dads  hence my point about waiting to be able to raise a kid with someone else.Well as stated before poor women severely lack access to birth control and abortion care..so... now what?gt How is that?Women especially Latina women make  cents to a white mans dollar. And thats just one example. That its possible to prosper is bullshit because if it was people would be prospering. The bootstraps mentality has no basis in reality theyre the exception not the rule. Did you ever stop to think that people arent playing victims they genuinely are victims of a systematically oppressive system? Youre really arguing hard that poor people are just lazy just like every other neolib. And thats why were in the situation we are now because its easier to demonize the poor than to admit the whole way we conduct society thrives off oppression and doesnt give marginalized people the chance to succeed.  ,LateStageCapitalism,d4kmnd4,24,t5_39qgx

The only options for doing this is fair economic stability or by fear and propaganda.When fair economic stability threatens the quality of life of those with wealth fear and propaganda is used in order to maintain the status quo or at worst enrich themselves further. Since moneypower in a Capitalist society those without it have fewer and fewer opportunities to be heard.Youd think democracy would be a corrective to that but when all information consumed by the publicatlarge is controlled the results of a democratic system are largely dictated by those with enough power or money to speak.Also when it comes to attempts at Communism in the past the proletariat has rarely if ever been the victor.

Slight suggestion?gtThe value of houses in the region has doubled every  yearsto...gtThe cost of houses in the region has doubled every  yearsWhat you described doesnt sound like an increase in actual value to the home owner but simply an increase in cost to the prospective buyer with a commensurate decrease in value as the whole area is economically depressed.gtPublic transportation is a joke.  Buses are so frequently late or missing from service that its impossible to hold a job if you rely on them to get to work. Buses on the same route run two hours apart. So if youre unlucky with you shift scheduling you could have a  hour commute for a job thats  minutes by car. Bus fare is . as well.That is terrifying to me in particular.  I just got a new job last week at . an hour commuting by bus an hour each way to go  miles from downtown Seattle to a northern suburb.  It costs . one way on the bus.  Thankfully our buses are frequent and reliable.  If they were like the ones you describe this job and any others like it would have been inaccessible to me.  To anyone who is riding a bus in place of a  minute drive you NEED to get a bicycle.  My commute is  bike  bus but hell if it means keeping a job or losing it bike the  miles.  It will take as long as the bus probably but at least youre fitter for it.gtIt really feels like the previous generation have pulled the ladder up with them and the only way my generation is going to advance is when they die of old age.Yep. Yep yep yep.  Man that catharsis eh mate?  I love my parents but live  miles from them.  Just like I was on my own at  when I started college in  they are on their own now in their late s and failing health.  There is simply no way I can assist them as they need more help in their old age.  Literally everyone in their generation will reap what they sowed and we will all be worse off for it.  The minority of the Baby Boomer age bracket in the economic elite after indoctrinating their own kids with their bootstraps ideology for their entire lives have produced entitled narcissistic off spring who will not want to care for them.  And those in the Baby Boomer age bracket but in the same economic bracket as my parents one of destitution have produced off spring that simply can not care for them in spite of all want.

8202761,0,t1_d52t66r,Asians are more likely to be born into a household that outearns whites. Asians are a minority. What in your opinion is the difference? My last job I worked as the general manager for a chain restaurant. I would argue that not only is it easier for minorities to find a job companies are forced to meet demographics thus hire minorities regardless of qualifications but easier to maintain a job as well. My supervisors were always walking on eggshells when it came to disciplining black employees. They were absolutely terrified of a lawsuit or having to pay unemployment even if something happened that would by all logic merit discipline.  Ill also add to this example that out of  GMs in my district  of us were white males  white females  black females  black male  hispanic female and  asian male. So it was far more likely that a minority advanced to higher management than a white. Of course this was a specific example. Now I wont delve to deeply into my corporate experiences but I will say that out of all the proxy training classes I attended I only ever recall  single instructor being white.          In regards to education I attended the same schools as everybody else growing up. I live in a southern state known for being heavily right and I had the same educations as all of the blacks asians hispanics etc. It is the same thing across all of the counties Ive familiarized myself with. The only disperity being that I did not qualify for many scholorshipsgrants due to my skin being white. I did not get to attend the big award ceremonies for minorities that excelled academically.         I have also had multiple friends that benefit from a thing called lowincome housing. Whats interesting about this is that I could never qualify for this as a young adult while my minority friends had absolutely no problem doing so. They enjoyed housing at a fraction of the cost that I did. I had to live on Ramen noodles no TV no luxuries for longer than I care to admit just to pay my rent and utilities. I was dating a hispanic girl at one point that made almost the same as me and she paid less than month rent for her apartment while I was forced to pay close to  with absolutely no financial aid.        I have never heard of a minority or anybody for that matter being wrongly jailed or mistreated within a county radius of me. The only occurrences Ive heard of that nature were via national media. ,LateStageCapitalism,d52wdeu,0,t5_39qgx

I leased my car over  years and got the price reduced down to invoice a total discount of over  dollars.  I also got a  rate.  So my payment is .  When this comes up used if someone were to finance it theyre going to be paying upwards of month.

Imagine its skins. imagine its a side story that isnt essential to the main plot. Imagine its another playable character.Theres Day  DLC like that all the time.Theres Day  DLC thats used to gouge customers for basic features or parts of the story but theres plenty of DLC that isnt that.Theres nothing wrong with a game that releases with an alternate character you can buy. Making an alternate character costs money rigging animating texturing testing and more if there are any gameplay differences. If that isnt in the budget it might be created as DLC securing its own budget. It might be produced at the same time as the game and pressed onto the disc to save bandwidth and server costs. But that isnt like ripping some random episode out of the story or like advertising a complete season thats missing episodes.Alternatively they might be developing what you think of as a sequel DLC at the same time. Could CD Projekt Red afford to develop all of the content of Blood and Wine without selling it separately?  No. But what if they had a team working on it at the same time as the base game and it was finished at release? Would it be unethical for them to sell it as Day  DLC? If not why would it be suddenly okay to do the exact same thing so long as it isnt done in time to be pressed on the disc? Its still the exact same content the exact same cost to produce it and the exact same cost to the consumer.I can actually think of relatively few recent DLC that are central parts of the story or functionality like youre talking about. There are some egregious examples in the past many of which with explicitly unethical motivations like selling multiplayer on primarily multiplayer games as DLC to curb used game sales but its way way more common for it to be extra items extra skins extra characters etc. A lot of it is crap that is plainly overpriced but its not at all like locking off random episodes of a series or misrepresenting whats on the DVD.A ton of DLC even day  is not at all like random episodes being cut out or like misleading you about the content of a DVD. You cannot uniformly condemn day  DLC. There are bad uses of it and you shouldnt buy them. There are also good uses of it and they enable developers to make things they otherwise couldnt and consumers to choose whether or not to purchase them.,LateStageCapitalism,d6w4iul,1,t5_39qgx

See I was born into a poor working class family.  And I like to observe people around me and the criterion I use for success is what you do with what youre given.If you use that they are by far the worst generation put on this Earth.  No generation of people was given more and did less with it than them.  They were the first ones who really got to experience leisure time growing up they had one of the most advantageous economic situations in history as a nation.  But did they plan for the future?  Absolutely not.  They plowed through life shortsighted consumed far more than they ought to have in both food and entertainment and now are laying the blame to rest on the generation which they raised. If they were concerned with the future the amount of bounty in their time should have sustained us for generations.  Instead it has burned up been spent on massproduced food and product and rather than a strong educated and moral workforce they leave behind concentrated wealth in the hands of people they strived but failed to be and a very large burial plot.You can check my post history but I only saw Youve Got Mail for the first time this past summer.  And what I saw in that was such a perfect encapsulation of pre thought and capitalism worship that it may well be a documentary about our time.In short that entire generation sold out to the worst facets of capitalism and greed and are crying now that they reap what they sow.,LateStageCapitalism,d706z5b,43,t5_39qgx

These drugs are categorically more dangerous than Kratom since they cause respiratory depression. Further they are categorically more addictive and often more toxic.No one is being helped by this. There is no significant societal danger posed by Kratom. The only people who have ever died from Kratom took it with other drugs. While it certainly is addictive it is not nearly as addictive as any other opiate and many people experience negligible withdrawals on par with caffeine addiction.All sorts of people have used Kratom for a variety of legitimate medical uses from pain management to generalized anxiety to IBS to weaning off opiates. These are not all druggies either but plenty of everyday people tired of bgi pharmas solutions for their problems. Parents veterans blue collar workers etc. are all among its base and will be criminals soon.Schedule  indicates that it poses a significant danger and has no medical benefits.

Ive seen both pessimistic and optimistic projections extraction is infeasible no it could work the bottom line is that lithium itself is about one percent of the cost of a battery even if the cost of the commodity increased by an order of magnitude it would hardly dent the cost of battery manufacture and there are plenty of ways to get lithium at ten times the current cost.There are plenty of reasons not to lift the worlds poor into suburban car culture rather than urban transit culture but lithium shortages are probably not among them.,LateStageCapitalism,d84ftqu,1,t5_39qgx

Being an Apple fan becomes a type of personal identity  Ive always felt that in our culture weve had a longstanding issue with defining ourselves personally and in terms of group identity by the products we choose to consume.Brand loyalty is a weird little thing. Companies cream their pants dreaming of that level of fervor and dedication from consumers but rarely does it come to pass. But when it does it really does work. Whether its Apple or Google circa ish when they were viewed as more of a good guy underdog disrupting the system than a big Orwellian spy machine or Costco its what a good deal of marketing branding and advertising is truly trying to create  a strong brand identity that people engage with in a way that frankly is kind of creepy and probably unhealthy.,LateStageCapitalism,d8fw97z,7,t5_39qgx

Groups like this when you suppress their speech just become more subversive and their community becomes closed off to outside voices.  This is especially dangerous with hate groups because then they become an echo chamber and their beliefs get more and more extreme.  The only way to stop someone like this is to change their mind or kill them.  Shutting down their events will only make them resent you making it harder to convince them to change and making violence more likely.  Your example is great as well people push these unsavory opinions out of earshot and think theyre gone then the freedom of speech returns and they realize those ideas havent disappeared theyve just been spreading behind closed doors.

9441614,0,t1_d9cr47c,I agree with you on many of your points. I always vacillate between wanting to say something but also not wanting to say anything because I dont want the discussion of language to shut down constructive communication between me and other people. I feel that I came across as too preachy and pedantic. I didnt intend to sound like I was attacking you but intended to address the larger picture of why this language can be detrimental and not about your use. I was trying to address the universal you and not you you. I agree with you. The discussion and policing of language can grind discussion down to a halt and push people further away from understanding. But I think I also see from a different perspective since I have a son with autism and language really matters with how people treat him. People often refer to him as abnormalnot normal instead of the slightly more neutral term of typical or atypical development. The label that he is autistic or abnormal allows for people to treat him on their preconceived notion that their is something wrong with and he isnt normal. Well what is normal?  My normal is entirely different from your normal. I have coping mechanisms that are both functional and dysfunctional. Just like my son who is a person with autism and his behaviors are completely normal to him. What needs to be addressed is not how to fix him but how to help learn to work with behaviors that hinder his development. Language to me can go along way towards people stopping to use autism as derogatory slur. TLDR  I agree with you on most of your points. Apologies for attacking you. Not my intention and more a reaction based on personal experience. ,LateStageCapitalism,d9csi1y,3,t5_39qgx

One of the art teachers used to be one of the bus drivers and asked to give it a shot when one of the other art teachers left. At least three of the teachers I had were fully leftist and given that one of the teachers I didnt know lead the schools production of a play about the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire there were probably more. However the teachers had quite a militant culture of teaching what they wanted to teach and have forced several heads of school to resign. Parents basically had to accept that left wing ideas were being taught or not send their children to such a good school.

The people here in this sub one of whom Id like to be believe that a good work life balance is essential to mental health and a good life overall and if people are going to work long and work more they should be paid for this.But let me add some of my own logic to this. What the fuck is the point of getting a job or creating jobs if youre not going to make enough money to buy a house andor pay for rent and utilities? Thats what this Living wage people are talking about is. Enough money to buy food and utilities not even leisure stuff which many people in this sub also believe to be a necessity for happiness as activities one directs himself feel more fulfilling.What is the point of creating more jobs if the wealth itself is not going to be spread around? What is the point of creating more jobs if the people who have those jobs make so little money that they need to be on welfare anyways? This is obviously where many people Not you necessarily will say The free market will weed out the bad businesses!. But Nike uses overseas child labor and its very successful. Wal mart pays its employees some of the lowest wages and kills any small businesses its built near and its one of the most successful businesses in america. Look at comcast and time warner cable. People HATE them but a lot of people have no choice but to use them mostly due to the fact that the internet has become nearly indispensable in finding a new job.The free market is about as good as filtering out bad guys as a cat is at guarding a storage full of catnip infused tuna. Even if you dont agree on full on socialism or communism surely you can agree that these businesses MUST be regulated in order to ensure the happiness and overall welfare of their employees or else they wont give a fuck.

Im against capital punishment in civil society but then what was to be done with the likes of Goebells Goering and later Eichmann? People like that have no interest in being rehabilitated. In contrast President Obama made a fateful decision not to prosecute the war criminals of the Bush administration. Consequently the incoming President and his henchmen can feel free to reinstate torture and other human rights violations with impunity. We prosecute and punish crimes in part so they wont happen in the future. I dont agree with capital punishment but I recognize that it was a routine practice in even the most advanced of nations until the last halfcentury its end only made possible by a sprawling prison infrastructure capable of holding violent criminals for decades.  ,LateStageCapitalism,dati83n,3,t5_39qgx

9891118,0,t1_dawqfsp,No? I live in Orange County CA so not exactly isolated. Im sorry but your ignorance and the ignorance of other Americans on this particular subject doesnt negate literally over  years of fairly consistent usage. Just google Liberalism. Pretty much the entire American political tradition is derived from the tenets of Classical Liberalism. It eventually diverged into two major camps which is the liberal and conservative you know today. They both come from Classical Liberalism. Maybe go to your closest college and ask any political science professor to elaborate on the subject if you want more background.To say it doesnt have anything to do with capitalism is just stupid frankly. I mean capitalism is the point. Countries like the US and France had liberalbourgeois revolutions to transition to a capitalist economy rather than a feudal one where the CrownMonarchy owned the majority of property. Alongside that came more widespread individualcivil rights. It used to be nobody voted whatsoever and the Monarch had pretty much all the political power. People wrote things like the US Constitution to give political power to landowning men even if they were not a part of the aristocracy.I mean its pretty narrow minded to think the only two political orientations is liberal and conservative where one represents the far left and one is the far right. Socialism is utterly opposed to liberalism of any variety. Socialism isnt just SUPER LIBERALISM they differ on very fundamental points. ,LateStageCapitalism,dawu3im,1,t5_39qgx

10002425,0,t1_dbbaekm,The reason I was saying all that is that we seem to have an ideological conflict. I was trying to deconstruct any ideology to stick to dialectical materialism before any debate.Ok so some people are naturally good at one thing or another and it feels good to have that kind of power and provide benefit for society. The greatest minds of our time had the freedom and opportunity for selfdiscovery throughout their lives to do what they liked. But under capitalism instead of encouraging you to explore and find the thing that makes you feel good and which improves your overall potential you are under pressure economic cultural and systemic to think small and do as you are told. It also rewards the people who are good at making profit for the upper class instead of meeting needs of people. The person who is the best sycophant or one who is good at manipulating people will rise to power and influence. The person who benefits society the most does not get the most benefit from society.There are no pressures within the capitalist system itself to get rid of menial labor or to adjust jobs as they are imagined by capitalists. Capitalism is economic tyranny and a workplace runs like a totalitarian organization. Yes you do get things done but it is neither the best way nor does it provide the most benefit. The people who know the work best do not run the company. And if you take a look at workerowned cooperatives they are significantly more efficient than capitalist enterprises. When people are treated more fairly they cooperate more and accomplish more.And if you are talking about specialization of labor you are probably referring to the exploitation in the mechanized workplace aka Henry Ford. Production went up and Ford got rich but society took the bullet. Look at all the alienation suffering and inefficiency that has come to pass since. If our economy was run by workers we would have had less specialization but the technological progress would have been more advanced cooperation is innovation and more aligned to the needs of people and we would not have a place called Late Stage Capitalism.,LateStageCapitalism,dbbcf36,3,t5_39qgx

10013952,0,t3_5j2fa4,The formation of workers cooperatives en masse is mainly a means of prolonging suffering in spite of the growth of the disease  capitalism. In the real world most material production is done by heavily exploited workers which our cooperatives would have to rely on and further in a way constrained by global capitalist logic. If we ignore that reality then we ignore our comrades outside of the socalled first world. Inside the cooperative everything might be dandy but socialism for the rich and privileged is no socialism of mine.,LateStageCapitalism,dbcuhov,5,t5_39qgx

Or maybe it means being able to afford that new  p TV for Xmas that theyve been saving for  months for and a reduction in their insurance rates due to safe driving and more than halfway to their goal of taking the family to Disney World next year?

10026636,0,t1_dbe1kx4,I was a Richard who had no opportunities and was getting angry at the system. It was partially due to living in an economically depressed area of my country.I worked like a dog for a couple of shit companies that treated employees like garbage all the good ones kept leaving. I came across a job ad in my old hometown where unemployment regularly goes up to . By random chance and timing I applied and got an interview and offer I asked my old boss one last time about the promotion then gave my notice.My new company was started in my hometown because an executive simply wanted to give back to her community out of charity. There was no other reason for them to open there it was more costly than in a city less infrastructure less headache overall for a startup. But it turned out to be a great job I got  promotions and multiple raises in my first  years. I worked just as hard at previous jobs and that hard work never paid off. I was only able to get the opportunity where my hard work paid off through random circumstance and charity.I think the whole pulling your boostraps is a load of BS working hard doesnt open those opportunities for you it only pays off after you get the opportunity. This is why I believe in social democracy to give everyone that opportunity to begin with.,LateStageCapitalism,dbehy3u,34,t5_39qgx

Im an anarchist so we believe that the use of voluntary associations and workers councils direct action and general strikes are how we can topple the state and capitalism.

10124594,0,t1_dbr5rmu,If there is any industry we should allow to fail its Silicon Valley. As hypocritical as it is for capitalists to talk of the virtues of risk and then turn around and bail out big banks the financial bailouts were at least somewhat justifiable if you start with the assumption capitalism is worth saving. Even in our financialized topheavy system finance still provides an essential service to the broader market economy even if that is no longer its true raison detre. However even those who drink their KoolAid and believe their most fantastic claims of selfimportance must concede that Silicon Valley at best provides improved convenience not essential services. If a company like Uber fails its not as if people will no longer be able to get around.If there is a crash in Silicon Valley it will be interesting to see how Congress and the Trump administration responds considering Silicon Valleys association with Democratic Party neoliberalism.I think your final point is especially good.

Americans arent prepared for retirement as a whole..  Generation X is pretty much boned.  Millennials might be but have more time to correct the situation..

Businesses regularly abuse employees esp. in poorer countries and abuse customers. Yet consumer boycotts are scarce and ineffective. Why? Because the overriding concern is getting things as cheaply as possible. Walmart is an awful unpleasant business with ample competition yet Americans continue to flock there despite the many wrongs that business commits because its cheaper.

10166625,0,t1_dbw2f2d,The most important thing to understand is terminology.A country that socialists take over and run is not automatically socialist. Socialism is when workers democratically control production instead of capitalism where a small class controls production and disproportionately profits from it. The bosses the bourgeosie the capitalistalthough thats an over simplification. If your boss doesnt own the place hes a worker like you.Its not simply that countries like Russia and China were imperfect socialism it is that they were failures to establish socialism. A socialist society would look radically bizarre far more strange than the totalitarian dictatorships formed when small groups took control of a country and tried to force it to be socialist from a centralized government in a very challenging global environment.This is the socialist ideaif workers democratically controlled their work places and got to keep andor directly or indirectly benefit from all the wealth they produced instead of business owners taking that excess wealth and calling it profit the world would be a better place. That is  percent all that you can definitely say a socialist believes.Now some socialists think that a dictatorship of the proletariat is the best way to make a country socialst. This is supposedly what you had in Russia and China where the workers  take control of the central government and use that to take private property from capitalists so that the people can own it and then gradually dissoleve and weaken the central government until it is very weak and most things are decided closer to the ground level by democratic agreements among the workers.So why did that not happen in many prominent countries that try this?There are two common answers you will hear from socialists.One is that the dictatorship of the proletariat is a bad idea that things should be organized on the ground level from the moment the revolution is over. You have to bear in mind many many socialists want to do none of what Im about to describe and loathe those countries that did it. They have other ideas of how to establish socialism.The other group of socialists will be largely Marxist Leninists. As you might guess the name comes from Lenin because largely speaking they support what Lenin did and felt that his method of establishing and using a dictatorship of the proletariat was fundamentally a good idea that could eventually succeed.Incidentally almost all the countries that you can think of when you think communist like Cuba started off with Marxist Leninism as their guiding philosophy.But how do Marxist Leninists defend the fact that by their own admission Russia failed to socialise? Why is this a good idea?In short capitalist interference makes it necessary. When a country has a revolution and declares to the world we will become socialist something terrible happens. Rich capitalist countries begin to sabotage them. Russia was invaded by western powers for pulling out of the first world war inline with socialist thinking.  years later they had nazis battering down their doors inflamed by the demonisation of socialism that so inflamed nazis and which was in fact common all over the world. Most seriously all the rich industrialised countries wont trade with you. Cuba as youll surely know was subjected to decades of trade restrictions by the US and other US allied countries in the region and had to fight off a literal invasion attempt by the United States.Not only that but socialism as a theorethical idea given a lot of its clarity by Karl Marx was conceived of as the inevitable next step of society for and this is vital well developed industrialized nations. Karl Marx actually singled out countries like Germany and France as the perfect first nations to become socialist.But what happened? Russia turned first. China turned first. Poor countries agrarian countries countries with little of the industry that you need to have the kind of easy production to become socialist.So it is argued that while it is not ideal and can dangerously turn into a repressive dictatorship you need a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat to adefend against capitalist countries with a centralised well stocked army that would be difficult for a decentralised nation to organise and bto industrialise as quickly as possible. On that second point say what you will about RussiaIm not defending it morally but no country in the history of the world has industrialised faster especially in a country of that size.And there you have the rock and the hard place that many socialists find themselves positioned between. They believe that for socialism to truly be safe and successful it has to either happen in very secure rich countries first or all over the world almost at once. All socialists are united in what they dislike about capitalism but disagree about the practicalities of how to move away from it.So no they dont like Russia or China they dont see that as imperfect socialism they want to succeed where those countries failed possibly by very using different means and establish socialism which contrary to socialisms associations with austerity and bread lines and state repression in the western consciousness would based on its theoretical principles be a society with a drastically higher standard of life than our own with way more freedom in the absence of a strong central government like you have in all modern nations.,LateStageCapitalism,dbwfygo,2,t5_39qgx
10168756,0,t1_dbwcwd2,gt If capitalism got us this far why not try to return to earlier stage capitalism?Which stage though?The stage we read the western world were in  years ago? Or the one we were in  years ago Or maybe the one we were in  years agoSince I doubt youre referring to the very beginnings of modern capitalism either with their widespread abject poverty childlabour and all Im guessing you must mean some time in the near past before the most current crisis really came through. Which era would that be though? Cant be Clinton in the US the bill for his economic policies came right quick Cant be Reagan since trickledown obviously didnt work it just made things worse.Youre probably referring to that time before the time roughly between  and the oil shocks of the s. A time of strong unions social progress a growing economy and rising wages. Now never mind the whole metropolis thing cue first world this is a time thats unique in history to the point of aberration. The last big economic crisis had just been over so the lessons were still fresh in peoples minds. The biggest crisis to date by the way which had lead the world straight in to the most devastating war in the history of mankind so stuff had to be rebuilt everywhere major disasters are always good for GDPgrowth. The car industry truly went off to reshape the world which also meant massive demand for labour. Resources were abundant and easyaccess. A big bad common enemy not only lead to social cohesion but also sharpened the vision for the worst flaws and excesses of the system this is esp. true for were I come from Western Germany not so sure about the US.This era didnt really end with the oil shocks though. The end came with the widespread use of computerized automation which lead to massive productivity increases at the cost of real downtoearth manpower i.e. layoffs. Labour demand crashed. All over the place and its never truly recovered since. Nor will it ever. Around this time Keynesian policies were abandoned in favor of neoclassical theory first by Thatcher ok they actually tried it out in Chile first after they had killed Allende then by the Reagan administration and then  after the collapse of the USSR which in economic terms was basically a sudden ginormous increase in labour supply again mostly EU perspective here  for you guys it was NAFTA I guess hence wave after wave of off shoring  years and still going hence globalization becoming a curseword hence isolationism xenophobia on the rise  by the rest of the world.tldr this has escalated into a short story of LSC its overproduction! just like in the s! yay! and I should stop now,LateStageCapitalism,dbwonci,2,t5_39qgx

10275228,0,t1_dc8ki9p,Gold doesnt have any intrinsic value beyond the practical applications like electronics connectors or conductive coating a gold brick only has the value other people agree it has because you cant eat it. Its useless as a currency unless people agree to its value and if your other needs are met and you dont need gold for electronics purposes nobody is going to be able to offer you gold.Our goal is a society where gold as a currency is utterly pointless. ,LateStageCapitalism,dc8r3v2,2,t5_39qgx

10290685,0,t1_dca7d4h,You mean right now under capitalism?The big issue is that the means of production are all dominated by capitalists and are privately owned.To legally obtain these resources we would have to be able to raise enough capital which is difficult to do when working class people earn only a fraction of the value of their labor while capitalists collect the profits as passive income and can continue to reinvest it as desired. Capitalism is great at concentrating wealth in the hands of capital owners but does so by extracting value from the working class.Anticapitalists especially tend not to be people in great financial shape. A lot of us are critical of capitalism because capitalism hasnt worked out all that great for us. We arent rich. Most working class people are busy saving money to survive and if theyre lucky retire.There are workers cooperatives and the likes that can exist under capitalism but considering that they are driven by workers interests and not the profit of one person they tend not to be as competitive. Cheap labor and poor workers safety by avoiding expenditure are profitable to the capital owner but a workers collective is more interested in the wellbeing of the people involved and would have more difficulty surviving in a capitalist economy.Theres also the issue of states setting out to crush anything that threatens them. Socialism is largely more appealing to working class people as they wouldnt have to pay for access to the things they use to work so the successful establishment of some form of socialism is threatening to the current powers that be.And even if we did manage to establish a socialist society somewhere theres still the issue of obtaining resources perhaps natural resources we lack that are controlled by capitalists. We would ultimatly be forced to play the same game as before.As you can see there are a lot of obstacles involved. Considering that we see the ownership of private property and capitalism altogether as unjust for many of us the solution is to fix that unjustice to seize the means of production and to establish socialism some form or another in revolution rather than alongside capitalism.,LateStageCapitalism,dcai6t7,4,t5_39qgx

10357921,0,t3_5o6v24,Libertarianism seems antithetical to the very notion of society. The bonds of a complex social organism like the United States are more convoluted than caveman society but create a lattice of connections and public works that protect and preserve quality of life for all its members.Libertarianism seems to follow a philosophy of individual responsibility and destiny each person is responsible for their triumphs and their failures.But that is NOT how society functions. We recognize that our neighbours may not help us directly but they contribute to a social whole that lifts us all out of the dirt.I didnt build the road that carried me to work this morning nor the pipes that brought me water. I didnt write the legislation the has kept my air reasonably clean nor the laws that protected me from assault.My contribution is small and as a tech worker abstract but I help keep the wheels in motion that benefit us all.A right to healthcare doesnt mean the enslavement of medical personnel or the theft of my neighbours wealth to preserve my health. It means that like all the other public works we benefit from we choose as a society how strong and how dense our safety net is.Theres a reason why Libertarians are overwhelmingly white heterosexual men often born into wealth when you have no need of the safety net it seems like an unnecessary expense.,LateStageCapitalism,dci4q27,2,t5_39qgx

10398233,0,t1_dcmoqt4,The argument is not that it does not conform to the laws of thermodynamics rather that the human body processes various energy inputs differently. Some inputs cause the body to generate fat tissue at the expense of energy for work output like movement though etc and some inputs are effectively burned more cleanly and immediately used. Calories are just the total energy stored within something. Think of a gasoline engine. If you put in a litter of gasoline it will produce a certain amount of work energy and heat. If you put in a litter of Diesel which has more energycalories it will probably not start and if it does will run extremely poorly. You end up with less work energy output and a bunch of stored energy in the form of unburned Diesel inside of the engine. A similar thing might happen in humans were certain energy inputs are not burned cleanly but instead stored in our case as fat. And yes if the energy is stored it is not available for work and the thermodynamic equilibrium is maintained.,LateStageCapitalism,dcmpfi3,5,t5_39qgx

Its a noble idea to bring in refugees however moving in a large group of destitute people REGARDLESS of education or value to the society is going to create a huge economic shift at the beginning of a period of climate change and globally risky ventures.The strongest position Was to stay out of the wars until the end and we benefited greatly  the present success of the country that allows us to desire these very goals is a testament to that.As far as the ethics...Yeah its pretty dark.,LateStageCapitalism,dd2zyyv,3,t5_39qgx

10564168,0,t1_dd5fyve,gt  What led to Venezuelas economic breakdown? Because youre wrong is not a very convincing argument.Crash in the oil prices reducing the income of foreing currency which is what allowed the State to finance the import of food manufacturing materials etc. combined with an even more parasitical capitalist class which would scam the state out of foreign currency importing trash or not importing anything at all while sending the money to personal accounts in overseas tax havens.Extraction through smuggling of food hard currency to neighboring countries reducing availability. Coupled by capitalists hoarding most of what wasnt smuggled out.This is made easier by the fact that most of what little was manufactured in the country is owned by private companies and also private proverty is enshrined in the constitution of the country. Hardly any kind of socialism just a poorly managed capitalist crisis by a socdem country.While Chavez might have had the intentions of going full socialist at one point or another it was still a socialdemocrat.

But the real problem with minimum wage bargaining is that its a long drawnout yet temporary fix to the systemic problem of inflation.Its a distraction from greater issues really. It gets democrat votes.The problem could be solved outright by algorithmically tying the minimum wage to the inflation index. That way it automatically ups itself every year. But no politician would do that because then they couldnt use raise minimum wage as a platform for election.Granted this algorithm wouldnt actually fix inflation.

It should be illegal for anyone to take a cut from that no matter what.Though this raises an interesting ethical question about taxes on sex work.But then again ideally we would end capitalism and thus profit and sex work would be unnecessary.,LateStageCapitalism,ddn5u3e,3,t5_39qgx

That said rockets are ancient technology and the differences are small.gt gt gt gt There is nothing novel or exciting about Tesla. The vehicles are designed to maximize tax credits and they have become playthings for the rich. There is nothing difficult about making an electric car. It is easier to make an EV than a normal car.gt gt gt gt If you investigate Teslas in particular you will discover they are unreliable shit boxes which require constant major repairs. These repairs are covered under warranty so the average rich guy who owns one who also typically owns  other cars doesnt care. Despite the constant need for major repairs Teslas warranty costs are not unusual  an accounting red flag but then again his nonGAAP accounting presentation is straight out of Alice in Wonderland. The cars are also not safe and have a remarkably propensity to burst into flames. About x the rate of a gasoline car in a fatal collision no I am not going to provide references because fanboyz dont care about facts.gt gt gt gt Then there is the questionable suckering of about M of deposits for the Model . People are foolish enough to lend a money losing company M for the dream of a car they dont know the price of dont know the features of but can be assured it will be less reliable than other Teslas.gt gt gt gt The most amazing thing was Solar City which was a financial scheme wrapped around subsidies. When that failed and was weeks away from bankruptcy despite Musk using SpaceX money to keep it afloat he decided to bail out himself and his cousins by having Tesla buy it. If this gambit had failed Solar City would have likely bankrupted SpaceX as well. As it is like any good financial scheme by having a related company buy it all the financial manipulation can be whitewashed  though it is a ticking time bomb inside the ticking time bomb of Tesla.gt gt gt gt Whatever innovation people hail Musk for came from the brains of his employees not him.

It can be important for kids to have a variety of experiences and make their own choices especially at  years old and your lesson can be further compounded at the end of the fundraiser when shes won her  trinket but made the company several hundred in profit. You can also use this as an opportunity to demonstrate just how important public funding of schools is so as they dont turn their students into willing participants to make someone else rich.You are the parent though so you will ultimately be the most informed to make these kind of decisions.,LateStageCapitalism,ddr6tg8,2,t5_39qgx

10795174,0,t1_ddtfk62,I see the arguement. Im not trying to refute it but adding to how basically all property is just inherited over and over and somehow that justifies that all that stuff belongs to you when it was never earned. The fact that the traces of the attainment of such ownership has been elongated and convoluted being extended over hundreds of years masks the true way of how such a state of ownership arrived. After time especially generation later it becomes normalized. The image overly simplifies it by making it more obvious and going against what many people think today.The idea of private property is so ingrained into our society that people cant fathom a world without it and ignoring how unnatural it really is.  Ignore the coercion to maintain the existence of such as you said they perceive it as a natural state. Just two ways to reach the same conclusion.,LateStageCapitalism,ddtg1lx,3,t5_39qgx

A warning sign to me as someone with experience is that it talks about kicking back. As a grinder modified or not it should only kick back under certain circumstances which would be known to any even basically experienced TA. IE if cutting pipe you chock very close to where you cut. If you chock far away from the cutyou start cutting from the top of the pipe the pipe will collapse inwards which results in the grinder catching and kicking back in the direction of....your valuable face and hands. A simple grinder is easily capable of taking out fingers eyes cheeks. Perhaps this is a case of incompetence amongst the managerial staff.

In this hypothetical it could very well have been grain I grew myself and has nothing to do with preexisting grain supplies. gtwhich curiously enough also happens to priceout the poor and the starving from the food market because of surplus valueYoure adding information to change the entire context of your hypothetical retroactively making you morally correct. gtAlso Im not upset. If thats how you are interpreting this then go back to your postmodern echo chamber where feels gt reels.It sounds like youre the one getting emotional not me.  You claimed I was frantically picking apart the minutiae of your hypothetical when all I did was answer your question and explain why. And considering the grain was allegorical to the funds bill gates was going to donate the whole you might go out of business and youre hording food! quip doesnt make sense because Bill gates money will continue to grow and him having it now doesnt inhibit others from obtaining any money is printed by the treasury as needed. gtAhistorical nonsense! The birth of currency at the advent of grain domestication and widescale grain storage was also the birth of deflationary currency. If you dont know your anthropology then dont act as if you do.This is completely irrelevant to your hypothetical just like the monetary value of the said grain. It could be worth a million dollars or a thousand dollars. You brought up inflation when it literally doesnt have anything to do with the amount of grain being donated.  Unless the poor and starving care what the monetary value of your gift is? Im sure they wouldnt. gtAh of course. Rich people never lose money and definitely never go bankrupt. Im feeling very enlightened by your wise insights into history anthropology and economics. How can I ever thank you? By the sound of it you dont really know much about the investment market. Let me give you a crash course. There are safe investments and there are risky investments. Safe investments are guaranteed sans the collapse of western civilization. Investing in large index funds or government bonds are safe investments with usually sub  Apr and will only depreciate in the event of large economic crashes however economies do bounce back and regrow to the original value over time see  financial crisis  then there are riskier investment options for those wanting to gamble on making more then  returns. This is where businesses fail and rich people go bankrupt. This when you invest in single small and medium businesses or provide startup capital. When you have an entire staff of dedicated fiduciary whos sole full time job is to grow your funds no. You do not lose money.

10963327,0,t3_5wkhr0,Capitalism has generated massive wealth for some but its devastated the planet and has failed to improve human wellbeing at scale. Species are going extinct at a rate  times faster than that of the natural rate over the previous  million years see Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School. Since   million hectares of primary forest have been lost each year. Thats  acres or just less than the entire state of West Virginia see the  assessment by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN. Even in the U.S.  of the population lives below the poverty line. For children under the age of  that number increases to  see U.S. Census. The worlds population is expected to reach  billion by  see United Nations projections.Capitalism is unsustainable in its current form. Credit ZINIYANGE AUNTONYAFPGetty ImagesHow do we expect to feed that many people while we exhaust the resources that remain?Human activities are behind the extinction crisis. Commercial agriculture timber extraction and infrastructure development are causing habitat loss and our reliance on fossil fuels is a major contributor to climate change.Public corporations are responding to consumer demand and pressure from Wall Street. Professors Christopher Wright and Daniel Nyberg published Climate Change Capitalism and Corporations last fall arguing that businesses are locked in a cycle of exploiting the worlds resources in ever more creative ways.Our book shows how large corporations are able to continue engaging in increasingly environmentally exploitative behaviour by obscuring the link between endless economic growth and worsening environmental destruction they wrote.Yale sociologist Justin Farrell studied  years of corporate funding and found that corporations have used their wealth to amplify contrarian views of climate change and create an impression of greater scientific uncertainty than actually exists.Corporate capitalism is committed to the relentless pursuit of growth even if it ravages the planet and threatens human health.We need to build a new system one that will balance economic growth with sustainability and human flourishing.A new generation of companies are showing the way forward. Theyre infusing capitalism with fresh ideas specifically in regards to employee ownership and agile management.The Increasing Importance Of Distributed Ownership And GovernanceFund managers at global financial institutions own the majority  of the public stock exchange. These absent owners have no stake in the communities in which the companies operate. Furthermore managementcontrolled equity is concentrated in the hands of a select few the CEO and other senior executives.On the other hand startups have been willing to distribute equity to employees. Sometimes such equity distribution is done to make up for less than competitive salaries but more often its offered as a financial incentive to motivate employees toward building a successful company.According to The Economist todays startups are keen to incentivize via shared ownershipThe central difference lies in ownership whereas nobody is sure who owns public companies startups go to great lengths to define who owns what. Early in a companys life the founders and first recruits own a majority stakeand they incentivise people with ownership stakes or performancerelated rewards. That has always been true for startups but today the rights and responsibilities are meticulously defined in contracts drawn up by lawyers. This aligns interests and creates a culture of hard work and camaraderie. Because they are private rather than public they measure how they are doing using performance indicators such as how many products they have produced rather than elaborate accounting standards.This trend hearkens back to cooperatives where employees collectively owned the enterprise and participated in management decisions through their voting rights. Mondragon is the oftcited example of a successful modern worker cooperative. Mondragons broadbased employee ownership is not the same as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. With ownership comes a say  control  over the business. Their workers elect management and management is responsible to the employees.REI is a consumer cooperative that drew attention this past year when it opted out of Black Friday sales encouraging its employees and customers to spend the day outside instead of shopping.I suspect that the most successful companies under this emerging form of capitalism will have less concentrated more egalitarian ownership structures. They will benefit not only financially but also communally.Joint Ownership Will Lead To Collaborative ManagementThe hierarchical organization of modern corporations will give way to networks or communities that make collaboration paramount. Many options for more fluid agile management structures could take hold.For instance newer companies are experimenting with alternative management models that seek to empower employees more than a traditional hierarchy typically does. Of these newer approaches holacracy is the most widely known. It promises to bring structure and discipline to a peertopeer workplace.Holacracy is a new way of running an organization that removes power from a management hierarchy and distributes it across clear roles which can then be executed autonomously without a micromanaging boss.Companies like Zappos and Medium are in varying stages of implementing the management system.Valve Software in Seattle goes even further allowing employees to select which projects they want to work on. Employees then move their desks to the most conducive office area for collaborating with the project team.These are small steps toward a system that values the employee more than what the employee can produce. By giving employees a greater say in decisionmaking corporations will make choices that ensure the future of the planet and its inhabitants.,LateStageCapitalism,deasg4u,14,t5_39qgx

10987786,0,t1_decvue4,Well rentseeking is an odd term to begin with. Lets say we have landlord A owning a building that makes profit above rent for . He modifies public policy to shove the responsibility of utilitytaxsomething onto the tenants but doesnt change the rent. Now he makes profit of . Hes rentseeking. Landlord B comes along and buys the building from Landlord A keeps everything the same. Landlord B is not rentseeking even though hes still making that mth profit. Example  Landlord A and Landlord B both own separate buildings. A campaigns to have a block of tenements torn down thus increasing other housing value due to less places availible for rent  the tenements were ugly and full of lowincome people. Landlord A only makes an extra mth. off that and is rentseeking. Landlord B simply negotiates for market price next time the living contract is negotiated. He makes mth. extra and is not rentseeking. See the thing is rentseeking refers to actively trying to change the system to get more profit without doing more yourself. If you profit off of changes but you dont try to make them youre not rentseeking. And we dont expect people not to profit off of different market conditions . . . they will after all be screwed by conditions sometimes.Under socialism the reason we would see landlords be abolished is not because of rentseeking although that would abolish a great deal of them anyways but because the means of production belong to the workers . . . and the resting places are also part of your means of production. Now to answer your actual question when can landlords be considered rentseekers?aslumlords. They dont upkeep the property or do anything for it. I used examples of positive change but purposeful neglect also counts. Getting the title with no intention of putting in any work. bSuburb developers  cThose apartment buildings that always demand bus stops and light commericial zoning around them after theyre built . . . or often as a condition of being built.  dThose landlords who are constantly freaking out about anything and everything damaging their property value like whether the neighbours growing tree might prevent their waterfront claim from can see the water from the top deck or whether you can paint a particular room.Probably many other examples but you get the idea. Youll note that already covers most landlords.  ,LateStageCapitalism,dedfipd,1,t5_39qgx

I do think a large part of the problem is that most people just can not imagine a world not run by capitalism. Its a mentality issue we always expect people to earn their place and to be valuable. I do attribute this to the whole show kind of having been set up by sociopaths for sociopaths. Theyve convinced us that pooling resources to improve everyones instead of just their lives is a bad idea when really in my opinion it was the whole reason people started forming societies to begin with. So if inquired Id have to say that capitalism and the pursuit of accruing personal wealth are counter productive to the original intent of society itself. Basically the elites selfish behavior is self defeating and weakens the very system they rely on for exploitation something more egalitarian is more sustainable in the long term but thats just my cup of tea and its depressing that the so called smarter and more powerful people of the world dont seem to realize this or and this alternative is probably worse they are aware and are acting out of pure malice. ,LateStageCapitalism,dez1ygu,2,t5_39qgx

Now if you subscribe like I do to the the notion that NATO and the tensions with Russia allow the U.S. to increase defense spending thus allowing military contractors to profit then it follows that by shaming our allies into supporting NATO they will also have to increase defense spending.

11275984,0,t1_dfa3uyx,gt why are our costs so high while we are all paying so much and we arent even getting better care than most first world countries?Because during the s the government decided that HMOs were good. But people didnt want to buy into HMOs. So the government started subsidizing the bejeezus out of employers to provide HMO plans to their employees. Subsidies increase market prices. A substantial portion of the population being insured for every little thing through HMOs led to the price mechanism being ineffective in the health care market  meaning people did not choose doctors based on price but instead just went to any doctor. This increases prices. This situation also segments the health care market into two groups  those with health insurance through their employers not price sensitive vs. people with no health insurance at all extremely price sensitive. So health care providers stop providing service to those without health insurance opting to price their services according to the least price sensitive consumers. This creates an issue where the uninsured receive no care. The government solves this by making it illegal for hospitals to not provide care. So how do health care providers respond? By shifting the costs of the uninsured onto the insured. This continues to increase prices. Basically since the s and even earlier beginning in WW the government has been rigging the health insurance market in favor of large employers and large HMO plans. This has created a system where prices have skyrocketed. The solution? Get the government out of the health insurance and health care markets. ,LateStageCapitalism,dfa47ay,-1,t5_39qgx

11286411,0,t1_dfb6rqq,I think its valid to look at voting results in terms of race gender and wealth and it is important to acknowledge white womens role in electing Trump. However I dont think this narrative covers the entire story. If we look at the difference in how younger white women voted compared to older white women younger white women favored Bernie in the primaries and favored Hillary over Trump. Hopefully as the younger generations get older and gain political power we will move further left and white women will be a part of that solidarity. As a whole younger white women didnt vote for Trump but their mothers and grandmothers did. I dont know what can be done about that beyond younger white people sparking intergenerational dialogue within their families. Looking back I really wish I had had more conversations with my mom before the election even if it strained our relationship because there was a chance I could have changed one vote and I didnt take it.

Basically I had just gotten some hand sanitizer and as a joke I went Ewww and rubbed off the excess sanitizer off on his arm. He laughed I laughed went back to my desk end of story. Except when I looked to my right this woman was staring directly at me with the nastiest expression on her face. I thought it was odd but didnt think much of it and went about my day. She was my superior so she called me into her office the next day and told me CookingDrama you need to learn how to keep your hands to yourself. Ive reported your sexual harassment of male coworker to HR. I had to ask her what in the hell she was talking about and she brought up the hand sani incident. So HR calls me in and asks for my version. HR also interviewed almost every person on our team individually. Everyone she interviewed including the guy that I was accused of harassing stated that our superior was actually the one who had been harassing me from day one of my employment under her. Anecdotal evidence from each person was provided and corroborated. The guy in question also said that she made him feel uncomfortable for going behind his back and reporting something without even talking to him about it first.Turns out she was just trying to get me fired because she had a crush on him and thought I was flirting with him when I wiped hand sani on his arm. She was about  he was  and I was... . Yeah she accused a yearold woman of sexually harassing a yearold man for touching his arm without her having even asked him how he felt about it first. So she and I had to have a meeting with her boss and HR and it was extremely awkward.I ended up switching teams so I wouldnt have to work with her anymore she kept her job by the skin of her teeth due to the fact that she was a trainer and had been there for a while. He ended up getting falsely accused of SH by someone else about a year later long after I had quit and moved states then he quit. The place was toxic. When you have a gestapoesque HR department it really just escalates the situation beyond reason. These type of people who accuse others of SH just because theyre having a bad day like you said are just emboldened by a super strict HR department.Whats your story?,LateStageCapitalism,dfd4bf5,28,t5_39qgx

In medium longterm you make less money since many customer go to other shop or eat alone at home.Young students are a big part of McDo customers so having less students with money going to Mcdo that bring their friends will decrease the money income of McDo.Overtime some of those Student would have pay their tuition fees with their McDo job will abandon school study since they dont have money gt they will become adult with lowwage job that CANT afford to go to McDo to eat with their family and friends...

They tried to shield us from the fact that we were living in poverty did what they had to do to scrape by and then spent the rest on trying to make sure we had a decent childhood. We always had game consoles nice clothes and all the other stuff kids ask for but were also always on the brink of getting evicted powerwater was shut off all the time etc. And I mean it worked  I never really realized how bad our financial situation was growing up until I got older.

11563829,0,t3_64vyim,I love that movie but would you be willing to elaborate on this? I guess you can draw some parallels to the worst aspects of capitalism but I worry that youre misunderstanding the themes of the film since I really dont think there is much narrative relating to late stage capitalism though I havent seen it in a while.  To me the film is about an individuals humanity.Theres a lot of themes there but the first act in my view covers the power and consequences of the social structures ability to enforce itself. Namely many of the soldiers acceptance of the abuse of bootcamp and ultimate concentration of that abuse on Pyle right before he snaps.The second act is about the dehumanizing aspects of war itself. Jokers Absurdist philosophy which sustained him through bootcamp is tested throughout the story. Being put to the final test when he kills the young sniper and ultimately failing in the face of it all. Just as Pyle had lost himself in act I Joker loses himself in act II. Its really a story trying to confer the inevitable loss of humanity in the face of inhumanity even if the individual survives. Take a look at Apocalypse Now if youre looking for more antiwar films from the time thats the film with the iconic scene in which Ride of the Valkyries is played over attack helicopters.,LateStageCapitalism,dg6rjzh,1,t5_39qgx

Every time I started following one of these dreams and got stuck on a limit whether I tried to work past it or not I would crumble and so would everything else in my life its happening right now actually. Some of these Ive even kinda dropped as a hobby because of it.Ive come to the conclusion that being passionate about your career is a lie that capitalism sells people to try to keep their subservient workers happy. I guess if youre really passionate about the work you do more power to you but youre in a minority among Bourgeois and Bootlickers the former making hand over fist doing whatever so of course theyre happy and the latter so sold on the lie that theyre not willing to admit theyre miserable but theyll sure act like it.   ,LateStageCapitalism,dgi8qsw,10,t5_39qgx

11739746,0,t1_dgqprhx,gtThe owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the labor power of the worker. By using the means of production the worker produces new goods which become the property of the capitalist. The essential point about this process is the relation between what the worker produces and what he is paid both measured in terms of real value. Insofar as the labor contract is free what the worker receives is determined not by the real value of the goods he produces but by his minimum needs and by the capitalists requirements for labor power in relation to the number of workers competing for jobs. It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product. Albert Einstein Why Socialism?,LateStageCapitalism,dgqqam2,26,t5_39qgx

11759443,0,t1_dgsy6o4,Yes but in the long term expected government assistance is capitalized into rent. Trying to raise public assistance spending faster than the landlords expect it to rise by is unsustainable. Also when assistance spending fails to keep up with expectations the poor are pinched even harder because their rent doesnt adjust downward quickly enough. This happens whenever theres austerity or when theres a big speculative bubble building.,LateStageCapitalism,dgsynzp,4,t5_39qgx

11779584,0,t1_dgv5pip,In reality it is not the case that the most competent people rise to the top and acquire greater capital through the best application of their abilities. What happens is that those who have inherited the greatest capital start at the top and remain there regardless of their work ethic or competence.Even if we set aside the presupposition that we need private companies at all the fact is that the pyramid is supported by its base not its cap. Bosses require the workers to generate wealth and value workers do not require the bosses. Your aunts business requires the labour of its employees to generate value and wealth  without them no wealth can be produced.Is the labour of the average worker not then of the highest value to the employer? Is it not the most critically important resource to any organization that requires human labour at all? Of course it is so why arent workers compensated for their time and effort in a way that reflects their value?Employers exploit the labour of the workers taking as much of the produced wealth for themselves as possible in exchange for the minimum level of compensation and threatening workers with sanctions unemployment destitution for not complying. This is wage slavery. By hoarding wealth in this way and passing it on through inheritance wealthy classes retain economic and political power bosses are born to bosses. Socialists believe that the workers should receive a fair share of the wealth they create rather than a small fraction of it that is fair compensation for their labour which they sell to their employer. Expanded across society as a whole Socialists believe that the cumulative wealth created by society is the product of the combined labour of that society and therefore is rightfully owned socially rather than privately.,LateStageCapitalism,dgv94r4,30,t5_39qgx
