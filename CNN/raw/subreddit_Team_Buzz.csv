11349636,0,t1_dfibn11,If youre adding cheese to sauces or eggs or anything like that try Parmesan! You barely need any for a cheesy taste I add like a tablespoon to sauces and its rich but not a huge number of calories because its so strong. Also try smaller amounts of stronger cheeses to save on calories? Im a cheese junkie so I try not to even keep it in the house any more because I will just sit and eat it all in one sitting...I am lucky that I live alone so I can remove some temptations like that  my weakness is mozzarella sticks!,Team_Buzz,dfigl18,3,t5_3jkgc

11462205,0,t3_63l4ls,Its shark week and even though Ive been eating below my deficit staying away from salty foods and drinking a lotttt of water Ive been weighing in at the same weight the last  days. While Im glad Im not seeing bloating weight gain this month Im just a bit frustrated bc the scale has been hovering  for the past week or so. Heres to hoping I see a whoosh in a couple days...,Team_Buzz,dfv8fdk,3,t5_3jkgc
