You could also try to apply early action to Ohio State or Pitt where you might get some merit aid. If you increase your scores you might try Wisconsin as well.,ReverseChanceMe,d6dmip3,1,t5_3fn37

11675470,0,t3_666ltp,If youre interested in politics look at schools in or near state capitals. Honestly its one of the reasons my school is great  deep ties with the legislature in the West though. Might seem simplistic but you might find a few good options this way.   I also highly recommend CTCL to help you find questions to ask yourself  discern what is important to you.,ReverseChanceMe,dgjfisf,2,t5_3fn37
