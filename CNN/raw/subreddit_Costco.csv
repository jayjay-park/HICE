If during a particular promotional period the employee gets a bunch of cards and upgrades it goes a long way towards their likelihood for promotion.

If you are waiting for them to finish their member before you unload your groceries you are part of the reason why the lines are  minutes.It isnt a goal its a fact. Each warehouse is recorded and has to maintain their MPH. Anyone who is too low can be removed from cash duties.

Yes it will mean a cut in pay for several years but sometimes it is worth it in the long run for some people.Also if you have the ability to transfer you will move up faster.  That is what my husband did.  He worked for about  years in his hometown Costco.  It was the only Costco in a town with a high unemployment rate so no one ever left and it was hard for him to move past the cart pusher  bakery clean up  assistant stage.  He transferred to a new store in the midwest and became an auditor right away.  Now he is a manager.  Yes working nights and weekends can be hard but on the other hand it isnt terrible.  He can schedule Drs appointment during the week and not have to take time off work for it.  We can also do things like take the kids to the zoo when it is less busy.

However in this instance the manufacturer whos actually responsible for the product has a warranty in effect for as long as I would expect this product to last. This situation isnt something that I would expect Costco to take a loss on its not their fault and they shouldnt be on the hook for this.If one of their suppliers chooses to not take responsibility then it is Costcos issue if the problem is something actually manufacturer related and not bogus as Costco has chosen to do business with that partner and that partner isnt upholding their end of the bargain. Costco and some others have great return policies that arent to be abused but to be used when you really need them. When something through no fault of your own goes wrong with a product and the manufacture will not take responsibility.

10270374,0,t3_5mxdqk,Im not an eye doctor or anything but on paper it shouldnt really matter because  you need a prescription to get contacts or eye glasses. The entire premise for even needing a prescription is to create uniformity and consistency across the Eye industry. The manufacturing process is going to be the same or similar across the board with some variance in materials and handling based on the product line. No matter the product line the lenses are going to be made according to your prescription.In other words you should be  O.K. to take your script to any lens manufacturerseller and get an appropriate set of lenses. The only fuzzy area to be aware of is which product line would be best for your eyes and which other brands have a comparable product. So thats where itd be somewhat important to ask your eye doctor what brandproduct they had in mind but you shouldnt feel obligated to go with that if a competitor has a product that could work better for you and costs less.Think of it like getting prescribed a drug from your physician they may have prescribed the name brand that costs more but you can request a generic when you hand in the prescription to your pharmacist.,Costco,dc87bom,2,t5_2rsgr

11117503,0,t3_5yqgom,I dont know that you need to contact corporate it just sounds like an annoyed employee. Honestly their return policy being so liberal can hurt the company financially when taken advantage of and she probably knows thats not good for her job. I think she was definitely wrong though by the way she reacted after you said you didnt need to return them. Personally I would feel like I was taking advantage of the return policy returning something I bought  days ago but thats just me. ,Costco,des5rmk,7,t5_2rsgr

11563399,0,t3_64zcff,Costco only quotes  big agencies while some of the stuff you see on Kayak are some shady operators or other websites. Every time it gets worse where I have to uncheck a bunch of weird companies to get them off my search. Even Kayak for flights lately shows lots of prices from some odd agencies with pages and pages of horror stories. For my last trip Costco ended up being the cheapest cheaper than employee discount and cheaper than any coupon I could find. But the weird thing is that the price I ended up paying was only available for half a day when I decided to check on a whim. After I booked it I checked again at home and it went up again. So my advice is to make a reservation for pay at the counter to make sure you have a car and then check the prices every once in a while you might get lucky. ,Costco,dg6pspk,2,t5_2rsgr

11613610,0,t3_65i120,Interaction sounds poor and if its an isolated incident maybe just give the person benefit of the doubt and assume they were at the end of a long shifthaving a bad day. Happens to us all like some of the other commenters Id recommend just leaving your bags in the car and packing them when you bring your cart to the car. The checkout people have a system and having the bags packed already throws them off more likely than not. If Costco is like other stores the workers up front are probably scored on time per transaction and  of items rung up and things like that.My strategy at every store I go to is to observe how the customer service interactions work and do my best to make it easy on the employee. If Im at a fast food restaurant I will try to give my order in the order that they key things on the computer so that they dont have to delete the item and start over when I have a special request to add such as no onions on a sandwich at McDonalds. If Im at a grocery store I will attempt to put items on the conveyer belt that match so that the bagger has an easier time such as all the produce then all the canned goods and so on.So anyway way too much text to say that what you are doing isnt wrong but doing it another way may make it easier for the employees to provide that great Costco customer service we all know and love. ,Costco,dgcev3k,6,t5_2rsgr

11696014,0,t1_dgl2mwa,Honestly it sounds like you dont really need tires from Costco. Costco has quality tire brands at a fair price but they arent necessarily the cheapest and if you have an older or infrequently driven car its probably overkill for your needs. The cheapest tires at Costco seems to be the Bridgestone Ecopias and they have fairly mixed reviews.My advice Go to Walmart and get a set of Douglas tires. They are cheap as hell a set of  tires was about  for me but they are made in a Goodyear factory in the U.S.A. You can get them installed at Walmart or take them to go I had Costco put mine on for ..although that doesnt include any of the other lifetime services like rotations.,Costco,dglrff8,3,t5_2rsgr

11703630,0,t1_dgmiiam,Exactly it isnt about eating a hotdog everyday but the fact that you COULD. Most people may only do it once a week but while there decide to run in amd grab those paper towels or whatever you may had gotten somewhere else.Alot of people I know only go once a month this would get them there once a week. Also how fun would it be to have a card good for hoteogs for a year that is just a childhood dream come true. And I know they would never do this hence the dream part in the title.
