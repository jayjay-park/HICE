11137913,0,t1_deu0bny,Oh thats really easy. You just disassemble the machine and put the new CPU in the same place as the old one. If you want to see how to do it just google laptop name dissembly or laptop name CPU replacement. Replacing the CPU is different for every laptop so I cant give you a one size fits all explanation beyond dissasmble laptop then remove old CPU put in new CPU with new thermal paste a VERY small amount  the size of a grain of rice then reassemble laptop. Its stupid easy for thinkpads in general and the  in particular the  is dumb easy too. Good luck!,Thinkpads,deugz3k,2,t5_394mn
