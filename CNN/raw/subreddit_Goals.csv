6619492,0,t3_43o8fc,I dont have many hard job skills or higher education to qualify for a good career. Most of my life working in service sector whether restaurant and food service retail and short lived sales jobs where you are expected to bring in x your pay constantly. I feel like life is a highly unrewarding treadmillamp exhausted just to break even each month just to stay affloat. I have never been on a real vacation I dont go to restaurants or movies I dont own a tv set gaming or even a computerI have a low end smartphone amp borrow anothers computer when neccesary I do own a car which is  yrs old amp might fail at any time. Basically my goal is to try to carve out amp find some resources to get a real career at some point that makes a semidecent hourly wage. amp get a computer amp start payments on newer car.,Goals,d040gjx,1,t5_2qspa
