7666199,0,t3_4kamm7,This lawyer is promising to proceed the same way any debt lawyer will proceed if you default on your private loans and get sued. It is a viable tactic but you dont have to make all of your loan payments to the lawyer up until the time you get sued. Talk to all the lawyers in your area that handle creditor lawsuits.rpersonalfinance and rstudentloans are full of people who do PRpropaganda for the lenders. They will tell you your cause is hopeless. Go talk to a real lawyer. Dont make your decision based on Reddit replies.,studentloanjustice,d3dlpw3,5,t5_39ncv
