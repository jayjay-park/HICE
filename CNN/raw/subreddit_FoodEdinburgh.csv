3615088,0,t3_31dk2w,Tanjore  Disappointing if Im honest curry was a bit too greasy for me Nan bread was a bit doughy and probably a bit undercooked and the soft drinks were all flat so cant say Id be back. Portion size is ok  for  of us but still disappointed.Kebab Mahal  been multiple times and its a bit of a hit n miss if they get too busy the food tends to suffer and your waiting  mins for your mains and then theirs time you get served and its like clockwork. Curry was perfect and naan bread was crisp and light. Would avoid going on Mondays though as thats when the food tends to be leftovers from the weekend especially the kebabs.Only downside for me is that its a bit crammed in there so always feel as if once youve ate they want you to leave straight away.Portion size is a bit on the small side Bill for  of us was   no alcohol Shezan  Superb food is top notch although its pretty pricey but cant complain too much as the food is brilliant curry was spot on although my garlic naan was a bit greasy but my ordinary naan was fine. The service is probably the only thing I think they could improve sometimes you could ask for more sauce with your meal and they forget all about it same when asking for more drinks Portion size is spot on Bill for  of us was Kebabish Original  its ok nothing special but not anything that makes you want to go back in a hurry food is meh and having been to their sister restaurant in Glasgow this place defo needs to improve. Mixed grills in here are outstanding but the curries not so much another downside is that the portion sizes are tiny compared to elsewhere.My other issue here is that if you get half way through your meal and realize youll need another Naan bread or a portion of chips sometimes it can take  mins just to get the extra food. Obviously its our fault for under ordering but still youd like to think they could whip another naan upBill for  was   no alcohol Mosque Kitchen  So I started going to this place when it was initially in the mosque grounds  years ago before moving into the building opposite kfc. Similar to Kebab Mahal it depends what day you go some days when the food is fresh its brilliant but then you can go other days and the food is rank rotten as its been sat in the pot for a while and just been reheated.  Another thing to remember is you only have a choice of  curries which are premade and you just go and choose what you want rather than asking for certain dishes. Portion size is great Bill for  was   No alcohol ,FoodEdinburgh,cq4cgu5,3,t5_37mfi
