1450549,0,t3_29qex7,This is exactly how I feel about subreddits like rraisedbynarcissists. As much as I understand the pain those victims feel there is an overwhelming amount of group polarization. I have recently been diagnosed with NPD and I know for a fact that there are now thousands of people over in that subreddit that consider me an object only capable of destruction. Interestingly enough though I honestly find that this objectifying makes me determined to prove the expectations wrong and be a better person. Its rather narcissistic in itself to want to be the unique narcissist that defies expectations.So in a paradoxical way your narcissism can potentially fuel your personal improvement.,NPD,ciy3oca,2,t5_2u6be
1945740,0,t1_cknlxpt,Damn man it sounds like youre in a really dark place. Have you ever been to therapy? Im seeing a therapist right now and hes treating me with cognitive behavioral therapy. Although it might not be a cure for the core problem it can have some very positive effects through changing the narratives you tell yourself. One thing that I see in your post is that youre using the word never frequently. This is a basic rule in CBT dont use language like that in your thinking because its just impossible for anyone to predict their future! The same goes for I can only expect things to get worse with time. These kinds of cognitive distortions are amazingly common among depressed and isolated individuals.That being said Ive been thinking a lot along similar lines as you about family. Im really questioning whether I will be able to be in a loving relationship with a woman and I honestly dont know whether morally it would be good for me to be in a relationship or have kids given that Im possibly NPD. I really dont want to be an abusive fatherhusband. I feel like my parents are the only ones who can put up with me im currently living with them. So yeah... I can definitely relate to that type of thinking. I wish I could say I had resolved this issue personally but I havent. Maybe you have some insight?To be honest what gives me hope is Tai ChiTaoismZen. I think that if I can tap into the ideal mindset that they try to teach that I might be able to heal myself. Admittedly this sounds like a long shot but I think its a possibility. Im hopeful that with enough meditation and insight into myself I might be able to salvage my situation. And hey you said it yourself youre not  sure you have NPD. Maybe you have something else? Have you checked out Borderline personality disorder? Bipolor disorder? Depression? Temporary Narcissistic Injury?Even if you do have NPD there are people who are successfully living with it. There is a member in this subreddit who is in a healthy relationship with a woman and she knows he has NPD upuddlelamp. So there is reason to look up.I hope you get better.Edit Also as far as stress goes check out a book called The Relaxation Response by Herbert Benson. Its a really good explanation of a physiological process that is built into us to counter stress and has great tips on how to access it.Edit  I am having suicidal thoughts too. In fact it seems that the one thing that gives me comfort is the idea that I can always end my own life. Also Im sorry if my post is preachy. When I wrote it I was authentically trying to help. ,NPD,cknnwbm,1,t5_2u6be
3268004,0,t1_cnx3y4f,Hmmm. Hmmmm. Unfortunately I dont know either of these two. But if I had to openly look at this. Id believe that the ex isnt the narcissist. More detail and info would be better to look into this,NPD,cp0s28c,1,t5_2u6be
6743849,0,t1_cyy2inh,I watched it happen. A narcissistic woman I know very well I rent the basement of her large house started a relationship with a man who was totally unsuspecting. He moved into the house and for a couple months she faked it  she acted totally normal. Then the abuse started. Horrible abuse. Narcissistsborderlines can be very cunning and are good at hiding their ugly side until their victim is completely sucked in.,NPD,d0gvdce,1,t5_2u6be
10337781,0,t1_dcftjuc,Beautifully written.You might be right about the friendship thing. I have a hard time imagining empathy. I understand the concept of it but it sounds completely made up. I cant imagine what its like to feel the emotions of others. The possibility that other people might be able to enjoy what THEY do for their friends hadnt even crossed my mind.What exactly did your previous girlfriends do to you that you would call sadistic? What destructive things did they do to you? Im curious.I think a defining trait of my NPD is the absolute apathy that the lack of empathy entails. I cant bring myself to care about anybody save for one girlfriend who I broke up with and later came to regret it. I still miss her and maybe its infatuation but she is the only person I have ever really loved or whatever I perceive as love. However I do not feel any guilt whatsoever for the pain I brought her by breaking up with her in such a cold manner. Interpret that as you will.Back to the point I touched upon in the previous paragraph before I got sidetracked talking about my ex I am apathetic towards everything. I dont care about just about anything beyond myself. I have had family members die and I have not cared at all. I dont care about any tragedies nor do I feel any real pleasure or happiness whenever something illuminatingly fantastic happens. I just dont care what anybody else does good or bad. I dont understand the concept of feeling anything through others actions. However I am not emotionless. I definitely feel happiness sadness and anger sometimes in disproportionate amounts. But only when something affects me not anybody else.,NPD,dcfugfq,3,t5_2u6be
10658044,0,t3_5s38n7,Let go of your fear of missing out its possible its just been set up like that to prey on that weakness that narcissists have. Try rnarcissism.,NPD,ddfanon,2,t5_2u6be
10698879,0,t1_ddj21iz,I suppose it has caused me problems but I dont feel theyre problems I want to avoid. Like Ill clash with other people who have strong egos and want to control me. I dont want to be controlled and if treatment means surrendering even a bit then I dont want it. I do want a truly loving relationship but I feel that a partner who doesnt accept the way I am doesnt truly love me.,NPD,ddjid5c,4,t5_2u6be
10814112,0,t1_ddve14v,Thank you for your help I definitely will ask again on that site. Truth be told though what you said I would find here is what I was expecting to find here  that is exactly why I came here. Who better to give me an answer than those who have been through it firsthand? People who come here with a diagnosis are clearly not in denial and at least on some level they are trying to take some responsibility.I should have been more aware and considerate of sensitive emotions though I totally recognise that now. Thank you for the insight I am diagnosed with BPD I should know better!,NPD,ddvee2e,0,t5_2u6be
11348169,0,t1_dfi4k5d,I get your point. I am making no generalisation on it at all. I am biased by one relationship occupying the last three months.I see what you are saying. I too have no want to label and dismiss people as NPD inhuman. One thing for sure whatever it is it is deep seated in the person. Personality disorders in general are a tough item for everyone involved.,NPD,dfialrj,1,t5_2u6be
11509077,0,t1_dg0bkw6,I like when someone looks after me sure. But my needs arent actually that complex. I like being independent and for them to be too anyway. I dont need or want someone completely submissive at all. Sounds boring. Ill hire servants if I wanted that one day when Im running ch. And that would be easy to find too depending on what other traits you want? I want someone special and perfect. I dont want someone where we fight either. I dont believe in people acting dominant or submissive anyway. That kinda stuff seems weird to me like it doesnt register. I want someone to be in awe of me infatuated and to think Im perfect. But they have to be special themselves otherwise whats even the point and I can get other people who I dont like or respect to do that anyway. And someone who would truly be capable to understand and admire my point of view theories talents beauty elegance etc. To do all that and more theyd have to be special as most people are not worthy. Plus of course I want someone as perfect as possible just not in a way which overshadows me but the only thing Im insecure about is looks so just not better looking than me. Anything else is just a plus and would make me like them very rare learn from them as my only goal is life is to be as perfect as possible and make it more interesting.  I want someone to idealise whos special. I wouldnt associate with anything less. I secretly think Im better than everyone anyway and most people make that far too easy. Id want someone who makes me feel good because they can be like the best mirror for me too and my life is made of mirrors. Then I can only idealise myself more with them. I want to feel in love or at least my version of that. So I want someone I can admire and respect. And for it to be interesting etc. Plus I want someone who understands me better but doesnt place any emotional demands or expectations on me like most people. So thats why I was considering if someone with NPD may be best. As they would have emotions or lack of I could understand better so I may be less likely to cut contact if I feel they are getting too close. Theyd have to self aware though but its like that for anyone really. P.s. The theory I was talking about was something by Masterson about the psychological structure etc. of closeted NPD I.e covert. ,NPD,dg0k07s,1,t5_2u6be
11584437,0,t3_5wrbk8,I experience the same with borderline which Im diagnosed with maybe theyre going to change it to NPD hence why Im around here  . Its very much about women with borderline being consciously manipulative and nasty and psycho girlfriends. And Ive seen the same with narcissists too.,NPD,dg93pqq,1,t5_2u6be
