Ice Block can only be played around by using Flare.gt Second of all Frost Nova is  mana and preserves your health total more than ice block does and potentially gives you more than one turn to draw what you need to win.No actually this isnt true. Frost Nova will stall for exactly one turn. Ice Block also stalls for exactly one turn.Also Frost Nova prevents damage equal to the attack currently on the board. Ice Block prevents all damage past the lethal amount. Those two numbers are extremely hard to compare.gt You can on consecutive turns cast AoE freeze spells to slow down the board.Sure hence the Frost Mages of yore. Ice Block is good in that deck absolutely.gt Neither of these spells are good in anything outside mage burn so its just odd to me that you consider ice block a good card and frost nova not.I dont so much think of Ice Block as a good card as I think most of the other secrets have no use. At least Ice Block does something useful. My note of Ice Block was made in that vein.I do consider Frost Nova to be much worse than Ice Block however so dont have a problem putting it on the bad list.But you are right in the sense that Ice Block mostly goes with Mage burn. I wasnt really trying to claim otherwise.gt Counterspell has more utility outside that deck than either of those.Counterspell can be played around which makes it mostly useless.

Mage uses removal possibly even freeze based removal to remove your slow stream of minions thus not having anything when the big guns come out.  They wont CCremove it allowing you to pick away at them or remove key minions of theirs.As long as you keep  minions at a time on the board to avoid frost nova while you wait for your big guns it shouldnt be too bad.

1246310,0,t3_28cjrn,Not really be best player out there but Ive played Zoo exclusively to rank  and am familiar with many of the matchups.People say Control Warrior does well vs Zoo but Im personally not so convinced. My winrate vs Warrior is  all but  of which were against control the outlier being that enrage aggro deck. However its worth nothing Ive only had data vs about  Warriors so its not necessarily accurate. Still I think it says something at least about the matchup.Control warrior is a very slow deck and Zoo shouldnt really have too many troubles establishing board control early. You really need to be careful since there are many different iterations of Zoo that counter your removal.Example Divine Zoo makes Whirlwind a very useful card since it pops all the bubbles. However more recent Zoo players will run Amani Berserker making Whirlwind a very dangerous card to use unless you have a way of dealing that  extra damage in hand. Cleave runs into a similar problem.Fiery War Axe is something you want  of the time against Zoo...but if the Zoo player drops a Shieldbearer the effectiveness of your Axe is greatly reduced.Generally speaking you want to try to be efficient rather than trying to keep Zoo down. No matter what you do Zoo will be spitting out minions every turn. You may not necessarily be able to destroy them all so do not go overboard and burn too much trying to. Obviously if theres a  Amani Berserker staring you down youre going to have to use Slam and accept that you lose a bit of value. But dont do it to clear the Turn  Flame Imp necessarily for example.DO NOT use Execute except against the Doomguards. That is easily the strongest card in Zoo except for those that run Blood Knight and get a good activation off. Unless the Zoo player has full control of the board when he plays Doomguard removing it immediately usually means you now have full control of the game.I would also be conservative with my use of Shield Slam. Save that for a big minion as well.Im not convinced with Brawl as a counter to Zoo. Zoo players will already be playing around BaronWhirlwind so you probably wont get too much out of Brawl. Although I do see the merit if things get out of control but at that point Im not even sure Brawl will really save you.EDIT Ive played against a few Control Warriors that ran Carine and Slyvanas. For some reason those matchups as always the hardest probably because the lack of silence makes Zoo extremely susceptible to their highvalue deathrattles. They are a little slow but if you arent in terrible shape by turn  forcing the Zoo player to have to clear them theyll likely turn the game in your favor. The fact that Doomguard lives after killing Slyvanas is huge as well.,CompetitiveHS,ci9tq31,1,t5_31ns2

Part of the innovation that resulted in the OP deck we see now was realizing that VC offers the player a use for cards that otherwise would be dead in their hand. I do not want to discourage you but the consistency of the deck is somewhat degraded without him. I played a ton miracle at a high level both before and after Atak and company developed the modern version. What seems obvious in retrospect was really hard to see at the time.

Kobold Geomancer spellpower only Loot Hoarder card draw only and Wild Pyromancer kind of a spellpower but AoE style and hurts your board as well are the closest and none of them quite do what Thalnos does.,CompetitiveHS,cii94ca,1,t5_31ns2

Id also consider making the Rogue deck a little more Tempo. Maybe drop the lowerimpact cards like LeperRingleader. Bring in techanswer cards like Blood Knight and BGH. Yeti would be solid in that list as well. I usually fare pretty well against Aggro Rogues as Tempo.

The general consensus is usually that aggro decks are a good option for the start of the season as you either win fast or lose fast. More games means more chances to win more chances to win causes you to rank up faster.However for the long haul I personally suggest playing the deck youre used to.

1401621,0,t1_ciruh9m,I dont know if this will help OP but I feel I learned pretty fast and this was how. I like to make my own decks. Playing only a few decks that you constantly modify is a huge learning experience. It is helpful to record the games as well or just keep stats. I got to rank  last season on a hunter deck I made upit was a little similar to mid range hunter which I looked up later I didnt even play that much because I took a huge several month break from hearthstone and played a lot of other games. In fact I got to rank  almost entirely in  day the last day and Im sure I could have gotten much higher if I actually played throughout the season.Figuring out your own deck is extremely difficult and a good way to learn. Your ability to analyze a cards value goes up out of necessity. You have to be able to predict your matchups well. You learn the valueable lesson of specialization. Dont try to make a deck that would win every matchup make one that will do REALLY WELL against some matchups and really bad for just a few while making sure you realize which decks are popular. For example I was playing an aggro warrior I switched in cards to help with some of my worst matchups but it resulted in me still losing to those matchups and now having a considerably lower winrate vs my good matchups as well. Its also a good idea to keep track of your decklist as you change it.When I go back to established meta decks I can actually tell why they are good almost immediately. Since Im so familiar with deck building myself I can see what they are trying to do with it and after just a few games it becomes obvious why the deck shines. Almost every deck also benefits from modification both to your budget and for modifying to the current meta and these are skills you learn from making your own deck very well. Essentially making your own deck is like handicapping yourself. If you get any deck that is actually decent from doing this not only will you feel like a badass but when you go back to premade decks it will be like the training wheels are off and the game becomes much easier in comparison. ,CompetitiveHS,cirz1zt,7,t5_31ns2
1408809,0,t1_cisu0xw,I would agree. I used him for a while in a midrange shaman deck. He would occasionally just dominate closing out a game if I had any semblance of board control. Once I even lived the dream and had a taunt totem and Flametongue up the enemy turn before consisting of dealing with a fire elemental. That sealed it. A  respawning taunt after removal was burned.That said Ive replaced him with Doomhammer which is MUCH less situational. ,CompetitiveHS,cisvgso,5,t5_31ns2

Obviously if youre pouring most of your hand onto the board your reasoning isnt just lol spending mana!! its like you said above youd be putting the cards on the board for the reason keeping up tempo more use on the board than in hand waiting for later. Those reasons arent I have spare mana so Im going to play these cards.Perhaps I wasnt clear enough my bad.

Personally the viable way to activate the egg is going to give it  attack from abusivedark iron dwarf and then run it into a creature with at least  attack hopefully trading in the process killing a  would be a huge tempo boost.You can also taunt it up with sunfury or argus. It allows your opponent to dictate how and when the  comes into play AND becomes an even bigger silence target but will still probably be a good trade regardless.Using two mana to activate the egg without getting any other benefits probably isnt the way to go. ,CompetitiveHS,cj5dpvf,5,t5_31ns2

You come to a point where your opponent drops a ysera and unless you have a way to deal with her  hp you can just watch her endlessly trading with your board.

1595449,0,t1_cjg9env,I think that Farsight just isnt a very good card.  You spend  mana and a card to get  mana and a card.  Okay so its a little more complicated than that of course.  Youre hoping that you can jump above curve and play something earlier than you would otherwise be able to.  This means you are hoping to play Farsight as early as possible.  Then there are only a handful of cards that you can and would want to play earlier that you otherwise wouldnt be able to.  Earth Elemental is one but only if you also have Ancestral Spirit otherwise you just spent  mana that might just be removed by a Big Game Hunter or some class removal.  You need to draw it with Farsight by turn  for that to help.  Azure Drake and Fire Elemental might be nice if you play it by turns  or  respectively.  Ragnaros would be great if you could play it a couple turns early.  Thats about it.  So if you draw it very early and you draw one of these cards and its the right situation it helps.  Meanwhile you are delaying the use of  mana which is a bad thing just like overload is generally a better way to spend mana and anytime you play it you run the risk of drawing a card that costs less than  mana  of the cards in my deck.  Then you lose mana with probably no benefit.,CompetitiveHS,cjg9yaj,1,t5_31ns2

1821352,0,t3_2fem6z,Though warrior is a bit better against face hunter paladin offers a few other benefits aside from the great weapon and the best pure board clear. People are not expecting the matchup. While lots of people get practice playing against face hunter zoo ect there are not as many paladins on the ladder. Knowing your matchups inside and out will often leave you significantly more prepared than your opponent running a control pally deck. Ive seen lots of people misplay against my paladin deck which just lets me continue my slow Stalingradesque grind to value supremacy. Its pretty good against the decks that are good against hunter. Pally vs warrior is a matchup that I love playing. Its an epic chess match and one I feel that paladin is well suited to play. Personally Ive been facing a lot of counter hunter decks and pally is well suited to go the distance against late game decks. Its also decent vs face hunter though always a nail biter.Its incredibly hard to play. A plus or minus depending on your preferences but I love the chess match that is control paladin. Its all about the long con battle for value. Who can get the extra pawn that can snowball into a th inning win. Dropping the wrong card at the wrong time is enough to determine the game but the satisfaction of a win is awesome. Deffo a slow climb from the bottom of the ladder esp if warriors show up to play. But everyone likes an underdog. ,CompetitiveHS,ck8nrs1,4,t5_31ns2

2090537,0,t3_2iu6s5,I love these decks! Heres mine that Ive been working on. Still undecided about x hellfire or x shadowflame but..x Power Overwhelming  x Ancient Watcher  x Nerubian Egg  x Sunfury Protector  x Earthern Ring Farseer  x Void Terror  x Shadowflame  x Defender of Argus  x Hellfire  x Voidcaller  x Loatheb  x Pit Lord  x Doomguard  x Sludge Belcher  x Siphon Soul  x Sylvannas  x Alexstraza  x Jaraxxus  x Molten Giant  Mine is similar to yours but with less emphasis on early game. The strength with my list is the incredible INCREDIBLE midgame. Eating a voidcaller is just so stupid right now. I also made a bit of a post on my thoughts with it maybe take a look.

But that hurts the other matchups a lot too. ,CompetitiveHS,cl6f5xi,1,t5_31ns2
2110530,0,t3_2j360z,Hunter  wlThe dreaded hunter. It doesnt matter if its face or midrange you mulligan the same.  But if they try to slam highmane on you youre probably winning this one.Mulligan Earth shock early board presence three damage removal.  Rockbiter over lightning bolt as you cant afford overload but better to take a guaranteed response to undertaker than a chance at one.  Keep ferals on coin or with earlier plays.ETA Coin  Use coin asap.  Get that creeper out t or play chow  removal coin into ferals coin out a totem or two drop if you used bolt t.  That totem can absorb attacks or be left up for a flametongue or protection from spirit wolves.  Searing trades with a lot of their minions and makes your spells more effective.  Spellpower and taunt always draw damage usually healing totem too and if they leave it up and you get taunts youll get a lot of value.  You want initiative on board as quickly as possible.  If you end up with an awesome curve an early belcher is always nice to have though.What to watch out forTraps!  In general dont proc unless you can handle it or in anticipation of a bow.  If hes got a bow up you can often afford to wait for a more favorable position.  Explosive argus can be a good response especially if you argus a healing totem.  Sometimes youll want to pop it even if it gives a charge if youre setting up taunts.Snakes Ignore it until your board can handle it or you can storm it out.  If he gets up a taunt well crap.  Signs its snakes he slams a juggler or a taunt.  Try to use spell removal for a taunt or juggler and truck face.  Freezing  You want to send back argus or a totem activated by flametongue or rockbiter.  Just let your taunts sit.SnipeMisdirect  Whatever.  Misdirect shouldnt matter.  Just roll some totems and attack with something weak.  Argus is good if you know its snipe or pop a creeper.  Spirit wolves dont get sniped.Bow  Wolves stop the bow from getting to your face.  If its t and he has a trap try to pop it to avoid bow charges if you can.Houndmaster t or  with coin is houndmaster turn.  Kill beasts before that even if popping that creeper gives him more damage.Unleash  Without buzzard this is less potent but now they run juggler cult master dire wolf alpha andor timber wolf.  Theres not much you can do.  Play around it a little bit but dont worry too much.  Lots of things with more than one health are a problem for unleash  more than two with buffsjuggler   so spirit wolves belcher and argused totems are a good stop gap.  And now they dont get insane card advantage after doing it usually.Highmane You want hex but you have other methods of removal.  A fire elemental in response takes out a chunk and you can use spellsboard to clear the rest.  If youre desperate you can just taunt up as well to get it weakened then follow up with a better answer next turn.Card UsageEarth Shock  It can be worth it for tempo to shock out a t leper gnome to protect early totems but ideally you want to hit scientists then creepers with spellpower or one damage from the board.  T webspinner is not a threat but he is a threat t.  Try to shock out beasts before they get houndmastered not after but if you draw into it earthshocking a houndmastered creeper or webspinner is good value.  Mad scientist is a huge tempo swing for the hunter and you dont want him to get it.  If he wants a secret make him pay for it.  In the mid to late game if hes card poor loot hoarder and webspinner also become good targets.  Keep him top decking.Rockbiter Probably your best response to a t undertaker on coin or a t undertaker coin lepergnome as it doesnt slow you down with overload.Lightning Bolt Its pretty expensive for the early game but on coin it works in a pinch to shut down undertaker and you can still coin into a two droptotem or follow up with another  mana removal.  Its best mid game for killing jugglers cult masters houndmasters and animal companions while also developing your board.Creeper Unless youre handling an undertaker you want the spiders out on board before you start spending one mana removal.  Hunters dont ping so pop him for more damage.  Worth coining out.Hex If you think theyre face you arent going to find better targets than companions scientists houndmasters and your other earthshock targets.  Im still not clear on whats what with Hunter lots of variations.  Its hard to predict whether you ought to hold out for highmane.  I mean wolfriders a pretty good tell but other than that cult master juggler houndmaster owl even tbk and belcher get run in both highmane and nonhighmane builds.  So youll have to go off ladder experience.Lightning storm This is a big tempo loss early game.  You want it mid game to deal with snakes unleash or a flood of small minions after they draw off of loothoarders or cult masters.  Also cleans up the second half of a highmane and other assorted hunter rubbish on the board.  Good odds it can kill a houndmaster.  Really theres not much storm cant kill with a little help in a hunter deck.  The question is whether its worth the cost  usually its awkward as its blocking your  and  drop minions.Feral Spirits  In contrast ferals are definitely worth the cost early game.  They trade favorably with all the early drops and eat up bows.  If you have  mana removal in hand coining them out can be a good way to get early tempo.  Even without one mana removal coining them out can be good if you have plans for your  mana turn.Flametongue In most other matches you want to make sure you get value out of flametongue.  Vs hunter use it whenever it works.  You dont often need  attack to clear anything other than an animal companion so just activating a totem and forcing them to expend a bow charge or a huffer attack can be good enough.  It can draw kill commands if you can set it up behind a taunt as well.  You use it to stall activate totems or even pair with argus and another fresh totem and threaten them when you get some tempo on board forcing them to use their reach on it.Argus sometimes its hard to double buff with him but a  and one buffed totem is typically good enough if you have to do it.  When you have board try to protect your damage output drakes fire ellies tbk rather than taunting it by taunting totems and spectral spiders.Doomhammer You can use it for some board control but be careful.  Your health is important so its best to let your board take the heat and use the hammer on their face.AlAkir Use him aggressively to protect yourself and get board control no point in holding on to him for a finisher combo when youre under pressure from the hunter.WinningYou win by shutting down their early board with removal and board presence outvaluing them with midrange minions leaving them topdecking then racing them down.  Your concern here is gaining tempo against the hunter not outvaluing him.In early game youre mostly fighting for board but in the midgame you need to start judging when you need to trade and when you need to put the pressure on him. If you arent getting in damage in the mid game you might not be able to finish him fast enough in the end game.  At some point youll get a stronger board and some defense and hell have to make the trades.  Just keep in mind the ways he has to blow past your defenses houndmaster unleash mark kill command tbk and play around them the best you can by denying beasts and setting up multiple taunts.  ,CompetitiveHS,cl83ddk,17,t5_31ns2

2126393,0,t3_2j99p7,Having read the arguments for both plays and with no further information I would play the fireball here. I feel like having  extra reach is not worth potentially losing the board to another bigger minion. Also against a warrior there is lots of opportunity for them to armor up and nullify the threat of a fireball. For instance if you were against a shamanhunterrogue and youd managed to get him low you could very slowly set the fireball up with pings to the face andor any other spells you managed to pull. Against warriorpriest etc you have a much harder time setting this up. The situation has to be kinda perfect for fireball.

The card clearly needs to be looked at IMO.Also I do not recommend Handlock as a deck to switch to on occasion.

Your goal should be to get them down to extreme danger health levels lt and ignore the possibility of molten giants. Try to save Kill command for the final lethal push as much as possible for when they have taunts up. Basically try to rush them down bluff their twilight drake with a trap even if it isnt freezing play as if they dont have molten giants in the first  turns Keep in mind past turn  they might have a health reset to  so dont burn KC for a  turn lethal on turn . Just play like they dont have the answers to your threats and youll win about  of the time where they dont.

2238136,0,t3_2ks7n7,Ive been playing an altered to fit my card collection Math warrior on ladder and its got a strong win rate vs hunter and zoo  on zoo and  on hunter.  Unless you get badly outdrawn its hard to lose to aggro and all of the worst matchups will be illegal or much weaker control Priest without cabal or lategame legendaries should be manageable classic control warrior wouldnt exist and without combo or lores Druid will be much weaker.  Id guess shamans will be playing bloodlust or zeus shaman and either way theyll play a lot of weak minions on the board perfect for that warsong  gt frothing gt break your deathsbite and suicide a ghoul combo.  If you can prevent them from using bloodlust until you have combo in hand its gg.  Ive only faced one tempo rogue on ladder but it was a really easy game so that matchup wouldnt scare me too much either.The only decks that would scare me playing this would be secrets mage and deathrattle priest.  Deathrattle priest is just because I dont know how much of the bad priest matchup comes from cabals everytime I think they wont have a second one... they steal my acolyte.  So far secrets mage has seemed to be an close but favored matchup but my sample size is way to small to know.TLdr  Aggro decks will probably be popular and antiaggro math warrior with armorsmith crushes those and is generally strong against decks that build up late board control because of the warsong burst combo.The decklist is here and the changes Ive made for mine are grommash  TBK  Ragnaros  frothing berserker I dont have  run  if you have them  raging worgen  armorsmith  ironbeak  whirlwind.

Learn what board clears he has and play around them no matter what. Two easy ways to do that dont overextend by playing too many minions and have deathrattles on the board. Ask yourself if the roles were reversed would you clear this board? If yes do not play more minions on to it.There are additions but in general the board clears to NOT ignore are below listed with the turn they become available.

Unfortunately the deck is a bit harder than it seems its a lot more than tap tap giant. Shaman is just a very solid choice overall and has decent matchups against most everything. I would say they are also pretty easy to play.Control priest is really strong because it is very good against the aggro face hunter and zoolock matchup which are all over the ladder you also already have sylvanas so you probably wouldnt need to craft very much. Miracle rogue is definitely my favorite class and the one that I have the most fun playing.

Your sample pool is smaller you see.That was the most basic example I could come up with to prove to you why your calculations are wrong.Now lets apply this to Hearthstone. Game starts you draw  cards. Your deck now has  cards.or  if you started second and draw one extra Oh. My. God. Is this real Hearthstone?! And furthermore you need to take into account WHICH cards you drew and substract them depending on their mana costs for each probability case separately.Furthermore before all this you need to calculate the chances of having Call Pet in your opening hand if you want to be real and see in how many games will it pull off something good.Why the hell are you calculating a one out of ? Why the hell were you calculating a one out of  in your previous comments in the other sub? I dont get it!

2552474,0,t3_2oyro0,As a Warlock lover the new cards got me excited as well. As soon as the expansion was released I crafted two Floating Watchers and theyve done good for me so far so I think you should always put at least two of them in your deck. I put two Mistress of Pains in my deck too because the healing benefit is just too good. Because of the heal from Mistress of Pain Im able to put one Pit Lord in my deck. Honestly I think Sense Demons is kinda useless since your hand would be full of demons since its a demonlock and if it shows up in the late game youd just get imps from it. Bane of Doom is pretty weak for me too since its always a random demon that shows up and situational cards arent exactly gamewinning. With Implosion youd get at least  damage and youre sure of at least   imps on the board so I think implosion is better than Bane of Doom.So yeah those are my thoughts.

The purpose was always a primary win condition agaisnt paladinhandlockpriest because quite often in these games at some point you have a board full of totems that they dont really want to clear but you cant overextend into a boardwipe. Its not a win more card in these matchups because all of those decks are able to win if you let them stall long enough paladins less so after gvg because they are less controlly.It also gives a lot of surprise wins vs. aggro when they set up lethal and ignore your board for example mana tide  broken creeper   damage with bloodlustflametongue.At its worst its a completely dead card super overcosted flametongue. This is why the deck needs to be tuned into having very few other dead cards even if you run only  bloodlust.This is the deck Im running at the moment rank  legend push starting.

My meaning was that it focused more on the board and building up power on it rather than the cycle hunter focused on buzzard unleash card draw or face hunter focused entirely on doing damage to the face and not particularly caring if minions survive a turn. As for Leeroy Id imagine that its better against control where you might find yourself topdecking for that last bit of damage as it represents  damage in a card so  with hero power at  mana in top deck phase. ,CompetitiveHS,cnd3li0,2,t5_31ns2

2735415,0,t3_2rd8yv,Regarding the fatigue druidi think it is really interesting but still lacking especially if your opponent knows what he is facing and doesnt waste cards to press for face damage and overextendin fact my last match to reach legend  was vs a fatigue druid.On the flare topicits a card that helps you out in the meta because of all the hunters and even freeze mage or mech mage variations with scientistssecrets.also i like that it cycles and thats why i prefer it to mystic cause it helps you dig into your deck for highmanescultmasters vs control decks rather than playing a  mana cost minion with stats that would be mediocre even for a drop.About Dr Boomalthough i love it as a card in general i tried it out and it just feels too slow vs aggro while at the same time it gives a bgh target to control decks and even midrange ones as most of them seem to run it at the moment..being the only bgh target in a deck is really bad so i decided against it in the end..Considering Jabs hunteri like the list but it seems to me a bit weaker vs controlwithout the sticky shredders and the cult master for the draw..also explosive trap can a lot of times be a drawback vs warrior.Finally i think shredder is one of the best gvg cards and drop at the moment.His deathrattle summons a  average giving him a  value that needs double removal.forcing our opponent to silence it leaves him vulnerable to our highmanes and even houndmasters.also most of the time your opponent will try to force you to trade it so you cant immediatly attack with the deathrattle on your turnallowing you to get better trades or even cult mastertradesdraws,CompetitiveHS,cnf069l,3,t5_31ns2

2805374,0,t3_2s6dqi,Heartharena always attempts to draft whatever it can get thats closest to a tempo deck. Sometimes it cant and you get aggro midrange or control but generally it tries to tempo deck.Most of the cards it picks will be the same pick a pro would make. Where theres a close choice it will pick towards tempo or filling a gap in mana curve. The pro might instead pick the card that matches his style.Some players prefer control decks in high win arenas. They have to be able to survive the low win aggro decks and still beat other control decks. Heartharena wont typically always aim for a control deck. Thats why most pros differ in some picks from heartharena. It differs from their style in certain subtle ways.Also if you put  pros together in a cooperative draft they will often choose different cards from each other. Each picks to their style. But once they get into a game they very rarely choose different plays and trades.There are multiple ways to draft a  win deck but you have to mulligan and play your hand perfectly with consistency.Pretty much all that from listening to Educated Collins.One example is educated collins when given the choice between a  and a  will usually pick the .

2820504,0,t3_2se3rw,I think I can relate to you pretty well.A little bit about myself  Once upon a time I played CS . at a very competitive level.  I played in the invite divisions for the major leagues in NA from  to  and won several LAN tournaments.  I too play CSGO and like you I find it hard to make time enough to play at the level I am satisfied with.  Currently LEM in matchmaking though I dont ever play matchmaking I also average RWS on ESEA well above the mean.  If I had the time like I did back in the mids I would be SMFC or GE and  RWS on ESEA I used to average above FPR and ADR back then.I think that as competitive gamers apparent from our time in CS the thing that drives us most is winning.  Its not playing fun decks like mill RogueDruid or RNG Priest or something like that.  Its playing high win  decks that do well on the ladder ultimately because we like to win games that fuel our competitive fire.You cant look at Hearthstone like you do CSGO.  In CSGO you can play one match and have enough action it in to catapult you into the next match because youre riding that competitive high.  This does not work for Hearthstone because of many things mainly how quick the games are in relation and that they are all cerebral requiring  twitch skill crazy reaction shots insane movement plays etc.  When you play Hearthstone you cant consider  game a win but rather a group of games.  So I use tracking software to track my win  and use that as a benchmark for success.  Right now Im maintaining a  win rate and thats what I play for.  That is what motivates me.  Getting to  or maintaining it.  If I lose I play again and try to get it back etc. and so forth.  I play for the win .  ,CompetitiveHS,cnoongx,1,t5_31ns2

Also which cards aside from acolyte armorsmith taskmaster and waraxe do you keep or mulligan for? Black Knight against Druid for exampleFinally when playing against control do you tend to play cards like Boom on curve for board presence or do you bait out enemy removal with belcher and shieldmaiden before dropping big hitters?EDIT Another question I had is how do you prioritize face damage?

2969122,0,t3_2u6muj,I would do my best to take advantage of the multiple deck possibilities. Youll be limited to  so you can bring  copies of each deck with  having  copies. Mage has mech freeze fatigue. Freeze and fatigue both take a good deal of practice to play well though so tread carefully there. Druid is a good class to have multiple decks in and is strong in the meta. You can run double combo or  FoN  roars is my favorite and full taunt ramp with the faster version being better against warriorhandlock and taunts being better against more aggressive matchups I think the mirror you will probably want taunt as well but im not sure on that matchupI would normally bring hunter to a tournament but Im really unsure on the postnerf state of the class so I cant really help there. An old list would probably be fine though. I like bringing warlock since it opens up both zoo and handlock. The popularity of BGH and zoos current state means that the class isnt the best pick to bring however. Handlock is still the best class to bring against priest probably which I think will pick up some popularity as a counter to paladin. Paladin is a really strong class in the meta currently. You can bring  versions of the midranged paladin with different numbers of equalities quartermasters etc maybe even the double LoH version. Priest is either the most flexible or least flexible depending on how you look at it. I could easily make  different priest decks for different situations based on what matchups I expect to face mind blast velen plus double death lightbomb and silence for handlock holy fires for hunter thoughtsteal for control matchups pyro  cheap spells for paladin  mind controlsblack knight for taunt druid etc etc. Im really not sure Id feel comfortable bringing priest to a tournament format where I will be forced to play it however. especially if they can queue handlock into it Id bring druid over warlock personally as Id expect a good number of BGH in tournaments and combo druid is pretty good against many of the common tourney control decks. Also ramp taunt druid is arguably the strongest deck on the ladder ATM along side paladin. ,CompetitiveHS,co5lr34,3,t5_31ns2

3210628,0,t1_couhw8f,Arent you sort of ramping into nothing with that replacement though? Not that theres a huge difference between six and seven mana but I just dont see a strong enough case for Wild Growth at that point especially if youre subing out Cenarius as well.Missing those three cards I basically see three options asside from biting the bullet and crafting Bring in Dr. Boom and possably another highvalue legendary or two with Ironbark Protectors if you feel you need the taunts. Switch to a double combo build dropping the Wild Growths and using the three open slots to shore up your early game. Switch to a more midrange oriented build with more sticky minions and possable a second Roar again dropping the wild growths. This would likely be the build where Sunwalker would fit the best.,CompetitiveHS,cous4nq,1,t5_31ns2
3212174,0,t1_couw45x,HiGreat question! This deck fares FAR FAR better against rogue than the standard control priest. Deathlord and other taunts are MVP in this match up since you want to drain the rogue of cards. The biggest nemesis has traditionally been Sap which completely wrecks priests attempts to establish a board presence and tempo. Less spells more lt mana minions with a large health pool improves this match up significantly. I cant say any winrates since I havent kept track of my wins but I can definitely say it is a lot better than a more spell heavy priests.Lightbomb kills all their minions except Violet Teacher and I actually currently run  copies of it instead of thoughtsteal.,CompetitiveHS,couxxk2,2,t5_31ns2

3234070,0,t3_2x4s4j,I didnt want to make a thread for this but Id love to hear your opinion about some possible card choices in midrange paladin.Almost all midrange lists run two quartermasters. I understand that its a very strong card but I always use one muster for battle on turn  or on turn  with a knifejuggler which leaves only one muster left for quartermasters. This often causes one quartermaster to be kind of dead in my hand. Just like you I also thougth that adding a healbot might be nice so do you think that replacing one with a healbot is a good idea or not?Quite some lists are also running coghamer but Im not really happy with it. Id rather replace it with another three drop so I was thinking bgh or mct. I dont have that much experience with mct so whats your opinion about mct also in comparison to bgh?Harrison isnt a bad card but I couldnt really find anything to cut. Do you think he should be played right now? Oil rogue often blade flurries immediately and doesnt run ass blade so hes not that valuable. Its also a very difficult matchup so Im not sure if teching against it is worth it. Mage amp Druid dont have weapons. Its decent vs warriors they of course dont run gorehowl anymore decent vs midrange hunter probably too slow vs face hunter great vs paladin muster ashbringer unused truesilver good vs priest if he thougthsteals your weapons decent vs shaman if they dont run doomhammer nonexistant on ladder good vs Jaraxxus but only demon warlock is a bit existing on the ladder the other deck that often times playes Jaraxxus handlock is nonexistant.Extra info I was rank  with a  winrate would of course be a lot lower in legend at the th of february.

3358553,0,t1_cpaqeqg, You cant compare ferallava shock to sludge belcher. Feral spirit is a  cost card with  overload not a  cost card. Lava shock has a completely separate effect. I can guarantee feral spirits is a better turn  play than sludge belcher and lava shock is a better card when you are  dmg off lethal lol. Anyone who plays shaman knows the dilemma of not being able to use overload cards because of how your curve lines up. Lava shock allows more options to efficiently use your current mana and cards in hand. I see this come up in like half the shaman games I play I want to use lightning stormferal on turn  but I cant because it will ruin my fire ele play for the next turn. I dont know if lava shock will be heavily used but I dont think its a gimmick at all.,CompetitiveHS,cpb3lyc,1,t5_31ns2

3376588,0,t1_cpcuts1,I can give you some examples. If you are playing combo Druid you want to be able to have creatures on the board so you can combo them later. There are pretty good substitutions for certain cards if you do not have a card like Sylvanas or Piloted Sky Golem then you can use Frost Elemental instead.Druid has problems with not having hard removal and weak AoE so they put in tech cards like BGH Black Knight and Mind Control tech to help them.Minions that are difficult to remove are some of the deathrattle minions or minions with stealth.When it comes to Paladin What is your win condition? For many Paladins it is something like Tirion and Muster for Battle  Quarter Master. Against enemy control decks it can be a fatigue game against Priest or Warrior since your hero power can eventually wear them down so your win condition becomes being able to press the hero power button as much as possible which is also how Shaman beats Warrior.,CompetitiveHS,cpd5mn3,2,t5_31ns2

It is like NeptulonI mean  murlocs are not good sure they have some synergy to degree but the four cards give you more options more potential moves to make. Take it for facevalue its  mana draw four cards sprint with a threat on the board to boot. So what if the four cards are shitty murlocs? Four minions are four minions. No one is forcing you to play shitty murlocs but the option is there should you want to take it. Nefarion is much the same. You cant expect him to only give you good cards Archmage exists already. But you can expect him to give you a big body and more options in the late game. It is a  mana  draw two cards. Again so what if the cards are shittyunplayable? You get more options.

The key to winning the matchup is board presence and a huge bladeflurry. Given the amount of pure damage in the deck I dont think its a mistake to use burn on the big minions if it lets you keep your minions alive.

3549303,0,t3_30xjkd,So I just posted this protolist on another thread but it seems like this is actually the best place for its discussion. The idea behind it is to ignore all the cheesy situational effects that one could go for with a dragon deck and just go for sheer value. Use that value to control the board until you can win with Thaurissand big drops and keep yourself alive and in the game with big heals until Chromaggus and Tirion can win the fatigue battle. Another thing it considers is that according to the fantastic stats posted by ulsyychee you only really need around six dragons in a deck to get value out of holding a dragon cards. So there are only six and they are only dragons that fit the gameplan.x Zombie Chow  x Shielded Minibot  x Equality  x Ironbeak Owl  x Blackwing Technician  x Big Game Hunter  x Coghammer  x Mind Control Tech  x Truesilver Champion  x Hungry Dragon  x Consecrate  x Dragon Consort  Emperor Thaurissan  Dr. Boom  Rend Blackhand  x Lay on Hands  Tirion Fordring  Chromaggus  AlexstraszaTwo things that need to be noted I completely forgot about Blackwing Corruptor when trying to come up with this deck and there absolutely should be a place for them I just dont know where. And also this deck will almost undoubtedly struggle against aggro on ladder and is mainly meant for tournament settings or for those of us that are willing to accept a few beatings in order to play control. Thoughts? I cant wait to give this a shot.EDIT so to contribute more to discussion the big problem I think has not been highlighted enough with Faerie Dragon is that you simply dont want to hold it. You want to play it on turn  so you can coghammer it on turn . And whilst this sounds absolutely amazing it doesnt really fit with the rest of a dragon paladins strategy. I think the only dragons worth including in a dragon deck are ones that will be played after dragon synergy cards  andor  drops for Technicians biguns for Corruptors and Blackhand.,CompetitiveHS,cpwudkl,3,t5_31ns2

I wouldnt play Freeze Mage without it now that Healbot is a card. Malygos decks are usually slow by definition since Malygos is a  mana card that requires other cards to do anything. That means you need Thaurissan down when you already have multiple combo pieces in hand or some way to cheat mana.

Its basically Murloc Math Warrior Supreme. Drawing into a Warleader or Warsong Commander can instantly give you lethal depending on your board and hand state.Ive actually had a face hunter add me after a game and actually complimented the deck was completely expecting cancer speak it threw him off and he had no idea how to handle it because I flooded the board a lot faster than he was anticipating... while drawing  cards.Edit regarding the tech cards they must be strongly considered regarding pros and cons as adding in something that does not flow well with Murlocs or something that is too costly in mana would either slow the game down because you drew it way too early or leave you vulnerable when the reason you teched it in never happens and its just sitting in your hand.,CompetitiveHS,cqco7xi,2,t5_31ns2

3694111,0,t3_32pfmw,A  on turn  coin isnt unimpressive. Rogue just wants to stick  threats and ride them to victory using a sea of removal and Van Cleef enables some very strong starts. Whereas youd just plain never coin SI someones face for  on turn  or God forbid cast a Farseer you can actually jam out your Cleef and feel good about it. Saying best case scenario you get a  isnt doing him justice either. CoinBackstabDeadlyPrep  Evisetc. to kill a Knife Juggler or whatever  plant a  is an insane turn  play that will put your opponent on the backfoot in a big way. He also doesnt die to a WarAxe hit unlike the other  drops which forces Warrior opponents to dedicate actual resources to removing him if they even can. Almost nothing that your opponent drops on turns  will be able to profitably interact with him barring dumb Druid shenanigans or Tinkertown Technician which usually sets your deck up to do its thing.If you dont want to craft one thats fine. Even though I own him I personally choose to omit him because I like the options that Southsea Deckhand provides for me in the current meta. My personal problem with Oil Rogue is that sometimes it feels like you dont even even get to play insofar as your opponent immediately removes every threat that you try and stick. Southsea Deckhand is noninteractive and enables insanely high burst damage which I like in a world of face shaman zoo face hunter etc. It obviously has drawbacks Im not suggesting that its the only way to build Oil Rogue Ive just played a lot of games with it this season and I very much disliked the versions without the Deckhand. Theres just so many matchups where you can stick a Loatheb untap Sap Deckhand  Prep  Tinkers Oil  Flurry to win the game outright. I also think that Deckhand is infinitely more valuable in the mirror since Cleef is a prime Sap target and Deckhand is nuts against slower decks that dont have taunts. I also like Deckhand vs combo decks such as Grim Patron Warrior Double Combo Druid Freeze Mage etc. because you can usually kill faster than they can and in a completely noninteractive fashion.Still Cleef is significantly better against Warrior and Paladin where you really want the additional threat. After all bursting them down on turn  usually isnt an option. While he may seem like the superior threat against face hunter most of them still seem to be on double Owl and they all run  at the very least and your deck doesnt have any other targets for it unless they decide to silence a Shredder which is whatever. Deckhand dies to Explosive Trap obviously but its a cheap threat that triggers Combo for your Tinkers Oil and you HAVE to race that deck in order to beat it.,CompetitiveHS,cqdcq3s,0,t5_31ns2

3707415,0,t3_32uwuc,Ive been playing it in my math warrior deck and it has been extremely underwhelming. Heres the problems Ive faced It does nothing alone. The deck has a huge web of synergy between many cards but the important part is that all of the cards do something on their own. Egg does nothing. It is absolutely worthless without something dealing damage to it. The effect doesnt play well with the several aoe effects. I run  whirlwind effects unstable ghoul whirlwind and deaths bite. The whelps only have  health so you cant really have more than one out on the field most of the time.  In the case that you do use a whirlwind effect for the first activation cruel taskmaster and inner rage lose a lot of combo value because they just kill the egg.In conclusion if you want a similar effect nerubian egg works much better.

3710320,0,t1_cqf6bql,Are we talking aggro tempo combo or control warrior here?Lets rule it out of control right off the bat since it makes no sense there.Combo patron combo I mean is an interesting card choice. It lets you get on the board early can be activated by taskmaster as the OP said inner rage makes it  total s  acting like a deathrattle for the egg body for  mana and  cards. With whirlwind effects the egg is going to represent  s over its lifetime though they will come out relatively slowly for a  drop. I can see this being worth testing in a combo list as a shift towards faster early tempo though I dont think that itd really be worth running unless you land a inner ragetaskmaster on the egg. You wont particularly want to use a whirlwind effect exclusively to proc the egg once rather more as an incidental benefit when you do end up popping a WW. Multiple ww effects in the same turn will synergize badly with this card as well. I dont see it working very well in aggro warrior. Tempo trampoline? warrior also doesnt have the number of activators to run the dragon egg. I was probably too quick to dismiss it for combo warrior if you want to add something to your deck to better play against early game tempo decks. ,CompetitiveHS,cqf7aaq,1,t5_31ns2

For example Firebat used three counter Warrior decks against Sjow as he knew he would bring Warrior  big respect to Firebat for the preparation. I just dont like Conquest in this regard as it focus so much on countering others deck.

Juggler Muster and Shredder are all ridiculous cards that are strong against just about any deck and provide a ton of consistency. You have a bunch of unnecessary card draw given that you dont have any combos. Thaurissan is probably in the deck so that you can try to play all of the extra cards that youll never have the time to play in most games. Dragon Consort is pretty great. Its the main reason to play Dragon Paladin in the first place. Sylvanas and Boom are great late game threats and give a lot of tempo and card advantage.

Im not making excuses it isnt impossible to win with the card but lets wait until it happens more than once and in tournaments with more stakes before calling people out on Reddit.  Poison Seeds is also ran in that deck it doesnt mean the card is strong or good to ladder with Mill really only works in tournaments even then very rarely where you can ban the hunters or rely on farming control decks since it is conquest which you cant do on ladder.In other news Savijz brought an aggro pally to Gfinity it doesnt make the deck good or consistent all it means is you can perhaps catch peoples lineups off guard once in a while.,CompetitiveHS,cqjl1ar,1,t5_31ns2

3833028,0,t1_cqt4h30,You are the ping lord. You are going to have a bad day playing against Patron Warrior. They get far too much power from individual pings PatronArmorsmithAcolyteFrothing. I suppose you could put in a Flamestrike to clear the Patrons but its a heavy card and that doesnt necessarily negate the armor and card draw they get from some of the other cards. Similarly Imp Gang Boss thrives on your pings. Flamestrike is probably too slow to be a solution here. If you manage to live that long it might help you stablilise but you probably want something lower on the curve. You probably just need a minion that is likely going to trade twice Shredder Mechanical Yeti Senjin Shieldmaster Argent Crusader Zombie Chow... etc. Lower on the curve is probably better for your strategy. A Shredder might be good because .  attack kills a Gang Boss . Shredders are a solid card in general . It is a mech for Blastmage. I suppose the same argument can be made for Mechanical Yeti. Mech Yeti also gives you Parts for Flamewaker but fills your hand negatively for Jeeves.Midrange Hunter is probably different. Its tempting to take Polymorph for Highmane. It might be better threatening to steal it with Sylvanas. The pressure that Highmane can put on may be alleviated if you have more trading power earlier in the game those Shredders might be handy. You could also play Kezan Mystic and steal that Freezing Trap. The bad thing about Kezan is that it doesnt aid your other MUs. When not stealing a trap a  for  is underwhelming but I suppose its not like you are playing nothing. It would get used in the Mage MUs but its not like its needed.EDIT I like your list.,CompetitiveHS,cqt75ls,12,t5_31ns2

3879720,0,t1_cqyhf26,Works very well. I have a  win rate out of  games or so with this very list. Im currently rank  however but I achieved rank  on the past season and couldnt get any higher due to work. Its worth noting that this deck destroys face hunter as they never trade and this helps you get value out of your cult master and draw your consecrates and heals and drop free drakes.Onyxia is great with equality. You always get value out of the cult master too. I often draw  cards out of him on turn  and i play a drake or two for free as I end up drawing him. Cult master is better than solemn vigil because you draw as you trade so you can trade your dude first and if you draw an equality immediately you can play it and continue to trade and clear the opponents board more effectively for example. Its rare for you to not be able to gain the board back.Due to all of the cycle in this deck you usually get a bolvar and he just sits there getting powered up. I drop him with  attack usually and it wins me the game against priest and the mirror. Yesterday I dropped him after a freeze mage had exhausted all of her removal on my very persistent board.  attack. Not an uncommon scenario due to all of the cycle as Ive mentioned before.Try it out though! Id love to hear some feedback.,CompetitiveHS,cqyistf,1,t5_31ns2

Doomhammer is pretty integral especially when it comes to bursting down the opponent so I definitely recommend crafting the weapon if you can besides its really fun to use!.  If you dont want to do that though stuff like second Lava Burst Flametongue Totem Mechanical Yeti Azure Drake or Bomb Lobber might be some options.  You can also try stuff like AlAkir but it might make the deck too top heavy.

3960071,0,t1_cr776as,Actually imo its better to read a comprehensive advice in such a wall of text than play x cuz its op period. Much more valuable information can be drawn from it  As for the Midrange Hunter I see one major flaw of this deck  if you dont draw into your Belchers and Highmanes it just playes like a worse Face Hunter with no late game at all. Actually lost some games because of it. On the other hand if you do draw them and the Highmane hits face at least once before getting rid of you propably won already.I played a lot with Face Hunter last season and ended up somewhere around rank . Personally I think this is not a good choice for the ladder in the current meta especially from rank  altough Im still facing a lot of them and get mad about it since there are a lot of both Patron and Control Warriors as well as other control decks which stomp it horribly. I was wondering about this hybrid version of Hunter featuring both Face and Midrange elements it could be kind of interesting. But I cant find any good sample list anywahere do you have one?Druid on the other hand suffers from a lack of consistency in my opinion. If you have good draws it stomps almost enything no matter what. However there is a nonmarginal number of games when the first thing you got to play is turn  even after mulliganing the whole hand when you propably already lost to tempo...I made some tweaks to my Zoo and managed to get up to rank  yesterday. Added a Sea Giant which stomps the mirror and helps me to race other aggro or fast midrange decks and also a Bane of Doom Bane into MalGanis twice in a row is just fucking priceless lol. Hopefully I wont fall again and continue to climb up. I was also thinking about replacing Haunted Creepers with some tech cards like AnnoyoTron or Acidic Swamp Ooze as this seems to be just a fodder for those pesky Patrons Armorsmiths and Pain Acolytes...,CompetitiveHS,cr7ojjq,1,t5_31ns2

3970003,0,t1_cr8sbxx,Sounds like Ive been valuing Shield Slam too highly... I thought it might help with early aggression since its cheap removal that doesnt require face damage but then again it does require armor and you only get to use it once compared to two weapon charges.What do you think about owl in Control Warrior?

4001579,0,t1_cra8grb,You need more card draw and some kind of board recovery because right now your primary win condition revolves around a multipiece combo that requires board control with no way to regain board control from behind and no way to draw your combo faster. I dont have much experience with Inner Fire Priest that uses a Lightbomb Priest core so I cant recommend an optimized list but there are a few weak links in the deck that you can swap out without changing your game plan. Lightwell very often just going to be  mana gain  lifeyour opponent plays a silence unplayable from behind and inconsistent from ahead mediocre Velens target   Kezan unless Midrange Hunter with double freezing is a huge part of your meta this card wont meaningfully boost your winrate   Thaurissan what does it enable? you can play Velens double PWS double Divine Spirit and Inner Fire for  mana youll never need it to get combo lethal and you have no other expensive cards or combos   Faceless if youre playing the combo your opponent is likely dead so what are you looking to copy? the only consistent target for it is Sylvanas Zombie Chow solid drop good Velens target   Gilblin Stalker solid drop good Velens target or combo target   Lightbomb you need board recovery   Antique Healbot you need healing   Acolyte of Pain rd draw engine for consistencyRealistically you should be looking to fit in even more card draw with things like Azure Drake and Loot Hoarder so a core build revolving around Circle combos might be better. You could also try a deathrattle core with Loot Hoarders Piloted Shredders Cultists and Baron Rivendare. You could put the Faceless and Thaurissan back in if you were running Gnomeregan Infantry or Stormwind Knight for a comical amount of fromthehand burst. The more elaborate the combo gets the more draw youll need so keep that in mind moving forward. Card draw will also help a lot with consistency in any build you try. You should also test running fewer copies of combo pieces to figure out whether you actually need  copies of each to consistently win.,CompetitiveHS,crcetkd,1,t5_31ns2

4034810,0,t3_36nyw6,After running into a wall of hybrid hunters I decided to swap from zoo to face hunter as my ladder deck since in a hunter mirror the fastest hunter usually wins.Heres the list I made Here are my stats from rank  to  Im not a Hunter main Warlock is my preference so Im looking for some constructive criticism on possible optimizations.Heres my logic on some of the less common inclusionsTracking Due to a decent number of oneofs a cheap deck sieve allows me to fish for an Owl or Leeroy if I stuck up a creek.Southsea Deckhand Whats better than a Bluegill Warrior? A one mana Bluegill Warrior! If your opponent doesnt remove it its just like a Worgen Infiltator. If you have a weapon up I usually leave the last charge up anyways for taunts it does everything a bluegill does just cheaper. Fun fact T Deckhand  Glaivezooka is awesome the deckhand gets the damage buff and charge even tho played before the weapon.Bluegill Cheap damage. Sure its like a hero power in a card but this guy is super useful in the mirror as it kills jugglers and procs traps if necessary but mainly its a threat that can often get in  damage AND eat a traderemoval.Freezing Trap Mainly to deal with annoying deathrattle minions youre rather remove than kill like haunted creeper and piloted shredder.Jeeves Its easy to get at least two cards off of this guy and during slower matches like Warrior and Priest the extra gas this guys gives can let you steal wins even with all their removallifegain. Often in my experience my opponent is left with a catch  kill my card draw engine and let me hit twice with my arcane golems and wolfriders or kill the damage dealers but let me dig  cards further into my deck.,CompetitiveHS,crg763q,3,t5_31ns2

Smite and Gilblins are both lowimpact cards without Velens Chosen in hand. Zombie Chow is in most matchups much better than Gilblin and Id recommend subbing both. Running Smites without Voljin or Wild Pyromancer seems pointless at best. Id recommend a single Shrinkmeister instead. Shrinkmeister can win you the game if coupled with Shadow Madness or Cabal and it isnt dead against aggro either turn  Zombie turn  Shrink and trade is a very strong start.Instead of Ragnaros Id go with Ysera simply because the Dream Card effect wins me more games than the random  dmg and it is much harder to remove. Id also recommend running double Death. Sure double Death in hand against hunter is very bad but in a meta where almost any deck runs Dr. Boom Id say any Priest needs either x Death or x Death  Voljin. In most games youll find targets for both.If you want you can try out my list it currently performs very well on EU ladder. Imgur As for the specific Handlock matchup aside from changing your deck the key is to be greedy. They run more threats than you can answer so in order to win you need to be greedy. Take the face damage and bait out more Giants so you catch at least two Giants in a Lightbomb. In this matchup you are the underdog so you gotta take your chances. Key cards are Voljin Thoughtsteal SWDeath Lightbomb and Cabal  Shrinkmeister. ,CompetitiveHS,crlg8li,1,t5_31ns2

4170425,0,t1_crv6qym,Before I start I am trying to give constructive criticism my hope is you dont get offended by my sometimes blunt in text critiques.  If I was saying them in person youd feel the lovelight tones in voice and not feel like Im just bashing you because I want to help a fellow hunter player play a cool fun deck.  That being said I watched the first game through and went back and highlighted where Id change stuff re watching but it felt unfair knowing what comes next so and giving advice like captain hindsight so the second game I watched real time and commented on what i would have done and what may have been done incorrectly turn by turn.First game  First of all you seem a bit tilted before the game even started.  Playing upset will only make you play worse so maybe take a break first?  From the start mulligan was correct.  You got very unlucky with the draws the highest drop is a  drop in the deck and there is only  of them.   of which are bow which is good to get early  are unleash which would have been good all but one of which you had the rest hurt to draw turn .   Turn  I would have favored coining bow and taking the damage from wyrm and apprentice then turn  explosive  hunter mark his wyrm.  Would provide a cleared board give you initiative and allow bow to start gaining charges.  From that point you were too far behindtaking too much damage from wyrm living through trap left initiative to him on board gave him a bodyfirst to act he snowballed win you took too much damage and died to fireball before doing what I ultimately would have done earlier with the hunters mark. Turn  decided that game IMO plus a handful of bad draws vs an already pretty bad matchup arguably one of this decks worst matchupsGame   You never keep tracking in mulligan.  That is always wrong so tough to say how game would have turned out not knowing what you could have had instead of it turn  along side two bad early draws Explosive trapquick shot.  Leper gnome top deck sort of saved you turn  so that is a good play. Turn  explosive trap is so wrong.  ANY play would have been better IMO you need the traps to either destroy their board when its huge or not play it if you dont have bow up.  He had no threat owl could have triggered it for free basically but he played bad.  Turn  I may have tracking into thalnos then you could get  damage off quick shot and thalnos next turn allowing cycle getting you closer to bow keep in mind youd have dropped  explosive but with my plays youd still have explosive in hand so its less of a big deal.  Again you played explosive vs no real threat  damage owl  damage creeper which allows more power to be on board for creeper now he threatens  per turn instead of  granted no KC or houndmaster value possibilities.  Turn  I actually like the play baiting him to trade s into mad sci essentially creating possible misdirect of misha to his face or own minions.  Small note before turn  you say of course fucking misdirection instead of explosive it could only be misdirection.  You played  explosive and mulliganed over  explosive earlier in the game.  You need to keep track of what you dont keep with tracking and know it cant be drawn laterpulled from mad scientist.  Also note you say probably just hit my fucking worgen then well it was stealthed and cant be hit by misdirection should be known when you play this deck that is a somewhat common interaction to occur.  Turn  I think was fine not many other options unleash was bad you used your mana it was fine. my two eaglehorns wont be drawn by half way this could have happened if you didnt keep tracking but that is subjectiverng based so who knows but going to hit on it again NEVER keep tracking in opener with this deck.  Turns  didnt really matter it was so late and he had all the damage he needed with unleash or arcane golem hero powers etc no play you made these turns would have changed it.Hope this helps feel free to tell me I suck and Im a noob but I think this may help your play a bit,CompetitiveHS,crvmwyx,10,t5_31ns2

4175685,0,t1_crw4bo2,I think this is an important point that OP left out maybe because it seems so  obvious. Dont give your opponent an opportunity for a for! The minion you play should have at least as much attack as the enemy minions health.For example say you are playing mage on turn . The opponent just dropped a  Yeti. You have the choice between Fireball to remove the Yeti and dropping a  Dread Corsair damn Arena draft!. Fireball is almost always the better play here since the Yeti will just eat up the Corsair.

Although I have faced him a few times and hes very frustrating. I also saw him used quite a bit in the ESL tournament over the weekend.Ive been getting by without Bloodmage in my Oil rogue. I did exactly what you mentioned which is put in Kobold Geomancer or even take him out and tech a Kezan Ooze depending on the meta.I do have a Van Clef in my rogue deck. Hes a legendary I opened a while back. I find him very useful. Being able to get out a  or  early is great or being able to drop a  vs priest etc. Hes very versatile. You make a great point about Harrison and not getting much value more than  card draw. I hadnt really thought about that. As well as being a  drop and sometimes being too late against face hunters. I havent even been running an Ooze and doing okay I have been teching in Kezan Mystics for traps instead recently. Perhaps Im overvaluing Harrison at the moment.I tend to rotate between about  or  decks now. Ive been using Heathstats and the tracker this month. Im just torn between fully investing in a single class at this point. Although I agree thatd probably be the way to go to get extremely familiar with a deck. Hearthstats has been extremely beneficial in helping me identify bad match ups. If I do invest in a class itll most likely be Antonidas because I do play a lot of mage or probably Malganis because I play a lot of Zoolock as well. Decisions decisions.

This strategy will guarentee at least  win rate its uncountereable if your opponent knows youre doing this then the best he can do is exactly th same as you. In most cases your win rate will be exactly  the only way you get more is if some of your opponents are playing unviable decks. Lazy Nash Strategy pick a viable deck and go with it. This works because the randomly choose an opponent is essentially the same as your opponent randomly picks a deck to play but it relies on the players to actually play the viable decks and in the right proportions. If players just play whatever decks are winning at the moment which isnt too far fetched then your win rate will go around . It will be slightly higher for a while but then as more people start countering it it will drop to below  then as people stop countering it it will start rising again. Every time it does so it will get closer and closer to . The exact trajectory your win rate will take depends on what other decks are also being overunderplayed and is described in the rd section about the orbits. to calculate the exact trajectory check what the metagame is like now subtract the Nash equilibrium metagame and write the result as a sum of the  orbits. Then let each of the orbits go round for some time t. Recalculate the same sum of the  orbits in their new position then add the Nash equilibrium metagame back in. Multiply on the left by the win rate matrix and you get the win rate of all the decks including the one youre playing at time t in the future Play whatever decks are winning strategy This is simple if the deck you are currently playing is losing and you see someone else playing a deck and doing well with it switch to that deck. In my model everyone is using this strategy so your average win rate will be . Counter the metagame Look carefully at whats in the metagame calculate the win rate of all the decks and play the one with the highest win rate.

4332535,0,t3_3aml7v,My experience playing the other side of the matchup is that the Handlock can and usually does win by tapping very aggressively since there are more threats in the the Handlock deck than there are answers in the CW deck. You will both make extensive use of hero power and thats where the Handlock advantage pushes through since your hero power is much more useful in this matchup.Deny draw generally by silencing or dark bombing the acolytes and keep slamming those threats.  Mountain Giants  Twilight drakes  Molten Giants Emperor Thaurissan and probably a Dr. Boom or even a Ragnaros where CW has  executes  shield slams a BGH and a Brawl. You have access to more cards due to hero power so your deck should simply outpace the warrior deck at all stages. You need to have a turn  twilight drake or mountain giant play which you can use to springboard into more threats on turns . Warrior cant keep up if you play your big cards before he gets to play any big minions of his own. Tapping is doubly important since it gets you low enough to play your Molten Giants and other big threats much earlier while also letting you see more of your deck including answers to warriors own threats. You can probably draw  cards before warrior even gets to see . Dont be afraid of Grommash since its just  card with only  activators Deaths bite taskmasters whirlwind and shield slam in a pinch but then they cant use it to remove your threats and some of those activators will need to be used to proc executes. The one card you should be afraid of is brawl since you dont want to lose more than  threat to a brawl.Dont taunt up early use taunt givers on ancient watchers and twilight drakes late into the game. You dont need to worry about direct damage ever since warriors no longer play Ragnaros. The only burst combo they have is Grommash and this can be easily be stopped with just a sludge belcher or using antique healbot to heal above .,CompetitiveHS,cse085u,2,t5_31ns2

4377136,0,t1_csiz83h,The complete Shield Slam package is certainly tempting and something you can certainly test to see how you like. As mentioned in the OP there is a spectrum in Patron decks of full combo to full midrangecontrol and adding Sheild Block  Shield Slam puts you all the way in the control end of the spectrum.That playstyle is not to my taste and imo not to the full potential of the deck. I think the most noticeable benefit of running the package however is that most opponents dont play around it and you can catch them with their defenses down especially with the decks burst potential.I personally use Tiddlers exact list I think double Inner Rage and double Cruel Task are great especially in combo with the Big Game Hunter because you can use one of your four activators to make Emperor Thaurissan BGHable which happens realistically in the majority of games. Also of course for good old Boom.For your preferences I think itd be safe to swap Gnomish Inventors for your two Dread Corsairs and also cut BGH an Inner Rage and a Slam for Shield Block  double Shield Slam. If you cut BGH you can cut an Inner Rage and Slam is in the deck to help clear big taunts which Shield Slam does better.Feel free to test those changes and reply how you like them!,CompetitiveHS,csj1euh,1,t5_31ns2

4435912,0,t1_cspt46p,Im currently not home but I should be able to put it up in a few hours. Edit Heres the list.  Long and possibly unnecessaryselfexplanatory writeup incoming.General gameplan Mulligan for chows clerics recombobs shrinkmeisters pws and cultist with coin. If you can curve out cleanly to a t shredder trading using heals and pws youre in great shape against aggromidrange decks. If you have to play a  drop vs aggro I favor playing recombobulator over shrinkmeister as shrinkydink can give you some great trades.After the first few turns keep a large hand make favorable trades and kill them with their own cards. Your big tempo turns are the even numbers    . At each increment you can slightly improve your thievery by adding in a recombobulator andor shrinkmeister. Getting a Thaurissan off with combo pieces in your hand can be devestating as usual. Holding the coin if you can can also be really strong getting these off one turn early or having  in a row. Dont be afraid to tank a little damage if it can set you up for a better combo the next turn i.e. letting sludge live to trade it into a t shieldmaiden or what have you.Try to be very aware of what your stealing targets are for each deck youre against. Do you expect a sludge belcher on t or can you burn your shadow madness now? Do you need the shrinkmeister to shadow madness a Sylvannas? Whats your answer to Tirion Ysera Boom Highmane etc.? Saving Voljin  Nova through turn  can be necessary if youre low on answers.Tech choicesoptions SWD or BGH I think this is personal preference. Maybe consider switching Boom for Ysera or Sylvannas I dont have either although he seemed to do just fine for me. If youre facing a lot of aggro maybe consider dropping a Recombobulator and a Madnessshredder for a holy smite and a SWP. Smite also synergizes well with Voljin. Also you can rework the list a bit for Pyro shenanigans.Final notes The heal on Holy Fire can be absolutely critical. It can take you back to  after an alex or keep you alive a little longer vs. rushdown. Dont be afraid to burn it on a Leokk or face. Dont get too greedy drawing from northshire remember that at some point youll want to hero power yourself to not die. Try to save one Nova and Azure Drake vs. Patron as that and lightbomb are your only patron clears. Shadow madnessing a flamewaker does give you the two shots as well. Hope thats helpful and that you have funluck with the deck. Feel free to ask me whatever questions you have.,CompetitiveHS,csptzbb,1,t5_31ns2
4435993,0,t1_csouo2c,You have quite a few answers to aggro  Armorsmith  Cruel on their dudes  Inner rage their dudes  Fiery war axe  Deaths bite  Unstable ghoul  Whirlwind  Dread corsairThe point of dread corsair isnt that he is a  taunt.  The point vs aggro is that he costs either  or  and can protect something like a frothing warsong or patron.  Vs aggro you should be able to set up lethal or establish board control if you can get one of those cards to stick for a turn.  However corsair is the  card for getting stuck in your hand and frequently doesnt do anything to enable combo.  Against hunter particularly corsair ends up being  mana gain  life.Gnomish isnt great against aggro but hes surprisingly nonbad.  He can often kill  of their minions and remove annoying taunts like mirror image and annoyotron.  Gnomish is better than loot hoarder because loot hoarder dies to whirlwind and cant activate battle rage.Facing aggro is definitely not just something that happens lower in the ladder.

4480330,0,t3_3cgtef,Very interesting deck  Im personally very fascinated with it as Im an avid priest player and have been trying to make a resurrection deck work for quite some time with mixed results  the fact that you made it work at such a high level is very cool. I particularly like that you included Troggzor in your deck as I always included him in my attempts at resurrect priest so Im proud of myself for following similar logic to a top ranked player Im a legend player myself but obviously have a lot to learn still. Having said that Id like to get your opinion on other cards that Ive previously used in my versions of resurrect priest as Id like to understand your thought process on why you chose your specific cards over my choices to further aid in my future deck building.For instance what do you feel about running  Faceless and  Velens? I personally got a lot of value from ressurect gt faceless turns as for  mana you can essentially play  Sylvanas or  Troggs etc depending on what you ressurect I also found Ressurect gt Velens to be quite strong. I also personally ran KelThuzad over Sneeds along with a Cairne over Emperor  KelThuzad along with Trogg obviously gets insane value when you have a strong board so I figured resurrect and KT mend quite well together. Cairne is iffy but I ran it as it synergizes with KT quite well. Im assuming Cairne is simply too slow for the meta.I also have some questions regarding gameplay. For one how do you handle aggro decks so well? While I absolutely destroy aggro with Chinese Priest I tend to get overwhelmed playing control or resurrect priest. If I dont get a Mulligan which honestly happens quite often with such a high curve deck I get overrun quite easily essentially if I dont mulligan a pyromancer or draw Auchenai combo by turns  its basically game over. Your strategy vs aggro is really based on drawing the combo but I really find that I VERY often do not draw the combo and cant handle the board until its too late. You also have a huge lack of taunts. I guess what Id like to know is if you can go over the aggro matchup in more detail so I can see what Im doing wrong.Im also curious about Voljin and how often you can get value from him. From my experienc running Voljin barring a ton of early game IE. Chinese priest or running smites its very difficult to have a board to deal with the creature you use Voljin on. Do you find that Voljin is often a dead cardworse than SWD because you cant Voljin when your board is empty?Finally light of the naru is a card Ive always emitted from resurrect priest due to the tendency for resurrect to res a light warden for me  I guess I shouldve strongly considered it anyway as youve clearly had a ton of success with your deck. However do you often wait to use Naru until after  resurrect has been used or do you just play it as you normally would and simply hope for the best?Thanks for your time and Im honestly impressed youve had so much success with resurrect priest.,CompetitiveHS,csvevrj,27,t5_31ns2

Thau is described as a taunt minion because once its on the board your opponent must remove him or risk your cards becoming  cheaper every turn.  Hence Hogger isnt seeing play.  One way to address this is to lower him to  where he would then be equivalent to Sludge Belcher and since they both have a sticky taunt that seems more equivalent. ,CompetitiveHS,cswr0vx,-2,t5_31ns2

4614894,0,t1_ctbz28v,Loatheb is absolutely a core card not a tech for this list. The ability is very important to protect your minions and board and push for the win. Theres no other card that can secure so many wins. Voljin isnt necessary you can run Light of the Naaru Sludge Belcher SW D or Ragnaros.Thalnos is always an okay card because it cycles in the worst case but it doesnt do much. I get the desire for a  damage Holy Nova against Patron Warrior but thats not the correct way to play the matchup. They have to be the reactive one you are putting out threats and pushing for damage. Thalnos just sits in your hand a long time while you wait for the right moment. Velens Chosen is already spell damage if you really need it.,CompetitiveHS,ctcacbm,1,t5_31ns2

4635089,1,t1_ctel3nn,Ive been calling for Sacred Warrior literally since before release when I said Lightspawn should be modified to... Basically this card. If it doesnt end up a staple priest card short of some huge meta shift because of the new set I will be absolutely stunned. Especially if they add a good two drop for priests Zombie Chow to good two drop to DeathlordDark CultistInjured Blademaster to Sacred warrior is just an insane set of plays especially if the priest can drop a CoH at the end of it.,CompetitiveHS,ctetlg1,0,t5_31ns2
4635388,0,t1_ctethg8,I think the way you are looking at it is a little too linear. Sacred Warrior is definitely not going to be used in the capacity that you are suggesting playing it as a midrange minion and slowly buffing it but the card has a lot more potential than that.Soulpriest isnt really played in priest for its damage potential so counting up its damage output really isnt that relevent. It is used for its board control  it allows you to ping near dead creatures and it can be combined with CoH for board clear. It is great at what it does but it is rare that it stays on the board for very long.Sacred Warrior is a decent minion on its own but what makes it special gives priests better access to burst. Lack of burst is one of the biggest things holding back Control Priest at the moment so that is nothing to be taken lightly. The biggest thing about this card is that it fits in very nicely with the existing Control Priest suite. CoHWild PyroIBMLoN all work very effectively with both this card and Soulpriest so I dont think players will necessarily be forced to choose between the two.,CompetitiveHS,cteuy7u,14,t5_31ns2

4642576,0,t1_ctfq37c,Yeah that is certainly the missing link that would make these Inspire cards a lot stronger. From what we know now you will have to go out of your way to hero power to proc the Inspire abilities abandoning your curve which is obviously not ideal. Maybe what is missing is something that incentivizes you to use your hero power more or get free activations of it which means you include cards like this because youre already hero powering anyway. Something like Battlecry if you control a minion with Inspire activate your hero power would be the type of strong card that can tie this whole thing together ,CompetitiveHS,ctfrguj,4,t5_31ns2

4670011,0,t1_ctihwcb,Alakir costs too much for only  damage. Drawing into doom hammer early on can also be used for a bit of removal and more damage over time for less cost. Also the doom hammer is a lot harder to kill. Is ooze vs just trading into an alakir ,CompetitiveHS,ctj7h2z,1,t5_31ns2
4676412,0,t1_ctcvkhd,Actually its a matter of what type of rng were dealing with. RNG that creates hope is good much better than negative impact RNG. People actually complain about crackle much less than they do about the Shaman hero power. If this crackle rolls high I win. feels a lot better than If I dont roll a taunt totem I lose. even though they are both random.Additionally randomness that takes place after planning will always feel much worse than randomness that takes place before planning. Most often times with shaman youll plan a play like lightning storm or ignore their minion as your way to get ahead in a given game and you have to roll your totem after youve already locked into your plan. Whereas with knife juggler you have to plan which minions to play but you get to see where the knives land before making any combat decisions so it feels like you have more control.,CompetitiveHS,ctk0ewr,1,t5_31ns2
4679045,0,t3_3ez8i5,If I was really getting overrun by health aggro minions Id rather run Annoyotron than Flame Juggler. Handles the health minions more reliably although with less sustained trading power against their later drops and crucially is a significantly better utility drop later in the game and in other matchups.  Thats not to say Flame Juggler is a bad card. It seems reasonable. But fair does not a constructed card make and when youre not living the dream of sniping their health early drop this guy just seems way too weak. If his ability synergized with something so you could find value for it in other places I could see him getting some play. But right now he just seems to fall too flat outside of his core use.  ,CompetitiveHS,ctkcawk,1,t5_31ns2

4681125,0,t3_3f1cm1,I am really impressed by Savage Combatant. In most classes this would be average but with the curve manipulation offered by Druid I think it is very strong. Playing this on turns  or  with an Innervate or InnervateCoin is incredibly difficult to respond to  it dodges early removal FWA Frostbolt Darkbomb Quickshot etc. while allowing you to remove almost any  or  drop and many  drops with just your hero power. Ignoring it isnt an option as each turn you fail to deal with it you are risking  damage to the face and it isnt a BGH target!.There are also very few viable drops that can trade up with this Kirin Tor Mage Injured Blademaster Arcane Golem so playing this after a Wild Growth is probably going to be pretty strong as well.Even if it doesnt come down early it still trades very favorably when you have initiative. Dropping a Shredder or a Belcher while this is on the board are both very weak plays. And it can trade evenly with a lot of  and  drops even if you dont make use of the Inspire at all.It is weak to Truesilver and Deaths bite and it is weak if you drop it when you dont have board control. But when it shines it will really shine. ,CompetitiveHS,ctklpcn,2,t5_31ns2

Firstly it can deal with one health minions which are quite common in aggro decks and secondly it stops them going face for at least two attacks. Dealing with aggro isnt just about wiping the board its about buying time for your bigger minions to come out and for aggro decks to run out of steam. The other minions all buy time as well.An owl counters shielded minibot and this card as well. Whats your point?

Druid and Handlock are the main matchups where taunts are going to be an issue but honestly clearing a Belcher or a Druid of the Claw is very rarely difficult and you can beat Druid on board anyway. Handlock is not a deck Im concerned with teching to beat just because if its prevalent on ladder I wouldnt be playing Zoo anyway.

4723992,0,t3_3fmp53,Honestly there isnt much you can really do against Patron double frothing. Its the main reason a lot of individuals want the deck nerfed.The three things I can recommend against Patron Warrior are. Manage your minions. Dont play too many and over saturate your board especially with minions below  Attack. Each minion acts as a Frothing proc you can make it more difficult for your opponent to find a lethal combo.. Dont let Patron warrior draw cards. Execute Acoltyes rather than damaging them dont ping their faces turn  to give them an extra card with Battle Rage. Just do your best to limit their draw. If they get the combo they win. Its how it works.. Play fast. Apply as much pressure as you can. Make the Patron Warrior use its WW to clear you. Make them shift their focus from card draw to survival. The more resources you waste of theirs the harder it will be for them to kill you.Other than that I really cant recommend anything else. Patron is very reminiscent of Miracle Rogue it plays a lot of cards out of hand and kills you it has fantastic draw and a ton of survivability. Patron will win in games it likely shouldnt its not a fair deck IMO. Just try to keep those things in mind play a deck with some antipatron techs and manage a winrate of  against them and move on.editGrammar and Punctuation.,CompetitiveHS,ctpzz1h,2,t5_31ns2

I dont have much rebuttalmuch to add simply because most of your points are accurate. It gets stressful at times dealing with k people holy crap... weve gained k subscribers in a year and trying to enforce our policies but there are some cases where I could just let it go. Ive been trying to involve myself in less arguments and be more directexplain myself in the beginning so the conversation doesnt devolve based off of a misinterpreted statement or a poorlywritten comment. I think your last sentence kinda hit home in that there are some comments that really dont take away too much. At the same time if we choose to enact a policy we cant exactly flip flop on how we choose to enforce it. Inconsistency is not only bad in Hearthstone!

I mean unless Ive already gotten a few Voidcallers.Anyways I wasnt really talking about relative strength Arena or constructed. I was talking just about how exciting or interesting or creative the card is. Its a class card and usually Id expect something from those. This card is just... there. As an example I doubt Fist of Jaraxxus or Dreadsteed are going to see a lot of play and arent taken a lot in Arena either. But they can make you wonder and imagine decks and circumstances where they could be good. Theyre unique and thats something at least. I can live with a bad unique card.

You have to compensate not only for the weak stats of this minion but also the extreme loss in tempo of playing it. I find the card to be really bad.

Ive read many guides seen lots of gameplays and played dozens of ranked games with it. I managed to get to rank  quite well but since a couple of days ago Ive suddenly dropped to  and falling down. I have played with different variations  or  Fiery War Axe  or  gnomish inventor  or  ghouls using Sludge Belcher using Shield Slam... But theres no way those freaking paladins are everywhere and winning me every single game.My current deck is Inner Rage x Execute x Shield Slam Whirlwind x Fiery War Axe x Battle Rage x Slam x Armorsmith x Unstable Ghoul Shield Block x Acolyte of Pain x Frothing Berserker x Warsong Commander x Deaths Bite x Gnomish Inventor Grim Patron x Emperor ThaurissanWould you change anything with the current meta? Its hard for me to tell because maybe I suck with the deck but I felt Ive really learnt a lot about it and the difference in winning ratio I had before TGT and now is just huge.PS I have the feeling lately that its hard for me to keep any minions on the board.

4981221,0,t1_cumeqba,When this deck beats grindy decks it often does so by not letting it get to the very late game or using burst damage when you reach it but if you ever end up in that grindy situation the deck already has options. Setting up a large draw turn with northshire is a common way to help gain some late game reach with a wild pyro a northshire and a circle of healing you can usually draw  plus cards out of nowhere with any other spell for example. Using that card advantage to find the threats and answers you need is a solid way to beat control.I dont think there is anything that would only take up one slot that would give you a real chance in a late game fight otherwise though but if you have any ideas feel free to try them out over something like the acolyte of pain. ,CompetitiveHS,cumf569,1,t5_31ns2

4995383,0,t3_3jcm7y,Edit one three drop not discussed here but worked out pretty well is earthen ring farseer. I have it as a singleton. It does most of what this deck wants. Against aggro its a great tempo play and can heal your two drop on turn  while building a board should it survive Was testing this deck heavily at legend last season and here are my thoughts Dark cultist great stats and the death rattle is very powerful in dragon oriest because of the nature of our two and  drops. If you have any board oresence u can use cultist to dictate board power and stat allocation. Technician  toughness is pretty relevant. However dragon requirement is make or break Imo and  damage is never enough for a  drop. Also u typically want to spend the first  turns developing a board if u can and not using hero power. Cultist fits this style better as the death rattle is a pseudo heal. I dont think technician is a poor choice either wayBane sisters subpar in this archetype. The body is relevant but if u play on curve its just a worse cultist and if u play on turn  for buffs too situational. With  buffs just not enough to play eitherInjured blademaster if u running some heavy control list with limited dragons I can see this for sure. But not sure if thats the best route for a dragon list to being with Velens chosen card is solid. I play one but wish I had room for a second. Death lord in highly aggressive metas I could see this but dragon priest already has so many taunts and ways to stem aggro. Why add another just for that matchup? It doesnt help your control matchups and its effect is redundant against aggro.   Also does not kill shredder or creatures greater than  toughness. That seems weak The problem with dragon priest is the mulligan. The synergy conundrum between whelp and wyrmrest make opening hands subpar. Still the deck is good ,CompetitiveHS,cuo4olm,6,t5_31ns2
4995729,0,t3_3jawyc,For myself I prefer general advice for example Trade aggressively to establish board Prioritize face over trades Use removal liberally in the early game Hero power whenever possible rather than specific descriptions on each and every card or matchup.  Maybe for most people these things are obvious from the deck list but my piloting of a new deck is most improved when I know the general strategy and win conditions.  Specific situations and card uses will come with experience.  Information overload just leads to me not remembering the important bits during game play.,CompetitiveHS,cuo66op,5,t5_31ns2
5003384,0,t3_3jdxc6,SummaryReading through all the comments i think that replacing a Shield Block with Justicar Trueheart is what everybody thinks is the right choice. Also most people wanted to keep x Shieldmaiden becasue of the high value of this card and the potential of a turn  swingplay with Shieldmaiden into Shield Slam.Opinions are still going in different directions when it comes to Varian Wrynn. Its interesting that the Straw Poll says that round about  would play him and only  would not. Reading through the comments gets you a different feeling. Most comments say that Varian is not a card for Control decks because of the ability to create an overextended board and bring you closer to fatigue. Others say its a swing card or a winmore card that can instantly win you the game when played at the right time. What I think was said most of the time is that Nefarian is a better or alternative option to consider for Control Warrior.Also its important to think about the card draw engines in your deck when putting in Varian what brought me to cut Harrison Jones for him. That works out pretty well at the moment.TLDR TGT Changes to the old Control Warrior Shield Block     gt Justicar Trueheart Harrison Jones  gt Varian Wrynn if you want to play him,CompetitiveHS,cup3fw0,1,t5_31ns2
5005758,0,t1_cupbupd,gt until someone hopefully comes with a new list.Ive been thinking about the rogue situation too and I think youre right  board control is getting more and more important you simply cant reliably outcombo someone as a nonwarrior class from  anymore. As oil you ideally want to stick a few minions to the board have them deal around  damage or so then finish off with a big oilflurry turn for lethal. Versus aggro its becoming difficult to get enough minions to stick to the board long enough for them to bring the opponent low and versus control our reach might not be long enough even if we do get something to stick.Even so Id argue that rogue has the tools she needs. Weve got excellent aggressive minions in Buccaneer Deckhand Valiant and SI firstclass removal in Backstab Poison and Eviscerate and sweepers FlurryFan that happen to be quite powerful in this token meta.So thats where Id start Id try to build a fairly aggressive deck with plenty of  and cost minions that can reliably contest the board vs aggro and bring a beating to control decks before firing off a big prepsprint or oilflurry turn to finish someone off something of a mix between traditional oil and the various aggro rogues that saw moderate success last seasonrCompetitiveHScommentsfwdbnnostamslegendaggrorogue. Hell if we delve deeper into the aggro decklists and consider stuff like Cold Blood or more combo cards in general then stuff like Cutpurse might warrant a second look.Who knows. I just think that the oil package is small enough powerful enough and flexible enough to be put into decks we otherwise dont necessarily identify as oil rogue.,CompetitiveHS,cupdrmy,4,t5_31ns2
5007432,0,t1_cupimby,I dont know if its right to think of TBV as a five. Admittedly most of my experience with the card is from arena so its not going to translate perfectly but ts stats are behind the curve for five mana and you cant make up for that by using your hero power so youre essentially playing a a  mana minion and backwardsoverloading yourself for one mana. Youre then using your Fire Elemental turn to proc a guy and play another four drop. Basically youre nerfing your five to play something roughly equivalent to Silver Hand Knight as your six. Its really more of a seven that has the option to be played as a five when the board is right or you feel you can get away with being greedy.,CompetitiveHS,cupl1r2,2,t5_31ns2
5008223,0,t1_cupmi2n, Id say yes.  Varian getting you a Sludge Belcher or two is still pretty amazing value for  mana.  It doesnt have to get Ysera and Rag every time.     Budget CW is tough because one of the things that makes CW good is that in the late game you have all these very powerful minions that generally outclass what your opponent can play or deal with.  Take that aspect of it away and you significantly weaken the deck.  And like it or not the budget options are generally going to be weaker than the standard Legendaries try to find budget replacements for Ysera Sylvanas Dr. Boom etc..  Definitely give it a try though since you at least have Boom Emperor and Varian.  At least youre not sitting there trying to play War Golem in place of Dr. Boom.,CompetitiveHS,cupohmy,1,t5_31ns2
5010278,0,t1_cupjrst,Magic number seems to be about  dragon cards for a deck and this falls a bit short.  Really Im surprised you are doing well against Midrange Hunter because you really should not be. Eboladin is going to be very unfavorable but Face Hunter especially with Justicar should be a favorable matchup.  Tempomage is kind of hit or miss on draws but you should be favored unless they get an insane draw.Honestly Im not sure if Dragon Warrior is really better then Control Warrior or not right now.  I like running the Twilight Guardians in my deck but Im reverting back to standard CW less JusticarSylvanas for ShieldmaidenBash.  There arent many Control decks and you win long games so instant armor is worth more in my opinion then Justicars long term gain.,CompetitiveHS,cupxf5v,1,t5_31ns2

5011053,0,t1_cuq044y,One thing I would note about the FlamewakerSwipe situation it may be possible for you to take advantage of this situation. Because of the cost of playing Swipe typically precludes Druid from playing another minion in the same turn except in the late game if you can resolve a Flamewaker on an open board and force a Swipe that can give you a big opportunity to get ahead on board uncontested on your own turn eg play two two drops or a drop if you can then use a removal spell on your opponents next play thats cheaper than whatever they play or you have another creature  fireball for example you can suddenly start piling on the damage!Looking for these opporutnities is really big. In the above situation if you can use the postSwipe opportunity to play a Water Elemental then you can punish Druid of the Claw with Frostbolt  attack with Water Elemental which will remain on three life which is extremely awkward to remove but must now be answered.Another thing to consider when you are quite far ahead is that they will often catch up on board with Force  Savage Roar so if you can only let them exchange that combo for two creatures even on card trade the ineffiency of that combo will then let you immediately get quite far ahead on board again.Hope that helps!,CompetitiveHS,cuq0sbg,3,t5_31ns2

5017260,0,t1_cuqoxza,I agree with jgs response but let me just add that pyroblast is really good against all decks with minimalno healing because it allows you to have enough burn to finish the game without drawing alex. It also means that you can start the burn plan on turn  or  rather than having to wait until turn . This is especially true when you get in some early chip damage with mad scientist or loot hoarder  many decks will not trade with mad scientist so you can often get  attacks  several pings in making pyro actually do more damage than alex.Maly is a lot better in  specific matchups patron and handlock. Against patron he allows you to much more reliably win by fatigue because patron will run out of executes. Maly is better against handlock because they have so much healing so you really want to kill them in one turn. I would never cut antonidas.

Made it to rank  very quickly  week currently edging  around a month in heres a very similar decklist to what I use. Hybrid is quite a bit faster and plays out like face hunter in a lot of matchups so in my opinion there are fewer chances to misplay because the only choice is really if you are faster then them go face if you are slower board control and chip until your highmanes go to valuetown.

I dont agree on Justicar. It doesnt make the control warrior matchup better. In fact it makes it worse. Let me explain paladin doesnt have any problems in out valuing warrior. Your cards and your hero power already win the value game vs Control Warrior. Usually the only way control warrior can beat paladin is lowering the paladin health until he can play Grommash. When you play Justicar you are losing tempo to double your hero power and make your late game even better. This makes it easier for warrior to rush you.,CompetitiveHS,cvgqdi3,1,t5_31ns2

5266203,0,t1_cvkqm2j,Its utility is the key! You can do both depending on the situation.I know its a face hunter but you need to clear the opponents minion sometimes to secure the board to do more dmg overtime. For instance some sitatuations You have a valuable Knife Juggler on Board you want to protect. You hafe Huffer ob board and the opponent has a minion which could possibly clear Huffer. You just kill the opponents minion so Huffer can do more dmg over time. You can do  extra damage to a taunt to get rid of it and still have minion on board  for the next turn the opponent has to deal with.If you are ahead you might do  dmg to the face in  turns because the shield is still up.If you are behind you can regain board or at least let the opponent waste  attacks to get rid of your minion to survive but you still managed to get your  dmg off.As you can see it depends on the situation it is a more skilled card but so it has more upside than Wolfrider. Much more upside!,CompetitiveHS,cvkte3f,3,t5_31ns2

Once Savannah hits the board even executing it  clearing its remains with patrons often isnt enough. Savannah is a solid winning condition.

On a related note another interesting point brought by Reynad in the PC Gamer interview posted everywhere this morning is that you have to find a balance between when to play around certain cards that your opponent may have and when not to. If you dont respect some cards enough you can throw games while on the other side if you respect too many cards and play around too many things you kinda play against your own win conditions.Best of luck to you.Edit.

5513024,0,t1_cwg8x1v,Not a pro so definitely seek other opinions but I like  pass.    If you  Coin Aspirant even if Warrior does not have Win Axe but dont they always? youre basically buying yourself a mana ramp at the cost of mana.  So it would have to live for several turns to get ramp value.  And if Warrior has axe it does nothing for you.  Best case scenario is acceptable but worst case scenario axe leaves you behind.     Coin wild growth is a good option as you can play Shade next turn and it cant get axed.  You will have options on T depending on what you draw.     Pass is somewhat passive but it gives you a lot of options for your next couple of turns.  Warrior might play Warbot or Acolyte if they are by chance not a control warrior and you will have more options to answer accordingly.,CompetitiveHS,cwgc7op,2,t5_31ns2

5544037,0,t1_cwk70kh,A nice thought and a synergy i never had in mind while creating and tinkering on the decklist. But as a controlpriest and dragon effigy mage player i dont recommend using the recombobulatoreffect in this deck.Targeting  mana creatures isnt a big deal and a dreadsteed is often stronger than a random one. You also dont have enough steeds to justify to transform one. Baron Rivendare is an antitempoplay so chances are that your opponent has an answer for him when they get the initiative.There arent many targets in the deck. Baron rivendare and healbot seem to be the only ones. You want to squeeze as much protection out of those belchers as possible believe me.If you want to make this list truly yours here are a few suggestions you can addImplosion Sylvanas Voidterror Jaraxxus Seagiant Bane of Doom Piloted Shredder and of course bring peace to that ofchaos.Good thinking with the recombobulators  but i can say for sure that they wont work.

5574055,0,t1_cwnwewh,Ive looked up Strifecros build as well. Seemed fun to try but it looked a lot inferior to decks that choose between Antonidas and Malygos. The lower Scientist value with duplicate is an Achilles heel. A late Scientist suddenly becomes unreliable for stalling.Many people have commented on Illuminator and it does seem like a very strong contender for Healbot. Ill definitely try it the next time I run freeze mage. I really like both Cone of Cold and Pyroblast and I see strong arguments for choosing either of the cards. In most matchups I dont need Pyro to win but I got to a point where I felt that I wanted to finish games before entering the last  cards in the deck and my use of stalling cards was already really solid. Its very meta dependent and running Cone against Aggro is overall a really stable choice.Im happy that you like the deck! It takes a lot of practice to figure out how to deal with early game properly when to freeze when not to freeze etc. Drawing greedily and not playing reactionary is definitely part of playing the early game well.

5595184,0,t1_cwqjwq8,Midrange paladin beats agro by using value trades in the early game transitioning into survival minions midgame and just running aggro out of resources so they can no longer kill you.Looking at your deck list if aggro is the problem consider cutting an equality. This is usually pretty dead against aggro. Haunted creepers would actually work better for you than seal of light because they trade well with early minions and synergize well with knife juggler. Silver hand reagent is bad against aggro probably just bad in general.You definitely need to add taunt back in. I run two belchers personally. I understand how bad it feels to have that silenced but I would still rather drop a belcher on  that they have to silence. That means they waste mana on their owl and allows me to continue to swing the game in my favor by continuing to play my value minions. And if they dont have silence they will have to burn a LOT of damage to clear it. Damage not going to my face is the best.I could see running a single defender along with belchers if you see a LOT of aggro but I wouldnt run . Defender has no value by itself. You will start running into too many nonaggro matchups where you get no value and it will just lose you the game. You already run too many cards that cant be played on curve for value murloc knight quartermaster peacekeeper.Aggro druid is an easy matchup for midrange paladin. You can keep up with them early barring perfect innervate hands and they just wont be able to find enough face to win. If you peacekeeper a fel reaver that game is already over. Focus on aggressive mulligans for  and  drops. Muster is fine to keep most of the time. Peacekeeper is fine to save for fel reaver if you already have a Zombie or shielded minibot. Playing an early juggler is good to contest Aspirant. You key is to play on curve and value trade until . They will try to make a power play around  mana. If you can respond effectively they will be unable to finish the game out due to lack of card draw. Face hunter is a harder matchup. Key is Zombie juggler and Minibot or creeper if you chose to run them. You need these in your opener. Keep nothing that isnt those three cards in mulligan. Keep muster or coghammer only if you already have your  and two drops or a  drop and coin. Play on curve for the first  turns. Minions are better than weapons in the early game. Only use a turn  consecrate if you have board presence or he sets you up for it hard. Trade with minions and go face with weapons to conserve health and play around unleash. Your goal is value trades with some early pressure till you can drop a belcher or consecrate and swing the game. Once you have board a healbot seals the deal. If you have a strong enough opener hunter will often find the need to start playing as the control player. If a face hunter ever has to start trading with you you should end up winning that game. Getting an early juggler often acts as a  drop taunt for that reason. Protip if he has a explosive trap up and you can tell then dont attack face until you have  minions that will survive the blast.There are a lot more little things but thats the basics. Hope this helps.  ,CompetitiveHS,cwqmve5,2,t5_31ns2

5603038,0,t1_cwo1zxg,Around the BRM release I played a Mech Rogue much like yours to get the golden hero portrait with success in similar ranks as yours. By no means am I competitive but hopefully what I say can help you deckbuild.Things I like Goes allin with Mechs. Youre always guaranteed value from Iron Sensei and Cogmasters Wrench. Aggressively costed but Fel Reaver and Dr. Boom can win your slower matchups singlehandedly. Cold Bloods can also push the pace towards your favor.Things that dont make sense to me Absolutely zero card draw. This is obviously dependent on your playstyle but I found Mech Rogue needs some form of hand refill for when you need to flood the board to take tempo. Having two Saps and two Owls seems redundant to me. They serve the same purpose but with different advantages. Saps are a bigger mana swing but Owls permanently disable taunts. Keep both if you want but you might benefit from cutting the Owls to one.Suggestions Replace your weakest performing mechs with Jeeves or Arcane Nullifier X. Jeeves provides conditional card draw while Nullifier is a Taunt immune to targeted spells. Both synergize with Sensei. If you go Jeeves make sure to replace some of your Spare Part providers since they antisynergize with Jeeves. Check out other Rogue class cards. Conceal can secure extra Sensei turns and lethal barring AoEnontarget removal. Backstab is one of the best values in hearthstone. Removing Knife Jugglers Sorc Apprentices while simultaneously building your board is invaluable. Oil and Blade Flurry provide huge tempo swings you might get less value out of Wrench since Flurry destroys your weapon however. All in all The opportunity cost of replacing Rogue staples like SI Backstab with Mechs might be bringing down your list as a whole. This leads to the dilemma that caused me to give up on Mech Rogue If you tech in your much higher value Rogue cards and decrease the consistency of Sensei why play Mech Rogue? Other classes have cards with much better synergy Shamans have Zap O Matic Rockbiter Weapon and Hero Power to conserve cards while providing board control Mages have Arcane Intellect and unbeatable minions like Goblin Blastmage and Chugger.

5645489,0,t3_3seu0w,For people who want to know the strategies For Rags attack with your weapon every turn because getting your second hero power is key. Youre playing the control game and your job is to kill however you can. For Nef your goal is to aggro down Rags before he can get enough mana crystals and his new hero power. He will win the long game you need to win the short game. This doesnt mean you go only face but aggro should be you top concern. Nef beware of Flamestrike. Dont play any bots that make spells faster if you plan on releasing a ton of whelps on your side of the board. Rags Nef gets any spell free. Assume worst case scenario and that your minions can and will get killed. Dont rely on one taunt when you can rely on two. Rags if you play Living Bomb ensure that either you play it on a minion that needs to die or that your board is empty. Dont let them simply trade their bomb into one of your minions as board clears are very very important to you later in the game. As Nef remember your goal when you mulligan.  mana s in your opening hand are backbreaking.Overall I find this version to be much closer matched than last time with maybe Rags getting a small advantage and Nef runs out of steam towards the end unless he hero powers or draws some direct damage to finish off the last couple points of damage.,CompetitiveHS,cwwvlhg,18,t5_31ns2

5705977,0,t3_3t9dyx,A couple of things to think aboutIs it fair to discard the data if you didnt draw the card? For example lets say I want to replace my single Zombie Chow for a Chromaggus  obviously I am more likely to see the Zombie Chow because I am mulliganing for it and by removing the Zombie Chow it could be making the deck as a whole less consistent so the winrate drops. And are you counting mulligans as draw? How is the mulligan involved at all?I think you need to make sure that the card being examined is replacing a card of similar use so late game for late game but this does make things difficult when trying out certain midgame legendaries for example Hogger. What does Hogger replace? A Sludge Belcher? Surely one advantage of Hogger is that he is an additional defensive mid game semitaunt when used in conjunction with two Belchers? I think you need to tweak the other cards in the deck as well to see if there is an optimal way to use the card. Baron Rivendare in Dreadsteed Warlock is a good example  is he good? Is he better with KelThuzad? Is it better just to run KT? Or no KT? Stuff like that.,CompetitiveHS,cx4dr99,1,t5_31ns2

It would be a great way to incorporate a community voting incentive as well.As for this problem specifically look to implement some of the substitutions I recommended maybe running a higher minion curve in place of preparations will help mitiagte this issue.  otherwise you might just need to make your deck more aggressive,CompetitiveHS,cxel6fz,4,t5_31ns2
5800671,0,t1_cxg3o7m,Im currently rank  with midrange paladin with a similar list. Im still not sure about my list but I think everyone should definitely run two copies of Uldaman. The cards Ive been swapping in and out are the second truesilver justicar argus owl and Ive even played only one peacekeeper for a while. In comparison with the list OP posted Im playing second Uldaman owl second knife juggler and without justicar second quartermaster and loatheb. So Im basically playing more geared towards early board control I guess which I think is better as Uldaman really helps you steamroll even better. Most of my games are won before t and I still have a really good win rate against control warrior and the weird warlocks. ,CompetitiveHS,cxg4mpz,1,t5_31ns2

5812608,0,t1_cxhh52w,In my opinion it seems almost improbable that youre ever going to be able to set up the raptors and those minions and those other cards. Normally most combo decks with a good winrate consist of discounted spells and ignore minions on the field such as Malylock and the traditional combo priest. The combo youve proposed seems really hard to set up and one will need a specific board in order to preform it. Because there are so many variables the proposed combo is relatively pretty bad. ,CompetitiveHS,cxhlx84,1,t5_31ns2

Ive generally been feeling like yourself the sometimes Equality just sits in my hand doing nothing. I had one game in particular where I drew Equality in the opening hand and it sat there literally the entire game of which lasted at least  turns doing absolutely nothing and blocking one of my draws.

6003538,0,t1_cy6cigm,I agree to a certain extent. Im an advocate of the opinion that old CW needs some serious revision. Just clearing the board and hoping one of your X lategame threats wins the game for you doesnt feel up to date anymore. There are more threats than traditional CW can deal with efficiently nowadays and a lot of decks punish you for having   or even more unplayable lategame cards in your hand.The first half of a solution is somewhat simple Make your removal more efficient. There are two ways to accomplish this You play minions that get value and enable efficient trades or you play spells that do the same. You play both here just by the nature of Reno decks. I just added double Slam and a single Bash to my CW Bash doesnt get enough value to run  imo. They help clearing midrange stuff a lot Minibot Druid of the Claw ... but still cycle so you dont fall behind in cards.The nd half of a solution inlcludes being less greedy and focusing more on a decent midgame i.e. mana usage. I run the same topend as your build but even without Ysera. Old CWs sometimes ran Ysera and Alex a combination I wouldnt dare to run anymore unless its Dragon Warrior. Instead of the big bodies you add midrangy threats. Saraad is a great example. It gets value if you want to but you can drop it as a Yeti in the worst case scenario. You cant drop Alex as a Yeti on . Reno fills the same role but obviously is deck specific. I have the full drop repertoire for CW instead Double Shieldmaiden Sylvanas Justicar. Running more cycling spells helps filling the curve and finding threats as well. Gorehowl is another standout here. It gives both Huge value and huge tempo. You need to build your deck in a way you can afford these weapon swings though. But that isnt that big of a deal if you take less damage in the early game anyway due to more removal spells andor early minions.Overall the key is enabling good trades again and using your mana more efficiently. But it doesnt need Reno Warrior to do that. You can build CW in a new and very similar fashion without giving up premium removal in weapons and spells. I wouldnt presume to judge which version is better new CW or Reno Warrior but both changed the old CW in a similar fashion and that makes both of them superior to old CW at least. I just wouldnt call your build superior to new CW yet. Give it a try as well.,CompetitiveHS,cy6le27,5,t5_31ns2

Hes at  hp and youre holding  in direct damage or more with a beast in hand which is an easy lethal in a couple turns making sure to get arcane golem out before noble sac.

I have plenty of time today and over the next three days to play so time isnt a factor other than the end of the season. At this moment I feel stuck. Between last night and this morning Ive played about  games between ranks . and .. Its not uncommon for me to win  games then drop  games in a row.What is the consensus for changing decks while laddering? Im currently playing midrange paladin and Im unsure if I should switch at this point. Ive stuck with Midrange Paladin as its the deck Im the most familiar with. A lot of the guides Ive read suggest playing the deck your comfortable with assuming its viable. That being said relatively speaking I can build just about any tier  or  deck. Is it wise to change decks at this point? It would certainly be possible that the last few games are just a rut and I need to grind through them. At any rate any advice or insights on getting off plateaus or getting over humps pick youre cliche metaphor would be greatly appreciated. I can provide deck list and stats if needed. Thank you!

6077243,0,t1_cyg5p14,You made the right play for sure. Need to get those secrets up hopefully barrier since you have a block in hand so you dont draw them when you need something else. The trogg would have spiraled out of control very quickly and the shaman even getting say two extra damage off of it on the following turn would be significant leading into the critical ice block turns.Shaman is more problematic for Freeze Mage than most other aggro decks because their early game minions tend to be a bit bulkier which means you need your freeze spells fast.

If my match ups looked more like paladin priest flood druid  of the time I would reinclude it.Beneath The Grounds sort of works and I ran it a lot when Reno first came out but frankly it is too slow vs aggro if I where to add it back in I would cut one Burgle for it but personally I would rather run double Burgle every day.,CompetitiveHS,cygivqm,3,t5_31ns2

6114009,0,t3_3za29f,Ive been playing a Tempo Hunter of sorts and I think its actually pretty great. Its really good at churning out value with almost every single card. Mad Scientist will often pull bear trap which essentially means youre getting a  and a  taunt for  mana. Wrangler is admittedly just in there for fun but I actually get some serious value out of it. Youre already getting  for  so as long as you get a Bloodfen youre basically breaking even but when you get a TigerHighmaneKrushGhazrillaThe Beast its just insane value. Flare is devastating against Secret Pally great even to pop a single secret and not terrible if its only being used to cycle and sometimes you pop the stealth on a Shade. Its amazing against aggro. Powershot and UtH can clear aggressive boards and you can use your burn cards to survive the earlygame and simply win later on with HighmanesBoom. Elekk is extremely good at pulling important midgame cards like HighmaneBoomTigerKodo.Against Control you can just win with perfect Tempo. The deck features a lot of highvalue smallish minions that keep your opponent under constant pressure. The worst matchup for this deck is probably other Tempobased decks but even then its just a coinflip for who curves out the best.Anyway heres the decklist Let me know what you think. The changes Im currently considering are the addition of a second powershot dropping wrangler for Loatheb and fitting a quickshot in there somehow.,CompetitiveHS,cykllq1,5,t5_31ns2

Malygos on the other hand can only have an immediate effect if you have gotten value from Thaurissian and your Frostbolt and Icelances and maybe even Malygos himself are  mana cheaper.So youll almost never be in a spot where you can profit from Malygos full  spellpower bonus but you might get of an  mana Malygos followed by Bolt  Lances for  to possibly  damage.,CompetitiveHS,cyvda5j,1,t5_31ns2

6227946,0,t1_cywwlf9,Gorehowl is very much an anti control card. It shines in slow matchups where you can actually utilize the  hits and probably more importantly afford to use your hero power so much that the life loss from the  attacks becomes less of a factor.The most typical example like uPastorPain mentions is control priest. That deck runs too little damage to seriously threaten your life total and you can eat up multiple Sludge Belchers and Injured Blademasters with a single card allowing you to save your premium removal for your own threats that get Thoughtstolen or Entombed. Its probably still a marginally losing matchup especially if the priest runs double Entomb but Gorehowl is an excellent tech card for this situation.The card is much worse against midrange decks. Sure a Druid or Midrange Hunter has plenty of reasonable targets to hit but youre generating card advantage at the cost of your own life total starting at turn  which usually just ends up putting you in lethal range before you can utilize the card advantage. If youre teching against midrange youre much better off with extra taunts or armor generation like a SenJin or second Shield Block that give you a better chance to stabilize at a safe life total around turn .,CompetitiveHS,cyxjt6h,5,t5_31ns2

They used one arcane missle and arcane explosion so I figured Tempo Mage.  Later when I silenced Antonidas they then used echo of medivh on it which kinda surprised me from Tempo Mage.  I have already used both Dark Peddlers one reliquary seeker one power overwhelming both abusive sergeants and both dark iron dwarves.  Their turn before this was jeweled scarab secret frost nova ping.  Thats about all I can remember.I was debating whether or not to doomguard  PO his face.  If they just played ice block or ice barrier then I dont have lethal.  If I discard one doomguard then I wont have lethal if he clears next turn.  He could still flamestrike or blizzard and wipe out the board if he lives.  Do I hero power?  There is nothing I want next turn left in the deck.  Worst case scenario playing doomguard I play a doomguard and discard PO and the other doomguard.  Best case scenario I win this turn if no ice block or barrier.Another option would be to not hero power or play a doomguard and just pass my turn I have two taunts so they cant finish me next turn with fireball fireball frostbolt.  Antonidas wouldnt finish me off next turn anyway just build up enough fireballs to finish me off the turn after.I choose to wait it out and passed my turn.  They traded with the taunts on the board and played some random spells they got from saraad that did nothing to change the board.

Against more aggressive decks you will almost never get to use the combo so its okay to use a second Darkbomb or even a Soulfire if the situation isnt looking good although I prefer saving Soulfire since you can drop it with Malygos on turn  without having to Thaurissan first.Against heavier control you might want to aim for a full  damage combo and avoid using damage spells until you have everything in hand.Id only consider dropping Malygos when Im completely desperate since youre basically passing a turn this way.

Youre right in the sense that Flametongue and Argus suck when youre playing from behind. It makes less sense to run them in a list with Finley too since they both have totem synergy especially the Flametongue. I rarely find myself struggling to get a good trade out of them. Even a  Searing killing a Mana Wyrm is fine.Not a fan of the Fireguard Destroyer personally eventhough I was hyped when the card was announced.

Hellfire lightbomb consecrate if you drop it on curve or later flamestrike if you drop it turn  or later. I tried the deathlord tech instead of shade and found it to be no better or worse.  winrate either way. A tech I found really throws people off is nerubian egg.

6652630,0,t1_d07f4xx,No guides but I can give you some pointers from personal experience.  Generally you want to keep it in the mulligan against paladin and zoo but making sure you have a good curve is also important so consider the odds if you havent got a single  drop to keep.  Often I play it to finish something off nobody expects the  damage ping from a hunter. You could end up playing it on an empty board if the deck youre facing doesnt play many minions if you require more board pressure to win the game or if you are going to be floating a lot of mana that turn.  Try to consider the board when you play it too dont kill your own stuff or make it easy for him to kill your stuff but dont be scared to do a damage to your shredder or something like that. I would say generally you just want to be clever playing it considering what it affects what it could affect how your opponent can deal with it and what it changes in your opponents plans. By the way changed my list a lot since I posted here this is my new list and Im currently sat at roughly  on EU with it. I can always spec a game or two if you want me to offer a little insight although I dont think Im actually super good at the game.,CompetitiveHS,d07fu07,1,t5_31ns2

6658814,0,t1_d082h0c,I guess Im underestimating how much time it takes to reach Legend. The funny thing is Ive gotten Legend twice before. But this was in a time where Trump did his fp Shaman run. He did it in  something games. I copied most of his deck and did the same and did it another time with Zoo. Today there are many more cards and types of decks overall player skill level is much higher and everyone has all the cards for at least the decks they play e.g. you will never see a Secret Pally with no TirionBoom etc. It has just become harder and Ive always been a casual player that doesnt play alot. The people who get legend in a single week play all day everyday. Between  hours a day. I guess I cant expect better results until Im willing to commit to this. Like you said in order for a winrate to correct itself to the meta you need be patient and keep on playing the same deck.

But unlike other games TCGs cant just sit on a solved meta. There has to be steady change to make sure the game stays interesting.

6696866,0,t1_d0bzr9p,In general dont aim to have secrets in your hand on turn . Theyll have a bigger and better effect when your Mysterious Challengers draw them for you. Secretkeeper is a good turn  play especially in the mirror match but dont dig for the secrets. Changes to the deck depend a lot on your rank and the decks you see often. To help against druid the biggest things I might suggest would be switching out Finley for a second Shredder and switching the Belcher for a Ragnaros. Belcher is great in some metas and useless in others  I ran it this season until I hit  and then it became a liability. Ragnaros gives you a fifth big minion that demands answers which Ive found very effective against Druid especially and its won its share of games against Mage as well. You should also consider how often Divine Favor works out for you. In control heavy metas its practically a must play but its another card that Ive found quickly starts to weigh me down when the meta shifts. Swapping it for a second Haunted Creeper will speed up your deck a little. ,CompetitiveHS,d0c0iax,2,t5_31ns2
6709762,0,t1_d0dae95,A word of caution Be careful about getting and disenchanting cards at this particular point in time. Were about to move into the new StandardWild game modes in March I believe? I could be wrong. A lot of the current really good cards will be removed from Standard simply due to the fact that Naxx and GvG were chock full of them but not Wild. If you plan to play Wild then this isnt a problem. Additionally were expecting a few nerfs and maybe buffs? on the Classic set so keep that in mind.What Im trying to say is figure out what game mode you want to play before you get any cards and if youre fine with the cards you get potentially being relevant for only a few weeks or so.

6756272,0,t1_d0i49ev,I hit legend on the back of face hunter the previous two seasons my stats show a  win rate against shaman which is probably almost all aggro shaman. I think that face hunter is a lot more consistent than aggro shaman but it can certainly be slower. It doesnt require minions to stick for multiple turns like shaman does which is usually just a trogg or totem golem and if those can be dealt with its generally pretty hard to win.Face hunter is heavily favored against zoo and paladin while pretty unfavored against patron and druid so to me its a matter of picking your poison on your bad matchups. I generally do pretty well against warrior  and priests in general . Though dragon priest is really bad for you. I cant say what my win rate against renolock is since my stats dont differentiate zooreno but if they dont get rich on turn  its usually over. Warlock overall win rate the past  months is .Do elaborate on why its better than hybrid or midrange is because other midrange decks are just better they have superior tools for controlling the board so if you dont run away with it before turn  its hard to come back. Zoo and Paladin dont care about highmane priests have entomb to ignore the deathrattle so youre limited to highmane being very efficient basically against control warrior.,CompetitiveHS,d0i5ld9,2,t5_31ns2

I tried using Kolentos priest deck back when he has the grand crusader which did have some nice  plays but it really isnt as versatile as I want.

I did use her a bit and I really thought she was a good  drop that put pressure on a lot of decks that just couldnt deal with her. anyone else use her as a good option? Harrison Jones or the weapon destroying  drop. I did run the latter but it wasnt that useful and having Harrison could screw you over against renolock with jax and potentially aggro shaman. didnt really need the anti weapon card it seemed.So for the Hogger season I have decided to challenge myself with a standard viable decklist. Obviously speculations about card releasing is useless but I just figured I would try and get used to some other options out there. I also went when dragon priest orientated list.

I found that if you can get a board going you can race him potentially. If he gets his burn spells and youre already low you just lose nothing to be done about that. But if he doesnt and gets minions you can lock things down by board control and taunting up. If he starts having to use his burn on your minions to get them out of the way youre well on your way to a win. As for patron Ive not hit any but I doubt youre going to get a great winrate unless you can rush them down frequently.

Control priest has too many clears circle auch lightbombs velend holy nova tough matchup.Renolock has a decent amount of clears as well with shadowflame hellfire and twisting nether so another tough one this one you gonna have to rely on grom finisher. Control matchups are tough imo for patron since all  of those have enough clears sans CW...only have to worry about x brawl and not getting in range of  damage revenge clears...Loatheb is usually a key factor in control matchups since it protects your board from getting cleared so a well timed loatheb can be a game winner. ,CompetitiveHS,d0tpsj4,1,t5_31ns2

A  or  drop being overstatted is very powerful because it helps establish a commanding board lead immediately and your opponents removal trades down for it.  As a  drop eh.  Not good enough.  And this one gives your opponent the opportunity to trade into it for free for an entire turn.  No downside indeed.And yeah the  that draws a card seems potentially very solid.

Against the combo version you can try to curve out and get the board.  Against the aggro version is a little easier because Demonwrath hellfire is devastating early on and shawdoflame is game later on.

If theres room for  probably  of each.Rogue has a lot of ways to fight for tempo so the fact that belcher fights better on the board isnt as important to me as guaranteed healingdamage mitigation. You can say that belcher prevents a similar amount of damage as healbot but in reality thats simply not the case because belcher is subject to silence and removal damage that otherwise cannot target face.To give  example lets say you are on  life and in lethal range of Grom. Healbot and you are on . Now warrior has to find a way to push  more damage before he has lethal. You belcher and theoretically he has to do an extra  damage somehow right? wrong. Because the belcher is subject to removals like shield slam and execute. Even if you are overwhelmingly dominating the board at this point you cant prevent him from removing the belcher and having lethal whereas hes going to have a lot more trouble doing  damage with no board if you straight up heal.This applies to a lot of matchups in particular aggro ones where belcher can be silenced as well so it doesnt prevent any damage.,CompetitiveHS,d1difbg,1,t5_31ns2

Not only does at draw a secret and plays it at the same time it also thins the deck leaving behind more good cards. Now saying that scientist is a better silencetarget than doomsayer obviously depend on the matchup how the game have gone you hand opponents perceived hand etc but getting a scientist silenced is quite a big deal in many ways.As for armorsmiths vs Face Shaman and aggro in general armorsmith is quite often the most important minion for Patron. This is also the reason Patron should always save at least one till its possible to get value from it and why playing one on t usually bad. Quite often when ignored aggro will lose the game cos Patron so quickly can generate loads and loads of armor.What you say about acolytes is partially true but in CW vs CP CW usually want to draw as fatigue is usually impossible to win anyway which is quite often the same in CW mirror as the CW that gets Justicar last is chasing and need to rely on pressure from legendaries.

7140904,0,t1_d1pnbki,For  mana a  and  are great value. That is a  of stats for only  mana!The fact that it is spread out among two bodies can be good and bad. Against control decks it is likely bad as it is more easily removed by AOE and it has effectively  health if they have to attack into a taunt. But against a control deck you likely want to be getting the mana crystal anyway.Against agro the two bodies are fantastic. It is as if the minion had windfury because you can kill two of their creatures for the cost of only one of yours. This is superior to how Piloted Shredder works because of how you get the second minion immediately and the extra point of attack is meaningless when your attacking small minions.And against combo decks the mana crystal is all that matters. Even in the mid game when you already have  crystals it might be better to choose getting the mana crystal just so that you can play your important win conditions taunts and life gain affects faster. ,CompetitiveHS,d1puedt,13,t5_31ns2

7147238,0,t1_d1oty6c,I think the concept has merit. Shadowstep has long been only viable as a comboinstant win card as opposed to a value card because the powerful battlecry effects for a valuebased decks just havent been there. However a deck that can use Shadowstep as both a value generating card and a card to use as an instantwin condition is the best shell for the card on paper. While we have many cards to go before its worth the effort to draft decklists in my opinion the CThun Shadowstep idea definitely will be in my mind. All of the dopey vanilla minions that buff CThun have fairly reasonable bodies that leave potential to heal with Shadowstep and that work well with Defender of Argus another great Shadowstep target. Whether youre using Shadowstep to doublebuff your CThun to reuse cards like SI Defender of Argus and EarthenRing or to hit kill your opponent with CThun the deck will definitely have the minion base to ensure that it can contest the board to attempt to survive for a lethal CThun.

And not when comboed with a hero power ping. You want your opponent to hero power. If you have to kill a creature please dont waste damage i.e. dealing  damage to kill a creature with  health. If youre ever going to be wasting more than  damage its probably better to just go face unless you really have to kill like a knife juggler or something.Lastly please plan your turns ahead. Overload actually forces you to think and makes shaman the second hardest class to play after Rogue in my opinion. Turn  is a great turn to overload since you will still have  for turn  doomhammer. Turn  not so much. Also theres a reason you dont have drops in your deck you almost never have  mana on turn .EDIT Also please play whirling zap.

Of course those are all situational advantages but then again having a  survive PO DOOM! or Brawl isnt exactly a win condition by itself. I get your arguments in favor of the Villager I just dont see them as terribly impactful either.  gthe will for certain see play in both standard AND wild.  No idea where you get that from. Standard maybe but why would you ever play that card over the current ones that will transition to wild? What would you cut from a current list?  gtits still leagues ahead of a ton of neutral  drops  I guess well agree to disagree on that. Keep in mind that in the context of Peddler drops were not playing it as a drop rarely even in the early turns  usually were looking for situational cards that will help considering the current game state.  Among other things Stonetusk Boar is one of the best neutral drops you can get in either Zoo or Renolock since its a cheap card you can combo with damage buffs to get an immediate impact on board. You have absolutely no guarantee that your villager or its spawn will get to attack. Same argument for Elven Archer. Clockwork Gnome consistently provides a very useful spare Blood Imp has its uses depending on matchup same with Bloodsail Corsair Abusive Sergeant is good enough to be in either list Voodoo Doctor can be a lifesaver or help trades even goldshire footman has its use as a weaker Void Walker... really nothing to be excited about there.,CompetitiveHS,d1wfjco,1,t5_31ns2

7300740,0,t1_d27ypeg,Interesting. The fact that it rerandoms is a nice plus since it will always rerandom into one of these three unplayable that turn bad but playable or playable and good. You ignore it in the first two cases and evaluate it in the third casewhether its your strongest play especially given the matchup. If its unplayable or bad just ignore it and roll the dice again next turn. If its not your strongest play just ignore it and roll the dice again next turn.In exchange for that benefit you effectively give up one of your card draws. Thats hefty but not insurmountable. If you have enough cards it wont matter that you drew a dead card that turn and youre gambling on getting that draw back as something really good on a future turn.Really good would have to be one of the following... Situationally good in your current matchup rare Situationally good for your current board statehand of cards like Van Cleef in a Tempo Mage deck when you have cheap spells superrare Hilariously good because of synergy with your hero power laughably rare as in Gahzrilla with Mage...any others? Powerful for your class because it has something your class normally doesnt have easy access to. e.g. Frost Elemental provides persistent freeze Warlocks class minions have downsides and thus nonWarlock class minions would be incredibly good Druid minions are highvalue Mage minions have spell synergy. unsure how common this isThe plus side of this card is that its handside RNG as opposed to effectside RNG. Youre not going to cast it and get a random result you know exactly what youre getting when you cast it. This lets you plan around it. I think if you wanted to put it in a Constructed deck youd want to see a few very particular types of minions that arent normally available to your class.Might be a fun companion to a Randolock deck that uses Renounce Darkness.,CompetitiveHS,d281lyt,3,t5_31ns2

7349248,0,t1_d2djmll,Well ramp decks are always about playing threats ahead of their normal turn and hedging that your opponent doesnt have good answers. When you play turn  Piloted Shredder turn  Druid of the Claw or even turn  Dr. Boom the value of those plays comes entirely on the hands of you getting ahead of your opponent. You then try to use that accumulated advantage on board to make your opponent have bad plays. Theyre always behind and playing catchup.Hearthstones mana system doesnt work well with trying to get to  mana first because you dont get there enough faster. Your decks still have a cap on mana and you still get mana every turn. The upper limit on how powerful individual cards can be significantly hinders your ability to try and control the game with a ramp strategy. It can work in a game like Magic where you can ramp into something like Emrakul which is nearly impossible to handle. Its a much different game due to not having consistent access to increasing mana meaning that you can actually generate significant mana advantages.Druid traditionally struggles most against Tempo Mage not because of them being a tempo deck but because Mage has good answers to early threats. Flame Cannon Frost Bolt and Fireball all nicely answer the more expensive threats from Druid that are being churned out early.,CompetitiveHS,d2dk530,1,t5_31ns2

Freezing Trap might be an exception as a last resort to stop things like heavily buffed Mana Wyrms.  Im not too sold on Carrion Grub either  Desert Camel seems much more attractive in combination with Injured Kvaldir andor Fiery Bat and can also serve as a Houndmaster target next turn. Of course its effectiveness falls off when you face a lot of Tempo Mages Priests or other decks with strong drops so the choice of Desert Camel vs. Carrion Grub somewhat depends on the meta.  Knife Juggler is still very strong in combination with Unleash the Hounds it might still be a very good card in Hunter decks regardless of the nerf.

7395234,0,t1_d2gf18j,Im going to hugely disagree. And part of this is based on playtesting a bit now that theyre out. Even the randomass priest cthune control deck that I threw together in  minutes feels extremely powerful. One of the biggest things that priest for example has lacked was a way to win. The cards that you can play with  in the cthun deck are actually fairly solid on their own. Theres the  for  which is just an appropriately costed body that EOT gives cthune . Not amazing but playable in the cthune deck. The big cards are the  mana  battlecry deal  damage give cthune . It functions like an argent horserider that ignores taunt and gives cthune .The other really big one is the  divine shield that gives it .The priest class cthune card isnt good but a  for  is actually pretty OK in a control priest deck you want bodies that you can heal.The power of cthune though is that frequently if youre just playing like a random midrange  control deck you can usually set it up pretty easily to actually just kill with the cthune ETB trigger. And obviously if youre running like a midrange control shell yeah they can know that you have a cthune it doesnt mean they can beat it frequently. Even if its only a  or a  on turn  FIRST of all... Avenging wrath is a solid card not really playable but the idea being that youre still potentially just playing a card that takes you from Completely losing with only one out being cthune to Crushingly ahead they must answer this immediately or they are dead. Like even a  for  that does  randomly when it enters is a very powerful card.And I would LOVE to disagree with Kripp. However the real thing you should be looking for is how many bad cards are you actually adding into your deck to support Cthune? And I think the answer is actually very few. Youre not actually adding bad cards. A  for  is a standard body as is a  for .  for  is also very standard. The  divine shield for  is VERY good The  with deal  damage might even be played outside of c thune decks. And I really only think you need like ish enabler cards.

7395431,0,t1_d2it165,yeah bilefin wasnt really cutting it because the biggest weakness of the deck was already efficient small damage AoE like fan and holy nova so i made the deck as sticky as possible with my old friend harvest golem too. it was really just a remnant from the super early version with reliquary seekers. and with villagers as extra  drops i didnt feel like i wanted the second voidwalker gets punished by things like totem golem too hard,CompetitiveHS,d2it8h2,1,t5_31ns2
7395904,0,t3_4gliro,I disagree with almost all of your post PMage  Demented frostcaller simply has bad stats. Freezing one thing is inconsistent and has a poor bestcase scenario.  The  mana  that plays arcane explosion seems to me a good counter for tokens like muster and creeper.  Paladin  Vilefin Inquisitor is very strong simply because of Warleader. You wont be running anyfin. The synergy is enough to make it a powerful boardbased deck in my opinion.  Steward of Darkshire is incredible. I dont see whats winmore about having your muster make squires instead of wisps. Turning Worgens and Selfless Heroes into what are basically minibots is insane and I think it will be a staple in aggro and faster Midrange lists.  Shaman  Youre missing some great cards. Evolve has good synergy with very good cards already played like Totemic. Halazeal will be a staple in slower lists its just insane. Hammer of Twilight is excellent for a couple of reasons one it can save you life since you only have to hit a minion once to kill it two it doesnt overload you three it gives you insane value for one card. It doesnt compare to a card like Doomhammer which is far more aggressive.,CompetitiveHS,d2iv6b5,28,t5_31ns2

7400117,0,t1_d2jbjx3,Ive been messing with both control mage and warrior.  Neither really uses that many cards from the new sets.  Ive been seeing a lot of aggro decks and cthun decks and both control decks just kinda poop on them.  Mage in particular has only so much wiggle room for new cards so the new set hasnt made a huge impact in my lists.  I havent settled entirely on a list but the fact that you dont have Shredders Creepers or Minibots makes it so much easier.  Its much easier to  for  in the early game and if you spend a midlate turn sweeping the board youre actually sweeping the board.  Its actually kinda funny.  In my experience from other games control decks tend to have a lot of trouble in a new environment as people figure out the meta.  Right now aggro feels so weak that you can just control and stomp all over the mid range thats running around right now.,CompetitiveHS,d2jcer6,0,t5_31ns2

7411150,0,t1_d2kkx6p,The death phase will not begin before the battle cry finishes and Cthun will only damage characters that have not been flagged to be destroyed.  So if you have Patrons on the board and a reasonable life total the damage from the battlecry will be split between you and any patrons that still have health remaining.  With a big enough Cthun the Patrons will fill the board but eventually all be reduced to  hp absorbing a maximum of  damage.

Doesnt synergize with Forbidden Ritual as well as Id hoped unless you somehow save coin?. Unlike Sea Giant tends to be a win more card.gt BrannI run him in place of a second Darkshire though Im still experimenting. I find the early game meta has slowed down enough that I wind up holding my Abusives longer than I used to and that Brann is more likely to survive if played naked on turn  or .  Obviously depends how many battlecries you run I happen to run a bunch.gt Bilefin TidehunterSpeaking of battlecries I run one of these and I like it though Im still experimenting and its on the bubble of cards Im tempted to replace.  The taunt is surprisingly relevant sometimes forcing a ping which can win you some tempo. The  and  stat lines give you more options for dealing with minions efficiently. Of course its also a second juggle andor proc on Darkshire. Yeah it dies to swipe but what in this deck doesnt?gt TBKHavent tried this one yet but there are a lot of really big minions out there these days. As always very situational to the meta but I wouldnt fault you for trying it. Ill have to give this one a think.gt DIDI used to run two now just one plus Gormok. I actually think its better than Gormok but having one of each provides more flexibility plus I run Brann and together they offer a lot of reach past taunts and the like.Other stuff I also run one coil because Im addicted to that card but Im not sure I really recommend it.Went from Rank  to  with only  losses lost track of wins woops at least two of which were to really bonehead misplays that I chalk up to being rusty havent played since around Feb and are no fault of the deck.

I also read how you didnt like Blessing of Might which seems strange since I love the synergy the card has with Divine Shield. Also have you considered South Sea Deckhand?

Nofinisher lists or southseafaceless lists are quite budget. What do you want to craft for Patron? Things like Ragnaros or Gromash can be played in other decks dont craft niche cards like Malkoron if you have dust problems.Your question is really dangerous to answer the three decks you mentioned have very different gameplans and are quite hard to get used to. You dont really want to say craft freeze and later realise you dont like the gameplay of it.For the competitive viability afaik all three these decks had a representative in top of NAEU ladder finish so they all are decent in the right hands.

7547160,0,t1_d2zyx7w,I did update it to add the cards people suggested and I removed a number of cards including Yshaarj and Mistcaller. I also got rid of one Master of Evolution and added  Healing Waves and a Jeweled Scarab. I also removed Alakir for an Earth Elemental. Lightning Storm isnt that necessary in the current meta since only zoo and aggro shaman are the only meta decks right now that run enough lowhealth minions to justify Lightning Storm over Elemental Destruction. The initial concern when I created this deck was Cthun decks and control. Since most decks in the current meta run a large number of somewhatbeefy minions I felt the Elemental Destruction would be more favorable right now over Lightning Storm. Plus with the doomsayers hexes and early taunts from Thing from Below and Earth Elemental there is enough in the deck to discourage aggro play. Also as I explained I put in the Hammer of Twilight for the efficiency. Having Lightning Bolt or Stormcrack is nice but the deck has enough overload as it is and I believe adding more overload cards will hurt the deck more than itll help it. Elise is a consideration but I think the deck has enough threats that having Elise wont be terribly necessary. EDIT In case youre wondering I use Doomsayer against aggro if I have it early. Playing it on turn  or  helps to stop their tempo in time for a Flamewreathed Faceless or something on turn .,CompetitiveHS,d302qb4,1,t5_31ns2

I find myself trying to control the board as well as go face and it works for awhile but if Im playing against another aggro deck I feel like sometimes if I dont draw the right cards my opponent will trade back and then have control of board and then I cant get anymore minions out. Another question about this deck is with my spell cards. Im running x lightning bolt and x lava burst with these cards Ive been mostly using them to clear bigger or more impactful minions but should I be using these to go to face?

Ive definitely tried lists with Soulfire and Mechano as well  but Soulfire has always felt incredibly cluncky ever since it became  mana and the  damage doesnt really cut it anymore because you can generate that and more if you control the board. It also feels like Leeroy where you dont really want to play it if its in your hand and just feels bad.

7768336,0,t1_d3p6fqp,Right and when you really look into it the NZoth package isnt strong against very many decks. Certainly its pretty much a nonfactor against any fast deck as you never even get to play it  you win or lose long before its time to play NZoth. Against slower decks several of them have counters to NZoth. It feels like a bad win condition against almost everything in the current meta.Control Warrior and Renolock will just clear your board when you drop NZoth. Priest and Midrange Shaman will EntombHex your TirionSylvanasCairne. When playing basically no midgame threats Freeze Mage will have time to assemble the OTK. I ended up realizing that NZoth is almost never the thing that wins the game but investing in that win condition can easily be what loses the game.You beat fast decks by surviving clearing and stabilizing which none of the NZoth stuff plays any part in as all the related minions are slow as hell and basically dead cards against aggro. You beat slow decks by outvaluing them which you dont need NZoth to do. Warrior and priest can counter NZoth pretty easily but not Elise and the Elise win condition takes up just a single card and is also decent against faster decks because its a reasonable midgame play. Between Justicar and Elise any long and grindy game is in your favor. NZoth is better only against decks that cant clear the board or whisk away your important deathrattle minions but these matchups  e.g. druid YoggnLoad NZoth rogue  arent exactly dominating the meta. Ive been feeling less and less optimistic about the NZoth package because it just feels so unnecessary and cumbersome and is countered too easily.  of decks in this meta are either too fast for NZoth to ever be playable or have the counter to NZoth.,CompetitiveHS,d3p74ox,3,t5_31ns2
7770891,0,t3_4lg4wa,Ive been having a good time with NZothCThun Druid with Justicar and Fandral. I call it MultiGod Nonsense though In suppose Justicar and Fandral are not technically gods inlorejust gods ingame! whew do they do work! DIt may seem overstuffed but Ive found its pretty consistent. Theres a number of CThun buff cards that are subpar that you really wouldnt want to be running especially in Druid but once I cut those there was too much space left in the deck.So I threw in Sylvanas Thalnos Mounted Raptor and Loot Hoarder and thats enough to make NZoth work wonders as a secondary finisher.Of course Doomcaller and Veklor are a must in any selfrespecting control CThun deck as are the various good cthun buff cards like Chosen Dark Arakkoa Twilight Elder and Disciple. I left out Crazed Worshiper because although its good this deck as so many taunts and buffs already that its pretty much redundant.For healthdamage I threw in  Feral Rages which I am very pleased with as a card. Severely underrated imo. Its a better Healing Touch which already saw some play in some of the more controly Druid decks but with the option for damage as well if needed. Justicar is also in here for the same reason now that Druid has shifted away from Savage Roar combo decks towards more tempo and controlbased decks her upgrade is pretty fantastic for both sustain and damage while also putting the opponent on a clock if they cant kill you soon after you drop Justicar the difference in health becomes close to insurmountable. HunterWarrior hero power every turn will do that.Then to just round out the curve I threw in some Druid staples like Wrath Swipe Innervate Druid of the Claw and Fandral since I have enough Choose effects that hes actually a valid threat.Overall its been pretty consistent and surprisingly good. I keep hearing that CThun Druid is just not all that good but maybe its just the hybrid nature of this deck but it has been serving me well up to rank  so far this season.,CompetitiveHS,d3phkmo,1,t5_31ns2

Which do you think hed be good in?He used to be pretty good in Ramp Druid but a lot of Druids are doing the Cthun thing and they got an upgraded Yeti in the form of Klaxi Amber Weaver.Warrior got his Bloodhoof which is usually better unless stomped by a Kodo.Hunter has Houndmasters and the deathrattle wolf.  Losing beast synergy would be tough to use the aforementioned Houndmaster or KCPaladin has a crowded  spot already with Keepers and Truesilvers but maybe you could work Yeti into some Pally deck?Zoo wants to keep flooding and using buffs like Dark Iron Dwarf Yeti is too slow for their game plan.Rogue has the Pillager to feed coins into AuctioneerVanCleef.  Its not strictly better than Yeti but it fits their gameplan better.Mage has other things to do on  than plop a body or if they do they can use the good old Water Elemental which lives a little longer to get value with the heropower or freeze a weapon class.Priest is fishing for a swing combo around this turn plopping a single nontaunt body would be too low tempo to survive against most tuned decks.

7850729,0,t1_d3ygkvq,Since were pretty solidly on both our sides of the fence Ill go out on a limb and guess youre probably a lot better at piloting the deck than I am. Ive got  games up to Rank  experience and I might not ever go higher due to time constraints or maybe purely lack of skill.Some things I think we can agree on. There isnt a hell of lot of power difference between the two cards. Theyre both impactful and both give the deck some much needed versatility. Were arguing over little shit but thats why were here in this subreddit. Nitpicking everything eventually makes us better.. Hell no Geomancer isnt worth a slot but youll still see people argue up and down that he is and thats fine. I wouldnt undercut Loot Hoarder because hes still going to give you turn  or  tempo when you might otherwise just dagger pass will still draw you that card and still has a small chance of disrupting your enemys gameplan. FWA charge Druid Hero Power Mage Hero Power are all good things for us to see on turn . Shiv is also fine like you said.Im going to stick to my guns as VC is one of the only consistent counters to Aggro Shaman. Going off on turn  with a prep evisc backstab coin VC is an automatic loss for them and one of the most gratifying feelings youll ever have. And hilariously bad when you figure out theyre actually Midrange but sometimes you just gotta go all in.EDIT I forgot to mention the main reason I brought up skill levels is that at some point I may get good enough at piloting the deck that my answer changes to match yours. I dont think someone who is looking to start playing the deck is going to see as large of an impact from Thalnos though.

7867566,0,t1_d40ctw2,Yeah I can confirm that Ive been seeing a lot of Warrior recently. Ive tried both the Doomsayer and Fiery Bat versions of hunter and IMO the Fiery Bat version is slightly better against warrior. A lot of times the Warrior has a way to deal with doomsayer without sacrificing much resources whereas Fiery Bat has that sweet beast synergy and forces the warrior to down a charge of War Axe on a one drop. For ooze I dont think running two is worth it. Maybe  but currently Im not running any.

7876177,0,t1_d41ani2,gtJust because you lose the coin flip  times in a row does not mean the th time you will have a higher probability of winning it. And yes it is possible to lose  times in a row and thats when people say they are unlucky. No people say they are unlucky when they lose one coin flip. Well maybe if they lose  coin flips. Thats my point. If I find someone losing so many in a row Ill give up and call him unlucky person. But I wont find a player like that because it is pretty much impossible to lose k in a row. Even  in a row. The chance that you will get hit by a car survive that then get struck by a lightning survive that again just to get hit by a car again today is probably higher than you losing  coinflips in a row which is  in . I know how RNG works and I know that each roll is independent. But after  coin flips the probability of uneven spread of results as in one side heavily favored is very low. VERY low. While the results like  are very possible thats still close to . And the more times you toss so the more games you play the chances that it will even out are higher.I dont know how to explain it. Im not good at explaining math stuff in other language than my own. But my point wasnt that someone cant be unlucky or lucky over short periods of time. If you look at one game one player probably got better RNG than the other. But in Hearthstone you have to look at a SEASON as a whole. Not  game but  games or  games depending on how many you play. And if you counted every time you won the game because of a lucky roll and you lost the game because of unlucky roll over the month those numbers would be really close to each other.Also  thanks. I think that most of RenoLock decks are similar when it comes to those matchups. The differences between most of the Reno lists is the win condition you run  like Leeroy combo NZoth or CThun. Those things dont really matter in Aggro deck.  I think that Zoo is slightly in the Renos favor while Midrange Hunter will always be a hard matchup. Ive seen an antiaggro RenoLock list somewhere on ManaCrystals I found it but I havent tried it so I cant be sure whether it works. Other idea would be to tech in more heavily against Aggro  like add a nd Doomsayer. Even though it might decrease your Reno consistency by a bit increasing a chance of t Doomsayer is pretty big.,CompetitiveHS,d41csb2,2,t5_31ns2

Having piloted a Nzoth priest with success last season Ive found that Nzoth priest retains the early game removal package that control priest revolves around but packs a more consistent win condition against control decks. Curators shapings and embrace were also quite effective in the list. The entire deck revolves around surviving until your swing turn  grinding opponents out of resources and the body provided by curator and forbidden shaping help accomplish through their versatility.I think the one thing weve got going for priests is that it is in an OK place in the meta.

8052480,0,t3_4phrdl,Warriors seem to be trending towards Cthun warrior. It appears that people have decided that they would rather give up some consistency against zooshaman for more dominating matchups against other warrior variants. It appears to be trading some percentage of stomping the rest of the field for a much higher percentage chance of stomping other warriors. According to this data Cthun variants also have a better hunter matchup than normal control which might be the tipping point for this shift as Hunter is probably the goto answer to a warrior saturated meta and you dont have to worry about getting a bloodhoof kodod and the higher minion count is more interactive against hunter pressure. Also notable is that Cthun druid which is a good counter to standard control warriors isnt nearly as dominant against Cthun warrior in fact has a  win rate according to this data. In fact according to the chart only in a single sub  matchup for Cthun warrior is there a better win rate as the normal control warrior variant Pirate warrior.

8138271,0,t3_4qm432,Im looking for some advice on how to play the CThun Warrior mirror with Doomcaller and Emperor Thaurissan.I understand you need to keep Sylvanas  Shield Slam to steal their CThun or yours back because you need to be capable of getting extras with Doomcaller. I also understand you need to combo Brann with Doomcaller to get two more CThuns meaning you need to save the coin or make sure Thaurissan discounts one of BrannDoomcaller to allow that combination. To my more specific questions. Do I cycle Shield Block on turn  or any turn for that matter or do I keep it to guarantee being able to Shield Slam my Sylvanas?. Do I want to be the first to play CThun? It feels like I can play it any time I have Sylvanas  SS to make sure I dont take damage from it and make sure I get it back for Doomcaller. As far as I can tell it doesnt matter if you steal his or yours back.. Assuming I leave Executes to answer CThuns I still have one to answer with the remaining Shield Slam which may or may not be possible. I could alternatively answer it with Brawl. As a result how do I answer other cards like Thaurissan Twin Emperor Doomcaller and Ancient Shieldbearer. Do I have to use other cards to answer them? Do I just accept taking  damage from Twin Emperor every turn if I dont have ways to kill them? Am I willing to play Brawl as  mana kill a ?. At the end of the game is there any way to avoid  Brawls? It seems like a lot of the time people used other removal and are left with Brawl as the answer to CThun. Do I have to play in a way that guarantees hard removal for CThun?

8311629,0,t3_4tdba3,What needs to be determined first is what are the major weaknesses of priest and therefore what can be done to patch up those weaknesses.In my somewhat limited playtesting of priest early in standard it had a lot of problems but what I determined to be its main weakness that really made it worse than other classes was its situational single target removal. At lot of its other problems stem from this one weakness which I will expand on.Every other deck has general damage based removal. Removal thats flexible. Priest removal is rigid. Small minions need to be dealt with pain large minions with death. This creates  problems that I can see.First you need to dedicate more deckslots to cover removal for every situation. The result of this is one of the common complaints for priest which is that its too reactive not enough proactive plays because you need to fill more of your deck with these removals and have less proactive minions.Second its much more difficult for priest to remove minions compared to other classes. The reason is that in other classes minion trades can be supplemented with damage based removal. Your on board minion cant kill the minion the opponent just played? No problem I can add  damage from my fiery war axe or my wrath to finish it. In priest no such luck. Either your minion is able to trade and kill something or you have paindeath to remove it. This makes it MUCH more likely that youre simply unable to remove something. The notorious  attack minions aside anything with  hp or more cant be removed if you dont have that much power on board or the appropriate removal in hand. The result of not being able to deal with a minion on board AND not being able to deal with it from hand is that your opponent is free to take a value trade and the board slowly builds up. A  is basically the same as a  if you have no  damage spot removal to finish it off and have to death it anyway if you pick up your death the next turn. This leads to another common complaint which is lack of good board clear without lightbomb. But the problem isnt with its board clears. In fact priest has a ton of board clears. The problem stems from its poor ability to deal with individual threats and requiring board clears to finish off minions after getting value traded. How do you deal with a  minion that keeps hitting you turn after turn because your opponent just keeps removing your minions wont let you make minion trades and doesnt play any more minions himself? Well I guess I will just have to use holy nova on it to deal  damage. And if that minion has more than  health after trading? Thats why I need lightbomb damn it! But no you dont need lightbomb. What you need is to be able to remove that one minion without resorting to aoe and currently priest has no way of doing that because it doesnt have damage based removals that dont involve auchenai combos.So how do we actually build a deck that fixes this problem? You want to build a proactive tempo based deck that relies less on crappy removal and more on being able to remove minions on the board through trading and leveraging the hero power. This means that a reactive control archetype like NZoth is definitely out and the best contender is probably some sort of dragon deck. Dragon synergy minions are all above the curve in terms of stats for mana allowing for trading and the corruptor fills a huge gap in priest by providing single target damage from hand.So why hasnt dragon priest worked so far? My theory is because it lost Velens Chosen. Dragon minions typically favor high HP and low attack which makes it a pain when youre trying to kill your opponents minions. Think of a situation where youve got a wyrmrest agent and a blackwing technician on board and your opponent rogue plays tomb pillager or the dragon warrior plays twilight guardian. Velens chosen would provide you with the attack power boost needed to remove those minions but instead you are forced into awkward  for  or overkill trades because as we established earlier priest cannot supplement minion trading with damage from hand. A possible solution for this I believe is to include attack buffers like dark iron dwarf. This has a fold effect of not only allowing for better trades but also opens up the option to combo with death to allow it to remove a wider range of minions including  attack ones. Pain also becomes unnecessary because you are relying on minions to deal with smaller minions opening up more room for proactive plays.Essentially with the inclusion of DID you are making a midrange zoo type of deck that utilizes minimal amounts of removal and focuses on board interaction. But this is where the deck kind of falls flat because zoo can do what it does due to the hero power. Priest struggles a lot more with card draw and this is a problem thats hard to fix with the current tools. Maybe someone else will have some ideas and expand on this.EDIT This is a theorycraft of the type of deck Im talking about. Minimal removal. Mostly neutral dragon package and attack buffers and just fights on the board like zoo. You still include death because death is high tempo when removing a big minion and synergizes with the attack buffers. Circle is also a good tempo card for keeping minions alive and is the only way to utilize the northshire draw engine without losing tempo.

Deathwing is a card not only wipes the board but also has potential to win you the game on the spot.

Adding one more heavily situational card will possibly make it much harder for the deck to get its draw engine going The inclusion of Brawl would hurt the mirror and basically all warrior matchups where the objective is to cycle as fast as you can and assemble a combo before they armor to  and are out of rangeOverall I really like the tech and its definitely worth discussing and considering!

So the tempo gain is really only  mana which you get on turn  when its  mana vs  mana.Another thing of note is that shaman can chain overload cards to keep deferring the tempo loss from the overload. If we consider FWF to be worth a bit over  mana compared to boulderfistwar golem and feral spirits to be worth  mana maybe a bit less by playing FWFsappedgtferalgtFWF they are still putting forward  mana worth of tempo onto the board during those midgame turns compared to the regular  mana.

8511445,0,t1_d6580yx,Youd cut ritual for two reasons first in a discardheavy deck you want to ensure that your discard spells can be landed on the targets you want to discard. This requires being able to pitch almost all of your hand early. Ritual can actively impede that as its much more of a value card than a tempo or aggressive one. Since you cant get it and other spells out of your hand reliably enough the odds are good it will either get discarded or make for weaker turns than youd like on a number of occasions. Moreover if youre not playing Councilman and Juggler the synergy of this card is basically reduced to Dire Wolf an Abusive. Which is still OK but not great. Second Warrior is a thing and Ravaging Ghoul Revenge and Pyro can all easily eat Ritual. While Ritual might be useful for refilling a board after that happens as well an aggressive discard list is probably looking to finish out a game before that is really needed.

8545978,0,t3_4wrl5o,Im actually pretty excited for Onyx Bishop. One issue with IBM  res is consistency. Another is floating mana say turn  is res and hero power face no drop in Priest.I think we just need a solid early game minion thats another good Res target and we have a potential deck. The issue is that of all the overstated early drops none have manageable drawbacks. Millhouse is far too risky. Ancient Watcher cant attack and if you run ArgusSunfury those are bad res targets. Argent Watchman has bad synergy with the hero power and the stats arent worth it. King Mukla has maybe potential but giving up two Bananas is sort of bad since we wont have the initiative to negate them. Nat the Darkfisher could be hilarious against control decks but those run a big finisher in CThun or NZoth so fatigue wont work as a win condition. And hes awful against aggro. Plus all the legendaries arent consistent since theyre limited to one per deck. Injured Kvaldir hasnt been good enough for Priest decks in the past but a  is okay enough with Bishop and on curve hero power resurrect.And thats pretty much it.

8575972,0,t1_d6dbuo0,A reasonably new player with a MTG background here.  Its sometimes easy to think youre doing REALLY poorly because of the nature of  match play not best two out of three like were used to.  So by that nature getting creamed because of bad topdecks crap mulligan or RNG is SUPER frustrating to a Magic player.  Not to mention HS is much more unforgiving with misplays.  You screw up once on a ranked ladder game and its a instant game loss against some decks.  Ive found myself making a spreadsheet to keep track of my losses and wins and more often than not Im actually doing better than I expected looking at the raw numbers.  Its a FAR more swingy game and sometimes taking a break is exactly what the doctor ordered.  To that point I recommend NOT swapping decks.  Get good at one or two main ones and stick to them when on ladder.  You wouldnt necessarily swap out your Standard deck in Magic after a bad FNM.  Play what you know and comfort level with a good deck will always help you over inexperience with a great deck.,CompetitiveHS,d6dkvgg,1,t5_31ns2

8656768,0,t1_d6m61o4,disagree if anything its underrated. I hear pros talking about testing it in decks and not thinking its good.. thats because theyre testing it in current meta decks without changing much else which is a shortsighted way of evaluating cards.Think about how insane it will be in the future when theres a tier  Nzoth deck a Yeti in stats with massive upside when you hit any deathrattle. At baseline just getting a vanilla  gives you passable stats for a  drop other times you get a decent outcome that they have to waste removal on and cant let live and then sometimes you get an insane outcome that wins the game tirion rag Sylv etc.,CompetitiveHS,d6npm34,1,t5_31ns2

8751951,0,t1_d6zn1fq,Well D Were talking here about warlocks hero power which has always been controversial p First the  damage you take have been added to the balance because it used to bring to much value the longer the game goes remember  mana is one card. Sadly it didnt work so well as life seem to be the worthless resource if you manage to keep board control. In the early times warlocks also learned to take advantage of this with the famous handlock that was really pretty strong back in time.Now youre right they also got some greedy value play. They usualy come with low downsides or requirements though unless maybe running out of steam fast which is not a problem for warlocks.But arent we back to my conclusion here ? You cant clearly split up tempo from value theyre linked in too many ways.,CompetitiveHS,d6znfuf,1,t5_31ns2
8752795,0,t1_d6zqkcp,Well i obviously cant speak for this deck as i used them in Patron. But back prestandard it was all depending on the matchup and your hand at the given time. If you had deaths bite and battle rage in hand youd usually wait so you could get more battlerage value. But if it gave you favourable trades or it was into a shamans t its almost always good. The problem with them is that they empty your hand quickly sometimes but as this deck runs two battle rages two slams and one acolyte it should be able to frequently refill its hand anyway. Might even argue that swapping one armorsmith for Finley would improve that ability.,CompetitiveHS,d6zr8xg,1,t5_31ns2

Coin  Doomsayer guarantees that it goes off and I can follow up with Loot Hoarder on .

The thing people underestimate most about reaching legend is A The stupid bonkers sheer number of games you need to play to get there and  B How difficult it is not to tiltTouching Rank  is only  of the way from gtlegend. You need to expect to TRIPLE the number of games you played on that best month after rank  at minimum.Dont avoid playing at the start of the month because its more difficult because you face more difficult opponents  thats false economy. Reaching legend is difficult. You need to face difficult opponents to get there. Trying to avoid the difficult opponents present at the start of the season isnt doing you any favours  just get in there and work on your game and try to learn your deck as best as you possibly can.

The goal is to have a situation where the share among classes and how frequently theyre playedhow successful they are is more even.Lets suppose that the way you want to balance arena is by making decks stronger. Ill give you three examples of solutions Make certain cards appear more or less frequently than others Allow players to select more than  cards and narrow it down Give more than three cards to select fromEach of them should make decks better. Each of them work as a solution to the initial problem.I dont think arena itself is inherently problematic. Sure some classes are just better than others better hero powers or card pools. But the bottom line is still that you can vary how good decks are by the cards they get. I really dont know what people are expecting other than balancing arena.

In this thread OP states that chance of any oneoff card on first turn is  and . for without coin and with coin respectively.So you are essentially saying that turns  is not enough cards drawn to bump up the odds to above ?Im not arguing against two Spirit Claws by the way. I think its pretty good but I remember way back when I used this tracker program that had all the UI things that showed chance to draw for singles and doubles on each turn. I remember it going up really fast turn after turn. Maybe Im not remembering it correctly.To be more on topic It might be the case that the spell power requirement cannot be fulfilled consistently enough to consider two copies a smart choice. If you play two then often it might simply be a weaker Lights Justice and you would require Rockbiter or other cards to make it good at that point.

Unfortunately people figured out the game plan and adapted rather quickly and we are seeing less priest now than before. Will Priest rise again?Dragon Priest has gained a lot from ONiK. Id argue that its stronger than resurrect priest although they are different archetypes so it depends on what you are up against. Overall in the current meta Ive had much more success with Dragon Priest since it runs a lower more consistent curve and doesnt rely on random effects.The addition of Netherspite Historian and Book Wyrm have given the deck some valuable new tools. Historian is very versatile in that it can give you the choice of picking a late game dragon or even just a twilight whelp depending on the matchupboard state. Its also not completely horrible as a backup two drop if you dont draw your curve see museum curator. Book Wyrm is simply good it almost never fails to find a decent target in the current meta even while running double shadow word pain. Both cards also improve dragon synergy by a noticeable amount so that you have more options on what dragon to playhold each turn.I think the result is that its now potentially a solid tier  deck.,CompetitiveHS,d7k062t,4,t5_31ns2

Okay I got a long shot here but hear me out. Ive always tried to make control hunter work from expansion to expansion and I finally found a deck list I made that is consistent enough in my opinion.Decklist The premise of this deck is to first disguise it as a MIdrange hunter deck however sneaking key death rattle minions in it. Your opponent then assumes youre a NZoth hunter and tries to burn you down before they realize it Reno Jackson comes to save the day.This deck has great draw as long as you get the right cards at the right time. Early game you have Kings Elek late you have Curator that gives you key cards that can swing your game plan. I believe the win conditions is to outlast your opponent through board pressure. Nzoth plays an important role in that near the end. Thanks to Barnes you can pull ridiculous tempo plays based off the minions in the deck too But there are some cards that just dont work with him obviously but more often I get a great deathrattle from it. the dream is to have YShaarj which has happened to me a few times through experimentation.You do wonders against aggro so Ive seen as long as you get your anti aggro cards and you surprise control decks in the late game with your threats.

As for tracking Im of the opinion that you should drop it as soon as you float mana so T if you dont play a keeper. Youre going to play it anyway and discard  cards that youll never access so you might as well do it early on and get a good curve going.

Really glad to hear others mentioning it as a bit of justification to my own instincts.I like him quite a lot for many of the reasons youve mentioned and also really like how he lets you be more liberal with cards like Azure Drake  you can get Battlecry value whenever its optimal without worrying about not having Spell Damage for your Claws on a subsequent turn when it gets removed.What Ive been testing alongside it is Double Bloodlust  the obviously hard to remove but low impact in the absence of something synergistic going on body of Snobold seems to make Bloodlust a good candidate for a finisher.  And the real reason Im currently liking it is that it gives you a path to victory against Freeze Mage go wide early before the AOEs come online and punch them for a ton very early leaving them on the back foot or just dead if youre really lucky for the rest of the game.Someone else mentioned Ogre Magi which also seems appealing if double Bloodlust does not ultimately pan out for me.

9350619,0,t1_d912ik4,Tempo Mage Your wincon is preventing the mage from snowballing you out of the game. It is perfectly okay for you to tempo out Gromm Harrison. Save an execute for Toni. Make sure to squeeze in as many hero powers you can while dealing with the board.    Freeze mage for both the aggro and more traditional decks your wincon is just armoring out of their burn potential. For Aggro freeze that is about  damage and for traditional it depends on if they are running Toni. If so they can do however many fireballs he makes. If not  is the normal amount of burst. The game plan is to armor up and use all your armor generating cards to get you out of harms way. Dont give them any more cards then they can do themselves which is still a lot. If they play an acolyte when they have  cards in hand try to make them overdraw. Burning Alex or a block can be huge.    nzoth rogue Contest the board and look for opportunities to make the NZoth weaker. Usually that boils down to stealing one of the big deathraddles with Sylvanis Shield Slam. Always keep  Brawl for the NZoth and you are home free.     malygos druid This matchup requires a lot of thinking and knowing if the Druid is running the more aggressivemiracle version with Gadget Auctioneer or if they are running a token Malygos. The aggressive version can cycle extremely fast and hard. You need to try and take board control early while he is ramping. If you can keep the board and armor out of the package Malygos moonfires  living roots   damage all you need to worry about is the arcane giants and maybe an Ancient of WarRagnaros.    Everyfin paladin This matchup is brutal. The anyfins alone do  damage over  turns but unlike freeze mage they have minions that they can proactively play so you cant just use your hero power to get out of range since you will be using your face to remove their minions. They also have the healing to prevent you from trying to race them. You need to think through every turn and armor up when you have the chance.

Kodo is good for totem stomping. You have enough dragons maybe a corrupted seer for a murloc? The  taunt isnt bad and if you draw  or  cards its probably worth it.     I could be off base with this but I think Far Sight is best when youre actively trying to pull off consistent  card combos like crusher shaman does with Earth Elemental  Faceless for example.    Earthen Ring Farseer might be a little low on the value side maybe MCTech would be better in that slot.,CompetitiveHS,d93c7yl,5,t5_31ns2

9376208,0,t1_d94fb2j,Well Im not sure what deck Eloise has been running but adding Giants AND Questings seems just way too greedy and cost her the game for sure. Im only running Giants that means every single spell like Shadow Strikes Eviscerates etc etc is mostly dedicated to early game board control. And additionally they also reduce the Giant cost already even if they arent in your hand. Giants are almost always enough to win the game on their own when I drop them concealed coupled with a lone spell or edwincold blood if I manage to get a good conceal turn is enough. So thats why actually getting to  is easierlets be honest a lone  mana  has very little board presence early on unless you can do some prep shaenanigans with it.Some of my games do end up drawing badly with a giant conceal and auctioneer in hand but it happens very rarely TBH. And its a problem with most miracle decks way too many combo pieces like conceals cold bloods or preps that can be drawn and no way to combo them.,CompetitiveHS,d94i1hh,3,t5_31ns2

Your starting hand is absolutely important but remember that by turn two your hand is either  or  totally new cards.  The cards in your deck are important too.Basically though youre overstating the value of the mulligan.  Not by too much so youre correct enough.

9464138,0,t1_d9fecvw,The deck isnt really trying to have board control early. Yeah you can get overwhelmed early but thats just druids weakness. The midlate game is where this deck really shines. You win through big swing turns and if possible try to play around your opponent getting too much value from their removals. Theres gonna be times where you have absolutely nothing to play but thats just the short end of the stick. On average you should have something playable.,CompetitiveHS,d9fn9s2,1,t5_31ns2
9478397,0,t3_5alhbt,You just have to play more.Different decks have different win conditions A control deck needs to be able to hold off the board until midlate so they mulligan for removal for harder matchups they tend to keep highcost removal in place of curving out minions otherwise they can go greedy and keep slower cards so they can play them on empty boards.An aggro deck is going to mulligan for the fastest highpressure minionsspells and throw midgame AoE. They need to able to deal as much damage as quickly as possible so they either mulligan for curve or to deal with a specific early minion doomsayer.A midrange deck needs to keep the board against control and survive board flooding against aggro so youre going to have to figure out what youre playing against and play the numbers. Most tend to keep early cards and one value card or hard mulligan for a strong turn   .Different decks also need to keep certain cards for extreme cases. E.g. I keep Thaurissan in my freeze mage mulligan if Im against a slower deck and rush for a large hand by  because Ive lost a lot of games when Thaurissan was one of the last  cards.

There are already cards in Druid that fit really well in Aggro decks such as Druid of the Saber Druid of the Claw and Savage Combatant all beasts.. After the nerfs there arent really any good Aggro cards left in other archetypes. Leper Gnome and Abusive are rip otherwise Id include those as well. Argent Squires are redundant because you already have Innervates to smooth out your curve. These two reasons make the Beast tag really good.

9641694,0,t1_da1gjsh,I strongly disagree. Even at its best the coin isnt worth taking out with Counterspell  you could be using that Counterspell to prevent a tempo swing down the line which is much more important. I mean think about how your hand and board will look in comparison to theirs if you decide to make this trade.Going into turn  you have  cards in hand  after you draw and likely a  on board. In addition youve already used one of your decks best tools at preserving a boardstate. Your opponent going into turn  is going to be holding  cards in hand  after they draw or possibly one less if they played a minion or removed your . They dont have coin but thats not a huge deal since they were already able to trade up with it and are now sitting with  additional cards in their hand.I do agree that a turn  Counterspell would give Druid problems if they dont have the coin.

I modified Xvirezs Face Hunter list to take out Barnes because I think its too slow and unreliable.In addition it seems that I need to sequence my plays smarter against decks like Control Warrior.

However we are ignoring that fact because we are not pitting machine vs humans but rather using machines to simulate the metaDoesnt this defeat the purpose? Unless you generate an AI that plays exactly like a human would you are effectively generating a different meta. By generating a network of artificial players that play at a suboptimal level the inherent meta changes and adapts to best deal with those plays which leads to different tech choices and eventually to different decks altogether.It sounds interesting as an academic project but for the purpose of analyzing the current meta and optimizing for it it sounds moot.,CompetitiveHS,da9rskz,9,t5_31ns2

9722998,0,t1_dabc6r3,You can just think of this card in a similiar way to the  mana  that refills your mana crystals. It is kind of a  manna  but it doesnt have the affect of a  mana  because you cant play it until you get  mana and is therefore only relevant in the lategame so you have to judge how useful it is in the late game rather than the early game.This card does only cost  mana but like the  mana  it isnt relevant until the late game. When you do play it you arent spending your entire turn on it which is great but playing it on turn one isnt useful as that isnt the purpose of the card.I wouldnt ever suggest that this card should replace a card like living roots as that is an early game card. Instead I think that this card is competing for a spot with Malygos or Ragnoros which are also bad early game cards.But what this card does do in the early game is that it can act as a  mana  that boosts the stats of your future golems when you are playing against an agressive deck and arent ever planning on choosing the option of shuffling more into your deck.

I dont see this seeing much play. But perhaps the  drop slot in shaman needs improvement.

9804924,0,t3_5fkdj8,Pint Size Potion is going to be weak I think for complicated reasons.  Pint Size really requires both Shadow Word Horror and Cabal Shadow Priest to be really good and in that package it is impressive.  However you cannot run that alongside the AucheniCircle package I dont think.  You dont want to be running two combo board clears when you simply could run the likes of Dragonfire Potion.  At first that doesnt sound that bad AucheniCircle was always somewhay weak considering the selfdamage.  However if you arent running either of those then Northshire Cleric becomes significantly weaker as does Injured Blademaster and then what are you running early game? Not Wild Pyro I think Mana Geode is pretty weak especially without Northshire and Talonpriest is out of the question then.  You dont cut your entire early game for thease pretty good two card combos I dont think.  Its too bad.  Priest would be amazing in a  card format.  I think with the  drop discover a dragon control priest will probably simply be a variant of dragon.,CompetitiveHS,dalo1s4,1,t5_31ns2
9807041,0,t1_dalpm00,This argument comes up for a lot of these types of cards. They want to remove it because it has potential to do damage. The best cards are the ones that do something regardless of if they remove it and then by virtue of still being alive threaten to win the game by themselves. Knuckles is the definition of a winmore card. If it sticks you were ahead anyway. Its another trash Hunter legendary unfortunately. Cobra shot never saw play. Cobra shot with a body attached to it is strictly worse in that it may never actually do anything. Hunter wants proactive plays that guarantee damage. I cant imagine any reason Id run Knuckles over Tiger if I was curving that high. What youve got to ask yourself is if I play this from behind can it impact the game? The answer is no.

9808582,0,t3_5fm57a,Damn Krul was disappointing. Was expecting a heal to solidify renolock as a toptier deck.But with Malganis and voidcaller in wild a reno demonlock could potentially be decent with all the demon synergy in MSG. Probably not going to be toptier but worth testing anyway. On a more competive note warlock is certainly in a uncertain state for standard. . Zoo is in an interesting state. It gets bad trades from goon buffs and cant deal with crazy jade golems yet it has the consistency to punish the clunkiness and slowness of jade and goon decks. however priest has absolutely disgusting curve minions along with crazy clears. The priest matchup is starting to look like the shaman matchup for zoo. Not good at all. As for renolock I think we cannot judge it till the meta settles. It really depends on whether decks can punish it for its inconsistencies. However i do think that it is going to become very combooriented. Leeroy is probably going to be the main wincon instead of nzoth or jaraxxus. The existence of jade golem and dragon priest which can outvalue renolock with brannnetherspite makes it seem like renolock needs to close out the game quickly instead of grinding out with jaraxxus. Food for thought  could the heavy self damage introduced in msg allow for a return of molten giants? The new meta seems to favor midrange decks that do not have burst.

I also crafter my dream maly rogue and made it to  winrate on rank  i was so proud. I opened around  Msog pack and only got krul damn it. So the only viable deck i have right now is dragon priest with  dragonfire potion but i always get stomped by jade druids and pirate warrior but not always. I wanna play jade druid but i lack aya fandral and AoW. I tried jade rogue but again i miss aya nzoth shadowcaster and i m getting stomped. I have the cards for the old pirate warrior but i m missing leeoroy and patches. I wanna play pirate rogue but again i m missing leeory and patches. I dont have the dust to play any renolock and the legendarys i have are both rag maly edwin cenarius thalnos. I m thinking about crafting leeroy and hoping to get patches from packs since this will be aggro meta prolly so i wotn regret it but as for nwo what do u suggest me to focus?

That deck has almost completely disappeared from ladder. From what I see the big things you want to counter are Reno Lock Aggro ShamanWarrior and Dragon Priest.  I think this is the main problem with CW it has an abysmal winrate against Dragon Priest and Reno Lock just to go allin on the antiaggro strategy. You could just play Dragon Warrior which also beats aggro but does well against Priest as well. Or Reno Mage which does well against aggro but also beats Reno Lock.

Have in mind that most of this players run full netdecks with all legendaries and stuff. Between  and th rank is really hard even if you have experience when you play a non netdeck.

So I do agree that running a fp account is capable of reaching  and even  or legend but this takes time and is not something that a new player with few weeks experience could do.

10063288,0,t1_dbinwed,I agree Eathern Ring Farseer is an amazing card overall and IMO one of the best  drops in the game.

10064256,0,t1_dbjbab1,To make it more confusing I actually think it was like he originally said if you have extra mana and think the minions gonna be removed you can use it for extra  damage. This is obviously a play where you realize you need to start taking your opponents life total down because youre not gonna have too many turns until the game turns against you. Also if you have enough spells for auctioneer without it too. Another reason to make this is when you think you might not get too many chances to use cold blood later mainly because of the earlier assumption that your opponent is going to have enough mana and plays to grab the board and stabilize or armor a lot. Ive seen prosstreamers do this at times and explain it like that or simply that it doesnt matter when you use it in the matchup. Ive tried it too few times and robbed a victory with auctioneer and few spells after losing the board but before opponent stabilized. It seemed like a right play because I didnt have anything to use cold blood on later and it put more pressure on opponent  they couldnt play slowly and build their game anymore they had to try and stop me. Worthy situation to consider. This is what I think he was saying. At first it might seem like a pretty reckless play.,CompetitiveHS,dbje9ue,10,t5_31ns2

10067204,0,t3_5jxhk0,Has anyone found the most optimized Reno Mage core list yet? I am really interested in the archetype especially in the big drops. Here are the choices so far   Alexstrasza. She is pretty much a staple isnt she?   Emperor Thaurissan. Some people love him some people me included removed him and dont miss him. How important is he to the deck or is this a matter of what other cards you combo it with?   Inkmaster Solia. She is personally a great card in the deck because normally when you play a big clear you do not play anything else. However she keeps the tempo that you provided her. Think of getting a Felbloom and a mass resurrect on your Kazakus potion. I think she would be a staple moving forward. And here am I hoping to unpack her soon      Firelands Portal. Much like Solia this spell clears then generates a body to retain tempo. I dont actually get why people are cutting the card from their decks.   Medivh the Guardian. A much riskier and slower Solia due to the prevalence of Ooze but he provides a win condition versus Druid and Priest by helping you retain tempo while you cast your clears away. I use him as of now and I am reasonably satisfied with what he gives to the deck. Heck I have used Atiesh to attack some small troops out of desperation and it works.   Archmage Antonidas. Some people have been finding success with him but I cannot make him work. Without that much cheap spells I think he rarely gets value. The most that I have gotten out of him is  Fireballs and at that point he was more of winmore. How has he been doing to the others who play the archetype?   NZoth package. Some decks opt to use this as a win condition versus control. I havent tested it myself because I do not own Rhonin so I cannot be sure if it is good.   Dragon package. Some Reno Mages run more dragons than others and it helps the deck become more proactive. I think it is a lot more different from the previous ones so I cannot comment on it as well.Other than these there are minor differences in the earlier cards. Mistress of Mixtures Dirty Rat the plethora of three drops Water Elemental and Refreshment Vendor Ethereal Conjurer Flame Lance  Cabalists Tome are just some of the minor choices that affect deckbuilding. ,CompetitiveHS,dbjs2yt,10,t5_31ns2

Sure the Jade Aggro shaman is much better in the mirror thats for sure but it struggles in other matchups like RenoLock Miracle Rogue and I suppose even Pirate Warrior.

10141399,0,t1_dbtf97f,My decklist As you can see this is a very different objective. I find my deck to do better against reno decks since if a deathrattle survives a turn which they almost always do I can punish it with faceless manipulator  ancestral.Additionally ancestral has gotten me a record number of concedes when used with earth elemental. The amount of threats the deck runs makes it possible to survive against dragon priest. although fatigue is a win condition against them too.Against aggro shaman earth elemental ruins their day healing is exceptional and hex is very good. My cards seem to line up well against theirs.However pirate warrior seems to not line up well and I find myself with confusing hands and uncertain plays a lot more.

Check meta snapshots from tempo storm vicious syndicate etc. Watch streams and see how people play decks. Find a good tier  deck craft it and learn to play with it. After you collect some dust make another deck you like to play preferably tier  and learn to play it also.Dont switch too many decks on ypur grind and dont get titlted or take breaks when you are. Learn from your mistakes always think of all the possible plays and review your games after.Once you play a bit of most the decks you will start to understand each deck weakness easier and play better vs them.Most important thing you must always feel that you are better each season maybe at a specific deck that you played the heck out of it or at the game in general.If you manage to achieve your reasonable goals each time you will feel a lot better.Happy new yearMay the draws be with you always.,CompetitiveHS,dbwrgzy,1,t5_31ns2

10553009,0,t1_dd31agc,While the statistical analysis looks good I think it might be overvaluing the mana wyrm a little as a  body often trades inefficiently often its the equivalent of a ping in arena which is worth closer to  tempo. If the Mana Wyrm player has an early game spell like Frostbolt or Unstable Portal this would increase the value of the mana wyrm but however bolting the  or playing Unstable Portal and trading the wyrm is a better play than mad bomber.So the most favourable scenario for Wyrm is if the Wyrm player is holding either something like Fireball or is on the coin with  drop since in this case the wyrm would be overperforming in terms of tempo. I would incline to play Bomber first in this case where we expect to be able to activate Mana Wyrms ability on turn  or . Otherwise I think trading and having a  better chance to hold the board with an uncontested  is the play because a  has a good chance of being able to trade up into an opposing  drop and gain further tempo.,CompetitiveHS,dd4aw7k,5,t5_31ns2

Rule  says when dont have jade claws you keep the spirit. Since there usually is no additional rule saying when to keep spirit claws then it shouldnt be kept.Rules aside having both spirit claws and jade claws in hand at the same time is always going to be a problem since one of them have to be a dead card for at least  turns which is a problem in the early game.

10610668,0,t1_ddae5ck,Bans make sense in tournaments because you select your decks and your decklist ahead of time. Theyre a tactical decision that let you bring certain decks over other andor let you tech your decks in more specific ways based on the decks you know youre likely to face after your ban. It doesnt make as much sense on ladder because youre free to switch to any deck or swap out cards at any time. I think it could also lead to certain decksclasses being even more OP than the level shamans at now. For example in a world where everybody is banning shaman miracle rogue probably becomes extremely powerful and jade druid would also see a big spike in power.,CompetitiveHS,ddaer0r,5,t5_31ns2
10637570,0,t1_ddcugk7,Thalnos is there to boost your miserable aoe a little  while leeroy is there to win games with burst damage. I do not run miracle lists without leeroy he is among my favorite cards in the game. Thalnos is not as vital due to the fact that two damage aoe still is not enough to stop shaman and most questing adventurer lists therefore run an extra coin over Thalnos because the way you beat shaman is a runaway start. Nonquesting lists tend to run double SI Thalnos and shaku single coin compared to the questing lists. Leeroy is less negotiable. He is how you win matches where youve been swept off board and need to turn those cold bloods into face damage. The only alternative is I think a southsea deckhand but without faceless manipulator youre in a hard way to produce sufficient burst damage. Deckhandfaceless is a very good version of the miracle concept though for those without leeroy. Faceless is never dead and used cleverly can win all sorts of games. Deckhand activates patches against aggro and you can have a weapon on demand as rogue so it is never dead. Six from the hand for two mana cheap eviscerate activator... Neither card is dead in any matchup. ,CompetitiveHS,ddd6mmb,6,t5_31ns2

With that being said I like the decision to make it a  if only because it starts to revert aggro back to how it used to be. Face Hunter ran almost solely  health minions. I think thats how aggro should be strong minions that are relatively easy to get rid of and as a result run the opponent out of steam.

Having  elementals played for only  mana can offer amazing flexibility for elemental decks to freely set up for next turn while giving  mana for this turn to react to the board.  However this depends on whether or not elemental decks can make room for  drops if the deck is focused on late game.  Still believe this card is great though.,CompetitiveHS,df6ow5n,3,t5_31ns2

So first things first control in HS is fundamentally the same strat but it relies much heavier on minions due to the nature of the game. Because of the way combat works initiative with minions is hugely important. You gotta shift out of our beloved sit behind one minion and a full grip answering all the enemy plays with countermagicaoe mentality and into fighting for the board above all else mentality. That being said control warrior is most like the mtg archetypes you mentioned. Theyre also my favorite way to play and CW is my fav way to play HS. Youll love it I promise.

11435385,0,t3_630g7x,Thinking of MurLock    Finja Package   Finja  Bluegill Warrior  Murloc WarleaderCore cards.  Even if we play no earlygame Murlocs we play these to potentially win the game turn  Finja gt Gentle Megasaur.  If we dilute this we have far less chance of hitting the Murlocs we want but get more from Rockpool Hunter  Gentle Megasaur.    Early Murlocs   Murloc Tidecaller  Murloc Tidehunter  Rockpool HunterThis is the Rockpool value train.  Is Tidecaller into Rockpool good enough?  Potentially      turn  into        turn  into Megasaur.  I think this is worth it plus the classic Tidecaller into Tidehunter and Knife Juggler stuff.    Other Murloc   Coldlight Seer  Gentle Megasaur  Bilefin Tidehunter  Seadevil StingerIf you dilute the Finja pool for early game Rockpool value I think at a minimum you want to double your odds at a strong turn  play. Gentle Megasaur is also a pretty crazy value card when comboed with Finja as giving him Windfury can pull double Warleader or double bluegill and giving THOSE windfurypoisonousdivine shield is just value.  Bilefin is usually better than Tidehunter at protecting your Murlocs but I think in this deck with  cards buffing all Murlocs you prefer to up the Murloc count.  Sea Devil seems a little too slow and Grimscale is too weak.  Discover Murloc is also slow.NonMurloc Value     Flame Imp  Voidwalker  Defender of Argus  Knife Juggler  Tar Creeper  Devilsaur Egg  Ravenous Pterrodax  Vicious Fledgling  Forbidden Ritual  Darkshire Councilman  Soulfire  Doomguard  Sea Giant  Argent Squire  Dire Wolf AlphaThere is obviously a lot of play here.  I think the classic drops are the only autoinclusions.  A lot depends on whether you are playing NewZoo with the Finja package or heavy Murlock for Rockpool Hunter starts.Two new cards I like a lot are Tar Creeper and Vicious Fledgling.  Im imaging a curve of Flame Imp gt Coin Tar Creeper gt Vicious Fledgling or even Voidwalker gt Coin Vicious Fledgling.  Early removal in general should be weaker so Lightning Bolt Frostbolt Wrath Shadow Word Pain and Eviscerate are the only easy answers to such aggression.Then you have standard zoo cards.  Theres a gowide package that plays Knife Juggler Ravenous Pterrodax Darkshire Councilman and Forbidden Ritual and maybe Sea Giants which is meta dependent weak to Maelstrom PortalWhirlwind.  Ravasaur Runt is a new card that also likes gowide strategies though powerlevel remains to be seen.Soulfire and Doomguard help finish games against control even without other discard synergy which I wouldnt run along with not losing a turn  play  card to the quest.  Devilsaur EggEggnapper  activators gives some immunity to boardclears.Defender is best against other zoo or midrange decks serving both to protect fragile pieces and to unbalance a balanced board.  Sea Giant is also good against boardcentric strategies especially if theyve blown removal on Fledgwing or early murlocs.  Id throw Argent Squire and Dire Wolf Alpha into this category as well.Best guess at an early list designed to put a lot of early pressure out like classic MurLock without being totally weak to Maelstrom Portal     Murloc Tidecaller     Flame Imp     Voidwalker     Rockpool Hunter     Murloc Tidehunter     Bluegill Warrior     Knife Juggler     Dire Wolf Alpha     Murloc Warleader     Coldlight Seer     Tar Creeper     Vicious Fledgling     Gentle Megasaur     Defender of Argus     Finja the Flying Star     DoomguardKnife Juggler works well with Finja Tidehuner haunted creeper Adaptation.  Dire Wolf works well with either windfury or divine shield or haunted creeper adaptations.  Defender  Megasaur can create taunt  poisonous or taunt  divine shield.  Tar creeper allows you to focus on the face and hurts pirate warrior  zoo.  Doomguard is in over Soulfire as a finisher because I believe Creeper will be a common card and it finishes it cleanly it was the best card in Warlocks arsenal for dealing with Sludge Belcher.  If  taunts are a large portion of the meta then Poisonous is the best way to clear them but the  Silence is a possibility.  I feel MurLock could make a real return and may be one of the better zoo options available to warlock which is largely a prediction of how strong Adaptation seems in a boardcentric deck.  ,CompetitiveHS,dfs6u32,1,t5_31ns2

11437973,0,t3_638lny,I ran a very similar deck towards the end of the season and similar to you found it extremely fun and rewarding to control your health total and try and burn the opponents down also with Felfire Abyssal etc. I like the transition into a more discard focused list around the new quest and think that this quest is great for the deck as one of the problems I found was often your burn tended to destroy your own minions Abyssal Felfire Hellfire and upon completing the quest this isnt an issue with the endless demon stream. However I feel like some of the losses to wild are really harmful to this deck. I think the best card in the deck was possibly imp gang boss and the combos you could make with trading this into a minion and then playing crystalweaver were devastating. Also Demonwrath was an amazing card for destroying enemy minions whilst keeping yours alive and well. Do you think with the loss of these cards the deck will lose some of the pressure it was able to apply early? especially with the possible turn one quest play I can see this deck becoming alot slower.

Even before cultist existed pirateaggro warrior was a thing and it was obvious that that card would be amazing in it since its a spider tank in stats even without buffing a weapon or the pirate synergies. It even saw play in some faster dragon warrior decks. Lava burst is  damage for  mana which is always going to be OP. Malchs Imp is a   drop with demon tag which is well statted for zoodemonzoo even without discard synergy. Meanwhile imo since an archetype for this card currently doesnt exist it only seems fair to judge it by if quest is a thing. ,CompetitiveHS,dftsmme,1,t5_31ns2
11453283,0,t1_dftxl3c,She is a low tempo high value card. She is a lot like rafam but lower on the curve.

But Ungoro had some absolutely insane murloc cards. So many in fact that Dr Boom became the worst card in the deck and had to go.

You dont have to play quest turn  at all  you only need to play it when you are planning on using a spell that isnt from your deck. So if you have both turn  you play the book first and then the quest when you have spare mana and before you play a nondeck spellThe main reason is as you said the double cab tomb means that you  dont need to run too much random secret draw. The glyph is better than book so  of those   cab tomb and only  babbling is more than enough.

Exodia can very often get all their combo pieces by turn  or  so if youre faster its only by a turn.You also have problems with breaking their block a nd time and then killing them. You alex and hit them with  giants that leaves them at . You dont have any burn. You minions will be permanently frozen after that until the exodia turn where they are killed.

11537276,0,t1_dg34s8e,I tried this deck cause I love Malygos Druid but I literally cant win with it.

It doesnt feel remotely viable even for casual play.EDIT Finally managed to pull the combo off.  Its thrilling to do but it took me  tries to go off once.

11537516,0,t3_64nsjo,I think Bittertide Hydra might be the best  drop for Hunter. Bittertide Hydra has the biggest body  out of all of them. Goes handinhand with the aggressive Hunter playstyle. If the enemy is going to abuse its weakness Volcano hard removal etc. then you were probably going to lose whatever  drop Hydra would have been in your deck. Tolvir Warden I agree that you would need to run  of Raptor Hatchling. This brings up the question of how many  drops you want to run in Hunter then. I imagine the standard would be  total x Jeweled Macaw x Alley Cat and the last two slots with a selection of Timber Wolf Raptor Hatchling Emerald Reaver or Fiery Bat. Emerald Hive Queen hurts more than it helps I believe and I think Murloc Crab could see use if Murlocs are prevalent enough. Tolvir Warden could warrant  or  more  drops. I think if you have Knuckles or Princess Huhuran then absolutely run them but for new playersfpetc. those cards are not necessary at all to the list since there are viable alternatives. Nesting Roc and Tundra Rhino are good alternatives for the  drop but also consider Stranglethorn Tiger,CompetitiveHS,dg3s2we,12,t5_31ns2

Dirty Rat can sometimes be an inconvenience but slowing me down brawling me and running down my resources and ability to refill gets me almost every time.I think youre seeing folks attempting to mitigate those weaknesses in the latest iterations of Quest Rogue Coldlight Oracles for refill elementals to generate selfreplacing threats postCore etc.I cant wait to get the Warrior Quest to start playing Taunt Warrior.,CompetitiveHS,dg6td5g,8,t5_31ns2
11565827,0,t1_dg6wbqf,As miracle if you can pressure them in turns  by cold blooding cheap minions with at least  health or applying any type of board pressure at all Quest Rogues usually tend to lose because they are busy answering threats instead of developing their quest.The real issue though is how consistently this can be done. Ive found that its very inconsistent due to the lack of interactivity. Sometimes you draw poor. Sometimes you only draw fairly. Usually a poor to fair draw is not enough you need a consistently strong early game to give you the edge and even then a large portion of it comes down to how many bounces they drew in their first  turns.Not to mention the elemental version of Quest rogue has added redundancy meaning you need very specific answers to stop that version. You need exactly sap to put them behind on quest completion by sapping Igneous Elemental so they dont generate two Flame Elemental tokens. Its just a very polarizing match up.,CompetitiveHS,dg6zpob,1,t5_31ns2

11582171,0,t1_dg7shf2,congrats! no matter how many times i do it that last win from rank  to legend is always so satisfying and such a relief. be proud of yourself.as for climbing to legend every month playing something you enjoy and are comfortable with makes it a lot less of a grind. a few months ago when midrange shaman was the top deck i was trying to play it to legend for like the rd month in a row and just having a miserable time. nothing tilts me more than an emoting opponent rolling a spell power totem and highrolling lightning storm to kill my drakes and the mirror was pretty much the only thing i was running into. i was around rank  for almost a week and finally decided that i couldnt take it anymore. i switched to secret hunter and made it to legend like  hours later.its really hard to be in a good mental state when youre not having fun or even worse tilting and its really hard to win games when youre not in a good mental state. take breaks rest your mind and try to have fun.once your head is in a good spot focus on each game. i dont usually track stats and never look at my winrate while climbing and i think it helps me a lot to focus on each game individually. dont browse reddit or watch streams while playing and think through your turns before acting.the more you play and the better you get the easier the climb will be each month. after a while it feels a lot less like a grind and more like something that just happens naturally from playing. congrats again ,CompetitiveHS,dg8ugou,2,t5_31ns2

Mulligan really hard for your two drops youd be surprised how well a coined arcanologist disrupts hunters fragile early game.  They have no healing so just aim to either get Alex down with an ice block up or simply antonidas plus frost nova and kill them in two.  Its not an easy matchup by any means but I dont think its too bad.  Freeze Mage is all about playing to win not playing to not lose if that makes sense.

11660012,0,t1_dghnp3e,Well I Suppose if you already have card advantage youve already won the game and Lyra is unnecesary. But OP also listed examples where a game was tight and he had trouble fitting in Lyra either because his stats were low for a  drop or he had few cards to combo with Lyra. In priest the odds are youll definitely have a minion still alive by the time you play Lyra so his survivability sky rockets. This further proves that Lyra isnt the main win condition and shouldnt be intended as such unless the game shapes out in a way where he ends up being so. Combo priest doesnt need Lyra to win the game by himself and although he can and believe me a good  of my games were won because my opponent cant handle the Lyra in a way no other card could manage. If your Lyra triggers only once or twice or even flops and does nothing but die combo priest still has multiple win conditions. I hope this answered better,CompetitiveHS,dghody2,1,t5_31ns2

When playing murlocs in shaman i honestly cant see any reason to not play quest when you can simply mulligan it away. If youre mulling it away youre likely trying to end the game fast or establish a board vs another fast deck that tends to lack card draw. in either case youre unlikely to draw the quest back again when drawing threats really matters for your game plan.,CompetitiveHS,dgixhvy,1,t5_31ns2

11718447,0,t1_dgnfy34,It is a pretty awful matchup and I had a similar experience as you where I couldnt seem to win a single game against them. However Ive won  of my last  games against them somehow so it is winnable! Best card in the matchup is Drak OP. If you can play  preferably two of those before they complete quest and then back it up with multiple dragonfire potions its often enough to get them. That said Im also running Wild PyroRadiant Elemental so I have more things I can play early to get in chip damage and the Wild Pyros help clean up whatever they have on board before they play the quest. I doubt those differences would explain our different experiences by themselves though I think Ive also just been fortunate for them to not have insanely explosive hands where they complete and cast the quest on turn  or  mostly theyve been completing turn  and casting turn  which is just fine because it means I got a Drak OP down. ,CompetitiveHS,dgobcgq,1,t5_31ns2

11729060,0,t3_67baqh,gt Innovation is merely one of many tools that may or may not help you reach victory. The goal is to play as excellently as possible. The goal is to win.Everything in Sirlins book is based on this axiom. If you agree with it then he is certainly worth reading.However its entirely rational to have a different goal when playing Hearthstone or any other game. An obvious example would be my goal is to have fun. Most streamers probably have the goal of have the most viewers. These goals and most others are aligned with winning but are not identical to it. That means winning is usually better but isnt always better.That means you can want to win more even if winning isnt your true goal.Take Day as an example. He is a very successful streamer yet he hardly ever reaches Legend rank. What is he doing wrong? Nothing. Winning isnt his ultimate goal and shouldnt be. He generally tries to win sure but there are times where he has lethal but says I could win but this is more fun! and then proceeds to lose. That is not a mistake.

For every  games of midrange I can play  games of aggro. The damage output is amazing. And the best part is that it actually takes strategy to play.

11758017,0,t1_dgs0sfd,this is a bad question but its good that you asked it.i really hope that doesnt sound rude or discouraging and im not trying to pick on you because there are a lot of questions like this that get asked here. asking more questions is great so keep doing that. i just want to unpack why this is a bad question because i think that may affect the way you make other decisions in the game. umcfaudoo already gave a pretty good answer to the actual question herethis question ignores way too much context to have a real answer. it sounds like youve approached this turn with the idea that making a mana play is optimal for turn  and you want to know the basic power rankings of your common  mana plays. the problem with that is that it totally ignores the fact that your gameplan will change based on the matchup the board and your hand context. this question DOES address one of those the board but ignores the other two and you need to look at all three to properly evaluate the best play.the only constant strategy irrespective of all of these cues is that youre trying to win in each game. how you win will change based on the  contextual areas i just described. sometimes youll win by surviving JUST long enough to alex your opponent with a block up and finish them off with burn. sometimes youll win by using your burn to clear the board and stick a defensive alex to put the game out of reach once your opponent is out of threats. sometimes you draw a ton of burn and little else and just have to race.if youre playing against a priest who has an empty board on turn  thats a lot different than a hunter in the same situation. similarly the rest of your hand plays a huge part. whats your plan for turn ? if medivhs valet is a part of that plan playing a secret on turn  becomes more valuable. are you planning to use valet to kill a possible korkron elite? in that case it has to be ice block specifically.im not gonna try to outline all of the scenarios that would change the play here because A thatd be a huge post and B i dont think im very good at playing the new versions of freeze mage. i just wanted to reinforce that there are no default best plays because every game is a totally different situation.,CompetitiveHS,dgssum9,4,t5_31ns2

It is also a better match up for Hunter I feel though still pretty bad. My secret mage was basically auto lose to hunter just couldnt get on the board and not enough clear. Though poly morph helps both those match ups  poly the igneous elemental if they are questing with the fireflys. and I was still trying to work with potion of ply at that point.,CompetitiveHS,dgtyz1b,1,t5_31ns2
11768445,0,t1_dgto071,I added in Genzo to combat this based off advice found in the aggro guide and it has helped the out of steam problem in some cases.  That being stated if the game is still going at turn  its probably not going to end well.  As far as over commitment someone above nailed it  if one card clears your board you are likely overcommitted with this deck though against taunt warrior and freeze mage in particular you dont have much choice.,CompetitiveHS,dgtzfnu,2,t5_31ns2

11770298,0,t1_dgu32sq,I got to legend with an ele shaman and Eater of Secrets as my only hate tech. That alone gave me close to  win rate against all mages I faced. It drastically impoves that one matchup and only slightly decreases winrate for others.,CompetitiveHS,dgu70d7,1,t5_31ns2
11772533,0,t1_dgufzjf,another thing you can do against taunt warriors is holding your razormaw in hand for midlate game to potentially adapt a small minion with psn   attack to get through a taunt easily. no need to always drop him on turn .  its nice to get early damage in but theres no need to rush in that matchup.,CompetitiveHS,dgug6or,1,t5_31ns2

11776987,0,t1_dguksv6,Honestly i like the earlier version more. Ive also been playing with tar creepers and i dont like them they just felt like weak turn. Also i prefer to play  drop instead of daggering on t which mean Im down one card comparing to your strategy thus hucksters deathrattle fits perfectly into resource supply role. Not sure about obsadian shard tho ,CompetitiveHS,dguyizv,1,t5_31ns2
11778078,0,t1_dgukali,Same for pirates with Southsea captain out or any units out with Stormwind Champion.,CompetitiveHS,dgv2zer,2,t5_31ns2
11778644,0,t1_dgv4j9z,You can separate your stats by class and date assuming you only played this kind of deck then you can just grab your general rogue stats. Typically this is what I will do. So do you think this deck is actually viable? I read in one of your comments that even wins feel hard to get  this really shouldnt be the case in an optimized competitive deck correct? If the goal of this deck is to be fun and unique thats completely fine. I have nothing against that personally. However it doesnt belong as a resource on this subreddit unless there is a competitive aspect to your post.,CompetitiveHS,dgv5ak4,5,t5_31ns2

11785240,0,t3_683ai5,Honestly this just makes it more complex than it needs to be. Understanding what a control deck is and what a combo deck is and what an aggro deck is all I saw and I knew that already. ,CompetitiveHS,dgvw9fy,6,t5_31ns2

11806339,0,t1_dgxuuqb,Malylock is much more aggressive than this list and has far fewer taunts. Malylock has a lot of burst and reach but less good AOE shadow flame on s and cant deal with aggressive decks as well. But I see your point malylock probably is better in the current meta overall. ,CompetitiveHS,dgyaf95,1,t5_31ns2
11807228,0,t1_dgydc22,Definetely Ragnaros. Wickerflame can be discovered from Stonehill Defender. Also Ragnaros is a really important part of the decks ability to stabilise in the late game.Only time I feel ive gotten great value out of wickerflame is if I really need the heals and put it down with a redemption from hydrologist. That or hitting it with a Spikeridged Steed.,CompetitiveHS,dgye1zg,5,t5_31ns2
11808559,0,t1_dgxyk8z,Pirate warrior is the best but if you like hunter better go for that.Make a good deck now and stop buying packs unless you are close to the pity timer. The key to staying competitive as an fp player is to save up lots of gold so you can buy enough packs at the release of an expansion.,CompetitiveHS,dgyjho9,1,t5_31ns2
