16805,0,t3_1uazvw,OK so a few mistakes were made. Posting without anonymity.  I am guilty of this but I havent been anonymous on the Internet in the past  years. Storing your PM insecurely.  It was in his home and in a crappy safe.  Recommend you all have a BEEFY safe or a safe deposit boxvaulthidden storage.  AND BOLT IT TO THE GROUND.Heres a video on choosing a safe that is really educational. Potentially  Posting photos of your collection with EXIF data Geotagging intact.I have an iPhone so heres the recommendation on this one.  Remove the EXIF data on specific photosOr turn off geotagging on photos globally if you arent making use of that functionality or if you post a LOT of pics and dont want to do the above app each time.Im sure there are android appssettings to do the same  Also IMGUR strips EXIF data!!!   One of the reasons why Reddit pushes its use I presume.   Trading over the Internet with your address when that is where you store your PM.  This is the worst one IMO.  You gave someone the treasure map and a quick scan of your stack pics might get them EXIF data to confirm it!Be safe and keep stacking!,Silverbugs,cegci05,3,t5_2t1b5

118206,1,t3_1vfqi8,Ugh I think you are probably paying too much premium for the American Silver Eagles. Stick with generic  oz fine . silver rounds.if you have a local LCS that charges .. over spot stick with them for the generic  oz rounds.  If you dont have a good LCS check swap meets or craigslist.  And if all else fails go online but try to buy on the dips when there are free shipping deals.  Stay away from Silver with a hefty Premium spot  . or more!.  Always KNOW where you can get  oz silver rounds for the lowest premium.  Remember there are the SAME amount of silver atoms in a generic round as there are in a government bullion round.  SOMETIMES you can get that premium back from a few Local Coin Shops.  But more times then not a LCS will tell you that they cant pay that a hefty premium like you might expect or be led to believe by some of the rsilverbugs who are overly fond of ASEs or heavily invested in them. Stick with  oz rounds versus larger bars  coins because when it comes time to sell there are more people who can afford a  oz round then a  oz coinbar.  Especially on EBay!  Pay for SILVER.  Do not Pay for Premium.  You might be surprised if you have a nice stack of cash and you keep an ad up on craigslist you will find yourself buying American Silver Eagles Canadian Maples etc at Spot.  By putting up  a craigslist ad saying looking to buy  want to buy silver  oz rounds at Spot!Remember if there isnt a good Local Coin Shop in your area that might be an opportunity for you to start selling and buying silver.  It isnt easy but its not imposible just look at how many coin shops  gold and silver shops exist already!Also dont worry about how you probably already got kind of fleeced on the premium you paid for the eagles.  There will be rounds you like aesthetically speaking that just appeal to your artistic sense and I would say buy one or two of them but dont buy a bunch!  Pay for silver not premium.  Or else you are basically a artistic coin collector and not a stacker i.e a true silverbug!There are a lot of fake silverbugs here who arent stackers but more so collectors.  These people are some of the worst and cannot take criticism.  ,Silverbugs,cerw3uy,0,t5_2t1b5

389697,0,t3_1yjnha,Well if you are dollar cost averaging you shouldnt stop buying until you are done saving.The whole point behind DCA is to limit your exposure to high prices because you make scheduled purchases regardless of the price. Also when prices are lower you buy more volume but the same dollar value. Your purchase should always be based on a dollar value. So in other words you DCA by buying  of silver every month. You do not buy by the ounce per month.It is critical to resist the urge to buy more because you think the price is on a bottom. The market will always prove you wrong.,Silverbugs,cfl5p22,2,t5_2t1b5

398749,0,t1_cfm3132,Due to the demand from preppers junk silver has a higher premium than it used to. Playing with the old circulated coins is fun though. Do you have a local coin shop? While you might end up paying sales tax depending on your location and what youre buying it can end up being less than shipping fees from an out of state distributor. That can depend on your states laws. For example US legal tender coins like junk silver Silver Eagles American the Beautiful  oz silver coins are not charged sales tax in Florida where I am.If generic rounds or bars arent what youre looking for check Canadian Silver Maple Leafs or Austrian Silver Philharmonic  oz coins. Each are very popular not as popular as Silver Eagles in the US and are governmentguaranteed silver coins with low premiums. They arent quite as low as generic rounds or bars but are slightly cheaper than silver eagles.

448510,0,t1_cfr6i2l,Nope  IYR is not a REIT  it is a derivative on a real estate index. So  it is pegged to how some measure of the entire US housing sector is doing you dont own a small piece of lots of properties you own a share in a fund that invests in properties. IYR is something called an ETF  an exchange traded fund much like SLV is an exhange traded fund for silver you hear people complaining about paper silver that would be this SLV.A REIT is a little different in that you have the value of your share based on actual buildings so for LTC it is  nursing homes  assisted living buildings.. you can actual enter those physical buildings and say yep I own a bit of this and I am renting that bit out and that rent is my dividend I get from LTC. A few nice things about REITs over a real estate fund like IYR is that REITS must leagally give out  of the rent they take in directly to the investors. So the dividends are nice close to the value of the rent. BUT you dont have to be a landlord and fix pipes and AM. So in the silver analogy this is like Buying a  oz brick of physical silver with  of your friends. You have something closer to real material but you are only one of many of all the owners. This can be nice for one more reason  if you want out you sell your part in that brick to your friends. Just like that in a REIT you can sell it just like a share of stock while if you owned a whole single building it would take weeks to months to sell.The ownership of one building as a landlord is like owning a  oz brick of silver yourself. You need to do all the upkeep on the building just like if you had the physical silver you would need a safe airtites all those sorts of things.,Silverbugs,cfr945e,2,t5_2t1b5

720525,0,t3_22emcd,Was hanging out with some friends on Saturday night and we decided to stop by this rec center attached to an apartment complex where a friend of a friend was working until pm. We were waiting for his to close up so we could go get drinks.Pulling into the parking lot we noticed a little rabbit sitting right in the middle of the road and not really reacting to traffic. My girlfriend jumps out of the car and runs out into the street to retrieve the rabbit and see if she could help it. The poor thing didnt seem to have any broken bones but things turned pretty grim when she looked at its rump and noticed a bunch of blood and some intestines protruding from its butt. The animal was clearly in a great deal of pain. Long story somewhat shorter everyone else retreated to the rec center and I brained the little guy with big ass rock. It was a quick clean onehit and done thing. I feel bad about it but it was the best thing for the situation and way better that leaving it to suffer through the night till a dog or a feral cat would find it.TLDR Im a rabbit murderer and coldhearted killer apparently.,Silverbugs,cgm6dof,5,t5_2t1b5

So it sounded like without her saying it  that I was added to the list due to me purchasing the improperly priced MS Eagle and that it might have been someone else who added me due to this.No harm no foul but she did say that if anyone else is on the list to please call and she would happily take you off if everything else was good.Hope this can clear up anything and help anyone else.,Silverbugs,ch476bz,3,t5_2t1b5

2550107,0,t1_cmrfcjt,Maybe maybe not. JP Morgans shenanigans burnt a lot of traders recently losses to the tune of  million.Lots of regular traders got their fingers burnt pretty badly. Whos to say what companies will now fold. Heres what silver analyst Ted Butler has to say about the situationgt Being that futures trading is a zero sum game the  million that the technical funds booked in profits on COMEX silver shorts so far was largely lost by the raptorsthe Commercial traders other than the Big . Technical funds closed out  short contracts at a profitand some but not all raptors sold nearly  long contracts at a loss of close to  million. While the large gain will undoubtedly increase the technical funds financial war chest the loss to the  or so raptors which sold contracts is devastating. Because the loss was not only large but concentrated among so few raptors its reasonable to assume the losses have knocked those traders out of the silver game for good. No speculator can lose an amount equal to years worth of cumulative gains in any one trade and remain solvent or continue as if nothing extreme has occurred.gtTherefore the relatively few raptors who got caught and sold the  long contracts in the downdraft from over  as recently as Oct to  and can no longer be effectively in business. It is highly unlikely that these traders will trade silver futures anytime soon. And its possible that the large selling by the raptors in gold last week may be related to the massive losses of the silver raptors. After all how hard is it to imagine that the raptors who got caught flatfooted in silver were also long gold futures?  While the losses to the raptors in silver overshadowed what might have been lost on gold longs what real difference does it make? A trader put out of business by silver losses isnt going to trade gold as if nothing mattered.  Silver analyst Ted Butler  December ,Silverbugs,cmrfq17,1,t5_2t1b5

3999860,0,t1_crbm0pm,I disagree. The act of structuring should fall under a SAR and be properly investigated before funds are seized. The simple act of depositing more than k total with multiple smaller transactions simply does not equate guilty of structuring. Again you cant simply say oh he made  deposits for K each for  days straight he is guilty and sieze his shit. Or well you shouldnt be able to. What happened to innocent until proven guilty? Being a criminal charge we still have due process of law. What about the guy who makes k a month in payroll income? He has to hold a check for a month to reach k to avoid having his payroll seized? ,Silverbugs,crc7rvb,1,t5_2t1b5

4412995,0,t3_3bkmwz,There is a fixed amount of silver on this earth.  A nontrivial portion of the easiest to retrieve silver has already been mined and some fraction of that has been lost to waste.  To state the obvious  An ounce of silver cannot be created without effort and cost and there is finite amount of it.  Silver is a historical store of wealth as well as a commodity that is used in nearly every electronic device.  When you buy an ounce of physical silver you hold something that is in finite supply and cannot be easily producedduplicated.A paper receipt on the other hand is a claim for an amount of physical silver.  Many of these paper receipts allow multiple receipts to be written against the physical silver! because rarely do all the receipt owners ask for all their physical silver all at once.  The details on the receipt say if physical delivery of the silver isnt possible for whatever reason youll be given the fiat currency equivalent for that amount of silver.It could be argued that the above receipt is an acceptable equivalent financially to physical silver until there is a shortage in the availability of physical silver.  Develop your own scenarios for that  shortage of supply increased demand confidence in the local currency etc.  Any of these events could cause a run on the physical silver the many receipts against one piece of silver will mean many receipt owners will not get physical possession of the silver.This article suggests there is a  paper to physical silver ratio as of last year ,Silverbugs,csn2v4m,7,t5_2t1b5
4415275,0,t1_csn4w13,Silver is far more of a commodity some say the  commodity after oil compared to gold and so there are more factors driving the price of silver.  David Morgan puts himself out there as an expert in silver and usually has much to say on the subject  google his stuff or check out the new book he just released.I would argue that you shouldnt get too hung up on ifwhy silver prices are manipulated...youre not going change things if they are and most people dont want to hear about it  will dismiss you as a conspiracy theorist.  Like the LIBOR rigging scandal everyone denies it until the truth comes out.Instead assuming you have money you want to put towards the purchase of precious metals Id argue you have to do your homework and decide what you believe is the average cost of production for an ounce of silvergold.  Many out there would argue that number is  for silver and  for gold with a TON of variation or to get geeky a standard deviation around  bucks.  The point being you need to decide what price makes sense to you as a bargain price or buy signal that affords you an opportunity to buy below the average cost of production.   Unless some new technology appears to lower production costs simple math suggests no commodity can sell for below the cost of production for very long without exhausting supply.  And if supply is exhausted assuming no substitutes exist demand will drive the price up above cost of production to satisfy demand.  At least thats what ECON  would say.  YMMV.,Silverbugs,csnc3uf,2,t5_2t1b5

I wanted to have x ounces of generics x ounces of government seminumi bullion and a certain amount Fv in  U.S. And Canadian silver coins.  I feel that having a mix of types of PMs would cover all bases for me.  For generics if spot price starts to sky rocket I have a nice percentage in generic silver so i am covered. If spot falls like it has been recently my semiNumi and  have been generally holding their value or even rising in value in some cases.

5629692,0,t1_cwuvjgm,David is a bit different since his shop is a licensed pawn shop though.  He has to report anything he buys or pawns since he is a pawnbroker however you are  right they are liable under AML laws to report too. .The loophole is that there are really no requirements around what your AML program has to consist of its just a requirement that if a precious metal dealer does more than k of buying AND selling annually they need a AML program in place. Gotta love regulations.  Thats where  of shops get around doing any of this crap. There are two ways to get around this if someone is doing something sketchy you are not going to do business with them or else that will implicate you in the laundering or the assets you purchased will get seized by police and you get nothing back. Second is if a shop sets their thresholds high enough for their program especially at places as small as Davids shop  of people wont meet their threshold and nothing will ever have to be collected or reported and yet they are still adhering to their program Im sure you are right it just makes no sense that this owner would do this and that people would do business here.

He told me they had no ships at sea right now because operating them meant running at a loss.gtThis weekend reports are circulating saying much the same thing The North Atlantic has little or no cargo ships traveling in its waters. Instead they are anchored. Unmoving. Empty.gtYou can see one such report here.  According to itgt    Commerce between Europe and North America has literally come to a halt. For the first time in known history not one cargo ship is intransit in the North Atlantic between Europe and North America. All of them hundreds are either anchored offshore or inport. NOTHING is moving.     gt    This has never happened before.

If a vendor doesnt want to come down on the price for something go to another. Chances are someone else has what you are looking for and are willing to work out a price.

6766496,0,t1_d0j90ws,To be fair nothing his friend said is untrue depending on your definition of collapse.  Every single fiat currency in history has collapsed.  The world economy is not healthy at the moment and hasnt been for quite some time.  China Russia and many other nations are hoarding gold and silver because of this.I dont expect well see a Mad Max situation any time soon but having assets in something that will maintain value if the dollar takes a dump like it did in  wouldnt be a bad idea.  I wouldnt go broke for it but having  of your net worth in silver and gold is recommended by most experts in financial security.Gold and silver arent getrichquick items as they dont tend to go up or down in buying power over the long term barring the occasional bubble.  They go up up up in dollar value but thats because the dollar keeps going down down down in buying power.I use the Pizza Analogy.   years ago an ounce of silver was worth about USD.  A pizza cost roughly USD.  You could if a vendor was amenable trade an ounce of silver directly for a pizza and both parties would get a fair deal.Today an ounce of silver is about USD and guess what a pizza is roughly the same.  Silver is worth about . times what it was in  in dollars but its buying power has not changed.Conversely if you had saved  in cash in  not counting investing or compound interest for the sake of argument youd have  today.  In  that  would buy you a car.  Today it wouldnt come close. If you had bought oz of silver today youd have USD in silver value.  Enough to buy a comparable modern car.The dwindling dollar means your savings are worth less and less every day.  Gold and silver especially gold are hedges against that.  You wont get rich but youll maintain the value of your wealth.  It makes more sense to have a diversified portfolio so that you are hedging against inflation and protecting against market losses when the economy falters but you should primarily have your wealth in a balanced portfolio of equities and other products such that your wealth is making more wealth.,Silverbugs,d0j9fve,19,t5_2t1b5

7132496,0,t1_d1oragb,Weights and measures tend to work fairly well without having to remove anything.  Its not perfect but its better than nothing.  Since silver is much more dense they have to slightly grow the size of the coin to make it weigh right.  If its spot on size wise unless theyre using exotic metals it should be lighter than an actual coin  airtite.  They are pretty easy to validate when you have a known good specimen right next to it.  These gold Eagles recently hit the market in flawless NGC holders.  They are very good copies.  They were able to determine the slabbed coins were counterfeit by looking for key elements on known good coins among other issues.  You can start flexing your skills now.  It also says to see exactly what fakes are on the market.  What they look like.  What they are made of.  I use Alibaba as a resource for this.Personally I only buy from trusted vendors.

Give me  or u get negative. He was a douche for sure but the margins on these coins are very small and minus eBay fees even smaller. If he wanted to he couldve cancelled the transaction sellers can do this if there is an error in the listing. IE I list gold for  vs ... That would be a reasonable correction the seller is not obligated to honor a pricing error. A buyer would be knowingly taking advantage of a mistake. Sellers are limited to the number of cancellations. Keep in mind for sellers eBay favors the buyer majority of cases.He reported you because you tried to ask for  please let us know how this goes.

Very nice looking round. Its a little bit bigger than the size of a quarter... probably the size of a Sacagawea dollar. It contains about grams of silver according to the mint. I paid a nice little premium for it but oh well about x melt value. I ordered it directly from the Shire Post Mint and it came in some pretty awesome packaging probably where a bit of my premium went.The packaging was sealed with real wax and a stamp of the coin itself Very nice and unexpected touch.Heres a pic of the rigid plastic sheet it came in and the informational insert.

At the last G summit time was spent discussing the creation of new SDR bonds that will replace US Treasury bonds in much of the worlds reserve currency. And for the first time in history the SDR basket now includes the Chinese Yuan. And what country just opened their own physical commodities exchange a few months back to compete with the London Fix? China. This is happening right now. Its not a sky is falling conspiracy. Add in the fact that we no longer have the Petrodollar standard to rely on and it looks like theres a  chance the dollar will be officially dead before the end of .

9478942,0,t3_5alqrl,this coupled with the other end of Id rather have food and bullets than silver when the world ends are two sides to the same erroneous way of looking at precious metals.Look at .  Just  years ago.  The stock markets shit the bed. The housing market toppled. Dogs and cats living together mass hysteria.  But for real many people didnt even notice.  No you probably didnt have to have a bunker full of spam nor a chest full of gold to come out ok.However those that did have some metal made out pretty good while the rest of us just muddled through.If everything is fine and the powers that be have the economy well in hand an arguably laughable position given the corrupt disaster that is the world banking system then it doesnt hurt anything to have  of your net work in precious metals.  That much wouldnt have you living on possum and macaroni but it can be a fun physical savings account that historically has kept apace of normal levels of inflation far better than the tiny interest on cash in the bank.On the other hand if it all comes crashing down it is highly unlikely that were talking a walking dead scenario where food and bullets are the new precious resource.  More likely youd see what youve already seen in many countries over the past few decades.  Hyperinflation Zimbabwe today Germany shortly after WW etc.  These places are real and this didnt happen in a fiction story or in ancient times.  Gold and silver arent for trading for jackrabbits and carrots during a collapse Theyre to keep your family wealth while the economy rights itself which it inevitably would.  The government businesses and the very rich all benefit from the economy being stable it would eventually get back on track just as it did in Germany and eventually will in Zimbabwe.  Youll still be sitting on valuable gold and silver instead of dollars that have been through the ringer and may be next to worthless if not entirely valueless since they hold no transmutable worth without the decree of the government.tldr no matter what happens holding gold and silver cant hurt and could vastly improve your situation in many possible future scenarios.,Silverbugs,d9hhf4g,5,t5_2t1b5

This ensures that your purchases receipts and all transfers remain absolutely private by default.gt Untraceable By taking advantage of ring signatures a special property of certain types of cryptography Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.It has gone from just under  a week ago to just around  now.Using an exchange like Poloniex the recommended one and I agree You can still buy about  XMR Monero for one BTC.Study the coin its history its implementation its advantages and consider buying into it now.I suspect that it is climbing right now as the developers are ready to release a stable GUI for the wallet. Up until now everything has been done in a  command line window. Even with that terrible disadvantage Monero has grown pretty steadily. Once the GUI is out Monero is likely to blow wide open. You can see the GUI as it will look in links and discussions about it over at rMonero. That sub and rxmrtrader seem to be the two dominant subs regarding Monero. Xmrtrader has a comprehensive daily thread.There are other cryptos that offer transactional privacy but Monero is miles ahead in development and implementation. I worry that Bitcoin is vulnerable to purposeful damage especially from the Chinese who are responsible for the tremendous rise in Bitcoin over the last several months as its citizens try to evade capital controls or any single powerful government like the US or a group of governments say from the EU.Trump has talked about blocking illegals in the US from sending home remittances and if that happens bitcoin might be the vehicle of choice to get around that. Bitcoin use could balloon so much here in the US that I could see the US working to block Bitcoin.Either way this portends a tremendous boon for adoption of Monero. I see it as a tremendous opportunity for speculation especially right now before the GUI is released.If you have ANY interest in crypto currencies you owe it to yourself to become educated about Monero. Now.EDIT If you ever lamented not buying into bitcoin when it was  or less consider that this is another opportunity of that magnitude. To give you an idea of the magnitude of the Monero market Poloniex shows that the  hour volume consisted of  some BTC were traded for some  XMR. Its a hot market.,Silverbugs,d9zlxfl,5,t5_2t1b5

I would venture a wild guess you would need  worth of silver sheet which btw sheet stock has at least  per oz premium for manufacture cost and I would guess multiply that figure by  for quality craftsmanship then double that figure for gallery or retailer. Which is why silverbugs only discuss mass produced worthless coins and bullion. Art is in another league of collecting.

Im in it for about  with Penn right now it was my first purchase with them and I was basically just trusting them based off the posts on this sub saying they were a reputable retailer.But it didnt take me more than about  minutes this morning to find out that the guy who started PennMetals was the same guy with an Ebay store that caved in just a few years back for the same issues were experiencing now with Penn. So that knowledge does not make me feel good now after the fact but it would have been valuable if I had bothered to seek it out before placing an order.Ultimately its all of our personal responsibilities to make sure were spending our money in the most prudent way possible and part of that is making sure we trust our purchases to a reputable dealer. As they say a tiger cant change its stripes and shady businessmen with careless business practices tend to carry their ineptitude from one venture to the next.I know Im throwing a lot of shade at Penn when I dont even know the whole truth but thats what you do when you suspect someone has stolen hundreds of dollars from you P.

The primary historical difference is stability as pointed out.Further if youre stacking assuming the world is going to continue with its current market system for a while and youre doing this as an investmentvehicle for future purchasing power then please consider  especially since youre young  that youre statistically much much better off heading over to rpersonalfinance and learning about lowcost index funds.  With current market systems gold is better thought of as a value hedge against fiat inflation and potential emergency fund as one part of an existing larger portfolio rather than as a primary investment vehicle.

Im sure people who have never been to rsilverbugs also collect them because theyre freaking cool! So if your cause has a following  over spot is a nobrainer since its for charity  over spot is probably fine for many people. The extra  over spot  work since it is actually a profit for the nonprofit and doesnt go toward the actual price of the round would be a taxdeductible contribution no? Or would it be an exempt item... I know laws are pretty strict about what goodsservices can be taxdeductible.If the cause were near and dear to my heart I would easily drop  over spot for a cool round for it.
