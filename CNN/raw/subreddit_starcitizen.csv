34846,0,t3_1uhoty,A lot of these sound like nice things to have for yourself like instant shield recovery or flashbangs but they would be really annoying for the other party. Imagine flashbang spam from multiple vessels. Some other ideas would have even worse problems like the Comm System Hacker thing. What do they hack? Voicechat? listening to random people and posting defaming videos of it to youtube? most people would have to not use ingame voice when grouping too.While I like the idea of having a nice compiled list of ideas to give the devs something akin to the result of a better brainstorming session I think we should weed out the impossible and improbable ideas beforehand to give the list more weight. Or they will glance at it and just think its another one of those wishful thinking things. Like Planetary Bombardment Weapons I imagine the FPS combat part will be a lot more close quarters and not some huge clashes of army that require planetary bombardment  there wont even be whole planets mapped out to bombard just some areas of interest as I understand it right now.,starcitizen,ceied50,3,t5_2v94d

Marines would be used for boarding actions and creating beachheads on planets. m isnt shit outdoors.And that video means nothing.

111784,0,t3_1vcaeh,Hey guysI really like the style of your casts and the focus on discussion about the big picture feel of the game.  Its a good niche in the SC Casting verse right now. Heres a topic that would fit your format well.  I am really curious about how CIG will approach the overall role of the bomber ships Gladiator and Retaliator.While both of these ships are visually appealing and decently speced I feel that they will be lost in the gameplay against the Hornet and Connie respectively unless they possess unique abilities or gameplay mechanics.There are two takes I have heard on this so far. These are military ships that have been retrofitted for civilian use.  While the platform with be powerful they will not be as versatile as civilian ships designed for multipurpose use a la Connie. These ships will be able to equip special torpedoes unavailable to other ships in their class capable of capital ship destruction and most likely at the cost of the cargo bays. So what is your take on this?  Will the Glad and Connie just be cool retrofited military ships or will they have some unique and exclusive bombing mechanic at some utility cost.,starcitizen,cer5qwn,2,t5_2v94d

135939,0,t1_cetvfje,Ooh thats fancy.Honestly I dont like the solution they found. The point of being damaged by trying to tractor in accelerating ships is so that you have to fight before you can board them. I dont think this is necessary. They should just make the force exerted by the tractor beam weak enough that you can fight it with thrusters. That way you could still escape a tractor beam but you could use tractor beams to move non disabled ships.,starcitizen,cetww6m,1,t5_2v94d

RobJG  days ago I am so glad that a game like this will allow me to never pvp!I think people like this have no idea what type of disservice they are doing championing a feature like this. In the end all it offers is a less stimulating experience for everyone where you can easily be lazy and careless with no risk yet high reward.IMHO everyone should have the exact same risk.

330780,0,t1_cfett93,I know they are saying that but I think it is a really bad idea. They will have to balance the input methods by gimping all to be as inefficient as the worst option or compensate with level of auto aim etc. That is not what PC gaming is all about.

330953,0,t1_cfeg1z0,Think i need to clarify my point a bit. as by offering a head tracking option one player could now do the job of  people being able to shoot  guy straight ahead while still being able to steer the ship and also shoot another guy to the right at the same time using head tracking how i see this as being different to lets say a HOTAS setup is that both control methods can achieve the same results only with one method being more refined than the other. This allows one player the ability to do something the other cant using existing input devices is all. Im one of the people who will be getting the Occulus i just have questions over its possible impact not that there should be a standardisation of PC input devices.TLDR its fine to have an advantage but not to be able to achieve something new that other input methods could possibly achieve.,starcitizen,cff2ok7,1,t5_2v94d

437417,0,t1_cfprl8n,When I think about choice in attire in games I tend to think of Skyrim mods.  I kind of love the things because they allow you choice in all things.  The prime example that comes to mind is that some people have imported the Tera armours into Skyrim with conversions for several of the female body mods.  When I look at the armours in the context of Tera I cant help but roll my eyes a little. A secondary role of women in game seems to be eye candy with littletono choice for more practical armours.  When I look at the armours in the context of Skyrim with the exception of the lorefriendly catastrophe of it they dont seem so bad. If youre wearing something that makes a bikini look modest its because you want to not because some unseen developers hand has decided that you must.Im currently playing through SWtOR with some friends which is another good example.  On the one hand you have full hooded robes and heavy Mandalorian armour.  On the other hand you have bare midriffs and slave bikinis a la Return of the Jedi.

There is a lot of opposites across the board as every single component of that garb is designed not because it makes sense but only for the sake of fashion. Which for fashion yea they do that dont they?  In a way because it is so completely opposite for each component of the garb you do see how it all looks like one very efficient showcase.

It is not only possible to do that but it is also possible to fully enclose a starship and have no viewports and instead have a thin display on the interior walls projecting video feed from outside. That way multiple crew members can see the same image broadcast from a multitude of small cameras on the hull.

However a scout ship would probably be used for long reconnaissance missions to planets and would most likely have to land or at least enter atmo. Also wasteful would be excluding an easily implemented feature atmo flight seeing as all these other ship designs have atmo capability why would the Xian hobble themselves?.

615206,0,t1_cga70u4,But if you are trying to work stealth systems to their fullest in a dogfight you are probably fighting a losing battle regardless.Now you are talking play style  and that factors a lot into these things.Like I said in dogfighting Im a boomnzoom efighter.  I dont need to worry about RPMs or mixture being just right because I set it for my preferred trolling ceiling and throttle back to min on my dive.  I only commit to the dive if Im sure I can get a gun solution  the moment I have the solution at proper convergence I pump and dump and then extend away.  Rinse and repeat  as long as I have the advantage.If he goes to the deck or pulls into a knife Im gone back into the clouds.  He cant chase me he doesnt have the e I had from the dive.Same thing  if you are a stealth fighter you wont be relying on shield management or fancy maneuvers.  You will be relying on surprise  on minimizing your signature and quietly getting the perfect solution.  Your excess energy will be reserved for boosting the throttle and the aft shields so you can evade as soon as you dump your load  because if you dont get him on the first pass you are not going to hang around for a turnnburn.

GSync could potentially help with this since it would likely make it way less apparent.Now I will say that I still wouldnt recommend getting SLIXFire setups if you plan to use something like the Oculus Rift because microstutter still does happen and thats not good when youre wearing the Rift where high stable FPS is key. I personally prefer just getting one single powerful GPU but to each their own!Plus the Titan Z isnt really meant for gaming though it will still work for it of course.

But I hope we can eventually have frigate vs frigate arena matches where the match isnt lost until the teams frigate is destroyed. teamwork and tactics will be required on each team to be effective. And with a frigate full of players controlling each turret and players piloting every fighter. It could be pretty insane. Since they already said you wont be able to sip a cup of coffee and just watch the battle.

741179,0,t3_22mfe5,Erm... Ill go in order I guess.a You can buy a ship package with the game only. Its  gets you an Aurora MR some starting money and the digital game package.b You can go up  for the MR package that gets you the above plus alpha amp beta access. This has been in place since Kickstarter ended. You dont need alphabeta access to download the hangar module. You need alphabeta access to get into the dogfight module OR you can spend  for a pass after current alpha access holders are taken care of. CIG has been pretty open about their development timeline.  has been the word from way early on with  not an impossibility. They are launching alpha modules and bring them online when they are ready to be brought online. The modules are still in active development as we see with the several updates to the hangar module. The dogfight module will be getting the same as will planetsidesocial org . and the other modules. First iteration of the dogfight module is supposed to be Hornets only. If you have a Hornet in your hangar great! You get to fly your Hornet normal not Super. If you dont have a Hornet in your hangar great! You still get to fly a Hornet. You temporarily get one added to your hangar for purposes of participating in the dogfight module until a ship you own is added to the dogfight module. Thats been the known for  months now. We will also be given weapons and gear specifically to use in the dogfight module to test out. You seem to think the dogfight module is the game. Its not. Its an alpha test phase just like the hangar module. You wont be able to earn money to buy other ships in the dogfight ALPHA because it is an ALPHA. It is NOT a game. Its a module within the game that is being alpha tested. In the persistent universe meaning when the game actually launches in  youll be able to buy every ship weve currently had access to ingame. But RIGHT NOW in the ALPHA TESTING stage you will not because its not a game. Its an alpha testing stage. They do not have x the money they asked for originally. Their Kickstarter campaign was to raise enough money to prove to investors that there was interest and to get investors to foot the rest of the bill. However the Kickstarter was wildly successful and that success continued onto RSIs own website.

You get those forces from slamming on the breaks hitting the accelerator or taking a sharp corner.  Those accelerations generated by swiftly starting stopping or changing direction are also present in zeroG environments.  Any time your velocity changes in magnitude of direction theres an acceleration that you can feel.  Does this help you out?I should also make it clear that Gs dont have anything to do with gravity per say its just a handy way to describe the magnitude of an acceleration.

I have tried it in ARMA III and Diasporae.g. Freespace  so far.ARMA III explicitly supports Freetrack and it works flawlessly without much setup.Diaspora supports the standard TrackIR interface which Freetrack can emulate making it also work right out of the Box.In any case you can use Freetrack to emulate a mouse or joystick and bind that to head movement that way you get atleast DOF Headtracking.The only games I know of which require hacks are the Battlefield series where you have to hold a button to be able to move your head and cant control the orientation of your plane while you do so. In BF that is the same for TrackIR. This rather stupid restriction is due to Dice seeing head tracking as an unfair advantage.,starcitizen,cgs6q07,1,t5_2v94d

789079,0,t1_cgtxzk1,Of all the space games Ive played with or without a joystick Ive never played one with aim assist. Actually I tell a lie I played Xcom interceptor and it had a end game weapon which aimed for you. It was boring and OP.I just dont think you need it. I welcome all the cool features you mentioned such as ECM packages scanning shield and general energy management and I would prefer no aim assist at all. Ive never needed it in the past.Even games which dont quite have that level of complexity such as Tiefighter but where you could juggle front and rear shields or energy levels weapons and extra subsystems speed matching and targeting yet I had no aim assist to hit those pesky nippy Tiedefenders. I just dont understand the reasons to have this at all. You say balance but that just means simplifying combat because a joypad cant aim for shit  lets be honest here.

I also remember it being called Snap AWPinggt gt gt gt This required both speed and pinpoint aim. A pinpoint sniper style aim that will not be available to those who use a joystick for pitchyawroll in SC.Sure but thats presumably not in anyway implemented in SC. I havent seen any railguns or awps mounted on ships I know that makes me sound flippant and disrespectful to you its not meant to be Im just saying its a non issue.The drifting part from what footage was shown from Pax just seemed more like a strafe move than anything. He maintained directional movement but turned his ship to face opposite. A pretty cool mechanic but his turn speed was still limited to make that maneuver. The only thing that seemed too fast regarding turning and maneuvering and Im guessing it was broken was when Chris tried out the MP dog fight and his joypad locked up and he started doing some crazy death blossomfor those not familar with cheesey s movies But yeah ok lets see how it turns out in a few weeks time optimistic fingers crossed when we try it out ourselfs.

826135,0,t1_cgy2d3u,Since it is used as a mouse input you could use it to control POV and any guns tied to it but itd be slow and unwieldy. You would get more precise control from a badly configured TrackIR profile and even more from something like the Rift. However if youre in a turn after someone and you cant quite bring your forward facing guns on them the nub could be pushed up to at least bring gimballed weapons to bear. Using it along one axis at a time isnt too frustrating I just wouldnt recommend it as a replacement for a mouse.What would be nice would be a mousejoy program that could map mouse axes to a virtual joystick while separating them from mouse input on separate devices. Unfortunately they dont seem to exist. If one did you could map pitch and yaw controls to the mouse nub and use the throttle in combination with an actual mouse for aiming. Right now the only throttle that I know of where this is an option is the CH Pro throttle The minijoystick on the throttle can be used for yawpitch the way hat switch on the front of the throttle under the index finger can be used for lateral and vertical thrusters and the throttle itself can be used for forward thrust. Your right hand is then free for POV and aiming with an actual mouse. This would be my setup if mouse ended up being too powerful versus other control methods when it came to aiming. Assuming a mouse doesnt end up being better than a joystick for the right hand anyone with a CH throttle as part of their HOTAS setup now has an unused minijoystick they can map to verticallateral thrusters for extra fine control instead of the onoff of the hat switch.,starcitizen,cgy6lmi,2,t5_2v94d

872360,0,t3_243oj4,Hawken is a free to play mech combat FPS. What could an FPS mech game possibly have to do with a space sim? The thing is combat in Hawken takes a while compared to twitch shooters like CoD. You need a bunch of bullets and rockets to take down a single enemy. One of the most important things is staying aware of objects other than your opponent  removing the tunnel vision effect you get in these games. I assume this will be one of the hardest aspects of dog fighting and playing this game can improve that.Also it trains your precision tracking your target while firing a machine guntype weapon and yes even some twitch shooting hitting a rocket is extremely hard in most cases. Positioning is incredibly important so when you dodge you have to consciously decide where to dodge and what will be the consequences of that. Then there is resource management. Every mech has a certain amount of fuel a resource used to boostdodgefly etc. Not keeping track of that can get you killed easily. Weapons overheat and it takes an eternity for them to cool down after that. It encourages team play. There are various formations and other tactics that completely obliterate a bunch of guys running solo and forces the other team to work together to counter them.Besides all that its a very fun game to play.

Remember that there are other expenses associated such as the physical rewards for backers that I would guess sums up to around  million alone and then theres the cost for the servers costumer support and other such things. And then comes various taxes like income and business tax etcetra.My totally unofficial and absolutely uneducated guess is that the actual development budget for the production is more like M right now. Which is indeed still pretty radical impressive awesome and rare for an independent computer game project let alone a crowdfunded one.

Notice that theyve released the Gladius model shortly after the stretch goal was released but have yet to release at least  other stretch goal ships that have been put forth? To me thats an indication that its been something theyve been working on for awhile.  The WC games always went Light Medium HeavyBomber in ship progression. And usually there are  ships or so. Sometimes like in WC with the Ferret or S with the Avenger you had a training ship of sorts. Hornet to me seems to be nebulously between medium and heavy probably heavy IIRC which means that theyve been missing their light fighter and their mediumheavy fighter.

900507,0,t1_ch6ji2s,But they are paid alpha ships the whole thing with subscribers is that you get a one day pass to fly X ship if youve paid for  months. Other than that if you buy a Hornet you can fly a Hornet. Now the only differences here are that if you dont have one of the three ships that will be available with DFM v then you are given an equivalent based on what you do have ie if you had an M youd probably get an Aurora MR Freelancer would get a Hornet as a temporary measure until your ship is implemented into Arena Commander.As for the Matchmaking its skill based and not so much ship based. I mean they wont put  Auroras against  Hornets but when you play it puts people with you that have a similar skill based on a calculation of your winloss rate and other points of interest that they are adding.You could say that DFM is pay to win because you buy ships and thats the only way to get them but in buying the ships youre helping finish the development of the game its not like this money is going into a publishers coffer who has no interest in making a better game. If youve followed this for a while you can see some of the massive things theyve added which was never part of the original plan and that was all due to people buying ships or paying subscriptions. I like their model and would be happy to see it implemented in other games.

The entire voting system itself was meant to replace the need for moderation outside of a few serious circumstances Doxxing  IRL Threats  Descrimination i.e. racisim.If you dont like memes thats fine press the down vote button on them if thats the case. Being a moderator of something doesnt make your opinion any more or less valid than any other user. Dont abuse the position of power you have found yourself to be in to make what is meant to be a community driven site in what is your personal opinion.This game is going to be huge and the community behind it will also grow exponentially from its current state once it goes live. If you cant handle the pressure now you are going to crumble when you start getting x the traffic you currently do later on.For the sake of the current user base and the many s of thousands to come just be as hands off as possible. Keep the place looking pretty and the discussion civil and thats it.TLDR  The downvote  upvote system was created for a reason To avoid this kind of BS. Dont try to shape the entire freespeech platform of reddit into the vision of a select few self appointed moderators. I appreciate and respect the thankless work that it is but avoid trying to manipulate the sub into what you want via arbitrary rules isnt something you should engage in. Leave it to the voting system and let the community as a whole decide.TY lt,starcitizen,chap1px,4,t5_2v94d

945616,0,t1_charavr,Easy with the down votes ppl it was just sarcasm.  I personally dont like the idea.  I like to think that a character is immortal in a way much like in the movies  think James Bond.  And if I choose to age him it my choice.  I would point out that the  Im at work and  I am sleeping a day my character is aging x faster doing nothing.  If I miss a weekend almost  days pass in game.  That will add up quickly.    I have to agree it does add immersion and goes along with the death of a spaceman concept though.  On a post a put up a long time ago I talked about the fact that perma death will cause players not just RPers to disconnect from there characters meaning they wont care about them as much.  Forcing changes in appearance due to age cybernetics and scarring while realistic takes away form the fantasy of the heroic starship captain.  It just adds to the bitter reality that everyone dies.  And while you may think its hilarious that your character Killzuded likes to ram ppl with his LTI Freelancer think Operation Pitchfork the guy who took the time to work on a characters look back story and and name may think differently about starting over because his heroicdeadly character is now a  yr old cyborg.

989212,0,t1_chgmi1m,Sure when you want to go from Uranus to Neptune it makes a big difference if Neptune is nearby or on the far side of the solar system. But planets have orbits that take many years or even decades. If the game goes live with Uranus and Neptune on the same side of the solar system they would still be one the same side of the solar system when the game shuts down twenty years later. There is no point in simulating that.The inner planets would be more interesting but at travel times of  minutes for an entire lightday it really makes no difference if Mars is near Earth or on the far side of the sun. The travel times would only vary by seconds.And you dont change that problem by compressing time at a rate of  or so The distance between the inner planets would still play no role and the orbits of the outer planets would still take months or years. Which by the way would make the simulation of economic effects quite hard since the devs would have to take effects into account that are months or years away.So unless you make planets orbit at immersionbreakingly fast velocities and model extremely unrealistic star systems that unrealistic that the point of simulating orbits for more realism and immersion becomes moot orbits of planets will have no visible effect and wont do anything for the gameplay.And dont dream of taking a parking position above the solar system and watching the planets orbit the sun. Star systems wont be a modeled as single objects and the distances will be too large to actually see the planets from such position. And like I said above even with compressed time as discussed by Chris a few weeks ago the planets and even most moons would move to slowly to notice their orbits. At a compression rate of  the orbit of the Moon would still take two and half days. You couldnt really observe that from Earth unless you are really really patient.The only way to see the planets orbit the sun would be to make two screenshots of the systemmap with a waiting time of maybe a month between them. Only then you would see small variations for the inner planets but still no change at all for the outer planets.I still think though that CIG should go for it because it would be easy to do and at least add to the immersion. Since star systems as a whole or only visible on the system map it should be easy to model orbits for the planets. No need to actually model the orbits in the Denvironment since you couldnt see distant planets anyway. Moons and spacestations are a different topic but modeling their orbits should be no problem either since the game doesnt simulate gravitational effects on stellar scales. Just give every moon and every spacestation an orbital path around their planet and a velocity at which the travel on that path.,starcitizen,chgqb9c,1,t5_2v94d

In David Webers HH universe large defense platforms have maneuvering engines specifically to avoid this type of attack in fact it was this type of concept that completely destroyed most of Manticore and Graysons orbital manufacturing infrastructure in that series.It wouldnt work against any kind of target that could maneuver. The attack profile of the delivery ship would be so completely obvious youd be able to avoid it without issue. Against larger or stationary targets youd have some other issues particularly if your targets backdrop is a planet. It would limit your approach angles.More likely I could see dumb firing being an option. In the XWingTIE Fighter games missiles fired without a lock were significantly harder for capital ships to shoot down since they were essentially highspeed tiny rockets with no active electronics.

Having a joystick though is ten times funner and more immersive than using Mouse and keyboard so Im looking at getting something that feels right and will last me awhile. I typically do my own research for weeks before buying the peripheral I want and usually I get what I want at a good price and it will last me for as long as I take care of it.TLDR  Its about personal preference and budget.

1110175,1,t1_chug7uk,I love your post. No seriously I love it. I agree with pretty much everything youre saying I think theres a slight misunderstanding of my original post however.The first three quote blocks you selected were me explaining how projects in my own company end up not what I assume is happening at CIG. As far as what CIGs processes are I am making plenty of assumptions but they are somewhat educated assumptions given that they have plenty of content showing their office setup teams and have provided a fairly decent picture as to what it is like to work with them.On the last quote block and comment I do agree that we have no insight into their source control and deployment structure but I assume that some of these issues must be major enough that they didnt feel comfortable sending it out to simply patch later when it could be something akin to rereleasing. Just my thoughts though.Lastly regarding agile its a buzzword. I probably shouldnt have even mentioned it but it seems that they are using a fairly iterative approach to SDLC. That was really all I was aiming at and the fact that CIGs deadlines are really just goals not hard and fast drop dead dates. If that bothers you thats your perogative  take it up with CIG and Chris Roberts. As far as Im concerned as long as they have money I dont mind.I only worry that theyll run out of funding for the project.  million seems big but thats not that much when you consider the amount of costs they are footing monthly. Multiple highly skilled teams of IT professionals office space in nottoocheap cities travel and maintenance of the community site alone are ground for a fairly large bill. I suppose they do have a sizeable amount of subscribers however so hopefully they are managing to that.,starcitizen,chuhgy4,3,t5_2v94d

HOTAS at most gives you three or four degrees of freedom depending on if your stick has a twist function pitch yaw roll forwardbackward. Of course you can map the extra degrees to digital inputs but I am speaking only of analog here.Two sticks will give you anywhere between  and  degrees of freedom.

1128256,0,t3_271jgc,CIG has excluded people from subscribing themselves by making it unattractive relative to other options. I am a former subscriber but never again unless benefits change. Why?Think of it this way I can budget  a month toward Star Citizen. For that  a month I can either...A Be an Imperator subscriber and get a monthly PDF Jump Point of which  of the content is uninteresting to me and with some issues being filled entirely with content that does not apply to me Idris issues for the space lt. I would also get access to a store for specialty items like patches that I have no intention of buying and every  months I would get a vanity item that Id rather earn in the game anyway. Recently added I can also get a day pass to fly other ships in the DFM  ships that I would have pledged for if I actually wanted to fly them in the first place. These benefits only affect me and I could certainly live without any of them. I can buy a new game package every  months to get more players into the game. At first I could give these out to friends who are interested in the game but unable to afford it or unwilling to take the plunge. Later on I could start giving these out to the community at large. This brings more players to the game and enriches the community overall. It also makes me feel like a nice guy which is nice. I could save up my RSI credit and within a year be able to afford a Constellation or other multicrew vessel which I could share with friends and organizationmates.In the end all three of these options involve me giving the exact same amount of money I.E. support to CIG the only difference is what I get in return. None of the things cost CIG anything to give me other than money that was already invested in their development and would have been so regardless of whether or not I pledged anything at all. Option  brings almost no value to the table for me and absolutely none for anyone else.Option  brings only intangible emotional value feelgood to me but brings a lot to others the ability to play a game you otherwise couldnt access  overall community value from a larger community.Option  brings a lot of value to me personally and also some to others who I choose to share the ship with.When you look at it this way why would I or anyone in their right mind ever subscribe unless they specifically wanted access to the subscriber store or the longterm  year meta benefits? And no You are supporting CIG by subscribing! is not valid because I am supporting CIG equally in all  scenarios.,starcitizen,chwjds7,4,t5_2v94d

One follows the other. if you are releasing something so early you should throw everything out there to show people that things take time and bugs will be there and more and more are beeing fixed. instead of building expectations because they are to proud to realease something that crashes. after release of AC alot of people will complain and RAGE about bugs and they brought it on themselves! they delay and tell us it is to keep the game from crashing at startup but still want us to expect the game to crash at startup? have they release as planned nobody would have expected the game to start perfectly every time and it does not so its ok.

1164795,0,t1_ci0mvwh,They designed the game through a multitude of factors in such a way that it rewards twitch gameplay rather than proper energyvelocity management.By far the biggest and most unforgivable issue is the mouse interface they settled on.  It is literally Freelancer  and a control scheme we were explicitly promised would not be in place  while also breaking their kickstarter promise of being controller agnostic.  Under the current scheme MKB gt all because the game through software emulation of a virtual joystick coddles the mouse user by addressing the interfaces weakness by flying the ship for them chase the mouse while also allowing them to retain their pointing capacity and pinpoint accuracy...a Mouse user is playing a fundamentally different game where they control the guns and the AI follows with the ship while everyone else is flying a ship...Consequently the game devolves into a simple point and shoot whackamole affair.  Theres a reason sim enthusiasts loathe this style of mouse control and its because it turns the game into a pointandclick adventure time rather than a spaceship simulator.  It doesnt have to be that way as many games have found quite enjoyable and fair mouse implementations see for example Diaspora or EliteDangerous  The fact that CR both broke his promise AND doesnt appear to comprehend why this is such a shit idea is a slap in the face to early backers that were promised a return to the golden age of space sims. Beyond the control issues ships are too slow fights are too close range the IFCS is fucked in the sense that it wont allow for the most basic maneuver combinations i.e. strafing in coupled mode or changing your velocity vector in uncoupled etcand yes EVERY combination of DOF maneuvers is physically possible with  thrusters and theres virtually no sense of momentum beyond input lag which is actually totally fine in my book considering it arises from the physical modeling of thruster. Even with COMSTAB off these issues remain because everything is so damn slow.Ultimately its twitchy arcadey mess because everyone is at close range and constantly flying passed each other so youre more concerned about playing keep your pointer on the box than you are with actually managing your velocity vector. Basically acceleration in SC is far too high relative to reasonably attainable top speeds. Consequently its possible to juke around everywhere rather than flying in arcs and planning intercepts that give you the energyvelocity advantage. If cryengine cant handle the math of truly high speeds then they should fake it by reducing acceleration. Optimally theyd just significantly increase top speeds expand total play area and fix their fucked IFCS system.  Its the difference between Gundam or Macross with tons of juking and actual deliberate space sims like IWarIn the end far too much emphasis is placed on point and click gameplay as opposed to actually flying a spaceship and what flying is there is shit compared to other currently available sims not to say anything of what we were actually promised....In short its an arcadey mess and my faith CRs vision has been irreparably harmed.  Since this whole endeavor was based on faith the whole house of cards falls apart...,starcitizen,ci0nq61,1,t5_2v94d
1165162,0,t1_ci0i9gh,Thanks that should help!I think my magboots were on when I was trying it before but when I cycled them I didnt notice the acceleration.,starcitizen,ci0p7up,1,t5_2v94d
1165174,0,t3_27g1y1,There are many interesting arguments being put up in this thread. I agree with the OP that more information on the gimbal states of each weapon class would be useful. But for me the choice to make the goal to target the enemy ship directly is the biggest issue.One of the biproducts of having to lead your shots is that your turns are always a lesser angle than your targets which allows you to slowly gain on them. With the current implementation of aiming your reticule at the enemy ship you are performing much wider turns than with leading to keep the target in your sites and as a result dont catch up nearly as much.I personally would prefer it if the target location was at a point which is the average distance between each weapons lead points directly in between the blue Xs in the OPs pic. This gives many advantages over the existing system including The amount of gimbaling each weapon would require to be aiming at the target is less because you are leading slightly with you shipmeaning that you can target ships which are traveling at a greater tangentspeed than the current implementation as your gimbals have more articulation before the target leaves their range. Being aware of your opponents direction and velocity with respect to you own would be more important because with the current implementation if a ship suddenly changes direction you still only have to aim at the ship. Eg ship goes from banking right relative to you to left But with my proposal you have to go from aiming to the right of the enemy ship to aiming to the left of the enemy target. This means you need more skill to maintain a lock on the enemy if he is performing evasive manoeuvres. TLDR This change would make you require more skill to maintain a lock on an evasive target and also allow you to target faster moving or closer targets more easily and allow you to close the gap between yourself and your opponent faster. It is making the game more skill based and less cumbersome.,starcitizen,ci0p9lr,2,t5_2v94d
1165196,0,t3_27h0c7,I think this is working as intended. You basically lock your flight vector when you go to decoupled. Then you can modify the original vector by overlaying it with others strafing. As soon as you stop adding modifyvectors i.e. dont press any keys it resumes the locked original one again for as long as youre still in decoupled mode.,starcitizen,ci0pctt,1,t5_2v94d

1232398,0,t1_ci871pg,gt is capable of taking as input three orders of control. Hes talking about control input not the way your ship responds in game!Were kinda talking past each other and in a circular fashion and I dont think our views are fundamentally different on most of this but have different ways of expressing it that may seem odd.   As I understand it control input dictates how the ship is supposed to respond. The ships parameters dictate the limitations on how its able to comply. The ships parameters are essentially fixed while controls are completely dynamic.  Whether its resolving position information velocity information or acceleration information makes all the difference in what the ship actually does with the deltas its receiving. Whether its being told positional velocity or acceleration information makes a  difference on what it actually does.    You may be mistaken on your interpretation of firstorder vs zeroorder or Im not seeing how you get it once you attribute this to a byproduct of adapting to thruster impulses. Also you are incorrectly applying my use of the filtering etc. The filtering is on the inputscontrols side and are simply modifiers to how its resolving zerofirstsecond order. They are not applied to the ship the ship only has mass thrust thruster placement and other fixed parameters that determine its minmax performance parameters for everything at any time. All other changes and behaviors are products of the controlsIFCS and are inputprocessing related.    What we experience as the flight model changes very drastically by simply swapping controlorder even with the same baseline fixed ship parameters.    For instance they call pure secondorder control mode raw acceleration lunar laner mode cause any input sends your ship spinning or sliding until manually countered. This is in stark contrast to firstorder that will stop moving as soon as the control is home or to positional input where the ship only stops once its in position or the input times out.  These are mutually exclusive axis behaviors even when applied to the same exact ship with the same exact weightthrustetc.    Currently ctlf is a form of handicapped zeroorder control. The handicap is applied to the input not the ship. That is what I dont want users to be able to monkey with and be able to disable handicaps that are there for good reasons like these one specifically. Its already dangerously close to unfettered as is and making it work better will have a predictable outcome and were back to fps in space which is the underlying danger here because this invalidates velocityacceleration adapted controllers like joysticks.    The envelope I speak of is standard physics stuff. Each thruster has its own a minmax performance at any given state outlineing its envelope by defining its edges. The flight model as a whole has minmax values etc and when these are graphed out they form what are called envelopes or what are also referred to as buckets. Its just a graphical way of expressing the math that physical objects or simulated physical objects have by defining their limitations at any given state...    ,starcitizen,ci89fs0,1,t5_2v94d

Add a kind of respec cost so switching between solid and liquid wouldnt be free and letting players switch between them at will mightnt fit with their vision for the economy.  Realistically though to my understanding my realworld experience with freight is limited and distant there shouldnt be anything prohibitively distinct between shipping liquids or solids.  Like with modern day liquid tanks the shifting load of a liquid cargo is mitigated within the tank itself and likely some adjustment on the trailers suspension. So beyond that you have a freight container attached to the bottom of the ship with no special needs.,starcitizen,cidlkqd,2,t5_2v94d

1418375,0,t1_citn590,Heres why he used bDEADBEEFWriting numbers in hexadecimal base is convenient if you want to be able to see individual bytes in a number that a machine stores in binary.  For example if we have some number X which is written  in base it would be written in binary as  and in hexadecimal it is written as f.  You can see how the right four s map to a single zero in hexadecimal and the next four s map to an F.  Converting from binary to base is more likely take a pencil and paper or a little oneliner in Python or something but you can convert between binary and hexadecimal in your head really quickly.  A through F are used to represent  in hexadecimal so counting to  would go           a b c d e f .  So you can switch back and forth between binary and hexadecimal by looking at each little bit piece of a number but f is a lot more compact than .To call out that a number is being written in hexadecimal the convention is to prefix it with an x.  So you know that x would be sixteen written in hexadecimal.  Without the x if you just see  you would probably just assume its the number ten instead of sixteen.Anyway using the letters A through F you can spell out some words like xCAFEBABE or dumn dumn DUUUUUMN xDEADBEEF.  Because it kind of stands out sometimes people will initialize pieces of memory with the number  where Ive written the number xdeadbeef in base so that if they see DEAD BEEF DEAD BEEF DEAD BEEF in a series of bytes they know it is probably memory that hasnt been touched since you initialized it which might indicate a bug.  If they initialized it with zero there could be other reasons for something to happen to be x but if its xDEADBEEF its probably not a coincidence.Quoth Wikipediagt xDEADBEEF dead beef is frequently used to indicate a software crash or deadlock in embedded systems. DEADBEEF was originally used to mark newly allocated areas of memory that had not yet been initializedwhen scanning a memory dump it is easy to see the DEADBEEF. It is used by IBM RS systems Mac OS on bit PowerPC processors and the Commodore Amiga as a magic debug value. On Sun Microsystems Solaris it marks freed kernel memory. On OpenVMS running on Alpha processors DEADBEEF can be seen by pressing CTRLT. The DEC Alpha SRM console has a background process that traps memory errors identified by PS as BeefEater waiting on xdeadbeef.Java uses xCAFEBABE to call out the beginning of a .class file.Anyway James wasnt using xDEADBEEF as a number he named a debugging temp variable bDEADBEEF.  The b calls out that its a boolean which is a convention called systems Hungarian notation and my religious beliefs are that its a lame convention and you shouldnt do it but I will give CIG special dispensation because I like them.  So I think hes aware you can spell xDEADBEEF in hexadecimal and it amuses him so he uses that for a debugging variable.  I bet he also likes that it kind of sticks out so that when hes cleaning up code and removing debugging variables if he sees bDEADBEEF he knows he forgot to remove a debugging variable.,starcitizen,ciu2ldd,4,t5_2v94d

1493407,0,t3_2b952t,Here is my  cents a day late and a dollar short.  Those who were here for the rules debacle may remember me as the vocal opponent to the mods eventual crack under pressure.  For those who dont know about it I will give a quick summary.  The mods allowed people to vote for rules the voting broke down into approve disapprove and rework.  After releasing the results people lost their shit because one of the rules specifically about leakscheatsglitches had  yes  no and  rework and the mods declared that an approval.  After a short argument about the vote being rigged the devs admitted defeat and denied the rule.  I specifically was against this for a few reasons but generally I pointed out that the mods were setting themselves up for pain down the road because of their flip.I lost all respect for the mod team that day and still am not subscribed to this subreddit.  I check it frequently but can not resub because I feel this sub will go the way of many popular gaming subs when the game comes out and getting popular.  They dont have the temperament nor the tact to handle the community they have now with people who are hardcore fans imagine how they will handle the more casual gamer when the PU goes live? This incident reinforces my belief that the mod team is not suited for moderation on reddit.  Beyond proving my point that this issue should have been resolved months ago it also proves that these mods have no idea what they are doing.  Reddit moderation is a delicate thing by its nature reddit is a bit anarchistic and supports the free flow of information.  I have seen some moderators of larger subs talk about how a moderator on reddit is different from a moderator on a typical forum.  Where on a forum a mod is like a gestapo controlling and pruning bad content and posters with an iron fist a moderator on reddit is more like a good police officer who enforces the rules but generally allows the population to do what they want and regulate the content and posters.  The moderators are trying to run this like the forums I have heard that some believe that the mods want to keep good relations with CIG in order to get jobs working for them which isnt out of the question as Ben was a fan moderator of a Wing Commander fan site and is now one of the top guys at CIG.  The problem is they dont seem to understand reddit moderation as none of them have previous experience with moderating a subreddit as large as rstarcitizen.TLDR I will say once more what I said months ago the mods are not suited for this sub and will continue to make mistakes like this.  This is just the tip of the iceberg expect worse mistakes to come in the coming months and years.,starcitizen,cj3h1yy,1,t5_2v94d

1496964,0,t1_cj3w0ci,gt And it turns out that rstarcitizen isnt a democracy. You have no free speech here. You can post exactly what any of the mods dont care to remove because thats the reality of the situation like it or not. The mods could decide to censor anything CIG asked them to starting tomorrow and Id tell you to vote with your feet because thats all you have to vote with.You are right it isnt a democracy its a community.  Like most communities people want to feel welcomed in them.  People have varying opinions on a lot of matters but reddit has always been a community about open exchange of information and discussiongt And youre a complete douche for turning what could have been civil into a personal attack. So fuck off for that.... It means that your opinion holds exactly the same amount of weight as mine does. That you think mine has nothing to offer the discussion says something about you not me. Id look at finding what the something might be because I have a hunch its not a good thing to be carrying around.Coming right after you called anyone who was angry about this a socially inept manchild is almost a joke.  You really think insulting people is how you get a discussion going?  I mean seriously you insult people like myself who thought the whole situation was bumbled by the mods and then get defensive when I point out the fact you were acting like a turd?  What you expect me to do paint you a picture buy you some roses and take you out to dinner?  You are the douche and that is my opinion.Please tell me how your opinion of insulting the people is relevant  to a discussion about how the mods handled the whole thing is relevant and helpful.  You are doing nothing but continuing to insult people even in this response.  I feel like I need to post the definition of discussion for you because you seem to think it means I tell people they are retarded and they bow before me.gt I was unaware there were any qualification exams in order to moderate a forum intended to discuss what in the end is a fucking video game and one which is still of minuscule importance in the grander scheme of things.Ah the old Its a game who cares?  Let me educate you again because it seems like I will have to repeat myself a lot with you.  This is a community.  Now communities have these things called people these people have various opinions and needs.  Now being able to handle people in a proper way when something controversial happens is the job of a moderator.  Each community is different but reddit is not a community which has a tradition of light moderation meaning mass censorship is generally frowned upon by redditors users of reddit.Ok so now that you understand this has little to do with the game and more to do with the community we can continue.  The issue with communities is if they grow you need people who understand how to corral posters and help enforce rules to be a moderator.  From what I have seen from their post histories this is the largest community they have ever moderated.  Thus as time goes on and this sub grows with the popularity of the game we will start to have more conflicts and issues like this or worse.  If this is an indication of how well they handle issues well this and a handful of other issues which have happened in the past I dont see them handling the expansion of this community with any kind of skill because they dont know how. ,starcitizen,cj3x3om,1,t5_2v94d

1656210,0,t1_cjnw463,Yeah! After getting the SF I saw that banu and was tempted before its size upgrade even moreso now might upgrade in the PU if it suits the feeling more. Though really the Firefly only had a ship crew of  pilot mechanic and captain if it counts so it depends on how necessary the other crewmembers are for ship function the rest were medic soldier mercenary stowaway preacher and high class escort for their non ship piloting purposes.It really depends on the SF first having the cargo bay and how they design the rest of the interior and how they handle extra passengers because the dimensions alone are quite similar. I hope CIG definitely makes a variant or upgrade options that really allude to the firefly class cargosmuggling  passenger vessel. If the interior is extremely basic the Banu might really be the best for space cowboys either way there will be a good ship that can give that misfit group dynamic.,starcitizen,cjnxfre,1,t5_2v94d

1743176,0,t1_cjyu9yy,Ok I see what youre saying. I think Ive been over zealous about a specific point and I think we are fairly in accord.I do still think there will be significant customization. I dont think it will be to the extent of every ship looking different or modifying your hull to a great extent. For the Constellations they have mentioned changing out the cockpit front except the Aquila for example. But changing your guns heatsinks shields thrusters avionics as well as overclocking even if you dont do it yourself. I imagine people will spend more time and money on modifying their ship than they will acquiring it. If it only takes a week to get a conni it will probably be longer than that before the ship has exactly the equipment you want unless youve already got it for some reason.,starcitizen,cjyw10c,1,t5_2v94d

1758033,0,t1_ck0qp1h,IDK the way ED handles it is just as you say having multiple indicators and it works very well.  That game uses more sciencey lasers which hit the target instantly beam lasers from a distance look like flashlight beams flickering on and off its pretty cool which is really neither here nor there but I had to mention it and kinetic weapons with travel time depending on which one it is.  But the idea of having multiple lead or lag as you can choose either really works well even if you have both kinds of weapons equipped.  They use little dots which will snap to the target so even if one of your guns can hit it that will be reflected and if something is too close to be hit the dots will spread out until they are very far apart and again you can still maneuver so as to hit from one side only.  I could see it working equally simply in SC I wonder if CIG is just overcooking the issue.  They seem to be having this issue recently having to backpedal on the old IFC modes in . and what looks to be a revamp of the HUD now as well.  ,starcitizen,ck0r9k1,-3,t5_2v94d
1760464,0,t1_ck124z5,But it doesnt work like that  both have the same autoaim in game  the extra is made up by the player so the analogy totally works. Have you actually used ctrlf mode in flight? Right now its bugged to be a huge disadvantage  the mouse tracking is so slow that in order to turn around you have to pick your mouse up and put it down multiple times which doesnt give the smooth motion possibility that the HOTAS has  which wouldnt actually do anything but then give the HOTAS a huge advantage  which is what it seems most HOTAS users really want not an equal level but an advantage.,starcitizen,ck12are,1,t5_2v94d

1765212,0,t1_ck1nl3k,I see where youre coming from.  An example I have witnessed personally recently though is in a game of War Thunder.  My buddy wanted to get a slice of the action with my friend and I that normally play.  We have mid range tanks that we got through grinding normally.  He elected to drop  and just use the money currency to buy his way up to our tier.  He basically saved himself about a week or so of constant playing to get where he is now.   And he cant kill anything for shit.  He has the equipment but he doesnt have the skill.  And I mean not even the basics down.     You have to realize that the funding CIG has received would not be even remotely as good as it is now if they didnt have pledges tied to ships.   Will new players starting off with an Aurora be at a disadvantage against someone starting off with a Constellation? To an extent yes.  But those differences can be made less severe when you add the cost of keeping the bigger ships flying or if those new players team up and fly together.      In the end within a months time new players will be playing against other newish players who have purchased ships through playing the game and so on and so forth.

If you want to buy a ship buy something which is able to see most of the other game parts as well. Such as a  Exploration an Avenger or something like that. Otherwise you are stuck with a racing ship which is not able to jump out of a system which cannot carry any cargo and is not able to fight properly.And I bet the racing will not only be with the racing type ships. They have to introduce race classes. Like in real motorsport the Fiat  cup or so. I bet you will be able to race with every single seater ship just fine except for the highest Formula  racing class.

1816322,0,t1_ck7wn24,I think that as of now. We dont need that. But once we get to this point where we could enjoy even more ships and variants to the point where we wouldnt be only flying  ships. The idea that they pick and choose the ships that are free to use for a while is perfect. As it gives them more data to look at based on different ships to skill level.They could even randomize who gets what free ship for the time being to add to the leader boards stats that uremosito had mentioned and see how a player stats will change per ship based on their skill level.Personally I think its a great idea. And I think for now. They should make a system. Where all of the ships are super cheap. But you can only use them for arena commander. And will not be able to use them for the persistent universe. Or when the persistent universe launches the ships are then melted based on what you payed to use them for arena commander.

Ram is dirt cheap and  things will kill a solid state drive in a matter of months. Defragging and virtual memory.

1880463,0,t1_ckfrlxx,Its a really hard thing to explain without having tried an OR yourself but first person shooters as we know and play them today simply dont work in VR.Dadley does a good job of summarizing why. The disconnect between moving your view for aimingwalking and what your body is physically doing really messes with your head. There are a lot of attempts around this Valve for example has  different modes for VR but none of them really solve the issue only alleviate it.On the flipside this is why driving and flight simulations translate so well into VR. You are sitting stationary both in real life and in the game. All your head movement is relative to the chair.After having played various games with an OR Im really not sure how to solve the problem while still only using a mouse and keyboard as input. VR is such a game changer and new frontier that so many of the little things we take for granted like climbing animation become huge and unexpected problems.,starcitizen,ckfsenz,4,t5_2v94d

1890428,0,t1_ckgzito,gt I suppose they could prioritize thrust in the direction the nose is pointing but that would meat at top speed you couldnt strafe at all.One possible solution would be to set it up so that the true top speed can only be achieved while strafing at top forward velocity. Doing that would make room for strafing as a viable maneuver and IMHO would also make combat much more skillfocused transforming it into a fastpaced dance of death rather than the turret jousting we had in .,starcitizen,ckgzle2,1,t5_2v94d

1890749,0,t3_2g8va2,OK so i just opened the game to make sure i wasnt crazy because am sure before i saw this tread i was strafing while moving forward.  the thing is if you are moving forward and you try to strafe to the left like in the first  seconds of ops videonotice how the smaller blue circle is moving to the left showing u that you are strafing your are gonna kill your forward momentum because op is strafing for so long that the ifcs thinks that he wants to use  of the speed that the ship can generate to just strafe. now lets say if op is moving forward at  speed and he wants to strafe while moving all he would have to do is  strafe to the leftright while keeping the blue circle the one that shows you when you are strafing in the middle of his hud so lets assume that the blue circle in the middle of the hud left or right transfer to  of the ship top speed in this case what the ifcs is gonna do is share the ship top speed between strafing and moving forward so basically it is gonna move forward at  of the ships top speed while strafing at  of the ship top speed.tldrop is coming to a complete stop because he is  strafing way too fast for too longthat the ifcs thinks all he wants to do is move to the side. the ifcs shares speed. so if u wanna strafe while moving forward just move your Q key or E slightly and the ifcs is gonna barrow speed form your main thruster to put it in one of the side thruster you want to use to strafe.,starcitizen,ckh0zae,8,t5_2v94d

1903410,0,t3_2gd0c4,I have so many questions about this game and some people have asked questions so here I go with a few. I have searched around a little bit here and there but Ive mostly been cautious about this game considering the general feeling about it from other communities seems to be that this is scammy or destined to fail. A lot of the searching around and videos and such looks to just be people saying Look! I bought this shiny ship for  bucks Look at how nice it is to look at! which is rather discouraging to see.On the outside it looks very much crazy You spent how much on that? and discouraging So to get in this game with cool ships I have to be irl rich?. And considering videos on SC seem to be largely Look how much money I spent on these things rather than anything informative about some of the nitty gritty important stuff I figure asking here would be best to get it from people who know the current state and direction of the game best.I am aware that its Prealpha very early stages. And the prices of the ships are basically nice ways to fund the game. Its just a little discouraging when most of the top results for me seem to be I SPENT FUCK TONS OF MONEY ON THIS and This is the most moneyefficient way to get everything and money money money!So now you understand my mindset about the game. Here are the actual questions.  Is it the devs that will run the servers for this game? If so how are they going to keep the lights on? A subscription model? FP? This is perhaps the most worrying and important thing for me. If the devs arent running servers how will the Persistent Universe work? Is everyone interacting with everyone else like in EvE online? While Im aware that you cant have thousands of players in the same area hell not even EvE can handle it that well... But is it possible to interact with everyone playing SC? Will you be able to make money racing? As in all the participants put money into a pot. st place gets most of pot and profits a fair amount nd gets a fair chunk and profits a little rd basically gets their money back with everyone else losing out? Or some other method of earning money racing. You guys are currently on Version .. So a . release is due next I would imagine. This cant be the full game can it? what kind of versioning system are the devs using do you know? Is there a road map version to version for these kinds of things?

1909012,0,t3_2gh4ev,This is definitely one of the best videos demonstrating what the racing in Star Citizen should mostly be like right now minus the straightline shaveoffcorners racing which I cover in a bit. Most of the racers had Ms and Rs and it actually was fun to watch.The main problem with racing right now is since all ships are pooled into the same race it can be quite boring to play and watch even. Hopefully CIG is actually going to have the option soon to race only against others with the same ship as yours.EDIT Also they should really make the track punish those who take nearly straight shortcuts seen from almost all of the races now. I did read someone suggest something like EMP slowdowns if you were to break off from the track in some way. Either way being able to enclose the racers in some sort of invisible circular tube that guides the players around the track is what it should really be like. Makes it more exciting and fun piloting instead of just shaving off nearby objects to obtain a maximum straight distance towards the next checkpoint.,starcitizen,ckj82bs,7,t5_2v94d

Also I was thinking with the heat bugs maybe you could buy specialised heatsinks that can be ejected when the bugs have absorbed their maximum amount of heat. And maybe the bugs could detonate or damage the ship in some way if theyre not dealt with. So if you dont have the special heatsinks you just have to keep below their heat threshold but if you do you just have to keep an eye on them and jettison them when nessacary.

2014051,0,t3_2htl9h,The core ship packages should stay the same price but the limited sale ships will likely increase over time.The main thing you are missing by not backing earlier are all of the funding milestone bonuses that are given out every million dollars raised. Everything given out or purchased can be earned in game but it will give you something extra to play with during alphabeta and a bit of a head start in the PU.You might want to consider purchasing a basic Aurora package now and then upgrading in the future when you can afford more. You can do this by melting a package for credit and then purchasing a different package with that credit or by purchasing an upgrade token.For single seater ships the Avenger is arguably the best all around ship to start is not much more than the i and has a better starting package hangar upgrade and more starting UEC.,starcitizen,ckvw1mc,3,t5_2v94d
2014128,0,t1_ckvvsxp,The Aurora package gets you the basic ship the full Single player campaigns and access to the persistent universe you can earn rewards in the single player campaign for your start in the PUthe MMO part of the game.Basically its a really good deal. You get two really awesome games for less than the retail price and youll get backer rewards along the way. If youre not a fan of the Aurora there will be another starter ship being released soon called the Mustang which is a bit more agile and has a very different aesthetic. If you buy the Aurora youll be able to switch to the Mustang if you like it better when it comes out. Ultimately the choice is up to you. But pledging now is a good deal and it means that even if you dont do any of the alpha stuff youll get a cool new game to play down the line and some of the single player missions may come out early next year.This is the most basic package that still gets you full game and beta accessThis package gives you the arena commander alpha module in addition to the above. This is mostly convenience as you can buy a pass for  which is the difference in cost between the two packagesIf you dont care about beta at all but want the game stuff this package is  less than the one that does include it. Honestly though Id go for the beta access since beta should be pretty funLast of all if you buy the Aurora package now and have some extra money down the road and think damn I wish I had this bigger shinier ship you can do that with things called Cross Chassis Upgrades. They allow you to upgrade from one ship to another while retaining your package stuff. ,starcitizen,ckvwdns,3,t5_2v94d

2021671,0,t3_2hwvjk,I wanted to take a stab on a few of the questions as well. Im going to skip ones that have already been comprehensively addressed unless I want to add something.  It could be a fun mechanic to follow your hirelings route to see fi you can find out what happened to him. Not sure if itd generate wreckage for you if you arrive at where he was destroyed stuff tends to disappear after  minutes or so in the PU.  I imagine you mean that your friends capture the ship  it would make absolutely no sense to send a fully crewed ship out under your expense book to have them destroyed because insurance never pays out the same as what you lost... Also the affiliate mechanic of the backend is probably going to play a role in whether insurance declares your claim fraudulent. If you are affiliated with TEST squadron and then you show up claiming insurance on a ship you lost to TEST squadron then Im pretty sure theyd laugh you out of the insurance office or they should.  the last I heard on NPCs is that each will be unique and will go about their own lives with their own careers and aspirations as well. hiring them will likely be an investment in developing your character your ship and a longterm deal. But surely there will be plenty of outofwork pilots or gunners looking for some UEC to blow at the bar so various people will be about but I wouldnt call them ad hoc generated or anything.  If your ship gets jumped in deep space and you have friends online they can load over to your ship and embody an NPC for the fight to help with gunning or defending your ship this was in a ftC a long time ago I think. Additionally you can gift your account characters not hired NPCs to other players that will allow them to play the game. You have to buy a game package to get any of these character slots one per package. I do not know if they can return the character to you after they are done playing though. ,starcitizen,ckwt3gg,2,t5_2v94d

2144665,0,t3_2jk03w,Nice find Beer!Heres a transcript if anyone cant access the siteHey guys! Answers to the last set of questions are attached.. Given that the Pirate Pack has a tractor beam and docking collar as additional equipment and the Cutlass now includes both of those as standard equipment will anything change with the Pirate Pack? The extra equipment was used to justify only including  UEC when other packages including the new Cutlass packs include  UEC.We have no plans to change the Pirate Pack. Backers who pledged for the original package have a unique skin LTI Alpha Access and two years of stretch goal rewards for less money than the current Cutlass Black pack. Ive looked through the old messaging and nothing Ive seen suggests the tractor beam or docking collar wouldnt be available elsewhere I mention this because there ARE times when weve said such things forgotten in the ensuing months and needed a reminder to change our current plans to keep our promises but as best I can tell this is not one of those times. That said if youre truly unhappy with your older Pirate Pack Cutlass and would like to switch to a Cutlass Black package with the current rewards  UEC no skin etc. then I will authorize Customer Service to make these changes without charging the additional  it would cost to purchase the new version.. Backers are confused about the modularity of the Blue and Red. Will they be able to remove the medical seats and the holding cells when the PU launches?As with the Phoenixs interior this is a feature we want to include its a feature we intend to include but its not a feature we are currently willing to promise at the launch of the Persistent Universe. The intention is to begin by offering limited customization onboard ships smaller decorative flare select internal seat action points and ultimately expand to fully customizable interiors.Slight update to this the BEDS and the CELLS can be removed from the Red and Blue respectively at launch under the current schedule they cant yet be repositioned to other ships or moved around internally. The benefit there is to trade them for cargo space rather than other seat actions.. What qualities of the Cutlass Blue and Cutlass Red are tied to the unique hull and cannot otherwise be obtained? We know about the improved maximum shield and the ability to fake being a cop for the Blue. Are there other aspects such as additional armor that can never be obtained by someone who does not have that particular hull variant? Does the Cutlass Black have any unique attributes?The Red and the Blue have increased armor we dont provide statistics for this yet but you can see it reflected somewhat in the mass compared to the base ship! The Cutlass Black has a larger maximum cargo capacity than either of the other ships.. Many backers are surprised by CIGs decision to move away from a common hull and provide a series of unique hulls with distinct configurations particularly in terms of hardpoints and capacities. Given that the Cutlass was originally described as a modular easily customized system the Honda of Star Citizen why did CIG decide to use this approach instead?I wouldnt say this is anything new weve been building unique hulls for ships since the series. Our feeling is that it gives you more variation than less. Three unique hulls means you have three choices to start from rather than one. A Cutlass Black is just as roleconfigurable as an Aurora ES you just have two additional starting points if so desired. Plus lets be totally honest here seeing distinctly different spacecraft flying around the universe is neat and more unique base hulls is a costeffective way of making that happen.. In your response you mentioned that the Cutlass Blue would have a better jump engine. What traits will exist in a jump engine and in what way will the Blues be better? Is that unique to the hull or could a Red or a Black upgrade their jump engines to match the performance of the Blue?Like any component a Jump Drive has a number of statistics associated with it. Including Recharge time number of minutes between jumps. Fuel Efficiency number of jumps without refueling. Signature easily detectable flash or silenced approach. Damage where hull damage translates to hits on internal components. Quality  of chance youll have a flameoutfailed jumpetc.The jump drives are not unique to the hulls though and can be moved from one ship to another. And as with any of our components its probably wrong of me to say that one is better than the other the Cutlass Blacks drive has less of an ecm signature but is also less fuel efficient for instance. So were measuring value in this case as the pure inuniverse retail in UEC.. You said earlier that Ships are priced based on their base statistics and the value of their included addon components the Cutlass series are no different in this respect. Later on in the same post when asked about why the Blue was more expensive you said Well one is the nicer jump drive! But yes this likely does reflect some factors not included in the stats including armor inuniverse production rarity overall maneuverability etc. This is confusing and suggests that the pricing is more than just the statistics and components. Can you break down what about the Blue upgrade makes it worth  and compare it to equivalently priced upgrades like the Super Hornet and Freelancer MIS? It seems like the other two ships are getting a lot more for their money.For context on this question I did a poll of forum respondents asking them if they though the Cutlass Blue was worth the  upgrade price. Of the  votes . said No . said Yes and  had no opinion or answer. Thats a statistically significant albeit nonrandom sample of the  backers with a margin of error of . given  confidence. I know many people are on the fence about the Blue and a bit more explanation would almost certainly encourage more pledges.I dont feel great about this one because it sounds like what youre asking me to do is sell you on the Cutlass Blue and while wed love your support forcing ship sales on our backers isnt the goal. If it seems like a ship design isnt for you you shouldnt feel like you need to pledge for it. I just want to get that out of the way before I talk about the ship itself. If youre dreaming of a different Cutlass variant like a super pirate version and youre looking for me to suggest this is secretly that you will likely be disappointed.Anyway! I dont know about the general confusion the things I listed in the previous response are all stats. But I can detail it out if desired. The Cutlass Blue is more expensive because It has the highest base armor stat of the Cutlass variants. It includes the following more valuable components RAMP RAMPower AMC Power Plant Hammer Propulsion HE . Thrusters Kruger K Parma Shield Nova ASIMc Spider II missile launchers Holding Cells It has a higher Max Shield potential  instead of  It will be produced in more limited numbers than the other two hulls in the finished universes economy that is to say for every ten Cutlasses produced severan will be Blacks two will be Reds and one will be a Blue thats preliminary but you see the general idea. It is designed to start the game with a specific role in mind police officerqshipNote that the fact that its a limited production model doesnt so much impact the sale price as it does the limited availability in the store.,starcitizen,clcfoja,18,t5_2v94d

2162391,0,t3_2jrwj2,Cutlass.Hornet is right out because you want a multi crew ship.  Only way to get that is to get a super hornet.  That will be way better at fighting than the lancer or the cutlass but you will be doing zero hauling.  Also the stock hornet doesnt come with a jump drive.Freelancer is a decent option and I can see why people would want one.  Its got some big ass guns and a very iconic redneck feel to it.   Theres no real negatives to list here and I feel that going from cutlass to lancer comes down to personal choice.  Lancer is more defensive and cutlass is more offensive.Heres why I would pick the cutlass over the freelancer... It can haul almost as much cargo.  It comes stock with a tractor beam and docking collar which opens up other gameplay options that the lancer doesnt have.  It comes with the asteroid hanger which is the most awesome of hangers.  The cutlass has more guns than the freelancer while the lancer has bigger guns.  While the lancers guns have great coverage to shoot at almost any angle around the lancer its difficult to bring all that firepower to bear at once in one spot.  This makes it good at defending and deterring attackers.  The cutlass has better forward fire power and the manuverability to get into position to use it.  The cutlass also has  crew stations so you get more multiplayer out of your one ship than the base lancers .When it comes down to it the cutlass can haul almost as well as the freelancer and is a more offensive minded ship.,starcitizen,cleotv1,2,t5_2v94d

So theyre begging for them to make a port? Why? Itll look shitty anyways. gt Many Star Citizen Investors Are Console UsersWell if thats the case theyre morons. IIRC it was explicitly stated that its going to be a PC game and a PC game only. Thats like ordering a Hamburger at a restaurant then complaining because youre actually a vegan. gtIf anything Star Citizen on the new gen consoles can be very well way of testing what the consoles are actually capable of handling.No need. Look at the current titles for next genconsoles and compare them to current PC titles. StarCitizen for consoles  and I like how they even dropped the next genBS and just refer to it as new gen because theres not really anything next about it  is a great way of showing how far consoles actually lag behind in terms of hardware. gtwe have the Kinect on the Xbox One that is more than capable of making a game like Star Citizen all the more immersive.Yeah right hop around in your living room like an idiot trying to steer a space ship thats not actually there?gt Consoles Need A Space Exploration Game TooAnd I need a blowjob but we cant always get what we want.

But the more I see the sales and marketing tactics in use as opposed to not being sure or assuming coincidence the more I realize CIG treats us like were buying ships at every opportunity publishing everchanging stats releasing commercials brochures hyping the sales up to a great degree with a faux scarcity model only  of these sets of pixels are available and then well maybe well sell more who knows?

2191260,0,t1_cli4p13,Yeah but iirc some ingame radar will be able to show the handle. And the handle is the same for every character on an account so how will it work ?,starcitizen,clid2ce,1,t5_2v94d
2191648,0,t3_2k36nh,So Ive decided to tackle all these arguments ..and I understand if my tone is undesirable and I get downvoted. This is just my honest view as I see it unfiltered and without any sugar coating. Apologies to those it offended.gtReason  Console market is huge. The new gen consoles have a huge fan base as of now and that has to work in favour of a game that is on to tackle such an immense audience.So? There is a reason this was crowdfunded so well on the basis of a PC game which everyone know..We already have the audience needed. Dont technically need more..you want to join in? Get a PC.gtReason  Cross platforming. While Chris voices his fears over having to make separate communities if theres a console launch it need not be that way. Star Citizen wont be like other shooters out in the market where having a keyboard and mouse gives you an automatic advantage over other means of input.Cross platforming is very much possible and it would not affect the games experience across different platforms.We all know that CrossPlatforming DOES affect games it shows and it can be felt EVERY SINGLE DAMN TIME so balls to this argument.gtReason  Supportive Console Devs. Apparently Sony has taken the first step forward by giving Chris team a PS dev kit to fiddle with. This shows an obvious interest of the company in the game.Although MS hasnt followed suit theres still time enough for them to work up some strategy to try and have the game on their console too.So? This is not an argument for doing it. Try again you silly goober.gtReason  Skittish Console Fans. The sheer scale of Chris project has been snowballing followers from all across the world and many of them are console users.The way the games concept and progress has been shown has made the best of console fans wish fervently that the game come on the new gen consoles if not anything. What Star Citizen will get if it happens is a solid and faithful fanbase.Yeah well a lot of people wish to be rich and famous not everyone deserves it though. You want to join in? Get a PC just sitting on your couch looking hopeful in a large group wont do it. So Balls to you!gtReason  Largest Crowdfunding. tar Citizen is easily the largest ever crowd funded project and the amount of money that the project has accumulated has not only enabled them to make it to their stretch goals but go way beyond that so much so that the developers were not sure what they would do with all that money.With that much money at their disposal Star Citizen is perfectly able to be on the new gen consoles without even bottlenecking the PC version of the game if it ever would be the case.Able? Maybe but then you might as well say they are able with all that money to make a Wiiu port..doesnt make it a good idea much less is it a reason. This is the You have lots of money give some to me argument..balls again!gtReason  Consoles Have Better SpectoPerformance Factor. Star Citizen is essentially a PC game. That would obviously include even the relatively average PCs that fall in the midrange category and the currentgen consoles offer better performance over a PC of the same configuration.First of all Star Citizen isnt essentially a PC game it IS a PC game through and through period. There are no grey areas. Secondly consoles offer better performance over a PC of the same configuration Aaaahahahahahahahahah! Okay lets say thats true..what happens a year from now when that PC gets bogged down from being too old? Its upgraded!..What does the console do? OH RIGHT! gtReason  Many Star Citizen Investors Are Console Users. A lot of people who through Kickstarter had made Star Citizen the largest crowdfunded project were actually console users.With such overwhelming support it would not be very fair to let out the console users on the game.If you as an exclusive console user pledged money to Star Citizen on the puppyeyed assumption that there would be a console port despite all warnings and notices EVERYWHERE that this is a PC game exclusive..Youre an idiot! thanks for pledging though..so tough luck buddyboy.gtReason  Testing The Potential. If anything Star Citizen on the new gen consoles can be very well way of testing what the consoles are actually capable of handling.This may even prompt the console developers to make their consoles not so static as they are today for consistently long periods of time.Hahahahah! ..No ...You want to test what peak performance values of a console is? Get a stress test performed by the people who made itdesigned it. This is NOT our problem so bugger off.gtReason  Utilizing Kinect. Some may argue that the key bindings for Star Citizen may not be provided for by the console gamepads but then again we have the Kinect on the Xbox One that is more than capable of making a game like Star Citizen all the more immersive.Ignoring for a moment all the many other factors that would make consoles nonviable options this idea might be interesting but its just a technological gimmick..so its rather unimpressive I must say.gtReason  Utilizing the PS Camera. The PSs camera hasnt been as extensively used as has been the case with Xboxs Kinect. That is not to say that the PS camera is any less capable.Star Citizens console launch may very well provide the platform for Sony to take PS cameras games involvement more seriously.First of all stop speaking in terms of Star Citizens console launch as though its already been decided to happen and then carry on to speak in terms of PSs cameras games as though Star Citizen was now a PS camera game..Fuck off you guys have had it too good for too long given this kind of presumptuous nonsense.Secondly no..Theyre called webcams and there is no reason to use them. Thats what we have skype for. Not impressive.gtReason  Consoles Need A Space Exploration Game Too. There havent been many space exploration games in quite a while. While we were widening our eyes over what a nice presentation Mass Effect offered of our galaxy it comes nowhere near what Star Citizen presents to us.It would be a particularly sour lemon to bite into for console users if they dont get Star Citizen on the consoles.So make one...How is this our problem? What the hell do you mean It would be a particular sour lemon to bite into ?? You get sour about what you dont have because someone else is getting it? That is a special kind of selfimportance Why am I not getting the toy truck that HE is??? D ...fuck off. We paid for this shit and you have no right to behave like this.gtReason  Project Morpheus. Star Citizen would be incorporating virtual reality compatibility. That means Oculus Rift is gonna steal the show.But bear in mind that Sonys Project Morpheus is no less a contender for the same and presents an almost equally brilliant opportunity for Star Citizen to let the players experience the best of the game in a VR setup.So? Good luck to Sony I say..You already mentioned that we have the Oculus..so ..dont need more. You silly person who wrote this. Moving on.gtReason  More People More Fun. Since Star Citizen will feature a persistent universe having players in such a huge world could be a problem. Having the game on the consoles would mean that a much larger number of players would be in any particular area than otherwise hence bolstering interactions and the games community and experience overall.So buy a PC...gtReason  The DualShock . The PS controller has a motion sensor that can substitute for a lot of key mashing in a game like Star Citizen especially being helpful in vehicular navigation.Key mashing ? Really? This shows you why this shouldnt get ported to consoles..talking in terms of key mashing is a console exercise..Star Citizen isnt the spaceship version of Super Smash Bros  there isnt a lot of sitting on the couch laughing gaily as you trash about in a drunken stupor with your collective friends to knock the other guys ship into the planets atmosphere and go OHHHHH!! Okay my turn I think Ill pick a bengal carrier this time! ....key mashing my arse. Please go away.Secondly whats this? Oh its my Xbox One controller connected to my PC so why do I need your controller? Oh right I dont.gtReason  The Consoles Are Capable The new gen consoles have tremendous capability as of now. But with the trending technology becoming obsolete in as much time as it takes you to take a leak trip to the bathroom it is hard to say if the game would indeed make it to the platforms. If the game were to be released within a few months from now the chances of the consoles handling the game would have been much better as would have been of most above average PC owners. The fact that the game is to be released not until at least a year makes the prospects of a console launch bleak if not entirely extinguished.There are a lot of hiccups in the way of the game going to any other platform than the PC and thats justified in the fact that Roberts is trying to build a game that will set a new touchstone in many ways for the games of the generation and many people are mad about it. But when youre building something as top notch as what Roberts has had us believe being unapologetic for some things doesnt qualify you to deserve any flak but reverence if anything.Okay..so even the guy who write this basically says Well if the game was released now we could totally do console..but seeing as it isnt it probably wont work ...Then why the hell did you write all this? You knew it was futile too. Geez man..who pays these people???,starcitizen,clieu7u,4,t5_2v94d

2221453,0,t1_clm1k5p,I dont really see the  fitting in this topic but I personally was less satisfied with the Constellation and Cutlass variant sales limited offerings than the others.  Im not overly clear why it bothered me more than the Freelancer as it had two standalone variants as well as the Cutlass.  I suspect it was because deep deep down I am a dirty minmaxer and I didnt see as clear an advantage in the Phoenix as the MIS then I saw even less of an advantage or worth for  of the Blue.  That is a stupid reason though as aside from some level of minmax hiding inside my wallet I do desire the most modular ship policy possible.  I believe the reason Cutlass  Constellation sales bugged me was with the R it was only clearly going to be fastest and worth the upgrade to me I knew it wouldnt out tank a  but traded speed for some strength.  With the MIS I knew it wasnt going to haul or explore like a DUR  base  MAX but the stock layout was badass and worth the upgrade.  Now with the Phoenix I hated the interior and the nearcomplete loss of cargo a big part of that ship traded for a shiny hot tub and table I saw it had the best engine and a class .. this was ambiguous to this day I debate asking CS to unapply my upgrade to the Rear Admiral pack I purchased Oct th .  Then the Cutlass  more cost for  potential on the shield?  I got one just because I am an idiot and figured Id take all but one or two cells out to use it as a bounty ship... Still the standalone  limited hulls of Constellation  Cutlass just seem less worth it to me while the price keeps increasing comparatively.  I dont mind tradeoffs losing cargo for defense or offense etc...  BUT if I am going to be making those tradeoffs then I should be able to choose to make those tradeoffs and mods in the PU.  If you are going to sell something at  more cost make it  more better whether I am buying a car or a coffee machine.  I understand if they clearly did this it would be utter minmax SO what made me less unhappy about the r or MIS is that they seemed  or whatever amount more they cost worth it.  Upgrades verse tradeoffs but for SPECIFIC roles.  I suspect that is my dissatisfaction with the Phoenix that I dont like its role of bling and hopefully VIP missions.  I didnt think the Blue really upgraded or outfitted to differentiate itself to a role.I dont see how WAY too many cells in the Blue and a shield will help me specifically as a bounty hunter and certainly not  more.  I do see how that huge missile rack in the MIS will help me X amount more as a gunboat and traded the base and MAX cargo for it.,starcitizen,clm77j6,1,t5_2v94d

2259090,0,t3_2l2anl,The problem with the Redeemer was that its design didnt make sense. The engines were the most glaring part of this problem and the one that everyones eyes were first drawn to. The mind tries to come up with a logical explanation for their shape and fails which makes the whole thing look weird.However the orange glow actually does a great job of fixing this precisely because the orange glow makes no sense. Its some weird bit of space magic but your mind instantly knows its space magic its just there to look shiny with no real explanation because it diverges so much from the other designs in Star Citizen. It fixes the problem of the Redeemers uncanny valley engineering the almost seems realistic but isnt and fully embraces how bizarre the engine shape is. The mind no longer tries to perceive the engines as realistic because it knows its not supposed to.CIG actually did a pretty good job of fixing those engines with that effect oddly by making them less realistic which made them more believable.

Currently you can pay some money to get other ships youd have to earn in game as a way to crowd fund but that goes away on release.gt. Any system requirementsthey can be official but I want it from expirence of other players.Game will most likely be a lot more intensive on release.  Right now a good i gb ram and a graphics card thats still considered upper midrange will play it well.gt.How much money do I need to invest to be on par?.  Well youll have to buy the game.  But from there everything can be farmed.gt.In what state is the game?Think of it like a bunch of demos currently. For at least another  months they will keep releasing alpha modules which play like little demos of certain mechanics.  Currently you can load up a menu and check out your ships in a hangar or do a race or an arena style dogfight or free fly.  theyre adding an fps match mode next.  once all these are done theyll put it all together into a mmo like persistent universe where you can go anywhere and do anything.gt.Any other things I should be aware of?  The game itself wont be out for a while yet.  If you back them now though even a small amount youll get minor ingame stuff like a decoration or a little cash or whatnot when we hit certain milestones.   also the preorder option is now  but theyre speculating it will be closer to  on release.,starcitizen,clsc60p,1,t5_2v94d

2272519,0,t1_clshcvx,Im hoping that there will be a way to add additional seating via the cargo floor. Like rows of seats on a cargo pallet. This would mean that it would be easy to add seats to any ship that had available cargo space such as the Cutlass Black Avenger Constellation Freelancers and probably the Retaliator which in lore has a way to add passenger seating. It would be a good way to create makeshift transports and allows for some nonconventional boarding craft. These craft wouldnt have sleeping accommodations to match their seating so they would be most useful for short range hops and would not be redundant in comparison with the Redeemer.On a related note I just realized that there is not much of a choice for the next stretch goal we can either vote for a combat transport or a civilian transport.

2274718,0,t1_clsuqos,gt as I understood a number of vocal groups were unhappy since it was originally a limited time sale ship.gt gt So CIG reversed course and kept it as a limited time sale ship.I mean as much as people complain about this CIG did the right thing by upholding their promise Even if selling them as limited time ships was a poor decision in the first place.The biggest reason people are upset about it now is because they cant fly the M for themselves. There is just literally no way to get one right now unless you go to the grey market. It wouldnt be such a big deal if the M wasnt one of the dominant dogfighters or one of the only two racing ships available right now Especially since the other racing ship is also a limited time offer and currently unavailable. It alienates anyone who wants to be competitive in either mode because there is no way for them to fly a competitive ship.The issue would disappear if there were some sort of progression or unlock system in Arena Commander that would let players work towards unlocking other ships. Even if that progress were reset with each patch for players who dont actually own the ship I mean it would still allow the rest of us to fly the M and that would be enough to hold most of us over until the ship comes back up for sale again. It also gives us something to work towards which encourages people to sink more time into the game which results in more test data for CIG to work with.Barring an unlock system Which obviously takes some time to develop and test while they have other priorities they could simply unlock all of the flyable ships for everyone until the progression system is in place. They did it for a week recently and nobody seemed to have any problem with it. In fact all I saw were people having a great time in Arena Commander because they could finally experience what the Hornet and M owners were already enjoying.,starcitizen,clsvhb0,6,t5_2v94d

2380167,0,t3_2mna99,I think that most impacts are accidental frankly. I still see a lot of people complaining about collisions though and Im going to state something that may not be popular. If you get in a headon collision its as much your fault as the other drivers.If someone rams you from the side or the rear you cant see them coming and youre not at fault. But if you head straight at an enemy or turn around to keep repetitively jousting at close range then youre deliberately engaging in risky flying that can lead to a collision.  It may be accidental on both your parts or you may have been playing chicken and expecting him to veer off at the last second but all you had to do was turn or strafe a little to eliminate the risk of impact.I see a lot of pilots too intent on making every shot count to avoid a fatal impact who then go on to complain about the death when they easily could have avoided the crash themselves.

2391999,0,t3_2mk7b2,Jason Zedwimer is the son of decorated UEE Captain Ajax Zedwimer commander of the Bengalclass carrier Pendragon and grandson of the notorious pirate Xavier Zedwimer. When Xavier died ten years ago his other son Jasons uncle Zander took over the family business inheriting his IdrisP and its crew and has plagued the lesspatrolled corners of UEE space ever since. While Zander took a liking to Xaviers freebooting lifestyle early on Ajax turned away from it when his mother was killed in a revenge hit for one of Xaviers scores against a wealthy merchant who didnt take kindly to losing his cargo.Xavier and Zander were at first amused when Ajax joined the UEE Navy. But when Ajax was promoted to captain took command of the Pendragon and made it his sworn goal to hunt down his father and brother and bring them to justice the gauntlet was thrown down. The Zedwimer pirates evaded the Pendragon for twelve years. Then one day a decade ago Ajax finally caught Xavier with a honeypot a bait ship. Though heavily damaged the pirates escaped but not before Xavier was killed. Zander took over as captain and vowed vengeance against his brother. Its been ten years... Zander hasnt forgotten his vow but sometimes plans like these take time and require the proper opportunities to appear.And so Jason is caught between the legacy of his father and the infamy of his uncle and grandfather. Hes signed up for a tour of duty with Squadron  once he graduates university but when he musters out he plans on turning to a life of exploration and free trading. To his surprise he inherited a number of ships from his grandfather including a p a Freelancer DUR a Connie Taurus and a Herald and he is still amazed that none of them have been reclaimed as stolen property the UEE checked their provenances out thoroughly. In addition he fears that someday Zander may show up to take them back since when was a pirate satisfied with one ship even if its the biggest one in the lot?.Jasons not thrilled with his upcoming stint in S but he made a promise to his father... and one thing Zedwimers do  on both sides of the law  is keep their word.FWIW Im an Imperator subscriber once my subscription hits month  my goal is to submit Zander Zedwimer as one of the pirates who call Spider home.,starcitizen,cm7cwte,1,t5_2v94d

So if you can manage your crew well enough you should do OK.  For example I can see sticking a couple of NPC gunners into the turrets on your Connie medium size freighter being reasonably effective.  All they really have to do is point and shoot.  A third could be sent to fly the snub fighter and given simple instructions like Watch my back or Attack my target.  The greater difficulty is in handling elements like power management sensors and other tasks that can all theoretically be handled by the pilot alone but would be better handed off to a fellow player at another crew station.  For example a crew of three human players in a Constellation could divide themselves up as a pilot a sensor operator who would work exclusively on identifying and tracking targets and an engineer who would manage the ships power and subsystems to squeeze out the most combat performance.  Think of this as micromanagement just like in an RTS.  One player can do it but they have to think and act very fast to stay on top of everything.  Divide the tasks up between a few players and it gets much easier.,starcitizen,cm7kk4k,1,t5_2v94d
2395447,0,t3_2muhfu,Decide how much you want to pledge.  Check out ships in that range.If you dont find anything in that range but you are still really interested in pledging then get a basic Aurora package.  You can melt it later on down the road and use the credit to upgrade if you want to.If you cant make up your mind at all then look into simply pledging  towards anything.

2402962,0,t1_cm8i1qi,Vs jousters yes I can agree that I have seen the maneuver be effective but against turrets I dont see how. For me its become simple math the more time I spend shooting and the more time they spend trying to maneuver or turn or whatever just leads to them taking more and more damage while I sit still. And people keep mentioning the targeting computer being the main thing in order to line up shots but I dont use it hardly ever. Instead I rely on the tracers from the gats in order to line up beads and then just rake the target over and over. It just seems counter intuitive I can sit huddled in the asteroids and by being in decoupled mode moving about ten feet at a time Im constantly in a far better position to my opponents. ,starcitizen,cm8pqu9,3,t5_2v94d

2466594,0,t1_cmg3llm,Luxury is a factor in what kinds of missions are available. The purpose of the Phoenix is for transport the VIP style of mission. Mr CEO isnt going to get in the back seat of an aurora ES for cruise through dangerous space. The ship is sort of geared for being able to deter an easy hijacking or kidnapping ransom attempt. That is the idea being ships like this. My guess is ferry the VIP missions will have a decent probability of being intercepted by NPC looking to make a quick buck. What I dont see the Phoenix being particularly useful for is players who are looking to use their luxury space for heavy machinery and cargo space instead or somehow having luxury give their crew some special advantage. At most maybe NPC crew will be more effective due to higher morale at worst they will be too drunk to fight because they were just a little too refined haha.,starcitizen,cmgkkk8,1,t5_2v94d

Misses out the jetpack for example.Should be in chronological order. Most of this stuff will probably not be too important in the long term.All backers before October   will start Star Citizen with a Class I Repair Bot in their garage.All backers before November   will start Star Citizen with  additional credits.Exclusive RECORD BREAKER ship skin and  additional credits on launch for all backers who pledge before the . million stretch goal.The first Squadron  mission disk Behind Enemy Lines will be available for free to all backers who pledge before  million upon release.All backers who pledge before June   will receive a Roberts Space Industries Class II space suit in their hangar.Every backer will get a free digital page Upgrade Handbook manual with their game which goes through the process of customizing and overclocking ship systems!Every pledger who backs before  million will receive a laser pistol. Keep your ship safe from boarders with a pistol by your side.Every pledger who backs before  million will receive a ship upgrade package containing an engine modifier.Exclusive star system for prelaunch backers. Only players who support the game before its launch will receive the computer coordinates needed to allow their jump drives to access this system.Explorerclass mobiGlas Rig  Every player who backs before we hit  million will start the game with their own visually distinctive mobiGlas ExoGlas rig which can be used to access the Observist at any time. Ive charged the mobiGlas team with a very difficult task creating a realistic interface that will help keep your affairs in order in an expansive galaxy that we hope players will expand in unknown directions. Its almost like building our own in fiction operating system for an imagined future and its very different task than building spaceships. This backerexclusive mobiGlas kit will come preloaded with additional galactic information that new players would ordinarily need to explore or barter to fill out its our way of honoring the information youve collected about the Star Citizen universe through the RSI site and community over the past year!Towel  And of course everyone who backs before we hit  million will also receive a towel for their hangar. Dont explore the galaxy without it! UEC  In honor of the goal were giving  UEC to every backer that you can use for upgrades and flair in the Voyager Direct Store. Id advise you hold on to the creds were going to have some cool configurable weapons and other upgrades for Arena Commander in the near future!  UEC may not seem like a lot but at this stage in the game it actually means were giving our backers several million dollars to outfit their ships!,starcitizen,cmglf8s,1,t5_2v94d
2467154,0,t1_cmglj3j,Its not unreasonable to expect a new instalment of a game to offer something more than the previous instalments.  Especially when the buzz surrounding the game paints it in such a light rather than the same but shinier.  So people who quite reasonably hoped for more than what amounts to an HD remake of a  year old game are disappointed.  And here you are pleased as punch that the game is everything that you hoped for throwing them under the bus for daring to want something different.  Not only is that some pretty shitty behaviour towards people who pledged money towards the game youre so fond of but its also the sort of thing that builds and perpetuates the sort of toxic community that can choke the life out of a multiplayer game.

It was more than just giving NPCs an identifier since the player was affiliated with every faction the player had a relationship with all of them. Youd see friendly and hostiles even in areas you visited the first time. But also each factions relationship with other factions made it feel like they had goals even though they didnt really. Coming up to a jump gate and seeing police and criminals fighting or coming to the end of a trade lane and seeing two corps duking it out is really fun for some reason.

2493947,0,t1_cmk363i,There are lots of ways to solve for focused testing in an alpha.The simplest is to just disable all content except the stuff you want tested. Want people to race? Disable all other modes for a week. Want people to test the Aurora? Disable all other ships except the Aurora even if you paid for a different ship.Except that wont help will it? People will just go play something else for a week until they can get back into their Hornet or back into the dogfighting modes.Thats exactly what the current situation is doing. People who are forced to fly an Aurora because they cant or wont buy anything else are mostly just electing not to play at all. The Aurora isnt much fun for the majority of players especially when they have to go up against Hornets and Ms with Voyager Direct weapons all the time.The proper way to do focused testing is with positive reinforcement. Give everyone equal access to all of the available content and then reward people who test specific things. Give them a trinket a stamp a badge a thing for their hangar if they play  matches with the i or complete  laps on each race track. Whatever. People love that stuff Just look at the Achievement Hunters on XBL if you need proof and it makes them feel really good about their choice to help out. Forcing people to play certain content against their will just pushes them away. Theyll find better things to do with their time.,starcitizen,cmk3hxw,-1,t5_2v94d

Realistically theyll probably just have a few persistent NPCs and then a large number that are generated randomly in areas where players are and then disappear when they arent needed.The entire economic model can be basically a big math formula based on how you want such and such percent of the NPC base to behave. You set it up and have some random number generators going to spice it up here and there but otherwise the economy simulation is just running a bunch of numbers.Then using those numbers you make a pirate spawn here near this player a trader spawn there as another player arrives the economy improve here where you have your hangar or fail there where the weapons dealer used to be.

The Avenger was pitched as retired police interceptor with a larger than average amount of cargo space for a fighter and nothing about that description is even remotely similar to an A. Any notion of the most important aspect of the Avenger being its apparent similarity to an A is only a fantasy that I made up for myself and never had anything to to do with the intended design of the ship.,starcitizen,cmr7dzz,0,t5_2v94d

2559084,0,t1_cmskxgr,Ok youre just talking about dynamic instances which star citizen is probably going to have.  ED doesnt have orbital mechanics it has dynamic instances.  Thats to say that objects visible in the instance operate dynamically.  The instance itself however doesnt support the relative velocity necessary for your vessel to actually be in orbit.If it has the ability to simulate not cutscene but simulate a ship deorbiting and dropping through the atmosphere at  kilometers per second then its got orbital mechanics because thats what youre going to need.  If not then it has a dynamic instance in a virtual orbit around a planet.  To support orbital mechanics the playable area would need to be a minimum of  kilometers across  distance from earth to the moon plus a bit.  While a dynamic instance results in a pretty view it doesnt support the vast distances actually necessary in simulated space.Theyre both pretty but they arent the same thing.edit Go play ksp for a while and the difference will become abundantly clear on why you cannot have an even remotely realistic space simulation and dogfighting at the same time.  Actually you could just watch the old naval carier series instead it shows orbital mechanics and it shows combat using them its a fun watch but it is definitely indicative of the difficulties in dog fighting in an actual orbit.Seriously I love the naval carrier series edit  Ok after watching a few more ED videos namely this  I think ive worked out what the ED devs have done.  You can quickly fly round an entire planet or even a stars photosphere in only a few seconds.  However there is still dogfighting in the game.  So what I think the devs did is they reduced scale.  by cutting down scale the devs can allow dynamic orbits but at the same time prevent ships from traveling so quickly that dogfighting becomes an exercise in futility.edit  Ive figured out how ED works and i feel like an idiot for having not done my research  ED operates with a dynamic condensed world the solar system you can fly around in see planets in ect.  The one in which you can travel at speeds approaching but under the speed of light.  So each solar system is a complete arena.  There are orbital systems here but your speeds are too high for it to really matter.  Then there are combat instances when you get interdicted or arrive at a station which are instanced areas but do not follow orbital mechanics and rather the instance your in ends up being in orbit around a central body while your relative velocities are kept low enough that dogfighting is an actual thing.Then theres the galactic map which uses and abuses the jump drive in order to send players from one area to another.  Personally i think this is a functional system and would be surprised if star citizen didnt use some variation of it.  It doesnt really give credit to proper orbital mechanics however.,starcitizen,cmslyjk,1,t5_2v94d

I ask.The crew are reporting strange occurances on the radar. Seems like a mechanical problem. What do you think?Hmm I said stroking my beard. Wasnt there a similar problem last week? They must be using the compartment as a foot rest again. Ill go have a look.  thanks desHe walked away. I wondered if he would make it of this ship or be stuck here for the rest of his life. Who knows. All I knew is I had a job to do and it had to be done now. So I got out my jailbroken communicator and hit the app I had been working on for a while.Red lights on the deck as the instant I touched the button the engions stoped and several ships appered in our airspace. There was panic everywhere and I stroled over to the closest console and attached my comunicator. Suddenly the ships cameras poped up on the screen. The wepons seemed to be down and the vault that stored all of the cqb wepons seemed to be broken. The capton just woke up and was only just recieving Infomation. Ships clamped onto ours as they set charges on the vault. Security must of had some explosives hiden somewhere. But then it was all over. They swarmed the ship like a well oiled machine. Passing me and moving to secure the vault. Finaly the seige was over.  minute and  seconds was all it took to take the whole ship and crew.All of the crew was lined up caption out the front. I was nere the back. one of the privatteres came up to me and started gloating. How bothersome. Suddenly the capton my cruser looked directly at me.

2625269,0,t1_cn187hj,Everybody keeps pointing out this high school physics information. Yes we get it. Weight should affect acceleration not top speed. But hey this isnt a space simulator. Theres Kerbal for that. This is more of an arcade dogfighting role playing type game with great graphics and an element of realism in the flight and physics mechanics. This doesnt mean that CIG has to be  realistic. It makes no sense gameplay wise to make the biggest ships with the biggest engines have the highest top speeds. Yes in the real world the biggest ships would universally dominate. But thats boring from a gameplay perspective. Have an Idris? Great youve got the highest top speed in the game.

Symptoms are not just losing forward thrust but appear to simulate applying full instantaneously effective Newtonian brake if any turning or strafing input is applied. The best way to experience this is to fly at the terra former solar panels and attempt to thread a gap at last minute any adjustment basically stops the Avenger while you change vector then instantly re accelerates you to full max speed when input ceases.Its a real bug not coupleddecoupled flight characteristics.I suspect its the nascent flight model that is only being used on Avenger and cutlass cutlass had reverse problem ...

However I can also understand CIGs timidness about them due to players spending a lot of real world dollars on these big ships and being told they cant use them for a month would bring CIG a world of pain dealing with that fallout.Crowdfunding has its drawbacks and not everyone is as tollerant to CIGs decisions as you or I.,starcitizen,cn3i7sx,1,t5_2v94d

2650248,0,t1_cn4i1jw,gt I choose not to because it requires ZERO skill. None. No effort whatsoever.How noble of you.I always cringe a bit whenever I see these posts after every update. Something in the newest update has always ruined the game or made it uplayable and now it requires zero skills because the commenters tactics are now useless.Then two weeks later people have learned to deal with it and theyre fine until the next patch. It happens after every single patch and you people always act as if every change is final and not iterative tweaks towards an awesome goal.Thank God this game is designed by people who know what theyre doing instead of constantly running after the moving target set by armchair designers in the two most toxic forums known to man where the game is apparently balanced whenever you have the highest KD. Personally I cant imagine how such a phenomenal game with such a dedicated and open set of devs has attracted such a horrible community as this game has. Possibly with the exception of Minecraft and ED this game has the worst community I have had the displeasure of being involved with.

2650912,0,t1_cn4et86,See that is my point the Aurora serves great purpose as a small general purpose ship. You can really mount up the weapons if you want to and with the impressively sized cargo hold for a smaller ship and option for a jump engine you can happily plod out on tradingsmuggling runs as you please. Its just like having a car you may have a big truck for work or a fast racing car for fun but for every day practicality you will always turn to your car.The key thing to remember about larger ships is you start to loose efficiency as you scale up when you think about the extra fuel you need to run your ship or the more costly replenishment of munitions for the better weapons.

2654789,0,t1_cn47z6m,I think you have Venus and Mars confused. Mars lacks a liquid core and because of that has a very weak magnetic field. This is the main theory as to what happened to its atmosphere if it ever had one which with the evidence of liquid water on the surface it did. Venus on the other hand is very seismically active with more volcanos than the rest of the solar system combined. The core of Venus is very active generations a large magnetic field almost as big as earths. The main problem with Venus is the run away green house effect caused by all the volcanoes spewing volcanic gases creating an atmosphere that is x heavier than our own and acidic. The soviet probe sent there in the s lasted just a few mins before melting. There was an interesting artical that proposed slamming as asteroid into the planet to blow off a large portion of the atmosphere and then using the volcanoes to power giant generators the scrub the ensuing fallout making a livable planet. But it was full of ifs and maybes.  Tldr Venus sucks. And technology even in SC probably couldnt make it a place you would want to visit. ,starcitizen,cn53zwc,1,t5_2v94d

As the pilot is sleeping in his bunk listening to classical music as he sleeps have the camera take a tour of the ship to make it feel livedin he is quickly awakened by a distress call. The distress call is badly garbled and the pilot must listen closely a few times in order to get a general location. The distress ship is badly damaged and located in an asteroid field ship accidentally hit asteroid. Life support is failing due to power failure. The pilot can hear the victim crying as she is badly hurt and hoping for help. The pilot sees nothing but a giant asteroid field and must find the distress ship before time runs out. Its a race against time! The entire time he is talking to her and reassuring her that he will come to save her. The pilot will also hear many alarms on the distress ship as life support is failing.

Cryengine since Crysis original always had good vehicle support including flightcombined arms.and zeroGPlenty of technical hurdles but the big ones are walking in vehicles seen this double precision nearing completion and networking theyre still upgrading this and networking is hard to master in complex games. Games can do quite a bit though DL one called Starshatter its old but probably the only game remotely going for what SC is attempting. Agreeing the game should stop funding though thats the article is still trolling though. Ive personally never seen ANY other project told to do such a thing in early Alpha or people trying to defend said position even remotely.

Gender equal?gt TD Well really were just going for something that reflects the real world I mean there are plenty of professional women here and I cant imagine itll be different in the future. I mean some games where you have someone running around scantily clad that doesnt really make sense here were going for immersion that wouldnt look right!gt AM I think realistic is what were shooting for. We dont want our females being weird fantasy avatars they should be an extension of the player and so should look like they belong in the world themselves.gt DV I mean thinking about how many years in the future this is set any perceived differences real or imaginative would really be negligible at that point.gt AM So yeah were trying to keep it real. Were right now finalising our final base female model and our characters will be dressed or customised however the players want so really itll be up to people playing the game.gt TD And it IS a scan not just an artists interpretation of the female body so more real. Mateor Asks Would it be possible or are there plans to develop an application that would allow players to use their tablets as programmable control inputs? This way players can input commands like what is show in a lot of the cockpits.gt TD This is that idea that you could have you second screen experience. Its one of the stretch goals. What the extent of that is and whether it has awareness of what youre doingpiloting in the game. Would it be possible? Absolutely anything is with enough time and engineering but are there plans... We think itd be cool it wouldnt happen tomorrow.gt AM Its not being worked on right now its a goal wed like to achieve and it needs a designer to work on it etc.gt TD It would be supercool though have you seen some of those pics of people that have turned their living rooms into Constellation bridges nearly?gt DV I saw someone on the forums that made their own tablet app that could change their equipment etc I believe they were actually putting ingame commands playing against the vanduul. So the tech is there...gt TD Maybe we should rephrase the question then ARE THERE PLANS?!? Kurupt Asks We know you guys have to reallocate resources when its crunch time to get vital items on the list done. How do you deal with peoples pet projects? If they have done all their work by Thursday do they get to work on something of their choice on Friday? Are pet projects only allowed on their personal time off the clock?gt TD Well... I like the idea of running like Montessori...gt DV I think a little bit of everything...gt AM The first thing to realise is the development schedule isnt written in stone it moves around a shifts every day. When its time to get something out for the players we have to prioritise and focus on something at the cost of another.gt TD Its nice that were not shipping on disc too. Just because a persons project gets put on hold for a patch push doesnt mean its never going to happen. It just means until  weeks from now table this.gt DV We tailor jobs to peoples talents anyway were not going to give UI design to someone that wants to program missiles. We want to make sure people working on projects are invested in what theyre doing.gt TD It ties into that question about where design ideas come from as well. A lot of peoples pet projects might be a prototype or a design idea theyve come up with. Kalix is renowned for his like illegal racing that tesla ship graveyard even the Murray Cup came from that.gt AM Murray cup was a test piece someone just build a map to test and fly ships around in and it grew from there.gt TD Theres a hologram city map thats going around now testing ships flying between the D backdrop of ArcCorps city. Its incredibly dangerous  TAC BuzZz Killer Asks It seems like missiles are currently very powerful and overly difficult to evade using countermeasure. Is the signature system being used by the missiles and countermeasures in . currently working as intended or can we expect fixeschanges in the near future?gt DV Thats a ubiquitous unanimous yes. Its actually one of our big priority tasks right now getting that tweaked and balanced enough for players to enjoy it.gt AM We released it knowing that its not balanced but we wanted players to get it into their hands and play with it a bit over the holidays. You can expect it to change to be what we think is more balanced in the next patch.gt TD Specifically in multiplayer theres definitely an issue with them being spawned on the client but not the server.Thanks and Extro!,starcitizen,cnn178u,22,t5_2v94d

If the database fields are somewhat similar in architecture  it would be easy for the devs to navigate and read so that they can focus on obtaining the necessary information quickly. Well that is if they ever plan to use it alot at all I mean for all I know they have tons of their own JIRA assignments.  tldr Question would it make sense for the community issue tracker to align its format to CIGs own JIRA project? uChillCIG may want to comment or seek feedback from the other CIG devs.,starcitizen,cno6bxx,1,t5_2v94d

The Merlin will not be your dog fighter.... It is not being worked on for AC right now because CR even said that it wouldnt do well. That is part of why I dont understand the point of it anymore. If it cant hold its own what is to stop a hornet from taking fire off the Constellation for two seconds taking down the Merlin and then jumping right back to killing the Connie? I am hoping that the P is more of a small transport because as a fighter the P that we do have info for doesnt seem like it will be that great.        Edit Oh and people keep bringing up the fact that the P wont be going very far away from a Connie... but then jump right to saying the XiAn Scout. It is the xian equivalent to the hornet for right now. The Hornet is carrier based. We dont know if that means that it constantly needs to restock ammo or something else but that is a thing. The XiAn may be the same way. I could never get a confirmation for whether or not it was carrier based on RTV so keep that in mind.,starcitizen,co0eq5n,2,t5_2v94d

Did I mention there is also a docking port down there.So I think I would use it as a strike craft against shipping lanes and convoys with the intent of shutting down a rival orgs economy rather than escorting or hunting for loot In large part because I dont think the return would warrant the fuel and time to get it.As such x hornets and the rescue ship refitted for boarding actions against enemy ships of value.

3021876,0,t1_cob6bby,Ok yeah.  What bothers me is CR has stated at least a few times that certain areas will be instanced on top of each other specifically in orbit.  What if a large organization of  ships tries to blockade a planet in orbit?  Presumably those  ships would be separated into  instances of say .  Now along comes another organization with  ships and gets into a conflict with one instance instance  but the other  are just sitting there picking their noses totally unaware of a fight until all of a sudden when a lot of ships get destroyed in instance  they just POP into that instance OR they are never aware that a fight ever happened. Or they could be split evenly between instances but then at the end of the fight they are just left with perhaps a few ships per instance either unable to reunite with their teammates or they POP into the other instance. Meanwhile joe trader goes to that planet and is put maybe into instance  and never even knows anything happened there at all. Stacked instances are really problematic and this is really a dilemma with large groups and it bothers me a great deal.  I wish they would stick to the spatial instances only except for quantum travel.,starcitizen,cob7qop,2,t5_2v94d

3039001,0,t1_cocyoe9,The way I look at trucking and especially smuggling since Im a big enthusiast of this gameplay mechanic and everything that comes with it is that youll never really have a close knit group unless its all on one ship. What I suspect is that unless you are KNOWN to be able to move high value stuff from player to market effectively youll be passing jobs back and forth with your fellow trucking buddies. To give an example Han Solo in the books made a name for himself of being one hell of a pilot and more importantly fast and highly trainedintelligent. Short of being able to pull off stuff like that it will probably be similar to a job board from Privateerother games or offering out youcreworg as a freelance trucker for relatively normal stuff. God help you if you end up in something like the Icarus Hunt.EDIT Also as a smuggler keep your ears open mate. Always go looking into places youre not supposed to never hurts to have a leg up on the competition because you know things just by listening. Never hurts to have a few pirates on your side to tell you whenwhere they raiding or other raider groups are. ,starcitizen,coczoui,1,t5_2v94d
3039844,0,t3_2uyzn2,Feedback CF series repeaters need serious work on overheatcool down. Omnisky series need a reduction in fire rate and a substantial increase in power draw and heat generationThe CF series are not at anything close to parity with the other option in the energy weapon classand I say option as a complete joke because using anything but the Omnisky  is a death sentenceThe CF repeaters while boasting a higher DPS than their equivalent sized counterparts are also dependent on keeping fire on the target due to a low pershot damage. With the current environment of chaff commander this is a tall order at best On a base hornet the Badgers will overheat long before they take down the shields and kill anything but an m or mustang.The Omnisky series are currently completely out of whack they have the highest velocity rapid rate of fire very low power draw and low heat generation.. Plus due to their burst damage potential they actually have the highest applied dps in the game damage per shot is far higher than anything else when you factor in the ease of hitting the targetThere is currently no drawback to using the omnis over any other weapon.IMHO the Omnisky series should be balanced as a standoff long range sniper type of weapon. With a lower ROF and higher power draw and heat generation players who equip  of them on a single ship would only get  shots before total power drain and overheat. This would disincentivize people from monoboating this weapon unless they have the confidence that they can finish the fight fast landing all your shots when you only have  is a skill based high risk vs reward scenarioThe idea is to encourage people to vary their weapon loadouts creating more dynamic styles of play and encouraging more maneuver based combat as varying weapon types  varied target pips  pilots must line up shots better to ensure all weapon groups are hitting at once.A second benefit from adjusting the Omnisky series not so much from the changes to the CF repeaters would be to highlight the Behring laser weapons.. Since right now they are an afterthought and hardly used.. Even though the ma currently has the best applied damage over a long period due to its fantastic cooling and low heat generation it still isnt attractive enough to use over the omniskys since the omnis do everything betterApplying my suggested changes to the nostly series would turn the Behring guns into the weapons that fill the current role of the omnis closemedium range burst damage weaponsAnyone who wants to refute this analysis please do,starcitizen,cod2tuv,9,t5_2v94d

Thanks for all the work especially the dark theme which is awesome.I really dont want to be a dick when youve clearly worked hard to do a great job but I have some criticisms I hope youwe might consider namely the font size and spacinguse of screen space.  Youve increased the font size px and given each link more vertical padding and in the process reduced the number of links visible on the screen at once.  Could you share your thoughts behind these changes?  I personally prefer having as much information visible at once as possible but Id like to hear other opinions.Also you may have discussed this already but as beautiful as the new header background is the animation is not very nice to the batteries of mobile devices.  My  retina MBP shows  CPU use whenever I scroll or the header is visible.  The impact appears to multiply with multiple rstarcitizen tabs open which seems weird since the browser should only need to render for one tab at a time.  Ive never made anything like it so for all I know theres nothing you can do to to help the battery hit but regardless when Im out and without a power cable Ill probably have to turn the style off.

For something as simple as a well put together and documented bug report or as a reward to every weeks MVP. Might help foster more positive community involvement and more actual testing bug reports.On some levels I understand why CIG is doing what theyre doing but at the end of the day its time to stop hiding behind the alpha label when accused of pw mechanics.Like others have said if it has to be rentals make it game time seeing as a lot of backers are full time working adults with not a lot of free time and not a lot of disposable income it would be frustrating to grind only to not be able to use the equipment  days.,starcitizen,col1dej,8,t5_2v94d

3125577,0,t1_colyizm,well whenever you guys ganged up on me i was toast.. i think that people are just going to have to accept the fact that certain ships arent going to be able to go toe to toe with others. it will require multiple single seater ships to take down a superhornet once the second seat is enabled trust me lol.i think the hornet benefits most from the shield buffs because it has the least maneuverability.from a few hours testing tonight i feel like my engagements were won or lost because of skill no matter what ship I faced great pilots gave me a tough time terrible ones took a while longer to kill and there was no real standout annoyance besides CS missiles,starcitizen,colyqr5,1,t5_2v94d
3126085,0,t1_com0fg0,But look at games like HZ a month or two between wipes is never going to happen. People exploit things to win and troll but with rentals that trolling is at least limited as they mentioned in the post. If everything is easy to get there will be no variety. Also this gives meaning to sales which will drive more people to try what CIG wants them to try than anything else. Sure you can tell people to fly something for the sake of testing but only things like sales and this free  series week will work for the masses. CIG having controls over variables is important. If everyone had a perm unlock easy to get ship  gun CIG would have no ability to get people to try something they wantneed the masses to try. At best they would get a very small percentage of players trying something out for a very small amount of time a match or two at different times so in the big scheme of things it would mean nothing. It hurts testing if someone can just sit in free flight all day to earn the next ship. The rental model forces people to get into their ship and actually try it out for more than a bad match. If most people who own an aurora get into matches to work on building credits we would have matches with mostly auroras. Best part when the rental runs out they are incentivized to fly their ship again to earn another ship which if there is a proper tree will not always be the same ship because it is easier to get access to ship x over ship y. ,starcitizen,com0mqz,-6,t5_2v94d

3127769,0,t1_com5t9g,So your solution is to give everything to everybody?  Like I said if CIG wanted that to happen then that would have happened.  Its funny to see that as soon as CIG releases something that allows people to unlock stuff without spending money everyone is suddenly complaining more than they have ever before.  No system is ever going to make everybody happy.gtgetting their shit pushed in by people who have a ton more time then they doIgnoring the fact that this is basically how most games work anyway those people with few hours of play time are going to get their shit kicked in by those who play a lot more anyway because this is a skillbased game.  If you give everything to everyone youre going to piss off the group that is going to complain about having nothing but imba Super Hornets in matches.  And this is exactly what will happen too.  Sure make the argument that people will be more inclined to test other ships and weapons when they have everything for free.  Unfortunately the fact is that a majority of people playing dont care as much for the testing part and want to win their match.  Thus we get everyone flying Super Hornets with six omnis because flying anything less puts you at an even greater disadvantage than doing so now does.  The only people who wont fly the SH are the experienced pilots who are confident in their ability to win with the lesser ships and those are the pilots that are going to kick everyones ass anyway.  So if you want this to happen just expect the eventual backlash from this community because they arent happy with that either.,starcitizen,com6wf4,0,t5_2v94d

3130781,0,t1_col01mb,There should never be a permanent unlock system in a game where the credits are only temporary. You will have the entire player base rise enmasse on the day of the PU release when all the credit purchased ships are erased regardless of the copius warnings and protest. People dont like something given to them and taken away. They CANNOT have credits in the game as the software programs are linked directly to the PU products for immersion a tutorial program customized for your own series of equipments so they CANNOT have a permanent unlock system that can be revoked. Besides that would only last until everone had superhornets and then the entire credit system would be pointless no one would fly any other ships so there would be no community QA support for anything else flying see below and the entire module would be a waste of time and support for CIG.How low should the prices be? Whats to stop people from refusing to play with auroras and mustangs and is and only use hornets? How would that lack of diversity help focus testing?I know youre thinking But theres only a few aurora or mustang pilot out there in the first place. However if a bunch more people sign on get SHs and play there will be no aurora or mustang pilots out there. So how cheap do you want to make it to ensure people still use the Auroras to the same extent as the Hornets for QA purposes?And I get the competitive multiplayer  its grindy when you have to race against yourself sixty times in a row but theyre trying to avoid grind. Its much more a game when youre playing multiplayer than when you are repetitively redoing a single player match for ten hours. Im against grind so Im for competitive rewards only.I agree the play time is long for what youre looking for. But youre still thinking this game needs superhornets. Just loadout a i or Avenger. An LN or Delta gets the job done with the right weapons and those are cheap. But if you take away the illusion that you cant enjoy the game without a superhornet then the rest of the arguments fall apart.Besides the community rewards. I agree those are awesome. ,starcitizen,comi4nc,1,t5_2v94d

3188649,0,t1_cosdvqv,I feel that if you wanted to make your Freelancer into a miner you could certainly do so.  After all it is just some specialized lasers and tractor beams that you would likely be able to fit in place of some weapon points.  Will it be nearly as efficient as an Orion?  Of course not but I believe it will be perfectly capable of doing the job especially since they stress modular design and versatility in ships.,starcitizen,cosi4th,5,t5_2v94d
3189597,0,t1_cosksds,I wasnt referencing any quote at all so Im not sure what youre referring to.  Obviously a ship that is built for a specific role is going to be better at that role.  Nobody mentioned a thing about the effectiveness of the Orion as a trader just that it will have the ability to carry cargo.  Nor did I state that it would have the same amount of freight units for cargo as it does for ore.  I simply stated the possibility of being able to turn the units into some cargo pods which I dont see as being out of the question seeing as how they are working for a decent amount of modularity between ships.  You seem to have assumed a lot of things that I never said.,starcitizen,coslo23,1,t5_2v94d
3190026,0,t1_cosmols,My big concern about the Orion mining ship is its sheer size. Mining isnt my thing so I havent exactly poured over all the details yet so Im making a few basic assumptions that could be incorrect. Were going to be mining asteroids and the best place to find asteroids is in an asteroid belt. Not all asteroids are going to be the ones we want to mine so that means we need to be able to navigate our ship through an asteroid belt in order to get to the rocks we want to chew on. This to me sounds more impracticable the larger your ship is.It would make more sense to me to have the mining process broken down into several smaller ships. You would have a CampC ship like the hornet tracker looking for the right rocks as well as keeping an eye out for unwanted visitors once he spots a tasty rock you send in a small mining vessel into the belt to break up your rock and send it out to your processorrefining ship who then in turn bundles it up for your hauling ship to bring back to the market.,starcitizen,cosn9nu,1,t5_2v94d

3196614,0,t1_cotarpq,Yes it would be more profittable though it does remind me of an old textbased MMO named OGame. OGame too had a universe with a dozen planets per star system hundreds of system per galaxy and multiple galaxy per server. However many tool website within the OGame community were developed that used bots to methodically scan each planet to record down what each player had built and resources saved and made the information gathered publicly available meanwhile running advertisements on their websites on the side. While it would be more profittable for individuals in that game to keep that information to themself and attack the same idle playerplanet repeatedly that information would have been already made publicly online on a third party website running advertisements.,starcitizen,cotbult,1,t5_2v94d

3205695,0,t1_cou9e9u,I think if the community were to give a show of hands theyd like immersion to be a significant aspect in the games designs. It may not take precedence over fun game mechanics but a big draw of this game has clearly been its immersion.Lets take a pistol with a thumbhole... eh stock if you will... for example  The back of this stock would get in the way of accessing the firearm from a holster. It would also create massive problems for actually holding the firearm  the arms of its user would have to be held to the sides making it far more difficult to aim properly and have good recoil control.

3206322,0,t1_coubw4q,while I agree getting a solid clean TTK is one of if not the most important parts I have spent years and hundreds of hours playing different FPS games and gun models have an absolutely HUGE effect on gunplay if the guns are huge and they have any recoil at all recoil it has a huge effect on your visibility.My current worry is with the guns being as bulky as they are they will be too large and obstruct the shooters visibility when they are walking around with them let alone when they engage in a fight.   If you look at modern guns as an example they are as minimal as they can be in their design to adjust for what I assume to be this exact reason. Im no gun expert but so this is all assumptions but our modern weapons are the result of centuries of development we should be seeing a concept that uses that information to the fullest not just generic space marine gun  through .I also realize this is a game and the aesthetic is important and can completely disregard physical laws of weight movement etc. if it makes a better experience but the basis for good a game is always built on good research.

First of all Crossfire setups are more jenky prone to microstuttering dont always work do not scale linearly are less economical in the long run produce more heat and on most mobos max out your PCI slots so you cannot do SLI in the future. If he buys   he can always upgrade in the future without buying two new GPUs. On your first build unless youre totally maxing out and buying top of the line cards SLI and Crossfire are not advisable.

3231976,0,t1_cowy92g,I like the wall popout toilet idea like you say it does feel like the aurora was designed before they thought they were doing that level of realism.The carrack does have a larger crew and much larger size but is less multirole than the connie being more specialist towards exploration it has more blindspots in a combat situation and probably isnt anywhere near as manouverable.The other thing is that the Connies interior uses almost all of the exterior space this is subject to change as i know the connie is getting yet another pass through the design pipeline while we dont know anything about the interior of the carrack other than the cockpit so for all we know the interior could be largely taken up by fuel tanks and that huge power generator. well just have to see.One last thing that i thought of  The CONCEPT sale of the Carrack may only have been  more than the Connie but they state on all the concept sales that these prices are the cheapest that ship is ever going to be for pledge prices so when we get a hangar ready sale for it it may be a good  more or even more than a connie.,starcitizen,cox007r,2,t5_2v94d

People who betray their crew  employer would quickly get a bad rep and become effectively unhireable whilst good crew will accumulate positive feedback ensuring their continued employment.Could someone still game the system by doing lots of real jobs to build up a rep then blowing it all on that one big score?  Absolutely.  And by the same token a person could work their way into a position of confidence in a real business only to embezzle it for millions and go on the lam.  It happens in real life itll happen in Star Citizen and Im excited about that.  Imagine how fucking awesome itll be when you realise your new hire has betrayed you and you have him hauled up to the bridge hands manacled as his friends in their Cutlasses circle the asteroid field where your Orion is hiding.  You keep your cool and explain that youll be willing to let him live but only if he tells his friends to call off their attack... He finally breaks down and agrees but when you transmit his message all that comes back is mocking laughter.  The pirates duped him just like he duped you... He was never going to get a cut of the profits.  They were planning to space his dumb ass along with the rest of you when they made off with your ship.You look around at your crew with grim resolve.  Theres nothing left but to fight your way out.  Your Orion is slow and poorly armed but it does have a powerful mining laser and some of these asteroids are reading as very volatile.

Once fully live SC ingame items will only be purchasable with ingame credits. There will even be some items you can ONLY earn by playing  flying missions. All you will be able to spend money on that is gameplay related would be buying some ingame credits as you dont want or dont have enough time to earn the credits you need for your contemplated purchase. Well cap purchase of ingame credits to avoid someone unbalancing the game  economy. Finally as I point out above skill will always play a factor  there will be no magic spaceship of death that will sweep all before it so while you may have bought a more expensive spaceship  weapon a better pilot can still beat you this is where people with lots of time get an advantage as theyll have spent a lot more time honing their combat skills!Link to the rstarcitizen FAQ thread ,starcitizen,cp9w02y,1,t5_2v94d

3364733,0,t1_cpbsez2,True but it does make logical sense considering theyre doing LODs anyway and packaging up different textures and assets based on the resolution wouldnt be too hard. They could also use the streaming tech so you wont have to download the entire thinggtgtChris Longknife | Apoapsis saidIm not sure if this has been asked but what about a patching technology similar to what Blizzard uses where the game downloads the core files first so you can start playing and then finishes patching as youe playing not sure if this is practical bandwidth wise? When I played World of Warcraft it was always nice to only have to download a small part of the patch and then optionally I could instead of waiting for the full patch to finish start playing while the rest downloaded in the background with a small negative effect on game play  lag.gtThe DevOps team has been investigating multiple solutions regarding this. The ability to stream data will be a necessity especially when we hit the point where the game spans multiple universes many of which a player might not ever reach. Theres no reason to download this data the player will never see or use so why use the network bandwidth for it?gtOne thing Id like to have eventually implemented is a connected data tree of the asset structure with nodes connected based on their position in the world. This way as you move throughout the game you traverse this data tree at the same time and assets that you may need soon are pre loaded. But well cross that bridge when we get to it.Either well get the system described above or get some type of launcher option to set the asset quality we want. ,starcitizen,cpbszgx,2,t5_2v94d

3390352,0,t3_2yzjry,So just to clarify the concern is that new backers will be confused and think the game is released? So is BACKING a game not enough of a clue that the game isnt released? If you could purchase it on steam I could see the confusion but you need to go through their website and click through agreements that this is just an Alpha and things will change etc.If anything I was more confused by the Arena Commander name. You want to advertise Star Citizen but for the last  years all you hear about is Arena Commander in the outside world. My cousin thought Arena Commander was a separate game from Star Citizen until I explained it to him. Im fine with them calling it Star Citizen .. If a person backs it thinking it is released then they are as foolish as a person buying a car form a used car lot thinking they are buying a new car. Since the only way to get this game until release is backing it by spending real money on a ship I pretty sure any confusion will be eliminated when the message This is an Alpha build pops up. That and the fact that you cant buy it in stores or anywhere other than the star citizen website. Mountain out of a mole hill.  ,starcitizen,cpeq6hw,4,t5_2v94d

It also looks like the turrets have airlocks in some spots so maybe they are theyre own escape pods?

Before I had two in mind  Amored transport  Well without the torpedos it hits like a kitten. Two superhornets outdamage the Tali. Looking at the contestants in this role Constellation  More cargospace higher maneuverability rockets  size  weapons assuming the turrets will get downgraded I see no reason to take the Tali over the Connie.  Bombing  I have an issue with the torpedos if they are really strong  to kill an Idris Idris owners would get really frustrated. If you need more multiple Gladiators might be the better call. If there is a carrier involved definitely Gladiators because they can reload without going back to a stationplanet. If not  Gladiators might still do more in a chaotic fight than one Retaliator.  In the end I can imagine some cases where the Retaliator is the best choice but these are way to limited.    Imo give this ship something to hit hard additional to the torpedos.

It takes a lot more to kill a pilot with rapid onset gs in the vertical direction but a lateral  g turn like the M is capable of could certainly mess you up.What Im trying to say is that blackoutredoutGLOC are not the only consequences of highg maneuvering.

Goal post shifting? Really? They changed the scope as more money became available.thats the definition of it yesgt Id rather have a better game late than a shitty game early. again those were not our  choices. they had millions after the KS to make a good game and then they could have expanded it or made a sequel. or made some completely unrelated game whatever. they werent forced to delay the game they promised for years by circumstances out of their control thats just something youre making up for some reason.They had the money they said they needed and they didnt make the game they said they were making. in fact they havent made a game at all and its been years. thats not ok its just not. We have an  million demo so far and in any other industry people would be furious but for some reason in this one the customer base is content with nonsense platitudes like well i would rather it be good when it comes out in  than be the worst most dog shittiest game ever and come out on time as if Wing Commander wasnt a great game that came out on time and as if no other game ever came out on time and its just impossible to do.The choice actually was well they could take this  million dollars which is more money than Chris Roberts ever had for a game before even the ones starring Hollywood stars and they could make a great game obviously or they could extend fund raising for  more years and then do whatever they feel like while fanboys praise them for it.

On some of our attempts we suffered the same one person remains above landing pad sitting in mid air whilst the craft takes off thing. Im not sure what in particular caused that bug but it seemed to simply be luck of the draw. A common feature of this seemed to be wrists and ankles syncing with the roll yaw of the flying craft.      Other times the cockpit on the super hornet wouldnt close properly. The rear passenger would not be able to fire the guns although they should be able to on a successful attempt.     At one point I managed to pick my EVA friend up in the middle of space. By communicating really well I found him in the darkness of the void and pursued him as closely as I could with my hornet. Even though I was already in it and flying it he was able to press to use and enter the craft successfully. However it quickly desynced shortly after with our craft just spinning and floating off into space on his screen even though I had flown back to the landing pad on mine.   We also had luck with the Aurora with me laying in the moonroof coffin and my friend flying the craft around.,starcitizen,cpr83fa,5,t5_2v94d

Im kind of sick of it and the at least perceived faggotry from Constellation crowd of i win pledged first.gtBased on this I expect the weapon sizes to be reduced.

3529868,0,t1_cpuju8q,Some of this is copy and pasted from other posts Ive made regarding this... some is new. Also this is my setup... but not a HowTo guide like you were asking. Look through this and let me know what if any of this makes sense. TARGET scripting for the TM requires some minimal coding knowledgeexperience to get it to do what I did. You dont necessarily need to know XML but it doesnt hurt to fine tune the joystick profile at the end. But SCJMapper will do most if not all of it for you.My controls might seem odd... but my reasoning is that I dont expect to always need a dual stick. I wanted my second stick to handle finecontrol functions or role specific actions. And I wanted to be able to fly with only one stick if I needed to. That being said here is what I have.RIGHT HAND CH Fighterstick YAxis pitch XAxis roll my preference trigger st weapon group primary fire pinky button at base of stick nd weapon group Throttle wheel set and forget throttle Left way switch on top of stick   Left Change countermeasure  Right Launch countermeasure  Up Missile Lock  Down Fire missile Right way switch on top of stick   Left cycle friendly targets  Right cycle hostile targets  Up target object in reticle  Down I dont remember I use almost every button so this goes on and onLEFT HAND TM YAxis center  to  full forward is my forward thrust. Center  to  full back is my reverse thrust... but currently this can only be on or off there is no gradient in between. XAxis Yaw my preference for now ZAxis twist lateral strafe Trigger boost Miscellaneous buttons decouple mode and other things I cant remember right now.This works great for ME. Not sure if it is ideal for anyone else though.To get the Yaxis on the T to behave as the throttle AND split into forward and reverse thrust Im using a TARGET script. If you want to see it let me know and Ill try posting it here or upload it somewhere. Id also give you my XML profile so that hopefully you could jump in using my setup or use it as a starting point.I can use my TM as the throttle OR the throttle wheel on my CH Fighterstick... with the TM overriding the CH Fighterstick. For example if Im using the TM as my throttle and release it my throttle goes to zero because the stick springs back to zero. If I then use the throttle wheel on the CH Figtherstick I can set my throttle to a specific  and leave it. If I then touch the TM again it completely takes over throttle again and ignores the Fighterstick wheel.While my special functions curves and sensitivity are all set in my sticks respective programs TARGET and CH Control Manager I bind all the buttons and axis in the XML but not using the ingame key binding. I use SCJMapper Star Citizen Joystick Mapper to set and then create the custom XML file. I then have to load it into Star Citizen usually once for each patch. And if I have to Ill even edit the XML by hand. I just find this easier than using the current ingame binding.I also use VoiceAttack for shield distribution targeting and a few other minor things. I never touch my keyboard once in a match.,starcitizen,cpumni4,1,t5_2v94d

Just because the OP wants a bounty hunting ship doesnt mean that theyll make a dedicated variant for it because it still has to fit inside the original frame which by the sounds of it is already very cramped. Im sorry Im in total sales mode and totally thought you meant that they would be selling variants as pledges.

3552771,0,t3_30xsqj,TBH I think having expensive shit is the way to go.After seeing how early access games have been in the last year or two SC seems to have broken the mold.Normally EA games are funded already and devs are looking to get paid quick.  I feel that two things happen because of this  you get a huge influx of players who end up getting bored of your game and CONSTANTLY complaining about a slow development pace and  you have a dev team that already got paid and ends up slowing down updates and the development process as if the game was already released.With SC although there are a lot of backers its not a crazy amount.  You dont have a massive amount of players just straight complaining that the game isnt finished.  Instead you see people who you know are dedicated to the process buying expensive packages.  You also have a motivated dev team constantly pushing out ideas and content because the game basically funded by their ideas and content.Although I dont really associate Star Citizen with early access its on the same level in theory.

3588951,0,t1_cq1d3se,gt Ok first of all you honestly cannot expect your joystick to be the endall control device in a game that will also include a first person shooter aspectI dont expect it to be the endall control device at all.  For flight I expect it to be balanced because thats what theyve said theyre going to try to do.  Even then I dont expect it to be the endall control device for flight  just one of a number of relatively balanced options.For FPS Id much prefer a KM and I have no plans to even attempt to use my HOTAS for that.All that Im saying is that people like the OP flipping out about the idea of them trying to balance the inputs for space flight after theyve said theyre going to do just that seems more unreasonable than expecting them to try to make them balanced.,starcitizen,cq1d9jz,5,t5_2v94d

As much as this idea would make me cry if implimented I feel that it is important to realize that these guys are just plugging away at the actual game. On another note I had a blast last night talking with all of the devs especially Travis BECAUSE I treated them like a bunch of guys that were off the clock. I talked to them about their jobs. But only to the extent that I would a friend I tried to stay away from pitching ideasasking questions about timelines and releases and instead I got to hear Travis tell awesome stories about a bachelor party in Reno. That personally was why I wanted this to happen. I would have cringed if it had turned into a townhall discussion where they are fielding questions and concerns for  hours.

The whole quotegtWhen in the Lowered stance entered by sprinting or using contextual navigation pressing the Fire button will brings you back into the Ready stance.gtTapping the Fire button brings the weapon to the Ready stance from Lowered. Holding the button begins firing the weapon as it transitions to the Ready Stance and releasing the fire button returns you to the Ready stance unless any other navigation stance change button is used Shift Space Bar Control.In full context it makes sense.

But there are times when they have a clear agenda or plan and when its revealed even partially they find out pretty quickly that its not very popular.The issue then is that they try to compromise which often helps no one.  The naysayers will still complain mostly because the underlying issues are still there and they risk pissing off members of The Church of Holy Christ Roberts congregation.In that case its best to either say Sorry we are doing our own thing regardless... or actually listen to the feedback especially the constructive feedback and be willing to do a  on things.

Without knowing what changes are in store for the i its hard to say.

Its a longtime known fact that after a subreddit has gotten to a certain size you will have enough people that impulse upvote. And what gets upvoted? Easily consumed content. Guess why there are so many game related subreddits? Because they will get filled up with funny stuff that people upvote in mass and content that takes time to consume gets pushed out. That is why strict moderation is needed. Its not that people dont like the memes and funny content. But it will bring the rest away from the front. Music text and videos are not as well upvoted as images.It can be solved by creating a separate feed. The best way to do that is to create a new subreddit. And that has been done. Yet people dont care about subreddits like rmobiGlas and rstarcitizenmemes.

3746706,0,t3_338i7l,I think the better solution is going to come from ship component limitations. When they really make coolers and power plants and CPU power matter they can discourage omniboats by making them CPU expensive to run. That would give hornets a reason  to run a varied load out they could either have all omniskys and lose efficiency and rof or mix them with less resource hungry weapons to get better dps and rof at the cost of alpha. Meanwhile the  series could keep using an effective weapon since they only need to run  of them. We have more ways to balance than weapon to weapon it doesnt matter if the ubergun is op if you need a Bengal to run it effectively. That said all the weapons need a balance pass and we need more variety. With the upcoming physicalization of ammo it would be great to see energy weapons get a similar treatment. For example each shot has a total energy value that is split between velocity projectile size and fire rate damage would be a product of projectile size and velocity with an efficiency controlled by CPU power. ,starcitizen,cqjclsu,1,t5_2v94d

3747779,0,t3_339k64,A few points im sure others have made them too.A phew i didnt miss this sale. so thats a relief.B if it doesnt have shields or guns then its far too overpriced for a freighter vessel with Real Money Pricing. And i say this as a concierge level spenderdonator to SC theres no value for the dollar yet.  month limited insurance and a year or more to see the ship in the PU betas its going to be a rough sell for veterans.Since the current series of ships are usable in arena commander even the starter ships a freighter would be belligerent in combat or racing. I know  is around the corner but its a lot to put in a ship thats not modelled or concepted andor scaled. th genth gen ships need a lot more work to go ahead now too. I know that SC is trying to tier their ships into dock class vessels but this seems to be an extension of the caterpillar model as a modular vessel. Unless the A hull can fit a i  the B a freelancer or constellation and so on. C I just dont know if i want a space truck without some kind of sketch or concept art. The Drake Herald comes to mind and the Xian Khartual Scout are some unusual ships but they do have a certain quirk in that the concept art was way off the final build for both those ships postannouncement.

3748070,0,t3_33c718,TC gtRaeyik Asks  Ive seen a lot of talk about food sleep showeringetc. Many ships have features for the immersion effect but are there plans to actually make these commoditiesneeds affect the player? In other words will sleeping grant a bonus to black out tolerance or food give a player a buff like they do in most MMOs?gtCR I think this is something that Ive talked about before. I like that we have functions in ships like that which make them seem real and I do want to give the player a bonus for using those things to a certain extent because it makes it not just completely cosmetic. That said you dont want to make it like real life where you have to use the toilet or eat  square meals a day or whatever. I was in favour of the light immersion factor which is something like say if you didnt shower for a week someone might make a face at you due to the smell or look and thus might be  to your reputationconversation with that person. Sleeping is what were using as a save mechanic too but perhaps occasionally if you rest in the PU or eat it might affect your stamina or something. I do think things like drinking too much alcohol should make your vision blurry but perhaps if you never ate anything ever you might get weaker. It should be fun but just a light RPG immersion factor like you could walk up to the Constellation dinner table and press a button have a meal appear and your character might have a little bit of a bonus from eating it. It shouldnt feel like you have to do it all the time like a chore but that itd be good to do every now again. Itll be like refuelling your ship just resource management.Im quite happy with it being a light RP factor in the game. Certain situations merit being washed and looking the part but for the most part it doesnt matter. Food has a minor effect but your avatar doesnt become a space tamagochi with a bowel movement gauge and a body odour indicator.,starcitizen,cqji6yc,15,t5_2v94d

3752921,1,t3_33ebje,Erris Welcome to an Imperial News Network INNterview! My name is Erris. Joining me today weve got SQB or Stupid Question Bot from the reddit forums.SQB Well hello.E So first off can I call you Squeeb? Or SQB? Or?S Well actually most people refer to me as my forum name. My game name is RTMoose. RT or Moose either one of those usually.E Okay I will refer to you as Moose then! So because I mainly know you from the reddit forums Ive seen you around there a lot whats your favorite stupid question?WINDOWS FAILURE SOUNDSMoose sigh ...oh sorry you broke the bot I had to reboot there for a second. There are no favorite stupid questions.E laughs Thats good. Also unfortunate because I like stupid questions. So how long have you been following Star Citizen?M Oh well I found out about Star Citizen from one of my really good friends. He came in all wideeyed telling me about it and I guess it was right at the beginning of the Kickstarter?E Nice.M I think hes a golden ticket holder so he was actually signed up for the prelaunch. And I was like Yeah Im pledging for that. And then it slipped out of my mind for some reason or another and then he came back to me and reminded me about the last day. I think my pledge date is the th of October of ? But like right at the beginning.E So how long have you been uh...Im not gonna say trolling but...intimidating the subreddit for Star Citizen?M Well Ive been there from the beginning I guess too. But you know I mostly lurked for a long time because I was on the RSI forums mostly but I got banned from there. Then I started becoming a little more active on reddit. And I dont know my personality I guess is I have very short patience for people who sort of expect other people to do things for them. When you have the magic of Google at your fingertips and all you need to do is at the top of the Chrome browser you just type whatever question you have right there youll find someone else has asked it you know? I just feel like reddit is a discussion forum. It should be there to talk about things you know not ask people things that have been asked a thousand times before.E Definitely. You had a question I think it was today I really thought it was a good discussion you brought up. If CIG are afraid of their players? I think it was?M chuckles Yeah no sometimes Ill just ask a question to see what kind of answers people are gonna give. Its not that Im like trying to troll its that Im trying to get a gauge of just what casual responses are gonna be to certain ideas right? Sometimes its like part of something that Im gonna bring up in another thread thats actually important. I just feel like a lot of times a lot of game companies especially when CIG goes from Yeah were gonna get  million dollars and build this sort of skeleton of a game and they get a whole bunch of money and have like  million dollars and  studios or whatever it is right now and all this stuff going on. You know theyre like Oh my god we have a million people watching everything we do! Oh god what do we do? Thats gotta be terrifying you know? And thats sort of the point these guys theyre not experienced in this they dont know what the hell theyre doing theyre not EA whos got like a multimillion dollar PR department that tells them exactly what they can and cant say. Theyve got a bunch of devs running around saying Oh yeah were gonna do this! and everyones like WHAT THE DEVS SAID! you know?E But like even bigger companies like EA no ones really done this kind of interaction this early into a game. Except maybe Minecraft.M Exactly like Minecraft DayZ. But look at DayZ the guys gotten so many people to pay for that game and its still not reallyE Done.M I know exactly what it was with this game its just simply the fact of the matter that Chris Roberts you know all the people who played his games are of an age now where they might have a little extra money and they remember that shit and theyre looking at console games and theyre like you fuckin asshole you ruined it. And he comes in and he like I wanna build this. Remember this game? Remember doing this? Well Im gonna do this! and youre like Fuck yeah!E Exactly! Im right with you there. Im doing this because Im just as excited about this game. So what do you wanna do in Star Citizen like when the PU launches? What are your plans?M The first thing Im doing is Im going out F Lighting hunting. Because I know theyre gonna be out there and I know we can get them so were gonna go out and get ourselves some.E Thats pretty good actually one of the guys on INN CmdrCruisinTom has the same plan. Hes trying to arrange Lightinghunting parties.M Oh and then theres a couple people Im gonna try to find I think. Just have a couple conversations.E I wont ask why. So whos your favorite person from the subreddit that you can think of right now that tends to go unnoticed? That isnt as big a name as SQB or Nehkara.M I think probably MrHerpDerp. He always has insightful things to say. We started off as with most of the people who I get along with really well now especially online we started off butting heads. But hes definitely got a good head on his shoulders hes a decent guy for sure.E And thats something that I think is really important is that even if you disagree with some people on the reddit lots of them do have good ideas and its easier to get along with those people because they want the same thing that we want right? They want the best game possible.M I can get along with anybody as long as I feel that theyre saying Okay I get where youre coming from I understand your position however. People who either dont even read what Ive written because if they had read what Id written they wouldnt be asking these questions or asking me right? Its like if all youre gonna say to me is ask me some question about what Ive written here and obviously this is my point if you dont understand what Im saying just tell me that and Ill try to explain it to you again.E So Ive noticed especially in the last few weeks actually youve been softening your stupid question botness on reddit and people seem to be softening their stance toward you as well. Im not seeing quite as many SQB downvotes. To what do you attribute this change of your cold metal heart?M laughs Well one begets the other clearly. The power of the words you use its pretty unbelievable. I could write something one way that comes across snide and sarcastic and I could write it another way which just is what I need to say to get my point across. And one will get  upvotes and one will get downvoted to oblivion just because people dont wanna see that. And I get that. The problem is that the kind of way that I am comes across really well in person. People always find me really find me funny and amusing and even though Im a bit of a dick in person it works you know? But one reddit when youre just typing you cant really communicate that so its kinda tough to alternate between what you need to be like when youre typing and what you need to be like when youre actually dealing with people face to face you know?E Definitely. So ships! What ships do you have in your hangar? And whats upcoming that youre excited about if anything?M Well I want the Herald to be flightready so I can crosschassis it to all the other ships Im trying to finish my fleet out with. Ive got a Super Hornet a a a Constellation Andromeda and Ive got a Herald and an M. The Herald Im gonna swap up to a Gladiator for the LTI.E Are you gonna pick up some Reliants when they come out for the LTI on those?M Probably yeah.E I think thats gonna be a good sale. So yeah Star Citizens development so far. What are your thoughts on its progress and on where its gotten and where its going?M Its like were watching a teenager learn how to drive for the first little while and now it seems to be going a lot smoother but you know for the first little while there was a lot of hiccups and starting and stopping and a lot of Oh we did this whole thing wrong and now we need to start from the beginning again. And this is what happens when they start one project and six months into it theyre doing an entirely different project they werent doing.E Yeah because on the Kickstarter it just started as basically just a single player with the intention to expand it later if they could. And then they made more money that most people can count. M I think theyre incredibly lucky and the talent theyve gotten for sure. The fact that Crytek is losing all their guys in Frankfurt that is just the light shining down on these guys saying you lucky dogs. And theyre gonna totally help them round out all the things theyre having problems with hopefully and Im confident. They seem to have guys that seem to pushing it along quite well and Im confident.,starcitizen,cqk25xh,12,t5_2v94d

3758595,0,t3_33gpo8,. Functionally infinite with the bit floating point implementation. You wont get approaching simulation boundary on your HUD.. It wont work based on sectors. The instances are the abstracted way that they deal with ships in a local area. You wont notice a change from one instance to another. The only noticable change is that you wont be sharing an instance if its too crowded i.e A large population centre or fleet of ships.. We dont know yet and its very hard to say at this stage. I think they are aiming for  ships obviously multiple players in those ships.. No idea. All we know right now is that there are reserved slots for enemies and strangers so you and your buddies cannot fill an instance and fly safely.. Instances have no boundaries. If you move your instance will move with you spawning objects and colliding and fusing with other instances as you go. Players will not pop out of existence when they leave an instance unless they log out theyll leave radar range and no longer be detected.I guess I should clarify. Dont think of instances as sectors of space which are divided up to help server load. An instance is more like a  dimensional picture frame that determines what you see in the local area and follows your movements. Picture frames belonging to individual players can overlap causing the instances to fuse. They can move into an area with terrain like an asteroid field derelict space station or planet. They can get too busy for the picture frame so separate instances divide to reduce server and GPU load.I hope that makes sense.,starcitizen,cqkph0r,6,t5_2v94d

Which in turn includes the MMO experience of the player base who share the game with you.I wasnt really trying to say that SCs popularity was essential to the games longevity of course thats obvious.

These D representations sure are nice and probably helpful for recognizing the shape of a weapon but its the stats that matter. CIG should design these interfaces for use in the PU where I believe well be able to tweak our equipment. I dont think every single modification will have an impact on the appearance of each weapon which means that weapons with an identical appearance could have very different stats.

Youll get much better performance using a single  than having both enabled.As many have said this is an Alpha.  No one should expect perfect optimization for any system spec at this point in time.  As to your point about raising money than fixing the game you realize they have over  people working on the game?  Not all of them are engineers.  There are many artists and marketing and authors who can create the concept sales all while the engineers are fixing bugs.While your multigpu bugs seem a high priority for you I think their net code bugs and back end multiplayer match bugs are a slightly higher priority.

3799410,0,t1_cqpasa1,I dont know if you played Freelancer but the ENTIRE universe had one type of cargo transport NPConly that compared to any of the HULL series at and above the HULLC.Their playercontrollable freighters could handle no small volume of cargo but it still felt stiff. Even the mods that opened up additional volumes and transports were limited by the core mechanics. This is pretty glossed over it but its not pertinent to the vision of Star Citizen.The thing that brings the critically real angle that would provide the universe with an playerprovided economic pulse that Chris is aiming for with these is the ability to not only provide the transport of goods to and from Docks tofrom the planet surface. This is the prime spot for HULLA amp HULLB. Warehouses in the same system. This is going to be mostly the role of HULLB and some HULLC freighters. Industrial worlds to consumer worlds. HULLD and HULLE will rule these routes. Industrial worlds to trade points. HULLD and some HULLE ships will see action as they are going to be feeding and bringing back the goods tofrom more outlying areas that have lower security. Trade points stations and prime points of system intersection at distance from the prime industrial worlds. to smaller stations worlds asteroid belts clans and such.      These can be points of use fordepending upon the security rating outfitting diplomatic relations in that area and moreupwards of a HULLC or D at the most.      HULLA and HULLB ships roles are going to be likely taken with the more reasonable ships such as the Banu MM Caterpiller and such. However their ability to become more than just a simple transport ship will likely bring about their usage as a mobile weapons platform.      The reason why I mentioned the HULLCD is due to their ability to handle more capacity than what the Reclaimer and Orion can and thus provide return of the savagedmined goods to a nearbyoptimal port. The HULLC will likely see more action of this sort but I can see both being massaged into handling the rough and prime target aspect. The HULLD and even the HULLE are not so desirable for this reason unless transporting common ores with escort. Id see the HULLE going directly to the industrial world that needs it due to its sheer volume though.braindumpMore specifically this system is comparable to giving us not only access to the commonly available panel vans tractor trailer rigs barges and aircraft that we see in space games and MMOs. Its also offering the ability to move volumes that are akin to trains that stretch for mileskilometers in length A jumbo cargo jets road trains cargo ships and the container ships that the HULL series was designed off of with a similar categorizationFor that reason the HULL is a cornerstone towards making the ingame universe alive.Key sources referenced from memory but not cited  ,starcitizen,cqpd246,6,t5_2v94d

3804116,0,t1_cqpw1xn,EDIT Woops forgot to talk about the turret the turret is two size  guns which is good but not great it will hold of ships. But if theres three on you and only one turret then its gonna get shot out first.Well no one has used it yet the ship is not released. but its a size  gimballed and a max of if you sacrifice the gimball which is pretty big for a ship that size the Avenger main gun is size .So its going to hurt a lot but dont expect op the game is meant to be balanced after all.But size  gimballed on a fairly maneuverable ship is very dangerous for small ships that cant continually dodge so if its more that you then they have a problem if its just you they can stay close and avoid your front.On the other hand a size  would be really good on medium sized ships like connies and caterpillars. They cant really outmaneuver you so they need to use their turrets and missiles. So now its a bit of a role revershal with you being the small ship moving around them.So it can do both just not at the same time.,starcitizen,cqpwek4,2,t5_2v94d

3805752,1,t1_cqpogfn,gtsimply because it shouldnt matter...once they made a billion dollars off of GTA V.See this reasoning doesnt work.What you have to remember is Star Citizen isnt out yet.Rockstar released GTA as a final product only then did they make their billion excluding obviously some preorder.The difference with Star Citizen is by giving them money we are funding development not buying a complete product although from buying in we will also get access to a final product which means we also do not know the quality of the final product.This is the ultimate preorder buy in.It would be like Rockstar making a billion off GTA  in preorders and sale of in game assets a long while before they actually released the game.With Star Citizen the worrying thing is how much funding do they need? Whenwhere do they draw the line?Over the last  months the only major content Ive seen for Star Citizen has been  very broken patches for Arena Commander and  sales for ship concept ideas not even tangible game assets yet.This is the difference.Making your money from a highly successful game is one thing.Making your money off what you tell people will be a highly successful game when that is still yet to be seen is something else.And no one is saying its wrong but its just unproven.Other funding projects draw their lines set their funding reach it and then stop asking for more money until the product is actually released.TLDRStar Citizen hit its funding far exceeded it and is being increasingly monetised without signs of stopping.Where is the incentive to finish a product if the money is poring in regardless?Should they draw a line?,starcitizen,cqq33va,0,t5_2v94d

3838323,0,t1_cqts14m,Very true but history can have its bumps and push backs in technology  Fission is already current viable and obviously has massive downsides.  And currently research says that Fusion reactors will work by heating water going through turbines etc to create electricityenergy possibly no the best for smaller ships. And currently it would cost about OneHundredBillion dollars to create one milligram of antimatter... so even a few hundreds years into the future the cost will still no doubt be a bit high I do like the idea though ,starcitizen,cqtsvsn,1,t5_2v94d

3842470,0,t1_cqu71l6,Well I disagree on the jump drive thing.  I think that is a nice hard line to define a class of ships.  Nonjumpcapable ships that have a defined parent ship is plenty of definition for such a term.     No other type of ship in the game is incapable of equipping a jump drive.  Single seat fighters can be configured as multi system or single system.  I also expect snubfighters to not have Hydrogen scoops to replenish their fuel as this has been referenced in the fiction the Cal Mason story.    I have no problem with other features adding on to complement this but batteries IMO arent really giving any added value. Im going to have to bribe and cajole people to fly the little ships as it is.  Adding further complication will cause people to say no thanks and just fly their own ship.     That said one other implicit benefit of these ships is speed and nimbleness.  Without bigger fuel tanks jump drives etc. snubfighters will be very fast and maneuverable compared to full fighters.  You can also likely get away with only carrying ammo based weapons since you will have a range and combat time limited by fuel.,starcitizen,cqu9xd2,2,t5_2v94d

It seems to me that they havent fully thought this part through and without some kind of API that would allow for out of PU transfers youd have to rely on real world fiat currency which is less than ideal.

3873486,0,t1_cqxed03,gt This isnt Eve there arent areas in SC that are unowned that players can take and control.I actually hope the opposite will hold true because then it would greatly lend to SCs longevity without needing to rely on artificially added DLC content. Eve has its problems yes but that game is also successful in large part because of the conflict politics and drama in nullsec. Something Chris would do well to not only permit but encourage. Dont get me wrong I appreciate a good story as well as immersion and all but that pales in comparison to the excitement I get from the idea of Organizations competing with each other often times violently for control of resources and stations and money while leaving carebears to their own devices in protected systems. ,starcitizen,cqxt6rq,3,t5_2v94d

3876025,0,t3_34u79o,I think using leaderboards to determine balance is a bad idea. In a game that is well balanced there will be a skilleffectiveness tradeoff for each strategy and in each situation. Also there is much more to Star Citizen than the arcade shooter that is Arena Commander in the full game youll need to consider reloading both hard ammo and missiles as well as maintaining equipment of all kinds.Basically balance is complicated. I wouldnt worry about it right now anyway Id rather have CIG focus on making assets than micromanaging an arena mode that isnt going to be reflective of the final game anyway.,starcitizen,cqy3mcn,1,t5_2v94d

Because as a programmer and developer I understand the development process.  I understand that at this point in development A LOT of things are subject to change.  Not to mention there are A LOT of contributing factors not implemented into the game that could affect any given setup.  Providing any kind of feedback on weaponshipmechanic is just pointless when eventually shipweaponheatenergycpushieldsammomechanicetc will be the actual feedback needed.  The other guy saying that the MouseOmnisky is fine wont be able to say its fine.  Did it change because of the feedback being provided today by credible people such as yourself? No.  Its because the development cycle is in progress and more systems have been implemented.

3882274,0,t3_34rqip,Great post and I have a few topics for discussion.  I believe the tests you sight are based on tests done at the Ames Vertical Gun Range  Theyve done some brilliant science there and I think you have too.  So correct me if Im wrong but these test arent in a vacuum?  Assuming that...In space there is no friction so when youre dealing with heat in your math you have to leave nearly all that energy in the round.  Since the round will only be in contact with the rails while at rest and maybe not even then it should keep one in the chamber its negligible.  Once its charged and fired it will never touch the rails again.  The gun wont immediately accelerate the round to that velocity either but would instead do so over a curve were it begins at  and then stops accelerating at X velocity...  I would really be interested to see some math on how long the round is in the barrel VS. heat radiation from the round while it accelerates in the barrel.  Beyond that coefficient no other heat would transmit from round to barrel.  In fact the only heat would come from conductors in the gun which should hypothetically impart most of their energy unto the round.  Which brings up thisgtthen youve probably just ark wielded a kg lump of metal to the end of the gunSince there is no air the round will maintain its shape to some degree.  It would turn into that soupy metal that smelting pots make.  The only thing that would perturb its motion is the flux of the rails Id love to talk about this more...the manner in which the round would leave the barrel could be tuned to make the round splatter or turn into a slug.  Very interesting projectile.  BUT it should never come in contact with the end of the gun otherwise you are mortally fucked at that point anyway.,starcitizen,cqyt9ij,1,t5_2v94d

John.JS  Do you want to start that again?JP  No I like that lets keep going with it.  So why dont you give I want a little backstory how did you hear about the project howd you get started on it?JS  I have known Chris for about a dozen years.  I was his president of production at Ascendent pictures when he took his hiatus from Gaming and became a filmmaker.  So I knew him then and you know I knew about this company from a continuing string of lunches when he was putting it together.  And then when the company came together he invited me in as a story consultant to work with Dave Haddock who was the only writer at that time to sort of craft the story for SQ and then maybe a year and a half ago I came on fulltime as head of linear content. JP  Yeah when I first got here the first thing you were working on was all the commercials thats what I remember you from. JS  All the commercials and the inside CIGs we did a lot of we did the runup to that first Pax East and we did a lot of the looks at Moon Collider and at Behaviour and you know so yeah.  A bunch of those.  But Ive sort of run out of time to do that because of the nature of the shoot and the fact that Im not here.JP  So you were with Chris at ascendant pictures.    JS  I was.JP  From there he kinda went back into games and you were like oh lets follow him?JS  well sort of yeah.  JP  Have you ever done games before?JS  I have never done games before so part of what I love about this gig is how much Im learning about digital technology and about how games work and how this whole process works.  Im much more interested in process than in product in general and the process of this is utterly fascinating. JP  So what made you originally just want to get into film?JS  To get into film?  jI had a whole other life in New York as a Bass player and somewhere towards the end of my Bass player time I read an article in the New Yorker magazine by John McFee about Nuclear Terrorism and I said theres a film in this.  And I sent it to a friend who was a screenwriter and he invited me to come to LA and write it with him.  He said yeah there is a film in this so we wrote it and we sold it to Fox and it did not get made but i was totally bitten by the movie bug so here I am. JP  I think thats the only time in the history of the world someone can say I got into films because of nuclear terrorism.  JS  It probably is.  Yeah.  Good point. JP  Ok so lets before we go out Ive got a couple of rapidfire questions.  Ready?JS  no.JP  Okay well wait then.  Favourite movie?JS  Fannie and Alexander.JP  Whats that?JS  its a birdman film.  JP  Okay whats your favourite movie that Ive seen?JS  Favourite movie that Ive worked on is FaceOffJP  Ive seen faceoff!  Faceoffs awesome.  Favourite video game?JS  Star Citizen I mean SQ  obviously. JP  Nice well done.  Favourite SC ship?JS  Mustang. JP  Mustang.  Why?JS  cause I made an awesome commercial about it. JP  you did make an awesome commercial about it.  Alright well thank you again for joinnig us.  I know the fans are really excited for the shoot and I know theyre really excited for someone with the experience you have JS  Well its going to be amazing.  What comes out of Ealing is going to blow people away I think. JP  Awesome.  Well thanks again and you just Met a Dev.  Thats my callsign I think.JS  I think it is.  ,starcitizen,cqzioyw,6,t5_2v94d

Its  for goodness sake and a bit more open mindedness would go along way.Its hardly closed minded to have only two options for gender since biologically humans overwhelmingly fall into those. CIG would be accused of being closed minded no matter what they did because they wouldnt include one piece of vocabulary out of the tumblr dictionary thereby being not inclusive to the one person who sexually identifies as a Platypuslawnchairnuclear aircraft carrier.

My advise buy a StarfarerG with LTI and a starter pack for the game it is not included with stand alone ships. The reliant is a newby ship and will be available soon with LTI. Then you melt your starterpack and buy the starter pack with the reliant no sure about that maybe the reliant will be only as a stand alone.After that if the Starfarer gt Conni doesnt come you can still melt your starfarer and purchase a conni back. And if the reliant come with a starter pack you melt your previous non lti pack and buy it instead. And when the reliant will be in game CCU it for an other ships.In the best case with a minimal cost you can end with your conni LTI and an AuroraMustang LTI.

3941818,1,t1_cr5l96w,gt there is precedent when the aurora coolers were broken they offered a loaner i until they fixed it.This prevented an entire ship from working. That is not what is happening in the Cutlass. In fact every Cutlass and every other ship flies fine with a Cutlass in the game. There is only network lag. Taking away the Cutlass not only appeases the selfish want to be able to play this PreAlpha version of dogfighting but restricts every Cutlass owner from enjoying their ship in singleplayer as well because you cant handle network lag. This is not a problem with the game it is a problem with how you want the game to work while its in an unfinished state.gt and this is a public alpha not a closed one It is not public. It is only available to earlybackers and those that buy the appropriate pass. Just because its easy to get into doesnt mean its public. It is still infact a closed Alpha. The only discrepancy is whether its considered Pre or not.gt supposed to represent the final game and attract new players certain standards should be adhered toThis is probably the most utterly incorrect statement Ive seen come from you SQB. AC is definitely not representative of final gameplay.  of the systems are not even implemented yet. The fact that you can monoboat lasers in a SH without losing power to your shields is evidence. Hell laser function in general is more evidence. Hint Space Superiority in the final game will not mean using all one type of weaponAC is to give us a very early idea of what its like and nothing more. The full game will not be SHs turreting up and shooting in a limiting arena. In fact that is probably going to be a hindrance in PU.

3949436,0,t1_cr5r5qi,Well I think people took all this too literally when what I intended to mean was that things in Star Citizen are not real but realistic instead i.e. plausible credible. Off course a game cant reproduce reality but it can become so credible that in SC case people can imagine themselves in the future piloting these incredible machines. In the case of other games designs are so far from reality that the effect of plausibility is lost and even if you can take pleasure in playing then you cant imagine yourself immersed in their reality and that really happens in SC well at least for me I can easily imagine myself piloting one of my ships. And as to the physics based gameplay well theres no need to get a NASA engineer for that since this is just a gaming concept that tries to use physics concepts or get as close as possible within gaming engines. Off course physics within games will always be limited but at least there will be the illusion of proximity to the real world and not a reproduction of the real world that would be impossible well at least with current technology,starcitizen,cr6gwz7,2,t5_2v94d

How important is LTI really?LTI just covers the base hullstock equipment. Youll still need to pay extra to cover custom fittings or any cargo youre carrying. Base hull insurance will be an incredibly small cost so LTI doesnt really matter at all.If you MUST have LTI you could always try rstarcitizentrades but expect to pay at least an extra  on top of the pledge store price.

We only have  ships at most on the live server but we know we will be dealing with more ships in the live game not to mention that there be many substantially larger ships. If I had to guess I would imagine that the lower settings would become somewhat easier to manage by the time the game is released while the higher settings will need the top of the line hardware of that generation.

The devs would control the actual website and it is on their heads if they do no implement password security because it is not in control of IT. If the server was under proper control of IT there are measures to prevent this but if the website devs do not add a password than that cannot be ITs fault.In your standard case of an onsite server with IIS I would agree with you but in this case I believe that IT has far less power than you make it out to be.,starcitizen,crkhvk1,1,t5_2v94d

Its more prudent to strike first and guarantee your own safety than risk an encounter that could turn ugly for you.Yes allowing the encounter to play out dangerous or not can allow for deep and enriching experiences but since it would put a players characterassets at risk few will take the chance.The only thing that can prevent it from becoming the norm is how policing in UEE space is handled.,starcitizen,cro6w1f,2,t5_2v94d

Deal with any potential traps.  If ship looks to good to be true strip it for parts to sell.  If not take it and screw any consequences.Or if you are simply asking if salvage operations are legal and my mind is too focused on being in the Verse then I think that there will be both permitted salvage and illegal salvage.  Specifically you can take some stuff but you have to return other parts OR you can  keep the parts you are supposed to return and sell them illegally for on the Black Market.,starcitizen,crocmyy,1,t5_2v94d

4130081,0,t1_crqnz07,gt First is the player driven economy. While the economy does have its problems I love the fact that a player can go out and mine a ton of ore then refine that ore into minerals at a refinery the minerals into partscomponents which inturn the player can use to construct a ship or components.There is the first problem with EVE I am glad they are not reproducing with Star Citizen.  Players building ships is much more inline with a fantasy RPG style of gameplay building your armor and weapons rather than buying them.  Its like buying a factory to produce  tank and then shutting that factory down afterwards it makes no sense.  Now building ships for the economy or other players makes equally no sense as it basically allows rich players to run off infinite copies of ships and then use them as they please that upsets the balance of power between players and the NPC government.  If you had the money to buy a factory and made nothing but Assault Vehicles  which you gave out to friends criminals or basically anyone youd get in trouble with your local government.EVEs run away inflation is also a serious issue which is directly related to the fact that large groups and players can basically just ignore the economy entirely and build their own fleets with their own resources.  That leads into your second part.gtSecond is player controlled lawless systems outside the control of the governmentBy doing this you effectively remove the player from the economy but not the economy from the player.  It means that more people will have more money and not have to rely on the economy that exists in the game run by the NPCs.  The only way to fix that is to require players to maintain control and supplies with out a player driven response basically rely on NPCs to maintain your area and force you to have a more magisterial role. ,starcitizen,crr1x5d,-1,t5_2v94d

4204665,0,t3_38u4xu,It does not appear that we will be able to change an engines size beyond the max hardpoint size but swapping out for engines with better output heat reduction or tuned for performancr will all be things. This basically goes for every. Componant. Your mission computer will output X amount of cpu cycles and all your componants will require cpu cycles so if you upgrade parts until their total cpu requirement exceeds your output. Youll melt your Cpu. These are the kinds of things CR wants us to considerworry about. Its gonna be deeper than just plugging in the next best item.,starcitizen,crzisj6,1,t5_2v94d

4213843,0,t1_cs0jwuy,Both not mandatory for the PU alpha in my opinion at least not the multicrew stuff but neverthelessWe kinda have the socioal module already. Were able to manage a friendlist and chat while flying around in space or walking over the landing pads. Fair enough they need to add a few extra hud informationsmenusdialogue options etc. But I guess this work is rather simple.For me the PU is just a combination of flying around in space getting to a specific load the next map marker which will then trigger a landing zone. Walking around in the landing zone you can use shop interfaces to configure your loadout and buysell cargo. The simple path for CIG would be to just rely on static interfaces for the whole landingzone part.By taking this path they can easily release something later this year claiming it to be the first basic iteration of the PU alpha.,starcitizen,cs0ka1r,1,t5_2v94d

I think the main problem was that they had a targeted delivery date of their game for August of  for what basically was described as Arena Commander.  They also didnt have any gameplay footage to show at the time of their AMA so that was a terrible plan.Also kind of a funny thing they had stretch goals going to  MILLION from a k start.

4229909,0,t1_cs1yuqn,Umm have to disagree with you here Mate.  Aircraft in WW were way too slow by comparison but the number of unnecessary guns would fit.  Also the fact is that if we havent gone to using gimbals on fighter craft now we arent going to use them  years from now.  Gimbal guns are found on helo gunships because they are used to target slow moving armored targets or other helos and not fast movers.  Its just the right tool for the right job.  As for the flight system well I agree with the assessment that the maneuvering thrusters have turned flight into a twitch fest.  The way it is currently after every fight salvage people would be picking up whole ships cleaning out the mess left on the inside and then sell the ships at a  discount on the interstellar market.

Hes had years of experience doing actual movie shots and of course he is the one who did the Wing Commander movie shots too. I see it as him doing his job.With that stated while there has been a crap ton of shows that have come out from CIG the quality of the information has gone down substantially. Lets not even talk about the countless repeat questions shifty answers or diverging away from hot topics.I also totally agree with you on some of the developer statements. Hell during last controller round table they said Everything can change we are willing to redo it all from ground up in how they work then a few days ago Calix in the same vain stated flight  aim for mouse might be here to stay...That is just the most recent example.What I am worried about is scenario  Them spending all this money where graphics are amped up to  but gameplay is shallow as a puddle. Honestly the AC gameplay is like Decent which is FPS but with space ships to me there is no depth or skill in the current way things are in AC.

4349382,0,t1_csfr305,I want to see the Genesis Starliner and if I was in a wealthier financial position I would pledge for one  delaying things wont make me happy so your hypothesis fails. Or are you only thinking of yourself and the people who agree with you when you say everyone? Make sure you actually have consensus before you try and speak for everyoneand you dont here.It wouldnt be making the devs and CIGs contracted artists happy either according to Ben himselfgtno one is happy to have a concept sale before weve delivered a major patch... but because the two things arent logistically related its hard to keep pushing one away out of respect for the other. If you follow our regular cadence youll know we were scheduled for the next concept sale several weeks ago. We opted to push it back and spend the time creating some additional resources concept images design explorations etc.... but here we are with that content being finished off and waiting to go out and other work in line after it that needs to be addressed. gtWould I rather release the Starliner after FPS hits? Absofluffinglutely! It would probably mean more support from happier backers... and you wouldnt have any of this sturm und drang that risks overshadowing folks just enjoying a pretty cool ship that a lot of people put their sweat and tears into. But the reality is that delaying concept sales forever cant work existing ships will pile up well lose contract artists whod pick up movie projects if there werent another concept for them... and to be perfectly honest at the end of the day we have to keep bringing in some amount of revenue to operate the way we are right now. Thats not because we havent raised a heck of a lot of money... but there are a number of fairly dull business reasons why it has to continue in some way the largest has to do with per my understanding credit... anyone remember how hard it was to secure the lease in Austin with such an odd business model?I cant help but see the vocal minority that are trying to dictate CIGs development processes as noisy selfish kids. Delaying concept sales will impact development more than temporary brattiness from a small segment of impatient backers will.  CIGs going to get hate no matter what they do because you dont have to know anything about game development before pledging and so there are a lot of backers with overinflated expectations for the current stage of development.,starcitizen,csfwohj,1,t5_2v94d

AC is a testing module this is why they release the modules to test certain features not to give out content to please the fans. And its a way for us helping improve the game so the features wont be broken or not fun on launch. It makes us help shape the game. We give feedback they have usually responded and either give us an answer or fixed it.And missing a release deadline is so fucking common in the game industry! And also it many industries in general. Its one of the hardest things to judge on beforehand. And its often because of bugs that takes alot of time to fix and its really common in large games.

4361384,0,t3_3ay810,From just my emotions as a WingCommStrikeComm fan when I saw CR pitch in the beginning I believe he was trying to create a space sim game that does what we have always dreamt of doing as space sim fans and he starts fulfilling them more and more as funding increases!This is how I feel at each phrase.In the beginning of SC with simple expectations and as a spacesim fan I have always wanted. Able to takeoff and land ourselves without animated sequences. Instead of briefing room animation switch to suit up and launch animations!. Walk around the star ship aka space carrier freely and see things happening around us walking to bridge briefing room sleeping quarters interact with NPCs watch ground crew moving about and repairing etc.. Great and engaging story line like all the commander series.. Bring in friends to help you in main storyline missions so you need not partner useless AI wingmen that let you do all the dirty work. . Get a friendNPC to help you with tasks in a single ship multi crew instead of doing everything yourself.As times goes on and more money poured in I feel CR felt he is now able to expanding all space sim fans fantasies at least some are mine. Since we have online to get friends to help out why not go multiplayer dogfighting aka AC since so many people loves CounterStrike and just playing on fixed maps.. Why not create a Freelancer universe with sectors and planets and let people trade and explore and interact? To be different lets put in effort and make it PU.As MORE money came in we are expanding even further spacesim fans fantasies mine at least. We always wanted to see what alien cities space stations planet forest are like instead of just flying over and near them so why not firstthird person which can move around the locations enter shops or forests or caves... etc.. And might as well throw in a shooter and have nonspace sim missions too! That puts an additional dimension to troop transport missions in spacesims you get to be the troop! . And finally interact with things around you grabby hands this one I dont really care.

However they have also had  years of development time and while things are ramping up in speed and they are getting even better I would rather they reassess their loose schedule now in a well thought out letter with some better SQ  footage and images out of context so its not a spoiler. Something that shows off the work really indepth and makes sensationalist click bait articles fall apart if anyone actually reads it.SQ  needs to be the best it can be and it wont be rushed so why pretend for a second its going to meet projections  I mean with the amount of footage CIG has just shot on set  if that was to be a movie how long would it need to be in Post before being released  now apply that to a game and we all know SQ  isnt going to make it this year at all.Im happy to wait  But I am sick to death of handing detractors and trolls ammunition on a silver platter when you can just throw out some in your face stuff with a bunch of never before seen footage and images to shut them up. ,starcitizen,csvul3e,4,t5_2v94d

We might as well throw it up as an option for the backerdecided ship polls if it does well then we can make it playerflyable.Well the ship got voted in so now we are working on it. We are going to have to fully flesh it out for flight now rather than it just being an NPC ship so it will take some time. Well call it the Genesis Starliner. It will be used to move people around!Who would have thought that carrying passengers around from point A to point B would be boring? Looks like we need to design some stuff to make this gameplay actually fun. How about a bartender minigame? Yeah that totally belongs in a space sim. Build it! That wont be enough though lets also throw in a mechanic where you have to repeatedly replace spare parts that look like servers. Were in this minigame thing deep enough already why not go whole hog right?You know what if there are people who dont want to do that minigame stuff? Maybe we should make some variants of the Starliner for other purposes I mean it isnt like we have tons of other features we already need to be working on. Lets get thinking on those variants!

4537680,0,t3_3d6nyt,IIRC online portions of games are often not rated by the ESRB due to the fact that the devs cant control what their players say in chat and do in game  of the time.  The exception to this rule are games that need to be sold as disks in stores like Walmart and Gamestop because they only sell games with ESRB ratings attached and that are Mature and below.  Star Citizen will not be sold in these stores so it should mostly be a non issue.  That being said they probably want to keep the door open to allow for future possibility of selling disks in these types of stores.There is also no reason to add gratuitous violence sex drugs and other adult themes just so they exist.  Take for example Hatred not a very good game that was banking on just pure shock value to get players interested.  Making the game a murder simulator doesnt make it good good designs and good story make them good.  I dont think CIG wants to make Star Citizen a hug box they just want to question if you need  hookers hitting you up for sex on Nyx or just  outside a strip club trying to attract customers.  Both are adult situations but the latter gets the point across with out hitting you over the head with it and stays somewhat classy.  ,starcitizen,ct2lt15,2,t5_2v94d

4551992,0,t3_3dep42,Sergeant Baxley cautiously peered down the empty docking corridor watching the closed hatch of the Diamond of Larcom with care. Her fireteam had arrived two hours ago after a call for assistance with a hostage situation came from Station SV. Captain Rays target Governor Sabine had taken the crew of his ship hostage after theyd refused to undock from the station. Due to the tenuous nature of boarding a docked ship theyd been forced to wait as workers had EVAd to the ship and attached additional docking clamps as well as disabled power to the engines through a few carefully sabotaged fuel lines. The ship was going nowhere and Sabine was trapped though he didnt know it. Has the governor made any further demands?Just the same as the last hour. He wants his ship released and a guarantee of safe passage to nonimperial space came Captain Rays reply over the comms.Beautiful. Do we have any live feed inside yet? Sergeant Baxley asked tersely.Yes. This particular constellation has a few security cameras installed as a safety precaution. Were finishing the hack now well be able to have a view inside in moments Lieutenant Makenos voice replied.Good. I want the feed patched into my HUD as soon as you have it. Baxley out.Sergeant Baxley turned to the three marines under her command speaking directly over their comms. I trust that all of you have reviewed the cabin design thoroughly so I shouldnt have to go over this more than once. This is standard procedure flash and clear emphasis on hostage rescue. As far as we know Governor Sabine has only one weapon a mediumcaliber kineticammunition pistol. Your suits are designed to take a hit from something like this but dont get cocky. A hit will still put you on your ass hard. Well be using lesslethal stun rounds in our primary weapons for this operation to minimize potential injury but you should keep your sidearms loaded with lethal rounds in case things turn sideways. We want to rescue the hostages priority one. Priority two take Governor Sabine alive. If he thinks he can escape justice at the end of a bullet hes mistaken. Oohrah?Rah sergeant! The marines replied as one.Go time in three kids. Strap up and tape down we want a silent approach.The marines huddled together checking and rechecking their kits for anything that moved or made noise. Once they were satisfied they grabbed stun rounds out of the ammunition box theyd humped to the impromptu command center and loaded their weapons. Sergeant Baxley checked her own kit taping down a few loose bits of material and then waited patiently for a call from Lieutenant Makeno.She didnt have long to wait. In a corner of her hud a small box opened up displaying a live camera feed from the interior of the Diamond of Larcom. The hostages were in a group on the bridge of the ship two of them kneeling next to a third man on the ground. The man on the ground lay in a pool of blood unmoving. One man stood apart from the group pistol trained on the hostages with his back against a bulkhead and a clear view of the approach to the bridge. Baxley grit her teeth grinding her molars together as she assessed the situation while Makenos voice filtered through her comms. Sergeant the man standing apart from the group of three people is confirmed to be Governor Sabine. As soon as youre ready on your end were ready to begin as well.Weve just been waiting on you Lieutenant. Leave it to the chair force to hold the ground pounders up eh Sir? Baxley said with a smirk.Same as it ever was. The mission is yours Sergeant. We move on your call.Roger that Baxley said turning to her fireteam. All right weve got a live feed inside the ship and our hostages and target are in the bridge. Hostages are on the ground sitting or lying down target is standing and armed. Hes on the left side of the bridge back to the bulkhead with a clear view to our entry point and hes armed. Less than ideal positioning but a flashbang will sort that out quick. Ill take point. Corporal Bough take drag and watch our asses. Lancecorporal Dilkey take left side Private Hitts take right. Dont forget to check your corners. This isnt a standard constellationclass ship so we may have some surprises in store. Hopefully our fine friends outside will help with that. Oohrah?Rah Sergeant!Seal up and move out marines!The marines tapped commands on their suits as one sealing the pressure seals on their helmets and activating their internal lifesupportstandard procedure for boarding actions. Sergeant Baxley led them on the short jog down the docking corridor to the hatch of the ship pressing herself against the hull. Her three marines stacked up behind her tapping shoulders to indicate readiness. Baxley waited for the return tap and then keyed her comms. Lieutenant we are go.Loud and Clear Sergeant. Tactical EMP away detonation imminent came Lieutenant Makenos reply.A second later the ship and the outside corridor went dark with a flicker and pop of static discharge. The hardened HUDs of the Marines helmets and comms stayed alive. Pushing in! Sergeant Baxley shouted moving to the hatch and popping open the cover on the manual override. She gave the toggles inside a quick pull activating the hydraulic backup systems to the door and then stepped back as the door opened with a hiss and a cleansounding whine. She tapped her HUD activating the builtin IR vision and the compartment ahead popped into view in a haze of grays. She turned on the infrared lights built into her helmet brightening the area further and then pushed in weapon up and sweeping right towards the door to the bridge. The fireteam moved on her heels each member covering their assigned sector. They stacked up at the door to the bridge. Baxley readied a flashbang grenade and waited for the tap on her shoulder to let her know the fireteam was ready. The tap came and she pulled open the manual override and pulled the toggle switch. As the door opened she pushed the primer on the flashbang once setting it for a onesecond timer and then threw it into the room. Flash out!,starcitizen,ct4egf2,3,t5_2v94d

That way things are scheduled in a way that is logical to human biology even if days on other planets are very different  especially for spacers whose clocks are wholly artificial anyway.That being said Im hopeful that there are also local clocks and calendars for other worlds so that the daynight cycles make sense.

I think they said its currently only like  more damage or so they didnt give exact numbersand I believe thats likely to go up but probably not straight doubled each size increase. they also intend for gimbals to require more power and limit its movement radius to smaller than it is now.  but really this topic has been covered x. and obviously you paid no attention to the BTC episode. ,starcitizen,ctdehtb,14,t5_2v94d

4626000,0,t1_ctdicf5,Huntokar I would like to point out a few things that I find a bit disturbing about this... please feel free to correct me if Ive misunderstood English not first language.  Isnt embracing the notion that a player that buys optional equipment should give them an advantage and this is acceptable.... go against the very core of what the word balance means?For example I own head tracking in the future VR full dual stick and dual throttle plus rudder pedals as well as voice attack. Does this mean that CIG is telling me hey grats for affording all this stuff... youre obviously welcome to have severe unfair advantages against those who do not ?Even though I own all that I would expect this game to not give me that much advantage or any if possible within reason. I would expect my head tracking device to not be allowed to aim gimbals just be used for views and I know from  years of ww flight sim realistic flight sims at that play as a mouse pilot then a stickKB pilot and finally with all that kit...that I have very little performance advantage over someone with just a mouse or a regular stick and keyboard. The only thing I gain from using so many other peripherals is immersion and fun... but it does not automatically make me a significantly better pilot than the others.  Last I checked A mouse has X and Y axis very much like any basic joystick has. The only difference flying a ship with either is the nature of the hardware itself and the fact the joystick autocenters which WW sims solved that problem for mouse pilots  some years ago..why hasnt CIG?. More expensive sticks and HOTAS setups like the warthog have XY and Z axis for flight and the throttle stick...then its just a whole bunch of buttons and switches. It has the same extras vs a mouse as it does vs a baseline joystick. But a keyboard provides over  buttons to use which is a lot more than the whole warthog hotas provides. No you cannot count keyboard plus hotas because hotas is literally hands off the keyboard. If you take your hand off a stick that stick ceases to count. I know from personal experience that a baseline joystick and keyboard do not put me at a disadvantage vs a warthog pilot. You use your stick buttons I use mine plus keyboard buttons. The only place where the stick makes a difference is in axis control and we both have X and Y which are the primary ones.. Z I can do with the keyboard in ww sims rudder in star citizen roll and while yes there is a tiny disadvantage in the Z it is not game changing. Certainly not like interactive mouse vs relative mouse. The solutions you list are literally assuming only mouse pilots will use gimbals and only stick pilots will use fixed. For a game allegedly being built with so much customization it certainly looks like it is not the case if things are bottlenecked at the control input level. Slew rate as less point and click. Ok... what about joystick user using gimbals. Slew rate reduction screws him over worse than the mouse user. damage disparity between guns its not weapon damage based issue its input based issue. The mouse has an exponentially higher hit ratio as well as chances to shoot because it can wiggle all over the screen. You would have to make gimbal guns extremely low damage and fixed weapons do extremely high damage for them to be equivalent just on dps alone. Thing is by reducing weapon damage to fix gimbal weapons you also screw over fixed users that have to use those same sized guns. How does this get past you fellas? Its common sense. Gimbal instability is again something that screws over stick users when using gimbals. Stick users hold the fire button longer per shot than mouse users because we cannot adjust the aim as quickly. Why does CIG not take the true controller agnostic path? Its such a simple solutionRemove gimbal and turret control from pilots. When they use them the weapons lock to fire forward. Gimbals and turrets can be used by pilot if they use the gimbalturret mount that is autofire  extra gun size reduction. This way the pilot does not manually aim the gun he flies the ship and has the benefit of weapons firing at his locked target..pilot only squeezes trigger to fire them weapons autolead aim and shoot. Similar to . but without having to point nose to target. Autoaim uses absolute aim not predictive aim so you can fly to defeat it... a human manually aiming with a mouse you cannot. This makes all input devices fly under the same conditions when using gimbals and turrets. Crew can fire gimbals and turrets but not the pilot. Single seater ships like hornet get to use the autoaim system if they want to. Multicrew ship gets their niche benefits in gimbalturret use. and if that wasnt enough relative mouse mode remains the best mouse mode to switch to for aiming fixed guns and interactive remains the best way to fly the ship aimpoint doesnt shoot guns but flies the ship. Everyone is happy its balanced no one has overwhelming advantages. VRHeadtrackers cannot use their devices to manually aim. ,starcitizen,ctdohkj,7,t5_2v94d

First of all in relative mode if I want to make a long turn which Im doing almost all the time anyway I have to repeatedly move the mouse and lift it to the other side of the pad then move it again like in first person shooters. Joysticks just stay in the same place for the duration. Second I cant use gimbals any more which was the only thing giving mice any advantage over joysticks. In relative mode mice are just very shitty inaccurate joysticks that you have to move around much more.

Its my second job. My first job is I work for CIG and my second job is I work on the Connie. Shes all that Ive got.JP  Shes your everything?JC  singing Shes my one and only.JP  So how long have we been remodeling the constellation?JC  February I think? yeah Februarys when we started winding up the war machine getting it ready to go.JP  What was the impetus to remodel the Connie as opposed to other ships?JC  There were a couple of things that just werent up at the time so there were a couple things missing that we needed. We had a beautiful ship come out the Retaliator and I fell in love with that ship and I wanted all the ships to look like that so the quality bars set have to match it now. So thats been the main drive getting a more focused style to it make RSI feel like a company the ships all feel like they came from the same manufacturer and they have a purpose and a fit and they fit in the world and also making stuff simply look really cool. Cool keeps me in the game and keeping me in the game is immersion and thats what I go for.JP  So cool  immersion?JC  I dont want to get distracted by anything other than playing a sweet game.JP  What are some things youre doing the exterior correct?JC  Yeah exterior currently and then Chris and I will sync our files up swap so some of the things you can visually see on the exterior are actually part of the interior so we have to sync up make sure that stuff isnt clipping through his walls make sure the exterior is completely solid.JP  So if we go from the original model to now whats one thing you really really wanted to change and got to?JC  When i first looked at it when it comes to the nerdy side of modeling hardcore geometry and stuff there are  certain faces on the model that were improper. And what that is is a squares actually two triangles and thatll reflect light a certain way but certain angles like that which I call a folding square that doesnt light very well. So fixing that was proper and there were a lot of polygons that just werent they werent visible so I could delete them and put them somewhere they are visible which makes it cheaper and also more high fidelity more detail. Just wanted to bump it up take it to the next level the next bar.JP  So besides the Connie what else have you been working on recently?JC  Sometimes in a pinch Ill get pulled for specific tasks. I did recently the helmet interior trying to refine getting those done in a quick fashion having them look good having them match the exterior face of the helmet theyre attached to. So I did the full Outlaw set and I did the full Marine set for the last FPS demo and currently. Before that I did the buggy skins with the new paint tech that was being worked on in house. I think we might actually do it another way now an even better way.JP  Whats this better way?JC  Well the problem we were having im sure everyones seen the new damage system which is still I mean I work here and I just see it andJP  Still looks awesomeJC  Yeah Im spoiled by it. So once that came online it solved a problem for us which was before we had to do all the damage states by hand placing holes breaking out pieces and youd do that for a ship say the Hornet and you do that once. And then you say Okay we need a variant. And then you do the variant. And the paint would be just more geometry on top of that. So you have to go through all the damage states cut them all out it was compounding the work but now we have this shader generated damage system we can now we dont have to worry about that anymore. Faster and faster. As the tools come online she ships can be done faster and faster.JP  Well thanks so much for coming on I actually really look forward to the Connie and some of the things youre working on.JC  Yeah me too mate.gtShip Shape with Lisa Ohanian Vanguard One of the premier deepspace fighters. Its a powerhouse with thick armour and great survivability. It does trade in some maneuverability for that but since it can travel the full length of a star system without having to refuel its a good tradeoff. Its favoured by the UEE navy and many militias. Gurmukh has been doing concept art on the ship. His two favourite things are working on the seats and the escape pods. Chairs are similar to the Retaliator but on the Vanguard they slide into place in an interesting way. Happens for both seat. Operator has access to the turret and missile systems and an advanced sensor suite whichd give the ship an advantage in an asteroid field. Escape pod is in the center of the ship its a heavily armoured deepspace escape pod. Can fit up to two people has a variety of features for survivability. Radar system hibernation pods advanced life support and the ability to spoof a kill on many radars. Lisa likes the crawlspaces on the ship where engines coolers power plants etc are hidden. Keeps the ship space efficient. Gurmukhs least favourite part of the ship was stopping work on it. Thinks the interior is an incredibly interesting ship. Excited to be moving on to the variants though.gtBen and Sandi No Around the Verse next week as theyll be on the way to Gamescom. Livestreaming the event.

4700518,0,t3_3f831z,I think it would make sense if the larger ships were not necessarily slower just more... ponderous.  They should turn slower and accelerate slower.  I think it would make sense for very large ships to actually have a higher top speed due to the ability to mount much larger engines and carry a lot of fuel.  For example maybe a carrier has a top speed of ms but a linear acceleration of only .ms  so it would take around  minutes to reach that top speed. Whereas a fighter reachs theirs in just a few seconds.  Plus capital ships would be limited to turning just a fraction of a degree per second to avoid smashing the crew at the far ends of the ship or tearing itself apart.,starcitizen,ctn1f5e,1,t5_2v94d
4700856,0,t1_ctlm71q,Yes but your TEC itself wouldnt have anywhere to dump its heat so youve just shifted the problem. On earth the TEC is being cooled by convection of the air around it.  If you took the air away it would just heat up until it stopped operating effectively or melted.  In space the only sustainable way to dump heat is to radiate it away.  One theoretical option is to couple your coolant loop to a thermal generator basically a TEC running in reverse and use the generated electricity to power a laser to dump waste heat.  This would have the added benefit of reducing your heat signature because instead of radiating evenly in all directions youd radiate mostly in a tight beam in a single direction.In an emergency you could dump your hot coolant and replace it with cold coolant from a reserve but that would be limiteduse option.  People think of space as cold and in absolute terms it is the average temperature is just a few degrees above absolute .  However without a fluid to mediate convection its hard for heat to move around so things take a while to cool.  A lot of the bulk of a space suit isnt for keeping the pressure up or to keep the astronaut warm its for cooling capacity to keep his own waste body heat from cooking him.,starcitizen,ctn2y6u,1,t5_2v94d
4703756,0,t1_ctneq1c,Dreamcast is an excellent system. Was widescreen format relatively new for games back then and supposedly EA never made anything for it. It also won the most rugged console awardtest. Its literally more durable than your average game playing device.As far as Starlancer I played it more than some of those titles you mentioned aka thats a personal opinion. Game popularity  fun factor or innovation. By that logic Farmville is better than Star Citizen. The most innovative released Space Sim Ive played isnt popular at all Starshatter. Yet it has all these things you can do that you couldnt in say Freespace Starlancer etc. yet both wereare more popular.Again popularity isnt something that concerns more other than the games getting funding to be made. Beyond that I personally dont care and game popularity is mostly  beyond my control. This is why I want good mod tools SC might be a good game but still end up shutting down official servers in a few years. In that case would be nice to more easily make new content.I dont know why youre obsessing about previous Roberts titles anyway. Star Citizen is a pretty much radical departure from the other games. It literally is closer combatflight mechanic wise to Starshatter than Freelancer. They didnt work on that game either. Thats how different SC is have to compare it to obscurenonCR games. All those titles you mentioned are entirely irrelevant anyway and CR never mentioned them for inspiration. So basically sales figures and nonsimilar games have nothing to do with SC. Theyre not even doing a standard FPS its tacticalunified camerazerog mechanics. SC is already successful financially anyway. CIG has no debt and there are thousands of Battlefieldfps players waiting to join up when SM hits. Why do we need to talk about completely irrelevant RPGsmech games from the early s?

4746369,0,t3_3fxa4c,Watch YouTube videos by greyheadedgamer tactical advance teller.. Theres quite a few good YT producers covering Star Citizen. Then get a Freelancer package along with a standalone Merlin or Hornet. And enter Arena Commander. Youll spend hours getting eviscerated by other players as you learn to pilot and kill. Lots of frustration bugs and troubleshooting. Its not even beta yet. But I for one love seeing this game develop and enjoy AC. The FPS module will be out soon as well. Are you ok with pledging at least  dollars? Best cheapcombat ready package is the Gladius at  USD but expect to add other costs. ,starcitizen,ctstp82,1,t5_2v94d

4783982,0,t3_3gezdo,But the Scythe is exactly that  a Hangar trophy. Ben mentions it specifically  their rarity is their value with only  of them to ever be available and come with LTI. That collector value is what makes the Scythe desirable  its a badge of honor.The Glaive is in every respect the superior combat ship once its balanced. Sure it may be engineered with humanmade components but it was also engineered exactly from an authentic downed Glaive. Its obivously not a for absolute complete replica but its about as good as human engineering can do.This is the way CIG has balanced the availability of the Glaive for sale a they open up Vanduul designs for others to ownbuyrentb they didnt technically go back on their word about selling Vanduul ships again by spinning up lore about humanmanufactured Glaive reproductionsc they dont piss off Scythe owners because  authentic Vanduul Scythes w LTI is much more rare and valuable than  Esperia Glaive knockoffs even if CIG retroactively grants LTI to the Glaives.d the Glaive by default IS the superior combat ship because it is the next step up in the Vanduul fighter hierarchy with more armament.Honestly im a proud owner of both a pair of Scythes and Glaives and I think CIG did their best with making Vanduul designs available to a lot more people with the Glaive even if the lore reason behind it was somewhat...cheesy while keeping the rarity of the Scythe intact. If anything the visibility to the Scythe being the only Vanduul ship with LTI thats likely to ever be sold has made the Scythe even rarer than before.Aesthetically the Glaive being symmetrical looks much better than the Scythe imo but the Scythe NOT being symmetrical does give it a bit more uniqueness and character.

4785632,0,t1_cpqnpqy,Thought Id weighin on this although a little late. I just started playing again recently and switched to mouse due to stick frustrations. So Im currently experimenting with lead vs lag pips. Bare with me while I try to get this outta my brain.What I found was lead is far easier to aim with while using the mouse and gimbals. Reason being your mouse controls the reticle which directs which way the ship will turn. This reticle is also where your weapons are aiming. Putting this reticle over your lead pip will allow you to fire on the enemy ship whilst also steering your ship in a favoured direction. The further afield the lead pip moves the faster you steer.Alternately with lag pips you will be moving your steering reticle to adjust your pips to land on your target. Sometimes with a fastmoving target you will have to move your reticle further than the threshold required for a faster turn to place your pips on target. This causes some serious pilot induced oscillation. I find myself adjusting back and forth back and forth trying to get my pips on target but my mouse steering sensitivity curve does not match that of the target ships transversal velocity. If that makes sense.In addition to the steering curve being more conducive to target tracking using lead pips youre also reacting directly to a lead pip with a reticle that never changes where it is in relation to your mouse. With a lag pip the thing youre trying to put on target is also changing all the time. So thats TWO variables you have to contend with. Its like your muscle memory goes out the window when using lag pips on a mouse.And that I think is the logic behind why lead pips are the favoured options for mouse and gimbal users. I hope that made sense. But Im probably the last one to the party  months late and all...,starcitizen,ctxrodl,1,t5_2v94d

4790850,0,t3_3gieif,The biggest takeaway is that things will change. Im not by any means one of the oldest backers but Ive been around for a few years now and I can tell anyone interested in the game buy something that you like for the ship itself and not for its perceived role because odds are something else will come out that has the same role and then you will feel conflicted on whether the new one does it better.If you buy a ship you love based on how it looks and how you enjoy flying it youre much more likely to be happy with it. I own a Gladius as my small fighter its not a Super Hornet but I love the way it flies and I love the look of the thing. I actually got rid of my Super Hornet because having the Gladius made the SH obsolete for me because I enjoyed flying the Gladius so much more.Find something you like and enjoy it dont worry about what does what best because it is GOING to change between now and Persistent Universe PU,starcitizen,ctyfc2u,4,t5_2v94d

4797117,0,t3_3gkwq5,Ok we need to sort of caveat this a touch this is based on early information that too my knowledge has not yet been rescinded.Because of fuel scoops and CIGs idea of picking up fuel while you fly youll basically be able to under normal flight conditions haven almost no net loss of fuel  this is because of CIGs limp home mechanic where if you run out of Fuel you can switch on your beacon for assistance and limp home traveling at a reduced functionality.Fuel is used for boosting thrusters or excessive maneuvering  like participating in a firefight or needing to maneuver through an asteroid fieldgas field.Ok Cymelion ... So what does this mean?Well non existent voice in my head  it means that should you fly in a straight line with expensive long range scanners you could in theory locate a Carrack and reach them with the majority of your fuel  however you would be more likely to expend your fuel fighting them and taking evasive actions meanwhile and powering your systems like shields and weapons.So yes you can possibly detect the ship  fly to the ship and engage in combat  however that ship most likely will outlast you since they can shut down their power drains and keep their shields and weapons running longer than yours. So when you run out of fuel for thrusters and boost you become a much easier target. Which means if you try and escape the situation youre a lot further away from the more populated areas so youre going to be limping home and a vindictive captain of a Carrack just attacked might feel inclined to follow you slowly chipping away at your ship to remind you not to pick fights unprepared.Now your question relates to you being in the Carrack  so while you wont be assurred peace  if someone does turn up to harrass you unless they came with a spare Starfarer and a pocket carrier you should be fine. If they came out with that much stuff to attack a Carrack .... well youve probably done something to piss them off so you should be proud of that I guess.,starcitizen,ctz7rmy,3,t5_2v94d

This means it wont be truly as effective at stealth when compared to a stealth specific ship I hope they create one specific to this in the future however in what was known as missile commander these hornets were a pain to get missile locks on. They also have massively reduced EM and IR signatures compared to almost all the other ships meaning from a distance or in a asteroid field you would need to get relatively close to even detect them on radar.

Its more about routing your traffic so the IP the outside world sees is not your actual IP but the IP of your provider. People use VPNs to secure their traffic or networks like the TOR network to make them more anonymous using TOR by itself doesnt make you anonymous it takes a lot more effort to truly make you anonymous on the net. There are a lot of legitimate uses of such networks but they are misused at times. I use VPNs to secure my mobile traffic while on my laptop.

4870566,0,t1_cu8g9eo,Preordering in this case is quite a bit different from other games since this game is completely crowdfunded at this point. Preordering for a typical publisher is their way to gauge demand for the game. They get preorders from stores then ship out the number of copies of the game to the store  some padding for last minute pickups. The publishers include incentives with preorders to get you to lay down the money so they can plan their shipping. With Star Citizen there is nothing like this right now. There may eventually be but everything with buying packages now is going towards development of the game not marketing or a publishers bottom line.What you would do if you won a giveaway standalone ship is exchange it for store credit melt a ship is the typical term and then buy the package you want using that store credit. This is done by a lot of backers to get additional store credit so they can apply it to ships they really want a bit cheaper. You could sell the standalone ship on the grey market but its rather pointless since you will get the full value of the stand alone ship in store credit even after gifting. The one exception to that is the Mustang Omega as it has  value due to it being a promotional ship given away by AMD through codes. Do not melt that if you get it as you will receive nothing in return. It is the only ship that only has value in the grey market or in its ability to be converted to other ships via crosschassis upgrades note melting a ship that has been converted from an omega will only give you any value you added to the omega so melting an omega  upgrade to Cutlass black will only give the value of the upgrade to the cutlass black and nothing for the omega  in value in this case.edit handy link for CCUs  notice the mustang omega always has no value,starcitizen,cu8h06a,2,t5_2v94d

4906294,0,t1_cucwzyu,CIGs first multicrew demo was a Constellation against two Hornets FA which they described as being a pretty fair match up.  Id argue that a pair of Cutlasses assuming two crew per Cutlass and a few minor upgrades to bring their total cost in line with that of the Andromeda should roughly fare as well in that fight.  Whilst the Cutlass is not a match for a Hornet its specific advantages and disadvantages higher health pool and less manoeuvrability relative to other fighters favour it against larger ships since it can still massively outmanoeuvre something like a Constellation.  The ability to get in behind your enemy and tear up their engines is not something to be taken lightly and that extra health allows you to soak up the odd hits that the Connie does manage to get in.Of course a pretty fair match up isnt what a pirate is actually looking for but thats where you need to start in terms of balance right?  Assuming two Cutlasses have a  shot at taking down a Connie youd then want to bring three or four to actually be sure of winning the fight.Aside  Im basically ignoring the Merlin in all of this theorycrafting because the Constellation having a fighter escort even one that its capable of carrying with it radically changes the playing field.

Im assuming he is going after the contract and if he is then he will have to show case law where the court ruled that particular contract language used by CIG is not binding on him.  Even if he seeks damages .. what the hell would those be?  From what I have seen hes more Derek Dumbass than Derek Smart.  If I were working on the case there is no way I would recommend a settlement absent evidence that the court is siding with the other guy and will likely rule in his favor.  However is he asking for a jury trial?  So will a jury side with Mr. Dumbass?  I dont know but I wouldnt worry about the legal costs hurting development.  Mr. Dumbass has to bring a proper claim on which to base his complaint.  If that is not the case a good lawyer will get the case dismissed.

4951539,0,t3_3iq4xy,As someone who played and modded a hell of a lot of Freelancer heres my answers.Star Citizen especially with the mouse actually plays a lot more like Freelancer than most people will care to admit. I suggest you set your binds similar to what you had in Freelancer but keep in mind that youll want to bind a couple keys for rolling and be aware of the the different targeting binds. In general SC is more slippery than vanilla Freelancer and much more akin to the drifty and high speed  Flak style of gameplay.. Yes. Strafing is incredibly important. Some ships are better at it than others. It depends on the thruster layout. Its worth noting too that unlike vanilla Freelancer you can strafe in any direction at the same speed you can fly forwards.. After rereading your post Im not sure if youre referring to engine kill or reversezero thrust. Im assuming you meant engine kill based on the context of quick s. In Star Citizen its called decoupled mode and it does the same exact thing it did in Freelancer. The only real difference though is that when you go back to normal flight you come back in whatever speed you were carrying in decoupled rather than snapping back to your previous throttle setting. On a related note unlike in Freelancer your thruster button called Boost in SC doesnt increase your top speed. It instead makes all the thrusters on the ship more powerful including the maneuvering ones. This means that your ship is more on rails due to the increased thrust and more responsive to input in all directions and rotations.. Theoretically this is the only way to effectively employ missiles but missiles kind of suck right now in Star Citizen for too many reasons to get into. Theyve gone from horribly OP to practically useless and are due for a complete overhaul.. They used to work  of the time against Infrared and EM missiles but now theyre about  effective but you carry more and how effective they are depends on the positioning. In Freelancer it didnt matter where the CM was relative to you or the missile it was just a set chance. Here you need to have the CM in between you and the missile for it to work best.. Interactive mode is the same as flying with the mouse in Freelancer provided your ship has gimbal mounted weapons. Some ships use fixed weapons but most can swap between the two based on preference. The biggest difference between Freelancers mouse flight and Star Citizens is that there is a gigantic and debilitating nonoptional deadzone that makes flying with a mouse really janky and clunky compared to Freelancer. The only way to remove it is to fly with the weapons locked forward. There is no way to fly with gimballed weapons active and without the deadzone. Ive expressed my intense displeasure of this many many times but most people dismiss it and hate me for it because they think it means I hate joysticks and want to remove them from the game.I dont think I ever played on the Void server. Waaaaay back when I played on the Asgard server.

All you have to do is get close to the ship  in the flight path and the ship will automatically drop out of QD.I dont know if they plan on adding any modules specifically to make this easier or not because all ships will travel at .c so it doesnt seem like you can catch up if someone flies by. Who knows if they will stick with that though. I wouldnt be surprised if ships had variations in QD so that an interceptor could actually intercept like how they did it in EVE online.

4968652,0,t1_cukos7k,Exactly.  New media isnt much different than old media other than speed and scope and the contrast between print and television is historically analogous to the contrast of old professional gaming journalism via website and video or livestreaming amateurs.  In order to get a jump on coverage you need access and to compete with the journos years of experience and rolodex full of industry names you need an audience to get that you fall prey to the kind of mainstream industry conscription youre talking about what Id call the celebrification we end up with youtuberstreamers as gamerreviewerquasireality stars the way telegeniccult of personality culture always functioned in TV for decades just magnified in the era of the Kardashian.  Too much of the youtube gaming coverage I have seen is just embarrassing in a way you cant compare to websites with mostly faceless writers for this reason too many adult dudebros and kids mugging for the camera and Chiver girls all with their schtick trying for their  mins as hard as actually being some kind of reporter or reviewer.  Now its not as it remaining objective and navigating the minefield of industry attempts at manipulation and spin that beginners have to contend with is exactly rocket science you certainly dont need a journalism degree in order to start but as you show you have to be aware of the industry and sadly many youtubersstreamers are just unaware or dont realize at such an early stage in their experience just how compromised they really are until its too late even worse some willingly enter into the celebrification octagon unaware or uncaring of how much credibility they lose going that route. ,starcitizen,cuku3oy,7,t5_2v94d

Maybe they run into financial difficulties maybe theyre arse trying to harm CIG for their own undecipherable reasons jrg DS etc.First you cant tell each other apart nor indulge into every refund claim to see if its motives are genuine and even that is not CIGs matters. So CIG is bound to have the same policy for everybody and no question asked.Second there must be some kind of penalty behind a refund. Otherwise people would get in and out in a whim and youd had no stable amount of money to actually create the game. Office space servers energy wages contractors cloud storage taxes... Mind you paying a team like the one SC has costs in the million  per month. Either you have a no refund policy and expose yourself to legal action or you only refund  of the money and have to open the books to prove how part of the money was spent and expose yourself to legal action or you have a  refund policy but reserve the right not to deal with the claimant in the future.Remember backing up Star Citizen or any endeavour is binding.

It seems they have a baseline of expenditure for their in house staff and bills and use some likely not all of the excess to hire in additional temporary talent and contractors to speed up asset development. Its not a bad way of doing it  you have a solid financial baseline to work with towards your projected initial release doing it all in house but the more successful your crowd funding is the more you can snowball the development by getting in contractors.,starcitizen,cuq92uc,1,t5_2v94d

I also gave CIG  in subscription funding not ship pledges monthly subscription dues which I let them keep even after they invalidated  of the benefits of said subscription when they banned me interesting to note that they also never offered. I cant even view the subscribers den or concierge forums let alone post in them. In addition CIG has failed to accommodate my visit one of imperator benefits on multiple occasions.

At least according to the Gamepedia wiki Dilithium is timebased roughly  per hour daily cap of . I cant find anything about a current price point aside from a lot of comments around  dilithium per zen that translates to around . per hour which is significantly below the price point most MMOs charge. As a point of comparison if a  Constellation takes  ingame hours to earn that translates to an assumed value of . per hour. Zen also can be used to purchase cosmetics as well as a few gameplayaffecting options like bridge officers playable species and ships. Like most FP games there are some advantages available here. There are also some other currencies like energy credits reputation marks fleet marks goldpressed latinum and lobi crystals that all have specific uses.

5085073,0,t3_3knqit,First thing to keep in mind is that for now and the foreseeable future Star Citizen allows for the reclaiming of your pledge. What this is is once you have purchased a ship or package after  hours have elapsed you can reclaim that ship or package for the value at which you purchased it in store credit. You can then apply that store credit to a ship of equal or higher value paying the difference of course. The only thing you lose at this point is the ability to gift the ship or package to someone else as anything purchased in part or in whole with store credit is nontransferable. This allows for a lot of experimentation and is a pretty awesome feature IMO. Once you have a ship you can also earn REC rental equipment credits by participating in group activities. This may apply to solo combat as well but Im not certain. You can then spend the REC to temporarily rent other ships guns missiles gimbals shields etc... You only see two ships with AC access because theyre the only two flyable starters at the moment. You can add an Arena Commander pass to any package that doesnt contain it for ..In regards to stats Everything right now is in flux. There are no stable definitions for what the differences are between TR and  at the moment. As for weapons on ships and repurposing them Yes. As long as the weapon fits the requirement for a slot you can relocate it there. ,starcitizen,cuyy07s,1,t5_2v94d

You could take a crow bar and beat it until it looked like any other lump of metal you could fry it with a flamethrower or you could shoot it with an RPG and it still wouldnt go off.

Not surprisingly his game was widely panned while Freespace saw great critical success. Im sure there was legal action threatened for some reason or another. He pretty much became to the FS community what he has now become to the Star Citizen community. Comedy gold if you ask me. Several years ago there was talk of DS acquiring the Freespace license from Interplay. A collective groan was heard round the world followed by panic that he might actually succeed and take a huge dump on the spirit and legacy of FS.

5159665,0,t1_cv7uwc4,Thats how bullies and antisocial misfits behave.It wasnt enough for Accelerwraith to post that he got a response back to his FOIA request. No that wouldve been too easy. Instead he decided to create drama and the subsequent victimhood by starting this latest furor thinking that I was going to just ignore it. Especially since I know who he is. And he uses his sycophants to help him do it.I dont profess to be right I can be abrasive and I do NOT strive to win people over. Im just a guy who tends to try and do the right thing whenever I can.When I started writing about Star Citizen this past July it was only to point out what I saw to be serious problems with the project.I was right.Instead these people went on the attack. Pretty much the same thing theyve been doing even before I got involved in this farce.Yet despite the fact that everything Ive written has not only gained traction everywhere but has also exposed a lot of underhanded activities they continue to act like its just noise. Not to mention the fact that people who had previously tried to get refunds are now getting them more frequently than ever before.People like Accelerwraith continue to try and bury anyall dissent. Theyve been doing it for months now because they can and because they have victims they can push down repeatedly.Thing is there is always a slim chance that youre going to end up picking on someone ever more crazier than you.Despite all the evidence that this project is tantamount to consumer fraud all the underhanded bullshit see item  here and tell me youre not concerned that keeps going on and which I keep commenting on they still want to squash anyall dissentAnd the more they attack me the more noise they help make and thus draw more attention to the vaporware that is the Star Citizen project.And when it all collapses as I am most certain that it will given what I know they are going to be the ones trying to pin the blame on someone else. As if this would be the first time that a major project has failed.Ignoring me is always the best thing to do.

5180046,0,t1_cv9mcoz,Now THAT was well written and very informative. Also as I stated just a few minutes ago in the comments on my video regarding the FOIA request there is a very real potential that I had spoken too soon or I was operating under incomplete information which is even worse. If thats the case I may end up needing to either annotize the video stating that I was incorrect or pull the video entirely and redo it. If it turns out I was wrong I think I would simply annotize the video with a huge I WAS WRONG filling the screen as I wouldnt want to hide anything.Yes I have said I am trying to be impartial. Which is an exceedingly difficult stance to take as I have said before even to Derek Smart directly that I WANT SC to succeed. I am a huge CR fan from the Wing Commander games as well as Freelancer and Starlancer. Hell I was playing the Freelancer campaign just a month ago. But taking that into account I have to try and lay that aside whenever I hit that record button.You are absolutely correct that there is A LOT oc chaffe on Smarts blogs and no small amount of circular logic. So far the main talking points have been theseToS changing Yes I can verify that the wording of the Terms of Service did change. Is that common? No. Usually the EULA will get updated for a game or have its phrasing changed in order to better protect the company andor the consumer but ToS rarely get changed. Nepotism This could be true however CRs brother is an accomplished games developer in his own right and CRs wife seems to be doing a good job. As long as that is the case why would we care? Hiring people that do good work means you made the right choice.Failing to meet kickstarter pledge Technically DS is correct here. However would anyone be able to successfully argue that  years development  if they were already working on the game beforehand.. which I cannot verify or disprove cycle is enough time to release ANY game post? No I really dont think so.Movie Yes thats right folks. Theyre working on a movie. Now before you start going SWEEEEETTT!!! remember that this opens up a very real potential for concern if it is found they are using game funds for the movie.Money The original kickstarter raised what . million? The rest was raised on RSI via donations and ship purchases. So were looking at overall what can equate to a failed to deliver kickstarter where . million would need to be refunded. Thats actually true. They did fail to deliver on the promise. Of course there are myriad reasons why but numbers are numbers.Is SC too big? Maybe. You know there are MASSIVE amounts of content that needs to be created. A great deal of it will need to be added in postlaunch I think. Also without some form of subscription or FP model in place this game wont survive long. Ship purchasing alone cant be relied upon once it gets pushed out the door as Servers do need to be maintained and people gotta eat.So thats where Im at with everything. There are some real potential for concerns which is why I started these videos in the first place but I know that DSs blogs can be a difficult slog to get through plus I know how easily some people can be won over by glut of information... whether they be truthful half truthful or misinformation. You throw enough data at someone even false data and eventually they start to believe it. Its because our brains are trained to make sense of what they are presented with and everyone is susceptible.However just so you guys know that if Im shown to be wrong then you can bet your ass that I will own up to it make everyone aware of it and take precautions that any kind of mistake isnt repeated.,starcitizen,cvadvt7,2,t5_2v94d

5196654,0,t1_cvccbaa,Firstly issues with the code merge blockers may not have any  relevance to work being done on the rework of certain ships being conducted by the F office the office that is looking after the Starfarer and the rework of the Freelancer variants because the people working on those ships may not be working on the merge blockers.  You dont necessarily need the GameDev development stream fully functional and blocker free in order to do alterations to the models and textures.Secondly if we are to believe what theyve said then apparently the code merge has been done and theyre busy nailing the big blockers already and are doing a company play test this week.  Im guessing that the code merged GameDev stream has to be mostly functional before the FPS module is released.  So if they feel they are going to show off the FPS module either at the end of this month or at CitCon then that indicates the big blockers should be eradicated before CitCon at the very latest.  ,starcitizen,cvce2ch,3,t5_2v94d

Let me assure you I have played enough to be able to come up with informed constructive feedback. The fact that you and your friend Tazius think its futile does not even scrape me remotely. Especially considering that your argument is to keep it because someone could manipulate it back into the game. I am not thinking that inconsequential. I am advocating the improvement of core aspects flight and controls and not bouncing around them with politics. I wont be dropping a single tear for poor IMers to play your phrase if it means to improve this game. Moreover I am sure most would not even care if it means parity and fun. So I dont believe your protect poor IM users petition for once second.

It had better be true your credibility as a company suffers if it turns out you lied. But then if it were normal to say something positive if there were something positive to say what happens if there isnt something positive to say? In that case silence would implicitly suggest that there was a negative reason for a departure. In other words you either have good things to say or you say nothing which implies something bad.

5214047,0,t1_cveh9zh,Thank you for this.  I understand that he knows that he would be done in the industry and therefore I dont nor have I ever thought its a scam as some have been very adament about saying.  I dont believe at any point did CR set out to take the money and run that would just be...idiotic at best.  That being said my concern is does the vision exceed the reach?  Yes right now though there have been reports otherwise the development is going fine and they have funding available.  But this funding could dry up.  Now it will never no matter what come to a complete hault but if the sense of apprehension creeps in to much or if to many people just stop caring then what happens?  No one but those at CIGRSI know how much of the game and all of its modules are truly done but the concern is what if things did start drying up then what could they put out there working and more importatnly enjoyable?  This is the inherint problem with crowd funding though right?  But this becomes even more problematic with a game of this scope and at this point eyes on it.  What happens if a publisher has to come in and help finish things up?  Does that effect how people will view the game?  Will that change the scope of things?  What if things are held off not out of spite but rather need for DLC?  Would people be okay with this?  I know this is all just speculation but these are the things I cannot help but think about when talking about Star Citizen.  It just seems worrisome how much they want to do with ultimately amounts to so little time.  ,starcitizen,cvehi41,2,t5_2v94d

They can really make you travel as fast as they want so theyve introduced what is essentially an arbitrary speed .c. But dont want travel times to be ridiculously long so theyve shrunk the scale of the universe. Why wouldnt it make sense to double the speed of qdrive and double the scale?Maybe its just not necessary. Right now weve been told it takes  hours in the fastest ship to cross the Alpha map. However theyve just said last week that in addition to the .c quantum drive theres going to be three levels of intrasystem speed precision speed landingtakeoffmaneuvering dogfighting speed what we have in AC and cruising speed which is faster than dogfighting speed but nonrelativistic lol but we have no other information on. So now we dont know how long it will take to get from one side of the system to the other at cruising speed or even if cruising speed is constant or different among ships.

5256486,0,t3_3mvfjw,Easily.  I keep saying this but CIG is almost certainly not running the program as a direct burn operation from their crowd funding cash.  Thats financial madness.  The way it would typically work in a situation like this is that the lump sum of cash would be used as a form of collateral or even leveraged to secure a more predictable form of financing.    There are actually tons of ways this could happen.  The simplest way is that CIG puts the liquid cash into a managed account and then uses that balance to open a line of credit for business operations.  The lump sum would probably only be burned directly to make interest payments on this line of credit  if needed.  Read on.  It gets even more complicated though.  As CIG burns cash they area also developing IP and game assets.  How these assets are valued is actually the real question here.  Depending on who does the accounting the value of the IP and the brand could very well be growing faster than their operations burn rate.  As the combined value of their liquid cash and total asset value grows so does their spending power at the same rate of leverage.  Thats why you dont direct burn the cash if you dont have to  because this does not allow them to tap into the equity of their own IP.  Failing to leverage such a lump sum appropriately is just leaving money on the table.    Think about it this way  lets say that CIG puts the entire company for sale the second the game is complete.  How much would EA pay for a fully developed brand new IP M cash in the bank and a sustainable finance model for their operations including financing debt?  Obviously a lot more than M.  Probably closer to x that amount.  Maybe more.  ,starcitizen,cvjlf04,1,t5_2v94d

It didnt spend  of its budget on marketing it didnt require private investors and big publishers to become a reality. And this is what CIG is paying for now. Being independent and making it!  This is why EVERY PIECE OF TABLOID GAME JOURNALISM will bury SC in any chance they get. It is their agenda. They will bury the game even after release until it succumbs to their will.  I wouldnt be surprised if DS was working under guidance from a big publisher to cause massive damage to the project so said publisher would come to save the project from its failure by paying peanuts.  Chris Roberts is at a very dangerous place at the moment and he needs to be extremely careful of who he has under his employment.

Theres an aphorism I read once that when electing a Pope the person who least wants the job ought to be the one to get it the lack of ego and need for the spotlightapproval of others are things key to being a good servant of the public trust.  Thats quite lofty and pompous and not at all to be applied to game enthusiast bloggers but on a smaller level its vitally important for anyone with any kind of power to respect that power.  I see kids on vlogs on twitter on blogs on patreon and see often nothing more than an amateur hour grab for minor celeb status and to then attempt to monetize that status.  Obviously I think its disgusting a less telegenic reality TV star in action.  Now before this is perceived as a kids these days rant the most important thing here is its the swollen ego which enables anyone to try for exceptionalism like this in the first place and its loving the smell of your own farts which leads to a higher than normal perceived value of your own opinions making amateur hour statements in the public eye.  Its an abuse of that kind of access in my opinion a minor league version of the sort of nonsense we see in politics on a much larger scale as in the person who wants that job should not have it.

Your use of it is so bad that I doubt youll get very positive responses here from very many people.  Id guess most people cant even understand half of your wall of text.  I dont mean that as an insult just.. more of an explanation and to say maybe if you could spend a bit more time trying to compose your questions so they are more readable to your audience then we your audience might be more willing to put more effort into our responses.Now.. With that said.. I started the game with the  package.  I picked the Mustang Alpha because I thought it looked cooler than the Aurora.  I did the training missions and then hopped into Arena Commander.  While I wasnt the top of the leader board I had no problem playing mildly competitively and enjoying my game play.  I feel like Ive already gotten WAY MORE than my  investment out of this game especially compared to many other games Ive paid much more money for and enjoyed much less.This game is currently much more skill based then gear based.  While I admit a better ship improves your odds.  Theres plenty of people with Super Hornets that are beat by much less.Finally if you think  bucks is too much.  Then fine.  Dont buy the game.

This made me think that it would be really cool if you could build impromptu stations out of ships a bunch of docked ships serving as a minihub until they need to move. Maybe you could get enhanced docking collars for the hub ship so that they can hook up to a few at once.

The tough element to prove here is the state of mind  and theres no test for reckless disregard or negligence. Plaintiffs have to present a combination of evidence that tends to show some combination of failure to take reasonable care negligence bias poor research or poor factchecking etc. That may or may not convince a sympathetic jury.

5351817,0,t3_38pb1o,Update from September Monthly reportWe did cherry pick several improvements from the . SDK updates such as the Character Tool which simplifies character creation and animation setup. Along with this we integrated initial support for  weight skinning more finely accentuated animations especially on faces and character attachment merging to significantly reduce draw calls during shadow rendering. We plan to revamp these features to further improve the character animation and rendering pipeline.In the animation and physics module we finalized the lowlevel functionality for procedural hit reactions normal ragdolls driven ragdolls and blending in and out of ragdolls. We started to clean up the interfaces and the implementation in Mannequin so that the gamecode gets full control over all physical features. The functionality from SDK.. to create secondary animations on characters simulation of capes skirts hair etc was integrated and fully activated in the latest build. All functions and interfaces related to auxiliary physics were completely removed from the animation module. During The end of the month we started to modify the management of the physical setup for articulated entities so that each loadout can have a unique physical setup.,starcitizen,cvvr6n9,2,t5_2v94d

Check the FAQ thread under the how me pledge section.Put in the free fly code and see if you can get a discount package at the end of the promotion. If not get the aurora ES and an AC pass. That gives you the same level of access as the starter packages for  total. The discount packages are ..gtQ How me pledge?gtA Try before you buy SC is free to play in singleplayer with all currently available ships unlocked until October th Code CITCONFLIGHTK.gtThat code will probably grant access to the  discounted starter packages which are currently the cheapest way to get access to AC alpha.gtThen look at this Its missing a couple of flyable ships but will show you how the choice you make and the amount of money you spend depends on what you want to do in the final game and whether you want to pay more for access to the the beta release and alpha modules. More info The flynow page gives you a choice between Aurora MR and Mustang Alpha AC starter packs and you can freely swap between any Aurora MR and Mustang Alpha at any time using this and thisgtThe two AC starter packs are discounted by  for users that entered the SXSW and gamescom  free flight promotion code and will probably be accessible to users of the free flight code from Citizencon. The discounted Aurora MR and Mustang Alpha are marginally less than the Aurora ESAC Pass suggested below.gtRight now the Aurora ES package  is the cheapest way to get into the game in beta and on release and if you also buy an AC Pass  you can play AC alpha right now but not further alpha modules they will require another pass. This is exactly the same level of overall access as the AC starter Aurora MR or Mustang Alpha but without the option to swap between those ships for free because its an ES not an MR. You can always upgrade to one of them from the ES later for another .gtIf you just want to play the game when it releases you might as well wait and see if a cheap package becomes available like the Aurora MR Anniversary Starter package.,starcitizen,cvvww6f,1,t5_2v94d

5363393,0,t3_3ockrx,Nice video but theres a few points that I think youve got way off. Theres no way that the Sabre is going to outspeed the Gladius. Sure its got a better thrustertoweight ratio but ship speeds really dont correspond to that at all Plus I dont see why CIG would create two ships that fill the same combat role where one is flatout better regardless of price. In the description where it describes it as more nimble its comparing it to the Hornet which isnt especially nimble. The description also mentions that it will outmatch the Stinger in speed and turning. Considering that the Stinger is a heavy fighter I imagine that its not going to be any more agile than a Hornet so outspeeding and outmaneuvering the Stinger shouldnt require Gladiuslevel specs. Therefore Id expect the Sabre to be the middleground between the Hornet and Gladius in regards to both firepower and speed. My guess for speed would be . Add in the fact that its a stealth fighter and I think weve got an extremely powerful combination easily allowing the Sabre to be the new king of Arena Commander.,starcitizen,cvx8frj,1,t5_2v94d

My other preferences are to map strafe updownleftright on the bottom right side hat on the throttle back and forward on the upper one. Use the the right bottom hat on the stick for changing targets not strafe or you thumb will get sore.Also map the rotators on the bottom and top right of the throttle to strafe forwardbackwards and strafe updown. you will need to set deadzones to hotas  in the settings. This helps with spiralling and take offlanding.If you have a ship where you will be using strafe and boost at the same time then remap it from the default to somewhere else as you wont be able to hit both at once.Other buttons whatever feels natural to you.Edit Decoupled I map to the pinkie switch on the throttle its a switch onoff in SC you dont have to hold it down.,starcitizen,cvy3qei,1,t5_2v94d

5384667,0,t3_3os4d4,The blue beam shattered the pitch black of space lighting pristine and untouched rock that had not been seen by mortal eyes in eons. Johanson winced one brown eye closed as the bright beam intersected with a piece of matter burning it away and sending the remainder of the rock tumbling away. Rodriguez could you pay attention? Tractor that piece back into the main beam. We need to get this operation moving faster.Rodriguez seated to his rear and above him in one of the many turret tractor beams startled at the call glancing down towards Johanson. Sorry boss. Must have been drifting off.The tractor beam came to life grabbing the rock and pulling it back in line with the mining laser. The laser went to work immediately boiling away the material as Rodriguez expertly manipulated it with the tractor beam before pulling the remaining matter away from the beam. Johanson signaled one of the waiting drones and it flitted through the blackness of space grabbing the mass of rock and ore and shuttling it back to the waiting processor.An indicator light began to blink next to Johanson and simultaneously a voice called him over the comms. Boss drone threes scans are in. Theres a large concentration of metals deeper in the belt. Itd take us an hour to get out to it but the haul looks rich enough to make the navigation worthwhile.Thanks for the update Collins. What are we looking at?Rare metals from the look. Lots of anomalous stuff too. Wed need samples to figure out what it all is but were looking at enough material to fill us up twice over. Maybe even three times over!Rodriguez whistled a low impressed tone. Three times over with rare metals? Thatd pay off the ship and then some.Johanson nodded leaning back in his seat as he contemplated the situation. The Emma a RSI Orion mining platform currently sat at the edge of a massive debris fieldthe remnants of a planet shattered by some unknown cataclysm. The debris field sat at the edge of a black holes gravitational pull creating an eerie backdrop to their work area. This system was their own little secret a jump point they had discovered had led them to this little slice of the galaxy and the black hole threw off conventional scans so they could work with relative impunity.All right then. Lets maneuver through the field. Green Collins shut down your stations and get on the tractor beams. Well need to clear a path for dear ol Emma through the mess Johanson said.On it. Lets get her moving boys! Rodriguez said shifting excitedly in his seat as he began moving aside massive swaths of debris.The Emmas engines spooled up slowly as the ore processing beam shut off and with a slow and stately glide the ship moved into the field slipping through holes in the mass of rock made by the crew. The drones buzzed around the ship assisting with maneuvering asteroids out of the way. Meanwhile far ahead drone s signal guided them towards their unseen destination.As they slipped around a particularly large bit of debris the potential mining site came into view. Johanson cut the engines immediately squinting into the darkness as he focused the forwardfacing lights on the site. The object in question was a twisted mass of black smooth rock that looked to be fused with metallic ores. The surface was glassy in appearance reflecting back the light slightly. Silvery lines broke up the black glass drawing the eyes towards a central core surrounded by spires of black. The whole of the mass was like looking at a droplet of liquid metal frozen in time halfmelted and then halted before it could fully form leaving tendrils of material leaking from the whole.I never seen anything like it Rodriguez said softly voice reaching a reverent tone that Johanson had never expected to hear from the normally brash man.I dont think anyone has seen anything like it Rodriguez said Johanson.The mass twisted before them as a smaller bit of debris impacted it and bounced away crumbling. Johansons eyes widened as he noticed the glassy black surface was unblemished by the strike. Thats incredible. We need to get samples and get them analysed immediately. I dont even know if our refinery can handle whatever that thing is made out of.Ill send out drone one and two. Get some samples of the surface with one and a deeper core sample with the other. Well get the sampled processed within the hour hopefully and well be able to get mining after that Greens voice replied two drones already launching away from the Emma and heading for the strange mass.In the meantime lets process some of our haul and make some room for all the rough material well be bringing in. Collin get the refinery running again. Only keep stuff thats really worthwhile though. We need all the room we can get.Aye captain. On it Collin replied over the comms.,starcitizen,cvzy9yy,2,t5_2v94d

5407690,0,t1_cw2sbi5,Thankyou for bringing this up. DICE claimed to fix the headglitching that occurred and made characters able to aim over objects but with only the top few pixels of their head visible. However its not been fixed they did a quick and dirty fix which only altered the gun position to be slightly lower than the previous barrel coming out of forehead design.Secondly you can still headglitch it has highlighted that most of the scenery was designed for being able to see over and shoot over with the original height point. Now thats lower half the scenery now obstructs the players ability to shoot. Finding a position to shoot over an object is arguably as frustrating as the headglitching in the first place.If the character was mechanically the same in First and rd person views it eliminates the problem of headglitching straight up as well as the other desync issues like shooting a dude in the back only to fall over dead as bullets fly through their own body and kill you. Thats usually due to a combination of lag and server tick rate not updating character positions fast enough mostly fixed on the  and Hz versions of the CTE for BF for instance.Hell I can go into all the scenarios where BFs supposed realism has turned out to be more Quake than Afghanistan but it would take far too long at this moment. Suffice to say Ive had ample FPS experience over the past decade and Im really excited for the first game to have proper strd person animation accuracy along with actual recoil and inertia for the character. Anything less just feels too easy oh and for those who are good at FPS games anything that takes a shortcut leaves an exploit.,starcitizen,cw2w5k3,3,t5_2v94d

Are you a part of a smallmediumlarge one and why? Or are you going to try to make it all on your own or with a few friends in a cutlass?Also what do you think about buying ships at this point? Are you of the opinion that buying the cheapest package will make you enjoy the games progression in its fullest? Or do you think that you need to buy more expensive ships either to fit your playstyle or to simply gain an advantage and skip some progression?

5421096,0,t1_cw4kadk,Ok reading through some of his posts I think what happened was   Beer had called out DS asking for verification of a source.   DS wanted to prove he had an inside source so he decided to provide Beer the name of the Sabre Vindicator to verify that he had an inside source.   Beer tried to encrypt the name such that he could publish it before the official announcement then decrypt it afterwards to show that it had already been known.   Beer is bad at encryption so it was quickly solved and CIG was able to change the name before CitCon or DS was lying in the first place but he was spot on with the price  vs .Beers comments Im taking this from    And I guess CIG banned him for trying to help verify DS?

5457569,0,t1_cw97unq,  Behind the Scenes Alpha .RJ Hi my names Ricky Jutley and I work as a project manager here at Foundry . My role on Star Citizen Alpha . was Lead Producer and Im here to talk to you about how we delivered Star Citizen Alpha . at CitizenCon.RJ When we started thinking about all the things we wanted to do for CitizenCon one of the things were thinking is were building up all these features why dont we actually get something together for CitizenCon thats going to be a demo thats going to showcase all the cool stuff that we eventually want to deliver to the backers in their hands in game. Part of that was just getting together a lot of Chris vision and having that interpret all the way down to the designers the artists global lead artists that is coders and necessary leaders of the disciplines that will actually put that stuff together. Marrying with our content complete dates that we are trying to aim for as well we were tying in the necessary high level beats that reach into the demo and my main role is to get those beats together and make sure all the disciplines on a global basis were working towards their unified breakdown goals so that we could deliver that demo to the backers on the event.LP Straight away we were running into the limitations of the editor. The editor is not built to do the huge coordinates we are working with now. And those were just arbitrarily capped values that Crytek had put in because they only expected developers to be making small well relatively small maps. So we had to knock all those caps off straight away in order to reach the billion metre playspace we have at the moment.DS Because we always try and push as much in as we can theres always a risk that you end up breaking things. JG  And we were pushing pushing pushing so much that whats going on in your mind is what if Ive missed something out what if one little element in there I forgot to check in or I forgot to double check? What if one of the guys runs through and theres a bit of collision missing on the floor and suddenly hes falling through into space. That sort of thing can really affect the demo a live demo like that. Going through my mind is hoping hoping hoping everythings tight and everything works well.IL Now theres a fair amount of content in there. The playable area is big. Now one of the main challenges from that is just how do you create that much artwork in a short space of time?LB I guess one of our biggest challenges from doing a demo like this is the fact that we deal with an awful lot of change happening right up until the demo comes out. When it gets up against it our deliverable I find myself wearing lots of different hats so Im not just being and audio director Im also helping out everyone with technical issues with whatever they are doing .SR With all this large world technology that weve been developing the way we develop levels is interesting because we have to create a level and then we export that level to a prefabricated part of the level which is something like a space station or even just the module of a space station.GC As a deadline like that looms you have some many big requests coming where people want staff for Task A Task B Demo Run     show the designers this part of the game. Its just being able to sit there with the guys and say right this is really important we need to manage our time efficiently we need to do this we need to do that we need to talk to production and just essentially trim out of doing. In a way just really efficient time and staff management.ZC You would see me running round the studio following up issues trying to make sure people are working on the highest priority issues so we could fix the big bugs unblock dev so they can carry on working communicating with the studios to make sure we get the hand offs because weve really had contributions from all studios to get that to the place we wanted it to be.IL It was a fairly big technical challenge and that was pretty much our highest goal to achieve.LP So art would do their bit and then Id have to go in and make sure you could actually EVA through it without getting stuck in pipes or everything they did looked to the player interactable if it needed to be.NE Weve got dozens and dozens of features that were all in different states some in a very early state but so important to get them into the hands of the community to start getting feedback at an early stage. It was concentrating on making sure that the resources were aiming in this direction and we were getting the maximum focus we could in order to get the systems as far along as we could.IL Everything you see in the large world map is everything from asteroids to space stations to moons  theres a whole load of content in there. And my guys were responsible for creating all of that.SR Everyone wanted to make feel like a cool place to visit. Theyve just come from this brightly lit welcoming environment of the station where you start in where you spawn. And I wanted them to go to this other station and feel a little bit threatened and its a really cool place that youd want to get in and explore as a player.IL Probably the biggest space station weve ever done so far so this is going to be Port Olisar that you see on the map and it has many different landing pads and many different interiors. The real key is getting that so you can fly on your ship land on the pad walk in the airlock and youve got all the interior right there.SR It was .. to get those elements into it for Saturday for that release. We had a lot of things cooking in the oven.GC Honestly just before it started I was so nervous. Ive never done anything like this before Ive never been on stage before especially in front of so many people.CG As it was running I was quite terrified that the ship was never going to come out of quantum travel or travel through a planet.NE While it was happening it was panic because I was editing slides with Chris probably about  minutes before we were going on in typical chris style. But you know once we got going it was absolutely elation and pride everything seemed to go really well everyones reaction was positiveDS It turned out in the end that the game was remarkably stable considering it was a demo for an event it was very very solid.LB I come from mostly tripleA development where youre locked away for years on end and the nall of a sudden the game comes out and it gets nice feedback and stuff but to be able to actually show what were doing in kind of an incremental way like that and get that feedback its a huge boost to what we do it just gives you a certain amount of crazy energy to do what were doing.JG When I sat there and watched it with everyone else live it was almost like you get to a appreciate the whole thing and the all the work everyone puts into it as well.LP To see the fans reaction was amazing I was like pride was what I felt.CG I stood beside one of the backers and he seemed really pleased with the presentation.SRIts exciting to know we did a better job than before.DS We all just wanted it to go smoothly which thankfully yeah in the end it did.ZC You feel like that everybodys hard work has really been recognized and it just makes you really really motivated now get it out there you know you want to get it into these backers hands you want to get people playing it and get everyone as excited as weve been just going through it and playing it in the first place.GC The cheers that went up for half the stuff we did when adam got out of the ship into EVA and started flying towards the relay. That was unreal absolutely unreal just the roar that went up from the crowd I absolutely loved it.IL Tears were coming down their eyes because theyre having so much fun so many interesting things happenedNE When talking to people later on it was such a positive reaction it was such a buzz for everyone that had been killing themselves practically for a couple weeks running up to it to get that out there and actually see the results.RJ It was a very uplifting feeling been to a lot of events in general so you know not just game events and stuff but that event was very special and Ill always remember that.,starcitizen,cw998fb,6,t5_2v94d

5460343,0,t1_cw96bni,gt While at some point we assume hope theyll speed up making new ones you still have only  more years to get  functional landing zones done and ironed out.Chris himself said they have a bunch of landing zones built already.You are familiar with the way they are building up a library of assets to be used in the modular construction of a large number of systems with prebuilt pieces? The stanton system is using the same library of assets for each system yet presenting the architecture and colortexture palette differently for each planet and landing zone. They can create numerous areas that all look different using the same starting assets.We can assume that more populated systems will have more than two landing zones that will weigh the average in favor of the systems where more assets will be repurposed. more unique landing zones might be smaller or at the very least less numerous than high population and high economy zones.Procedural generation of planet surface will speed up the process of making the worlds themselves fleshed out.My point in this discussion is that while you have the opinion that its not happening your reasoning is based on the history of the project. Its clear the process for creating these is going to be absolutely different even here on out than it was in the past. The way ArcCorp and the Morrow Tour are treated shows that they use those areas as test beds for developing new ways of doing things. It wont be necessary to go through the same development processes for each system.What its like to build a pipeline isnt indicative of the resources created using the pipeline.I dont even particularly strongly disagree with your basic premise that CIG wont have about  landing zones at launch. Its just your supporting arguments seem to fall flat.,starcitizen,cw9lzq8,1,t5_2v94d

A thruster cannot accelerate faster than another unless you are talking about gimbal movement.What you are actually talking about is change of thrust over time. Spoolup like you say in your video.

Players jump and crouch and crawl and it might be a single pixel difference between a solid surface and a hole people can crawl through.Theres quite a bit of testing that goes into these things so depending on how perfectly they are aiming very detailed.

5491491,0,t3_3q9oif,Play style doesnt really come into consideration because right now SC Arena Commanders really pretty much just has dog fighting and racing. Hopefully that will change soon but even with the introduction of the Baby PU I dont expect to see bounty hunting mechanics at least not capture bounties but perhaps kill bounties would be offered so I still wouldnt factor it in for the time being.As others have suggested just use REC to try out different components to see what you like.  To start with I recommend getting a single S or S weapons on the nose and upgrading the shields while leaving the OSs on the wings alone. If you have enough left over you can get a couple of twin missile racks and some cheap but still somewhat effective missiles. You could also opt for the missiles rather than the shield upgrade or if you choose to go with a fixed weapon on the nose you could conceivably get both the shield upgrade plus missiles within your K REC budget.I personally like to mix things up and combine slower firing weapons like the OSs with weapons with a higher rate of fire. Laser cannons like the OSs are good for slower moving targets at a distance or when you are really up close. Whereas laser repeaters or ballistic gatlings offer you the ability spray and pray which can be helpful against nimbler fast moving opponents. Combining the two allows you to not only alternate between weapons to alleviate overheating or power drain issues but also to use the weapon most effective for the target you are battling. Since I will pretty much mix it up with anyone from the Merlin all the way up to the Cutlass having a mix of weapons really helps.However if you want to specifically target larger higher value targets like the Hornets Gladiators and the Cutlasses then mounting a slower firing but heavier hitting weapon on the nose may be your preference. This could include mass drivers or ballistic cannons. Whatever you pick keep in mind that different sorts of weapons will have different ammo velocities which will cause PIP separation which can make it more difficult to hit a target. However some separation of your PIPs can actually make it easier to hit targets depending on the circumstances.  You should also be mindful of power drain and heating issues. Weapons with higher power drain like the mass drivers can rob your other systems of needed power resulting in slower shield recharge and sluggish maneuvering. Lastly be aware that if you go with all energy weapons that you wont do damage until youve taken down an opponents shields. To start doing some damage almost immediately you may want to mount a ballistic on the nose along with those OSs on the wings.Here are some loadouts within your budget that Id personally look to use starting out with the iGimballed S Energy w shield   REC Flashfire VariPuck S Gimbal Mount  REC CF Badger Repeater REC and Shield Generators  INKMark IDINKSplash IS  RECGimballed S Energy w missiles   REC Flashfire VariPuck S Gimbal Mount  REC CF Badger Repeater  REC  x Twin Rack  REC each and Marksman I  RECGimballed S Ballistic Cannon w missiles and shield   REC Flashfire VariPuck S Gimbal Mount  REC Tarantula GT  REC  x Twin Rack  REC each Marksman I  REC Shield Generators  INKMark IDINKSplash IS  REC Fixed S Laser Repeater w missiles and shields   REC CF Badger Repeater  REC  x Twin Rack  REC each Marksman I  REC and Shield Generators  INKMark IDINKSplash IS  RECFixed S Mass Driver w missiles and shields   REC Strife Mass Driver  REC  x Twin Rack  REC each Marksman I  REC and Shield Generators  INKMark IDINKSplash IS  RECFixed S Laser Repeater w shield   REC CF Panther Repeater  REC and Shield Generators  INKMark IDINKSplash IS  REC Fixed S Laser Repeater w missiles   REC CF Panther Repeater  REC  x Twin Rack  REC each and Marksman I  REC.Fixed S Ballistic Gatling w missiles and shields   REC Mantis GT  REC  x Twin Rack  REC each Marksman I  REC and Shield Generators  INKMark IDINKSplash IS  REC In some cases listed above you can upgrade from the Marksman I  REC to Tempest II  REC and still keep within your budget.Heres a link to a spreadsheet containing the current weapons stats so that you can make a more informed decision.,starcitizen,cwdl84b,3,t5_2v94d

I know its shit but honestly it doesnt look as bad as other Low resolutions with the CryTek engine. You can use higher resolutions too but it might not work as well.Chances are this alone will not be enough to stop the constant wave of freezes. So you need to download a custom userconfiguration file that is performancefocused from here Read the article if you want to know more but the files is the Performance Preset link beneath the screenshot. You can edit the file to tweak settings but theyve tested that configuration and its the most stable you can get at the moment. Download and place the file itll be called user.cfg in  CCloud Imperium GamesStarCitizenPublic  folder. Change C to wherever you installed the game.Youll know whether or not the config file is working by the lack of shadows underneath your ship in the Hangar. If your ship has shadows beneath it then the user.cfg needs to be renamed to User.cfg or USER.cfg or you might of put it in the wrong place.,starcitizen,cwikfop,1,t5_2v94d

The instancing should be fairly seamless with instances being able to talk to each other. So it may feel like one big server but its not.Maybe youre thinking of the fact that theyre not having multiple shards where players from each shard never interact with each other? Instead theyll have dynamic instances and the GIM will try to group people into instances based on geographical region. If you have a friend across the world though it can place you into an instance together but one or both of you may experience worse than normal lag.Heres an old article on the subject.,starcitizen,cwj6ggy,9,t5_2v94d

5539943,0,t3_3r06hr,The general idea is to make all action meaningful and with consequences. Meaning no free instant respawns for the character see Death of a Spaceman or the ships as described by AgentMothman. In this context this also means no loot pinatas  you cant reposess cargo if you blow the ship up. This leads to the other general idea  everything should be skill based. The skill in this case is damaging the ship just right so it surrenders without blowing it up. This requieres good flying and targeting.So yes a potentially big deal if you loose the ship or even die or even if you just loose the uninsured cargo. How big of a deal? Nobody knows yet the game is not developed to that point and it will take quite a bit of balancing to make it just right.

5546922,0,t3_3r2pl5,eve online has a wormhole system where they are unstable move shut down and... in game rules... things that happen in wormhole space are A LOT more lethaldangerous compared to the rest of the playable world.I havent read everything that CIG has posted about jump points yet... but if I were designing the system.... jump points live at LAGRANGE points... so they move.   But only some Lagrange points.  The zero g spot of a lagrange point makes it possible to be there but not all  L points have one.  . Unmapped jump points just havent been mapped yet and mapping actually is the process of stabalizing them.   All Jump points act wonky and are dangerous.  The ones that are stable are just understood.  your nav computer knows how they act and what their patterns are.   The unmapped ones just havent been fully documented yet.. This unmapped behavior happens at both ends of the jump point.   It takers a while to fully track lock down and understand a jump point... Then you end up on the other side and you have to do it all over again.  ... many scout ships have been lost this way .... these unmapped jump points while unstable as described above are stable enough to jump through poke around a bit and run home before its too late.   Go explore that new system but you have  minutes to get back to the jump point before your nav computer looses track of it..  make them difficult to use.  all jump points have to be approached in a certain way to be used safely or at all.   our unmapped ones as well just simply havent been approached the right way before.   mapping one involves knowing how to get near it.   Even if not all L points have a jump point the ones that do you might never find until you approach it from just the right bearing.  just some ideas.,starcitizen,cwknamm,4,t5_2v94d

5561282,0,t1_cwlnzz9,Possibly but given that we all SAW the FPS module being played at different CIG conferences you could make the argument that its just as likely that Illfonic delivered as requested CIG didnt renew because the only work left to do was integration with the rest of the modulesgame and wanted Foundry  to handle the rest of it as that team would also have to incorporate FPS into the SQ campaign... and suddenly Foundry  has had to relearn a lot of what Illfonic learned over the last couple years and integration of the FPS module with alpha . to release the FPS module to backers has taken ndplace to going full steam ahead on making SQ missions etc. Thats a totally feasible possibility.Its also entirely possible that Foundry  delivered exactly as ordered and CIG didnt renew because of the cost of keeping the team on taxation laws where the studio was set up etc. With people working all around the world CIG still doesnt have a blank check and were coming into November still around M shy of where CR said in several interviews he expected to be by the end of .

The question is Why suddenly show it now?Theyve mentioned the Avenger variants several times recently and so Im hoping that perhaps this may be relevant as theres one variant we know nothing about. Having an SampR version of the Avenger would be a nice starter ship for those interested in that kind of game play and about half the price of the Cutlass Red which can rescue and care for many more people.On the other hand it could simply be due to the fact that the first ships with actual escape pods are going to be properly flyable soon and the escape pods might be functional!OR.... its just a crazyrandomhappenstance.Im personally hoping that its a hint at at least one of the Avenger variants having a bottom hatchdocking collar as its difficult to imagine an Advocacy agent or bounty hunter having to EVA to board another ship to apprehend someone.If it really is an expolice ship then it really needs the docking hatch.,starcitizen,cwqbcsg,3,t5_2v94d

If they can pull it off and release SQ in the next year then all doubts will be put aside because that will guarantee the continuation and completion of the full product.If you havent seen some of the recent SQ stuff let me know and Ill send you some links.The is the upcoming PU alpha release.There were some major technical hurdles that theyve had to overcome in rewriting CryEngine to make the game work and the upcoming PU alpha contains  of that work.The bit FPP rewrite that allows for single map solar systems the individual physics grids that make multicrew work and the Octree replacing zonecontainer system are technical wonders that make the game possible as envisioned and theyve pulled those off.Now at least for the PU its just a matter of building content and making sure everything is stable. Other major concerns that other have had Ive never really shared as Ive always know the flight system to be an early version. But even with that Im still excited to see the new flight system because Ive been waiting for it for a while too.This next year is going to be really exciting.,starcitizen,cwtjgne,2,t5_2v94d

Also Andromeda is not a freighter it is multirole though not specially feat at anything. The Taurus the Freelancer MAX Hull series those are freighters. The Andromeda is meant to be just decent at everything a jackofall trades. Good for boarding operations and combat when supported by escort fighters but its outmatched in dogfighting.Realistically it can kill a Retaliator because unless it is caught off guard bombs or torps arent going to do much since the Connie is supposed to be fast enough to avoid them maybe on splash damage but who knows?.

To reapair it youd have to probably get replacement parts from the black market or through a broker and cover repair costs yourself. If the hull is completely destroyed you have lost the ship all together.This is the one case were LTI is strictly better. However theres currently only one ship that definitely fits into this category which is the captured Vanduul Scythe.It is unclear whether the Esperia variants of alien ships will be insurable considering they while being alien technology were reverse engineered and produced on a very small scale in UEE territory.

In SC you can yaw pretty easily and decoupled is also more helpful but you need very accurate movements for that.You either train a lot with a high end joystick to achieve good precision or go with the MampK.And when you want to do PVP and want to be effective you will go for MampK because its just easier..,starcitizen,cx4bwmr,1,t5_2v94d

So personally you could work to eventually create an entire component by putting all these parts together and creating blueprints from the individual pieces of the pipes and wires to the entire casing. Then when youve done this well enough to earn a name for yourself you could buy a factory node and have them use your perfected blueprints to create the components en mass.

5727159,0,t1_cx6xfx7,I am sorry if I am misunderstanding it your question confused me a little.If what your are asking is if you can buy an Aurora Package and a Standalone LTI Avenger Titan right now and then combine them into a single package the answer is no.The only way to get LTI into a package is to own a package that already has LTI. Currently the only way to get an LTI Avenger is if you get it standalone.So in your situation you will have an Aurora Package and a Standalone LTI Avenger Titan. You can CCU the Titan to other ships later which will retain the LTI.I hope this cleared things up a little but reading it back myself it is still confusing. Maybe rephrase your question if you need more help and I will do my best to answer it.,starcitizen,cx70dem,1,t5_2v94d

5742792,0,t1_cx8x5ke,Fair enough.  To answer your question though as we have come up with that idea over at Pitchfork the problem is the Tiber is a MAJOR strategic POI for the Vanduul as per lore.  You would need a Reclaimer to start with and get a decent profit out of it. A Reclaimer would then need quite a large escort. A Starfarer to begin with most likely. So you have  space whales now which need protection.  Lets say  Vanguards better an Idris.  Thats where your problem starts such a large force might wake the interest of the Vanduul.    By now we have  pilots and  ships including  Talis  Javelins and a  Idris and still think it is suicide to go into Tiber.    You could try and go in with small and stealthy ships but that would probably not be worth the risk. Maybe a couple of Cutlass escorted by Hornet Ss.,starcitizen,cx8y688,1,t5_2v94d

5753353,0,t1_cx9vb12,Pfft. I played EVE for  years. Early on I collected the bounty on the th Most Wanted CEO of a merc corp who had been hired against me and the bounty was  million a freakin fortune at the time. I reverseengineered the guassiancurve missile damage formula CCP implemented in the first missile rework and shared it with the community. I was coCEO of my own corp of a few dozen dedicated players went on to be a senior officer in multiple large nullsec alliances. I was one of the first capital ship pilots. I fought off raiding gangs singlehandedly with a carrier while our pilots traded mining ships for combat vessels. I turned industrialist and built Tech  ships ran my own highrisk transport venture. Then I probed out wormholes and got involved in faction warfare. I can fly any ship save  of the titans and fit any weapon. EVE no longer has any draw for me. I have a wife and kids now I dont have the time for it any more and it just doesnt call to me these days. It was a great game for over a decade and perhaps your friends are still exploring the enormous depth the game has to offer but there is also a lot it lacks. No firstperson hurts its immersion a lot. Ive read all the EVE stories and lore and despite years and years ingame it always felt like a game not an environment. It has such a rich back story that never really gets used to its fullest ingame.Anyhow thats my take. My sub has lapsed and I probably wont go back. CCP made a step in the right direction with Incarna when they added st person and captains quarters but then they dumped it under pressure from the purists who I guess are fine with playing the same game until the day they die.I hope Star Citizen continues with the vision of seamless immersion and doesnt sacrifice the overall experience just for a few more ships and weapons.,starcitizen,cxa9baw,5,t5_2v94d

5774772,0,t3_3u92tv,Nice post overall.I see where youre coming from with the exploration part.I concur in that I might not get the feeling of being out there if the galaxy is  hours end to end. That would make the outer rim about  hours thick so I would be  minutes away from everyone else.I imagine its hard to get the on my ownfeeling if I know that I have a fully stocked repair shop and and a bunch of mercs a mere hour away.And venturing into the unknown isnt that satisfactory if the unknown comes to an end after about two hours.On the other hand I know from the Fallout series and similar games that if there is enough to dolook atexplore along the way the hour straight path becomes a multiple day adventure zigzaging inbetween points of interest.You made me think about this... So have an upvote for your input I might come back to this after I have mulled this through.EDITJust got through your other two points and I have to agree with the other commenters.  Im fine with the economy the way it is currently planned. You will be able to manipulate local markets by buying fromselling to economy nodes. I remember the example with the lasercannon supply line from the raw ores to the finished weapon and the way the players can interfere. You seem to have a different understanding of the slider than what I and many others got from the FTC vids and other sources.I recommend to reread the relevant design docs. You have assume some  oversimplified models for the economy and the slider which makes you come to your conclusions.,starcitizen,cxcwxbz,7,t5_2v94d

I can play Arena Commander the  player dogfight module at fps at Very High.The game does not look bad at all at lower settings the difference is not that significant you should be able to get a decent framerate at around High I think I guess you could google Star Citizen gtx  performance videos. Notice that this game is still in relatively early development and not optimized. There will be areas where you get framedrops no matter what settingshardware you have.And Star Citizen is definitely one of the few games that profits massively of having it on an SSD it is currently my only game on my SSD the loading times are significantly lower with an SSD.One tip before its too late if you decide to jump in Use the Referral Code Generator when you create an account so you can make one random Reddit Citizen happy and grant you  of ingame currency.Feel free to ask about game packages and so on.,starcitizen,cxdyxje,1,t5_2v94d

5790361,0,t1_cxem316,.... uh huh. So. A bunch of Turkoman have Fs and nearcurrentgeneration TOW missiles? Did they develop that technology themselves or do you think it came from Ankara and the CIA? Did you not see them thanking the coalition for those pallets of weapons?What do you think is the end game when your strategy is pushing those palettes off of cargo planes into the most dangerous place on the planet in a desperate attempt to get them to people who need them?They warned the jet  times in  seconds. An su took  seconds to fly a mile and a half? So it was flying at stall speed... seems legit.Do you remember when Russia shot down a Turkish jet and Turkey said a minor incursion could never be a pretext to an attack? I do. I also know Turkey has violated Greek airspace over  times in the last year.And perhaps if Turkey could do basic math the world might believe it had nothing to do with it. Read some history on the conflict and what Turkey has done before you open your mouth.After you read that read up on Edrogans son and who is buying all of ISISs oil. Genus. Im sure General Dempsey is talking out his ass when he testified about major mideast allies funding ISIS. Might be why we never went near the oil tankers until the Russians made us by attacking them first. Too busy attacking the PKK and empty desert not ISIS.Russia dropped bombs on the tankers we dropped leaflets. Citing ROE and the drivers may not be ISIS.This coming from the same people who shelled a Doctors wo Borders hospital. Who drop cluster bombs on weddings because a terrorist cell phone is pinging from the area. Add I am expected to believe they had a moral issue with bombing truck drivers who know exactly who is selling them the oil? Now Turkey claimes it didnt know what aircraft were in the area and wouldnt have attacked if it knew it was Russian.Wait I thought they warned it  times??No need to question why ISIS doesnt bother Israel Turkey the Saudis Quatar Jordan or Kuwait.Nothing about this has to do with Quatars oil pipeline and Turkeys interest in being its port.Oh look! A story in one of Turkeys papers today about the secret service smuggling weapons to ISIS...But dont worry Erdogan has the reporters safely under arrest.     I eagerly await your response.

5790442,0,t3_3uhgqz,So I decided to try out the racing track after crashing out of Port Olisar one too many times yesterday. Its hard to tell when flying in such an open map but on the track you can really get a good feel regarding the changes CIG made to the IFCS in . For starters you really have to slow down and apply boost early to make turns quickly now but you have to balance this with the need to not black out. In some cases its actually quicker now to take wider more graceful turns than trying to cut those corners. Its also much more of a challenge to get good lap times without crashing the ship at least that was my experience yesterday in the r.  However in my opininion the introduction of afterburners is the real game changer. After some practice I managed to get a . second lap time on OV and I was still wasnt being all that aggressive in the turns due to still getting a feel for things and crashing too often when I did get too aggressive. My best time on OV in a public match in . was around . For me thats a huge difference and it wasnt due to improved manueverability and handling. No! The r now flies like a pregnant cow again in .. In fact I had to turn on both comstab and gsafe to keep from sliding into buildings and not blacking out with every turn.  I never had to do that in .! The only reason I was able to get a sub minute laptime was due to being able to fire afterburners and get up over  ms in the straighaways. My prediction is the introduction of afterburners is going to help the good pilots dramatically cut their lap times. We might even start to see lap times in the  second range on OV but only after pilots adapt to the dramatic handling changes this build introduces. Ive not yet flown the M on the OV map but I also suspect its going to do much better in those turns and as such we might actually see it be more competative again at least when it comes to the smaller tracks with tighter turns. Hopefully things will balance out a bit more with players having to carefully consider their choice of ship based on its capabilities their own piloting skills and the particulars of the track they are about to race.,starcitizen,cxeuxxm,18,t5_2v94d

I might not end up making as much money but Ill probably have a lot more fun doing that than I would playing cards and waiting for something to happen.gtThen its a dollar on the store to buy  UEC so basically you are making  and hour by being paid labor.I already have one job dont need another.,starcitizen,cxi4xx1,1,t5_2v94d

The Avenger currently has a more versatile cargo area though the  series will get an overhaul at some unspecified point in time.I think the biggest defining factor as far as weapons goes is the Avenger mounts a larger nose gun than the  series can  but its permanently mounted. The  series has a hardpoint there thats a size smaller but you can swap out the weapon.The good news is since both are available to you any time you can buy the  package if you want then melt it a day later and get the Avenger.

5843800,0,t1_cxlkmiu,Ive always been a big advocate in favour of rewards being dependent upon risk. At the low end of the spectrum risk wise would be transporters. They just move stuff from A to B but their risk would probably depend on the spacelane involved and the cargo.Next up would be the resource acquirers. Miners farmers and fuel gatherers. They take some risk in the fact that the best farming areas will be hotly contested and likely Org controlled territories. The competition in such fields isnt just hostile  it can be warlike.Next up you have pirates. They wont pick a fight with a transport or resource convoy that they dont think they can beat so their risk is largely in their own hands. However successfully beating a decent convoy and netting a decent catch should yield a decent profit assuming you have the cargo capacity to haul it!Next on the risk ladder are the soldiers and police. They dont get to pick their fights so much as have their fights picked for them. They go where theyre told and fight until either they or the enemy are dead. This is very high risk.I might even argue that bounty hunters should come in quite high up since trying to bring someone in alive cannot be easy.,starcitizen,cxlnd0c,1,t5_2v94d

5851777,0,t1_cxmo4wt,Sure Im not talking about pulling resources from unrelated teams theyre busy in the pipeline for future content. Im referring to how programmers dont just work on general programming. Say you have someone focusing on their AI implementation and at some point they need players to start engaging the NPCs and identifying exploitable weaknesses e.g. able to get pirates to reliably crash into the solar panels on the satellite. Cant get to that point because the server stops processing AI entirely once players spawn enough NPCs. Maybe its an issue specific to the number of characters in the zone which doesnt come up in solo.So rather than having that AI programmer sitting there waiting for the server issues to be resolved before a player can discover that AI issue or trying to get them to crosstrain and halfheartedly review the netcode or something the same code could be in place in solo allowing players to flesh out those bugs earlier.Its stuff that needs to be resolved some time during the project before it can go live ideally so might as well keep the specialists busy with feedback on things in their area. The issue with QA getting overwhelmed with duplicate requests is one benefit of the issue council approach  they can crowdsource that triage.Just an example to illustrate what Im talking about  of course AI isnt a priority right now.,starcitizen,cxmp2m2,1,t5_2v94d

5877232,0,t3_3vrfkb,Ill start off by saying not everyone will get it. Some people will just think its stupid. Ignore them. Dealing with friend who would be more open to SC I usually tell them that it is going to be the most immersive space sim that has been made with an unimaginable number of possibilities and careers. Mining pirating being a marine a cargo hauler a medic anything you can think of within reason you can be one way or another. They generally think this is cool then I explain to them the funding situation.The game is not out yet but over  million people have backed this game. You pledge money to the company who is a very good company that wants to do things right instead of quickly. They have a vision and they want to make it the best they can. Crowd funding is their solution to not working for a big company with deadlines. So we can choose to pledge  minimum to get complete access to the game throughout develpopment from Alpha to finished. We can choose to pledge more in return for different ships or not. Everything is avaliable in game at launch and wont be buyable with cash after launch either. This is strictly to fund the development of the game.Theyre either interested by this point or not so i usually show them different ships and explain their rolesadvantages and I let them know that the ships start out with stock weak weapons and the real struggle will be beefing them up and maintaining them. I then ask for questions or talk about the vanduullore depending on who Im talking to. You really have to feel out your audience when trying to sell star citizen because if someone likes syfy space AT ALL I think theyre missing out if they arent backing star citizen.,starcitizen,cxq1ceg,8,t5_2v94d

5877812,0,t3_3vrtee,Stealth doesnt equal smaller profile necessarily. The engines need to be shielded and have a lower sig then normal so they might be larger then normal. Also the missiles are located within the ship and not on the outside. ,starcitizen,cxq42x8,54,t5_2v94d
5878030,0,t1_cxq48s9,You raise a perfectly valid point about those with limited play time. From my understanding of most of the posts Ive seen about this from time to time its not necessarily the speed that bothers people from an immersion point of view but the constant running being unrealistic. Its not something that particularly bothers me and certainly not enough to dictate somebody elses play time. Perhaps a possible solution would be personal transport systems of some kind. Hoverboards? Inline antigrav skates? Jetpacks?  Its the future dammit I want my Jetsons  jetpack!,starcitizen,cxq540f,2,t5_2v94d
5878866,0,t3_3vs86s,Marksmen are essentially the best s missile. If you want to use s missiles you can rent a Gladius or an Avenger take off their missile racks and use them with the Hornet. The wing and nose hardpoints are size . This means you can equip size  fixed weapons or size  weapons with a gimbal mount attached. Right now the laser repeaters are probably the best energy weapon but it seems the game is still mostly about ballistics.All Hornets can use up to size  shields although I have heard some people report issues with size  shields. Note that how this size system works will be changing in the future and hence there is conflicting information out there. There are spreadsheets out there with stats pulled from the game files however it must be noted they can still have mistakes and arent always updated instantly. The upcoming patch . will likely change some of it.,starcitizen,cxq92f8,5,t5_2v94d

5881698,0,t1_cxqlczc,I said unit cost not what they charged to make a profit or cover development costs.The F is heavily subsidized by the US taxpayer. We are absorbing the bulk of the development costs. Frances pockets arent as deep as ours. The Pentagon has been doing whatever it can to prevent buyers from pulling out and sending the program into a death spiral. Giving them a better deal based on very conservative cost estimates isnt out of the picture. Theres always the chance that the price will get jacked up. The Rafale is completed and the F is still in development.Highoff bore missile sights will be great the only problem is the missile itself requires a lock which it cant do from the inside of a weapons bay. There are workarounds but they havent been implemented yet. Theyre on track to. Opening the bay will make it lose stealth. Theres also the minor problem that the Fs cockpit is too small and the helmet is too big for the pilot to look around. That one is hopefully just a teething issue.Fs still came out on top because our pilots are the best in the world. They get more training and flight time in a month than most other countries get in a year. Their winloss ratio was still much much lower than the US was used to.  as opposed to  or  in other conflicts IIRC.gtFs that had no guns had more kills and better ratios than those that didCitation needed  The F was designed as a missile toting interceptor and was generally described as a brick. Strapping a gunpod to it isnt going to change that.Youre making the assumption that there will never be counters to modern missiles. The days of sidewinders tracking to the sun are over but stealth jamming AESA radar etc. still exist. The F is expected to be in service until . A lot will change in that period. Plan A is relatively solid but there is no plan B whatsoever.,starcitizen,cxqmgbi,1,t5_2v94d
5882741,0,t3_3vrtee,The top down the cross section is large for the Sabre. This is because of its high level of redundancyeg.  reactors  engines and  shield generators compared to the current design of the Hornet which only has one of each. It also has an encapsulated design where everything neatly tucks away into the hull to give a smooth shape for a smaller radar cross section.However if you compare the cross section of the ship from the sides or back. Its actually about the same if not smaller than many other light and medium fighters.Like some others have said I dont imagine the Hornet will stay the size it is for long. It doesnt make sense with its intended role. The Hornet was not sized correctly to house components which currently dont fit. It also is probably going to need to become even bigger to support some redundancy in components and extra armor if it is in fact going to be the durable brawler compared to a Sabre.,starcitizen,cxqrdpl,3,t5_2v94d

5894249,0,t3_3vzxxm,gt What kind of controls would you prefer on the on the front of the base?This is real hard to answer because it depends on how flexible CIG makes the control mappings. Right now momentary switches are better because you cant do proper hold style key bindings. But if CIG adds proper hold style bindings in the future then toggle switches would IMHO be more preferred.So really this question is going to get improperly skewed I think Edit I am also slightly concerned that a company building a joystick doesnt know the proper term for a momentary switch. ,starcitizen,cxs9qjw,4,t5_2v94d

The EVE and EnB communities were rivals on the EnB side we often mocked EVE then also in Beta as a mining simulator and ridiculed its lack of content. Sounds a little bit familiar doesnt it?! I was a huge Homeworld and Freespace fan and was looking for a game that would satisfy my craving for ships and scifi. EnB was more my style because it was more handcrafted less empty you could walk up to NPCs and didnt feel like you were always just a ship hanging in the void. Ironically playing EnB through Beta and being fortunate to cruise through a lot of endgame content with several incognito devs I befriended meant that after release it held little appeal for me. There really wasnt anything new to experience.After Westwood Studios collapsed and a couple years of playing PlanetSide I joined the enemy and played EVE as it was the sandbox that wouldnt run out of content so easily and for a decade on and off it satisfied me though I never got that feeling of immersion I was looking for. After CCP scrapped Walking in Stations outside of the Incarna release I began playing only rarely before finally letting my sub run out. I played PlanetSide  and some MWO before the responsibilities of being a father and a homeowner and a rapidly developing career whittled away at my game time. SC looks to bring together everything Ive dreamed about and enjoyed over the years the twitch space fighter combat of Freespace the range of ship classes and complexity of Homeworld the FPS combat of PlanetSide and some of the sandboxy nature of EVE but with the handcrafted systems and environments of Earth and Beyond.I never thought Id see anything like it.EDIT  Earth and Beyond emulator for those interested ,starcitizen,cy0rn2f,28,t5_2v94d

And dont be fooled by size.  A small dense body with a xenon atmosphere and a strong magnetic field could have significantly more atmosphere than a large less dense body with a helium atmosphere and a weak magnetic field.Here are a couple of interesting resources I came across while thinking about thisNick Strobels Astronomy Notes offers a section on atmospheres in the Planetary Science chapter that has some good basic information.This Gas Retention Simulator offered by the Universty of NebraskaLincoln is a great way to understand some of these effects.Ultimately CIG is pretty good at explaining things with ingame explanations or fiction and I suspect that will extend to they whys and hows of planetary atmospheres.

5994554,0,t1_cy4y5ds,In a gameplay sense that is kinda cool. In a practical sense that is really very stupid.Commander Ptolemy I want you to park the I.S.S. Omega along the busiest trade route coming out of Port Olisar. There are a band of cartel fugitives that the UEE wants to force out of hyperspace and we will intercept once identified. All civilians will be rerouted after inspections.Sir what if there are any ships that have a malfunctioning QD object detector or the cartel members rig their stolen ships with pirated software that ignores UEE signatures? We cant have ships with people in them flying themselves to their deaths. The public backlash would put us on trial.Dont worry commander. The game devs made this scenario impossible. Nothing to worry aboutIn real life I think it would be potentially stupid to put yourself in the way of objects going .C and then just assume that nothing can go wrong and they will stop because their computer should tell them about you.

6017402,0,t3_3xwh59,Short answer  its Buy To Play.  No subscription.  No freemium limiting stuff.Long Answer  If you buy a game package  it includes not only the game but a starting ship.  When the game launches youll be able to earn credits which you spend in the game to buy upgrades for your ship or even a new ship.  Please note that the game is currently in Alpha stage thus is not feature complete we only have access to a relatively small testbed space environment area and one city at the moment.  There is no ETA on when launch will be right now. Please note that some packages are just for ships ONLY whilst other packages contain the game itself.  The easiest way to tell the difference is to look for Star Citizen Digital Download in the list of stuff contained in the package.,starcitizen,cy8eoe9,3,t5_2v94d

6029857,0,t3_3y1p3n,Transcript as requestedLETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN HAPPY HOLIDAYS... AND THANK YOUGreetings CitizensAs  draws to a close I would like to thank everyone in the Star Citizen community for your incredible support. Its amazing to think that this journey started out just over three years ago with the simple idea that there had to be more people out there than myself who liked space and PC games. Why werent the big publishers interested in supporting space games? Why did they think the PC wasnt a viable platform?On the set of Squadron  imageTo say that all of you proved them wrong is an understatement. To date youve done that to the tune of over  million in crowd funding raised to build this game and a million Citizens signing up to follow what were doing here. Its the game Ive been dreaming about ever since the moment I learned to program and Im pretty sure its the game all of you have been dreaming about too!For making all of this possible I can only say thank you. With this funding we are now building a game that can compete with any AAA publisher backed game out there. No corporate suits deciding what franchise to milk or license. I promised a long time ago that the funds that we raise prior to what we consider the commercial release of Star Citizen would go towards additional development. Because of all of your support we can build this game bigger and better than anyone thought possible a few years ago.With big numbers comes big attention. Some people look at the number and say Why should they have all that money? Well its because you want to build a big bold game that doesnt compromise! This is the secret. The additional money that comes in doesnt go towards dividends for shareholders or making analysts happy with our profitability. It gets invested into making Star Citizen the best it can be. Hiring the best talent possible and allowing them to reach for the stars. Your contributions are going towards making the game better for you and all your friends. How could that possibly be a bad thing?Technology like the procedural planet that we demonstrated in the Pupil to Planet demo during the December livestream is a direct result of your contributions. Without it we wouldnt have the Frankfurt office or the technical wizards that reside there. Or the incredibly talented team in Manchester! Without the continued support and enthusiasm of the best community in gaming we would have never been able to hire up in the UK Germany or expand our US development team. Thanks to you we have been able to build a truly world class team.But Star Citizen isnt really about the money thats just whats allowing us to build a game of the ambition and fidelity that people thought wouldnt be possible.A huge milestone towards achieving this goal was the release of Star Citizen Alpha . earlier this month with the ability to play in a huge area the biggest yet in gaming thanks to  bit floating point positional coordinates and offering up all of these exciting options in that world walking around a space station on foot or boarding a space ship by yourself or with friends walk around that ship andor have your friends man various stations while you are flying fly thousands or even hundreds of thousands of kilometers engage in ship to ship combat against AI or other players exit your ship to EVA and explore space stations engage in FPS combat on foot or in EVA rescue stranded players perform various missions. All of this happens seamlessly without loading screens at a fidelity and scale that has not been seen before in any game.Star Citizen Alpha . is the first time that you can see how the various elements space combat FPS social interaction huge play spaces will all fit together into one seamless holistic game experience. You can really see the dawn of the first person universe. Combining the fidelity that we are aiming for with the scale we want has always been our biggest technical challenge. Were aiming for detail that is as good or better than any AAA first  third person game but that can go from picking out details from several centimeters away to seeing planets hundreds of thousands of kilometers in the distance all simulated and rendered from the st person view of your avatar that can go anywhere.. shows the naysayers it can be done!We still have a lot of work to do many game systems to complete content to generate code to optimize bugs to squash but you can now see what Star Citizen will feel like and in . you can get an experience you cant get with any other game. I know thats a pretty bold claim to make but you just have to visit our forums or Reddit or watch hundreds of YouTube videos or Twitch streams to see this happening every day.The aspect that most excites me is that players are building their own narrative around what happened to them in their . game sessions. It reminds of when Wing Commander first came out and I noticed people talking about their wingmen  women as real people  not just a game character who you should team up with to complete a mission or level. Instead people were picking their flying partner based on personality and who they liked. That was the moment that I realized something special was happening and the whole was more than the sum of the parts.Just imagine what you can do with the Star Citizen Alpha . experience but with even more content and features? More locations and interactions? Its not really a space sim as we understand them. I find it hard to put my finger on why it seems so liberating but I think the ability to really feel like you can go anywhere and have the universe rendered with such detail and fidelity gives a different sense of immersing oneself in a game. With a lot of other space games the experience still feels like a game. This feels different. You can even see it in the player behavior in .. There is no win. Just experience and adventure.And this is just the beginning!Whats coming next?Star Citizen Alpha . goes live to all backers on the PTU today. . includes a couple of new ships the remodeled Freelancer is now flyable and the Sabre the new experimental medium fighter that we announced at CitizenCon  is hangar ready. Both the Freelancer and the Sabre have benefited from the new ship modeling processes that the Ship Team has developed. Once a manufacturers style and look has been defined and we have built out its material set the process of taking a ship from detailed D concept to ingame is much faster than it was previously. As we flesh out the various manufacturers in this manner expect to see quicker turn around from concept to ingame.Going forward we will be changing our patch release strategy to be less feature driven and more date driven. Our goal is to release a new update every month so Januarys would be SC Alpha .. We have many features in development separate to the release stream and the idea is that we assess which features are ready for prime time a few weeks out from the release and then greenlight them for inclusion in that months release. We would then have a good PTU test make sure the features really are ready for primetime fixing up the issues we see and in the case of a feature needing more work we would pull it out of the release. Physicalized EVA is an example of this. After testing in PTU we felt we needed to do some more work in order to polish it for better usability in certain circumstances.We feel like this strategy will be better for both development and the community at large. It will ensure constant updates and patches and a good flow of features. But as were not defining which features make a particular release we wont be in a situation like we were earlier this year where the delays on the FPS development in Star Citizen ended up blocking game updates for the community.With . as our foundation which combines the various game modes into one holistic experience we now have a good strong framework for any new feature updates whether they involve FPS ship social or planetside. Expect to see us flesh out a huge amount of the Persistent Universe and its functionality in this coming year.In addition to this well be hard at work in completing Squadron  which is something Im incredibly excited about. I had a lot of fun working with a great script and amazing set of actors earlier this year and its a lot of fun to start seeing all this come alive inside the engine. I will be personally spending a lot of time in the UK with the Foundry  team in  closing out Squadron  for all of you to play. I cant wait as Squadron  really is how I would have made a next generation Wing Commander. The fluidity that is so compelling in . only serves to enhance the feeling of immersion and being inside the story for Squadron . Combine this with some amazing performances and technology that can transcribe the performance into our game engine I think the sense of emotional connection to the characters and story will take it to a whole other level than people are used to.,starcitizen,cya178w,12,t5_2v94d

And keeping the movements smoother can help to like going from right around toward down in an arc instead of right left up down left etc. So you can swing yourself around while bringing your guns to bear on the target then boost strafe hard in another direction if their shots start landing.Getting a good amount of hits even at low damage helps a lot too. Most people try to break off for a better position if they notice theyre getting shot a lot especially since it can be tough to tell how much damage is getting done when your shields start lighting up. This gives you the chance to close and finish while they try to get a better position.,starcitizen,cyk5136,2,t5_2v94d

Not to mention the people who would integrate VR arent necessarily the same as the people who develop more core features and mechanics of the game. At the end of the day its just a really advanced peripheral. Regardless VR was never going to be the biggest priority. Even if it was cheaper not that many people are willing to wear something on their face for hours just to play video games. The first few iterations were always going to be for the enthusiasts. They will work on it when they get the time but just like they have done so far development of the actual game will take priority over something like peripheral support that  of the player base will actually use. I assume your post is due to the recent news article about SC refocusing on VR in  if you actually read what was said by CIG you will see that these articles are reading too far into what was said and are hence exaggerating. ,starcitizen,cyo805u,5,t5_2v94d

They wont fly around without any fuel theyll fly to a station where they can buy fuel before they run out and they wont make trips if their fuel capacity doesnt provide enough range.

6168312,0,t1_cyqqdpj,Well the dk comfort level is a non issue for me. The longest play session Ive had with it is hrs in elite. The only discomfort really was a sweaty face afterwards since in addition to the rift I was wearing giant headphones. It was also slightly disorienting because when I put the rift on the room was lit by sunlight and when I took it off it was pitch dark. That took a bit of getting used to for maybe  seconds. But other than that its pretty nice. The other nit pick is maybe the lens fog. I got around it by resting the rift for  minutes over my head before putting it over my face this equalizes the temp of the rift to my body...hence no fogging. My biggest issue with the rift is resolution and number two the number of wires that are all over my pc area what with an x a g  headphones and the rift.

The screens.  HTC mainly produces what?  Cell phones.  Cell phones most expensive component is what?  The screens.Point is HTC already has a leg up in VR with being able to get screens at a likely cheaper price than Oculus could even with Facebook backing them.

It was is? Pretty sure its still around twitch based combat so there was a definite element of strategy and tactics behind what ship to use at what range when to use what weapons and whether its better to close to beam weapon range or not and smaller ships frigates destroyers and some cruisers could wage EWarfare missile boats were common for standoff situations.If anything cap ship battles were generally determined by numbers only in v did individual skill play much of a role. v and up the team that won generally had the best communication between players not counting if one team is using T dreads and the other is using T but thats not exactly an even matchup anyways.,starcitizen,cyurzxc,2,t5_2v94d

6270495,0,t1_cz2d8fu,In space its always more difficult to get on an opponents  due to the abilities of spacecraft to spin freely.Which brings in the benefit of decoupled mode. Decoupled mode allows your thrusters to operate independently so you can change your orientation much faster you can easily strafe fall or rise depending your perspective. In coupled mode your ship in simple terms operate more like a classic airplane. Main thrusters push you forward and you can make small adjustments as needed but spinning freely will take longer. ,starcitizen,cz2dvkt,3,t5_2v94d

But when you cant jump to any system without being hunted down because of it then maybe youll learn you lesson.I really dont want to see CIG interfering with players when its something like this. Trash talking trolling or just being an asshole needs to be handled by the players.

If it kept recentering people would have a much harder time aiming.I suggest switching to the alternate mouse control mode via CTRLC and trying it out. This is much more like the mouse controls that you see in most flight games.

6362079,0,t3_42rsq8,I think you hit it right on the head without realizing it.  You quoted that they said SM includes animation fidelity and attention to detail that you wouldnt normally expect in an alpha gameplay module.Its this reason that they realized the FPS is still way too buggy to release in the way they promised SM would be a polished game mode.  If you think about it they had to pull the new EVA systems from the latest . update because it was STILL not ready for primetime.  About  months after they had originally expected to release SM and the EVA system we have in the mini PU is still a placeholder because they still arent happy with the full fledged version.Chris promised high standards for Star Marine and realized that in its current state they cant meet those high standards.  And now theyve redirected their efforts on other parts of the projects SM will have to wait even longer to be at that level of polish that Chris expects and promised.  It sounds to me like he refuses to release it until it meets his standards but he realizes they need the team focusing on the core game engine before his standards can be met.,starcitizen,czcsqa9,7,t5_2v94d

You also cant replace a turrets weapons with any other guns at the moment.or how to give the pilot back the ability to slave the turret?With . all turrets can only be controlled by a person in the turret not by the pilot. The devs are working on a system to allow weapons to have different control points but right now they have to choose between pilotonly or gunneronly. Since this is alpha testing CIG would rather have people test the turrets so they chose gunneronly. I replaced the displacers with the whatever gun from the turret loaded the proper ammo but cannot for the life of me figure out how to assign fire groups... With apparently no HUD and no access to the onboard weapons screen.You can use the hotkeys to access your weapon screens on the multifunction displays or look at them with freelook and press right altspace to bring up the mouse cursor. The hotkeys are right altwsad to switch between display screens.For the Cutlass it should be the bottomleft screen.

6378252,0,t3_4307wa,There was a pretty good thread here about PictureinPicture technology in Star Citizen the other day. Programmers had initially said that the additional rendering would cost too much performance for what you would get out of it and CryEngine didnt really have a builtin feature for it so they planned to leave it alone. Apparently something happened with it over the last year though because another programmer for SC mentioned how they could definitely do PiP but it would still cost quite a bit and given how unoptimized the game is even right now.. probably still werent going to do it.    But more importantly they mention its the rerendering of the lighting in the PiP that kills your machine so if they simply rendered simplified images like grainy or blackandwhite lower resolution etc. it would definitely be feasible. I would really like the idea of blackandwhite or thermal imaging security cameras on ship. Or at least for a rearview mirror. ,starcitizen,czemzjy,2,t5_2v94d

6388865,0,t1_czft8ml,there is a fine balance between immersion and tedium. there are a few games that I played that were literally flip switching simulators the original steel battalion comes to mind and they were really fun games. but you need to really enter that magic circle in order for that to be effective. Ive used voice attack and power grid they are pretty cool little tools. I have run into issues in the past with VA when using team speak or other voip services which has led me to find its usefulness limiting also what happens if somebody is mute? completely useless for them. Roccat is a fun little toy power management and shields is a real treat with it. but there are issues of cost that come with it first you need a phone or tablet then you need to either have or make a stand for it and sometimes for your different applications the grids cost money. not to mention that it kind of goes to hell if somebody phones you. I get what you are saying we as players have options but they are at times bulky and not ideal.as for overhauling the UX and creating a unified experience for new players adding options for players to have their ships to run they way they want to without having to dick around with toggling options like a mad man or installing rd party software is a pretty key thing. have you ever sat friends down infront of your computer and had them try the game? trying to explain how all the flight modes work and what buttons to press and not press is quite funny but also experience breaking for all parties involved. sure having a setup that works as a catchall default is great at first and encouraging people to explore the flight system to figure out what works for them is also important but theres a next step in the user experience we are missing. it would only make things better for players new and old to be able to set these defaults. all im saying is that we look at the whole UX not just the bits and pieces that apply right now this second.maybe the vision is to tie it into persistence and the different ifcs modules thats fine but there are solutions to that. make a menu in the holotable that sets ifcs and weapon group defaults we already have the holotable and we already have to respec our ships every time we log in we are used to this and it would work out. it just gives us options.,starcitizen,czfuiw1,1,t5_2v94d

Regular maneuvering does not consume fuel however using quantum travel does consume fuel and eventually using jump points will also consume fuel.   You will have to refill fuel at stations planets and so on. Players will also be able to collect refine and sell fuel.  By the dynamic economy supply and demand. However since NPCs outnumber the players in the economy the prices can only fluctuate so much.   Expected to be a small  overall similar to repair costs ammo costs insurance and etc. Of course it could fluctuate a little based on the economy.   Both. The ship design and the equipment being used thruster powerplant etc will influence fuel economy.   Depends on the ship and once again equipment. Some small ships will be able to keep up just fine with bigger ships other more role focused ships may not be able to.   There are no player cars afaik.  Unknown. ,starcitizen,czk8sg1,3,t5_2v94d

Upgrading ships will be a big part of the game.   If previous video game history is any guide the potential for upgrading a bigger better hull will be higher than a cheaper hull so for hypothetical example you could upgrade a Freelancer to be closer to a Constellation but you couldnt get as close trying to upgrade an Aurora. So its worth putting some value in your basic chassis because thats going to come with a lot of insurance youll want to hang onto it at least until the insurance expires at which time the cost is the same for keeping it or discarding it for a newerbigger ship. ,starcitizen,czlu6j2,1,t5_2v94d

Dont try to go fast at least not at first. Concentrate on just getting around the track in one piece. Then you can work on adding speed and improving your technique.  Keep gsafe and comstab on until you get comfortable getting around the track then experiment with turning them off. You can take your time in the solo race track as there is no time limit. Also before going into an actual race go to your hangar and use the holotable to strip off all weapon and missiles.

Mobiglass is for supervising porters when you hired them. There is even a dedicated multicrew station for loadmaster in Hull D and Hull E. It isnt instant but it may be quicker than group of players manually loading cargo and it would be quicker than one player manually loading cargo.There is few star systems without any large jumppoint you need smaller ships to travel to these systems. Also Hull D and Hull E cant land on and take off from planets. Hull D have  times more cargo capacity than BMM and Hull C so these ships can find shortcuts from medium jumppoints for some trade runs but cargo have to physically occupy space and these ship dont even have a flight ready model yet.gt  PvP slider.PVP slider at min do not means you would not see other players and PVP slider at max do not means you would see everyonly players.,starcitizen,czngbz3,1,t5_2v94d
6462080,0,t1_czne2ua,The problem with worn gimbal systems is that without an external reference or a predictable motive force the inertial tracking system in them can either be hideously expensive or get near constant errors that add up.   In gaming terms if you like to roll left and pull into turns for attacks youre gonna have a bad time as your head starts to drift up and right to maintain alignment.Track IR uses a fixed sensor position to track a profile image  while it isnt necessarily as moment accurate as a gyro system it literally cannot drift.  The systems in independant VR helmets that dont have reference bases can drift constantly and can even become drifty where the code to align them gets outofwhack while you use them.  Theres likely to be a reset button in most applications but the end result is a slightly ever changing nontheraputic load on your neck and the equipment will almost always drift in the same direction.  How this is compensated for in situations of frame lag is very very important to the gaming experience but no matter how accurate youre talking about it will still drift if the sensor is not externally referenced.   Gravity systems that use little balls are absurdly selfcorrecting but every time youd move your head theyd jerk around and dance until they naturally reached balance again.So VR helmets that dont use external references will not stay accurate over long gaming sessions  thus the angle of your head may vary a little bit or a lot over a half hour of gameplay using the VR hat as a control input device...   And if the drivers arent perfect you could end up with your visual axis and the aim point on the helmet not matching over the same period of time.Some of the most expensive parts in missiles and aircraft are the precise little inertial navigation gyros.INS are not cheap ,starcitizen,cznq0ur,1,t5_2v94d

6572335,0,t1_czz1xaq,gtrun around the stationWhen you are running around the station find this room and use one of the terminals to request your ship. Terminal will tell you the landing pad your ship is waiting. You can see where is your ship in your HUD too but if you interact with another ship HUD will start showing last ship you interacted. Find the nearest airlock to landing pad your ship landed. There is a button on the side of airlock to open it. When its interior doors opened you will see another button on the wall it will close the opened door and then open other door. Find you ship and then press F to use mobiglas. There is a journal in mobiglas where you can read about missions.After takeoff if your speed is limited to ms press V. V is the key to switch  different flight mode. Precision mode is for landing an it is caped at ms for all ships. Space Combat Maneuvering mode is the flight mode you were using in AC. Cruise mode will use your ships main thrusters at their full capacity so max speed is higher but maneuvering is harder.But Cruise mode isnt fast enough to travel to even nearest Comm Array. Someone tried it and he reached after  hours. If you press B you can see Point of Interests saved in your ship computer. When you activated Comm Array your ship computer will have more POIs but you dont need POI to use Quantum Drive. After pressing B move your ships nose to where you want to fly and press middle mouse button. If ships nose was pointing to a POI ship will automatically deactivate Quantum Drive when you arrived but without POI you have to manually deactivate Quantum Drive with pressing middle mouse button. ,starcitizen,czz4tyr,6,t5_2v94d
6572778,0,t3_45l065,While Im not against this idea in general I think the range is just too large.  If Quantum travel ends up being anything like it is now we end our jumps km from our target.  If you then activate a km warp interdiction field you need to fly at max cruise for along time even if the Idris is stationary.  If the Interdiction ship has Vanguard escorts then you have essentially created an unescapeable killing field as nothing randomly jumping in can scratch an Idris and no ships can outrun a Vanguard in cruise.  Further if you try to joust with the Vanguards reversing direction in cruise then you arent escaping the field at all you need constant speed away.  For minutes and minutes. It just feels too strong to me.All that said I still like the idea but at something like km.  That way its a serious tactical consideration you need to lure ships far into the zone turn on the well and kill them before the can get out.

6591918,1,t1_d012uzr,The concern is that the majority of detail are in the textures custom normals decals etc. The workflow in AAA realistic games is incredible. You can get high res models even without adding additional polygons. That has been normal in the industry to use normal specular etc maps to give the illusion of detail meanwhile now a days there are a lot more efficient better looking and more complicated ways of doing it. In film for example you also optimize polycounts by using displacement maps. All of this stuff is important. All of this stuff is what makes any D object shine! Criticizing a work in progress without its textures really makes little sense as game art most of the time has all of its detail and areas of importance in its textures.Star Citizen is most likely using stateoftheart techniques to achieve the look they want. Looking at what has already been created there is a ton of detail already It wouldnt make sense if a single ship suddenly came out without any detail. Thats why to me.

6592090,0,t1_d0165jc,gt drop inout coop was removed only from the initial playthrough of the game youll get to do it in specific missions in the simpod.gt This wasnt done because of some logistical or technical issue or because of a lack of funds or time. This was done because it would make a mess of the story in SQ the choice you make having a permanent effect on the character you bring to the PU. And youll have thousands of hours in which to play cooperatively with your friends there.gt Do you honestly think this is a good reason to start seeking a refund?I would yes. I tend to play coop games with the wife and this would actually have been great fun I loved the coop in Freelancer where you could play through the whole campaign with two players and this was something that was promised.I have not been seeking a refund for a very simple reason I have given this money not as payment in return for some goods but as a pledge and unlike CIG I like to keep up my end of the bargain even if it means being out of .

What about Godus by Molyneux being delayed constantly and it is crowdfunded as well? Also what about The Division Watch Dogs Witcher  Fallout  and countless others receiving downgrades to work on consoles. Games with Multiplayer systems shoved into them because the publisher says so which cuts their ability to work more on the main game.Does CIG need to be a bit more strict  yes yes they do no question  Cutlass owners should have been told to fuck off into their little hole in the ground and ignored  instead it gets a redesign and then its split into a new ship. Chewing up resources that could have been used to make ships still waiting. Oddly a lot of the Goonrathi members seemed to be the ones pushing CIG to waste resources and time fixing up their precious widdly ship.

6701056,0,t3_47cs63,Looking at the real world handguns run the gamut from the PMR  rounds in a magazine fast reloads lowmoderate damage low recoil to the SampW   round revolver slow reloads extreme damage extreme recoil to small concealable weapons like the LCP low capacity fast reloads low damage moderatehigh recoil to the G fully automatic  round magazine fast reloads moderate damage high recoil when firing automatic.  I think representing all those categories would be great and some players might find that all they ever need is a sidearm which they will have on them at all times.I think that rifles and shotguns will always still play a role but you shouldnt be able to just have one in your inventory and pull it out if things start to get hot youll have to make sure you sling it over your shoulder when you get out of your pilots seat and it should be visible to everyone around that you are packing that extra heat.  In a boardingfps action situation assault weapons are going to be the goto choice but most crew wont carry them regularly unless they are expecting trouble then youll pull them out of the weapons locker.I love the discussion about security zones and that reputation should impact who can carry what where but I think there must also be concealable weapons that a person could carry anywhere but if you use it and you werent supposed to have it you would get into trouble unless its Lawful self defense. ,starcitizen,d0cg40r,2,t5_2v94d

6734781,0,t1_d0fruxu,Sorry OP. Youre completely missing the point that this attention to detail mechanic you think is great is just a feature of optical physics that the CryEngine has been capable of rendering for years now due to very solid optimizations. Now however it isnt very impressive for anything built on the CryEngine to enable if its even something you can toggle this feature because according to Moores law  the average processor is  times more powerful than when Crysis  came out. Also rendering has nothing to do with whether its an MMO or not and is  a feature of the engine the game is built on. The server streams meta and location data to the client which draws on assets and dynamic rendering algorithms to generate the visuals you see. Youre misinterpretation of what attention to detail means in this scenario is what is garnering you down votes.

For example you use to not be able to do that unless you were a profession that allowed you to move on cliffs there was a stat call terrain navigation or something along those lines that controlled how fast you move up cliffs but as time went on and the stat was eventually removed they said Fuck it cliffs dont matter.,starcitizen,d0ggzry,3,t5_2v94d

6755393,0,t1_d0i155n,gtSure its not just the goons but the thing about the goons is they generally try to wreck and grief whatever game they get involved in look at Star Trek Online for another example  theyre famous for being griefers. This reputation they have isnt  misplaced theres a lot of examples that demonstrate the point.TESTBRAVE are guilty of this in other games too theyre infamous for their whelp mentality suicide fighting with lots and lots of new characters.Goons are the worst for it yes but you cant pretend theyre the ONLY people that do it.gtSure we know there will be areas in Star Citizen where if you go there youre asking to be ganked. If EliteDangerous shows us anything those areas will be fairly sparsely populated because gankers dont like having to fight with other gankers in the same way real world bullies dont like an even fight griefers only find joy in easy fights against unsuspecting victims. Certainly this has nothing to do with competitive PvP etc etc. Uhh... I think youre mistaking world PVP for griefing. I dont see this as griefing at all and just a part of space sim life. If youre going to travel in dangerous space dont complain when you get jumped by a wolf pack its not griefing its just a part of life.This is where I start to hate the SC community they want a game where you can do whatever you want but they also want to be complete carebears.,starcitizen,d0i2blm,1,t5_2v94d

6758125,0,t1_d0ibpcp,AFAIK they allocate  cpu cores per instance currently. In a cloud infrastructure one isnt renting servers theyre renting compute resources. Larger instances with more people at once means more resources. I get your point but I dont think they can instantly allocate more cores to an instance. That is why they are attempting to merge multiple instances. If their baseline instance is for  people is  cores which they then reserve for that instance regardless of whether there are  people or less. Now consider that instances are designed at worst case to house  people then they would need to reserve  cores for such an instance.,starcitizen,d0ichn5,1,t5_2v94d

I suppose backup generators could keep you alive for some extra time but chances are those will be destroyed as well. Personally for me I would like the see oxygen limited significantly. Something like  mins. Planet side you could travel with oxygen packs or drive a buggy with a few tanks of oxygen. Space stations could just have little emergency oxygen canisters hidden away in case of emergency. In the end I just dont want to have to wait  mins or whatever it could be just to suffocate and respawn. Though I think NPC rescue in a timely manner is solid.

Recently declassified documents show just how close we came to war during what became known as the Horus Incident. Working in conjunction with Aegis the Navy deployed a prototype AIpiloted Overlord bomber wing along the XiAn front. Their hearts were in the right place it was an attempt to bring home pilots that had been stationed along the Perry Line for their entire careers. But when Aegis billioncredit babies decided that their comms were compromised and shut them off  just in time to miss their recall order  we had to chase down and destroy our own mistake the death knell for Aegis in the shipbuilding industry. Again we arent sure that they would have plunged us into allout war with the XiAn by wandering around unsupervised in the neutral zone but what might they have done?Found here Yeah that was more of a mistake of programming rather than a conscious decision by AI to take an action independent of their original programming.

To be upset because a ship is more or less rare feels a little ridiculous.  The guy who pledged the Aurora LN and the guy whos got an LTI version of every ship to date will still have the same opportunity to own the same number of any ship once the game goes live.

6983438,0,t3_4bbms8,Im afraid the fixed Vanguard nose might be a conscious choice from CIG having a tight weapon grouping is extremely powerful in the hands of a skilled mouse user.Read the above as guaranteed hit look at how fast Starwraith clears each enemy at  when they are close Or look at anyone unlucky enough to close range brawl with Malygos or any of the top gimbal pilots... unfortunately staying afar only helps marginally D The volley damage from xM lasers sits almost exactly halfway between a hit of the size  Vanduul Plasma and Neutron guns and is equal to the damage of  Broadswords .On the Sabre two will almost always hit while the others become progressively more luck than skill because of the spacing.That is before you consider the rate of fire and projectile speed.In fact I have been eagerly awaiting fixed SSSx mounts with doubletriplex S for that same reason the stats show that having more weapons is better than having bigger ones.They could balance it by making smaller units draw more power or heat up faster when parallelized...Note the word balance here is intended as the performance relationship between sizes I firmly disagree with the whole concept of ship balance in the PU as this direct ship comparison is only relevant in AC. In the PU there is practically zero you will ever face off against a single matched opponent. Component upgrades come into play opponent numbers etc... Any pirate ballsy enough to roam solo will probably have a short career.I also hope CIG will push the importance of dying the feeling of loss I used to get in EVE when I lost a ship here we have insurance to soften a lot of the impact stakes should be high enough to dissuade cheap ship zerging and make each encounter count with escape as first option.IMHO trying to balance ships flattens diversity and team gameplay. Like you mentioned in the video each ship should have strengths and weakesses the shield on the Sabre is probaly another voluntary choice by CIG... and bringing diversity to a battle should be encouraged.Also please make a missile video I loved the others!

They have staff actively working on optimization and other things and it takes time. There is a way to play in an offline mode by using Cheat Engine and I was getting around  fps in Crusader. I only have GB RAM and a GTX and an i processor so its definitely the servers. The servers are sending every player all the physics stuff for every item currently and they are reworking this for the new Item System. So that will increase fps significantly. So yes the bottleneck is the CPU but only because of the poor optimization in the servers. Hope that helps.,starcitizen,d1951jx,3,t5_2v94d

7005182,0,t1_d1ack6q,Chris did say this in a series of official forum posts yes.gt Horses mouth here.gt The discussion about Australian servers was taken out of context.gt The issue is that were building our PU server framework on Google Compute and doing a lot of things like dynamically spinning up and down servers on demand. It is possible for us to have a non Google Compute server extension but that will require additional logic and code. So for the early stages like preStar Citizen v. launch we will probably be limited to places where Google Compute is available. Which is where Singapore came up as I believe the closest Google Compute data server to Australia is based there. If Google sets up a data center locally to Australia then we would enable nodes there. In fact part of the design we are going for is to allow us to spin up and down game servers via Google Compute as geographically colocated as possible  not just limited to the usual suspects like North America Europe and Asia Pacific. This is the longer term goal but one where you get to harness the true power of cloud computing for a better game experience.gt p.s. I am writing this from Australia andgt Does everyone assuming the worst and raging on here realizes that the only servers that anyone is playing on are in North America at the moment?gt I did NOT say there would not be servers in Australia. And contrary to everyones outrage the M stretch goal doesnt promise servers in Australia right away. What we said was that our initial plan was to spin up servers in North America then slowly expand to have servers in other areas like Europe and Australia once we launch to help decrease latency. The M stretch goal was to allow us to start this sooner and allowing for servers in more than just North America for the early testing. We are STILL doing this. The stretch goal did not say Australia gets a server right away for early test BEFORE everyone else but North America.gt For the record we currently spend north of K a month on a combination of our servers and CDN Content Delivery Network. This is all for early testing  it costs money for everyone to download the patches yes were working on making them smaller and to have servers running . This doesnt include the Live Ops cost of people that maintain this  currently we have a  person team that focuses on this this doesnt include the web team of Turbulent BTW. Im pretty sure were investing much more than anyone else to keep its community involved and up to date on a game thats still deep in development.gt We have chosen Google Compute for our initial cloud implementation as we think its the best combination of power price and flexibility. We are attempting to build a dynamic server system where local nodes can be spun up to handle the hifidelity server instances in areas that would help reduce the ping for people that are matched together. Arena Commander is our test bed for this. When you join a multiplayer match you are currently connected to a game server by the matchmaking service. This server eventually will spin up on demand in an appropriate location to the people that the match maker has put together. In the PU as you travel around a Star System or jump from one to another every time you come out of warp or jump youll be handed off to one of these server instances that will be spun up on demand taking into account where the people that have been contextually matched together are playing from. As were first prototyping  building on Google Compute this will naturally happen where there are Google Compute data centers. With some extra work we can fold other Linux Server Cloud providers into the matchmaking and server management. But it doesnt make sense to do this before weve even finished the base system on Google Compute. Right now we spin up a fixed number of servers in the Google NA data center for the current multiplayer. One of the ongoing engineering tasks is to make this dynamic based on demand and then at different data centers around the world. Once this happens we would be ready to expand it to other cloud server providers if need be. Its pretty likely that Australia will get a local Google Compute data center before this but if not we would spend a little extra time making the backend system game server provider agnostic.gt So I would appreciate it if everyone put their pitchforks down took a deep breath and actually be happy that were thinking about how best to use the power of the cloud to allow for a better game experience for everyone Australians included.and... gt The biggest single area for Star Citizen is the USA at  the next is Germany at  then the UK at  then Australia and Canada are tied at  each.gt There is a large team of people working very hard to fulfill a very large vision. Many things are being worked on in parallel. One of them is a flexible and dynamic back end that should help reduce latency in matches assuming there are enough players in a colocated to make a local instance viable. I just wrote a detailed post outlining the concept and where we are in its implementation. Its kind of hard to have servers in multiple geographic locations before the dynamic server system is completed. Once it is we will start spinning up local game servers on demand based on where the players are in automatically matchmaked games. You will also be able to override this in the case you want to play with your friends in the US or somewhere else in the worldgt As the largest group of backers are in the US and the backend team and live ops are all in the US it is common sense that the first servers would be in North America. That has always been the plan. With the M stretch goal we decided to accelerate our plans to have geographically colocated servers to handle the low latency game servers as we now have the funds to cover the additional operational and engineering costs that this entails. This is in process.gt I know patience is a hard thing to have but these things dont instantly happen.gt Remember everyone isnt playing Arena Commander v. yet let alone the later versions like . and . that bring the full suite of space combat features to play so please dont expect a full featured backend just yet.gt And for everyone who is wondering Im not still in Australia  just suffering from Jet Lag and need to sleep rather than play forum warrior!gt Night all!Note that what youre looking at is a majority of the forum posts Chris has made in the last year and a half Then theres the fact that his wife is Australian.

My opinion is that well be jumping a couple of times in SQ.We also know that Delamar on Nyx is being built and Terra prime is already inengine but Hurston Crusader and Microtech are still the focus and the thing were most likely to see next. Its not known whether the focus on these locations outside of Stanton are technical they present the best location to refine their development pipeline with or are required for SQ. Remember Crusader what were playing now is not a system. Crusader is a single planet of the Stanton system and the system includes Hurston ArcCorp and Microtech.,starcitizen,d1ekd7h,2,t5_2v94d

They have showed some demos of various landing zones that are near completion but no specifics for space stations and other maps like crusader. But Im sure there is a lot in the works.Also keep in mind that Squadron  is coming out this year. That means all those required assets and maps will need to be completed before the year it out.

7047877,0,t3_4c5ct4,gtI realize many of us did just buy our ships because we wanted to see and play with them immediately but its a matter of terminology here. If youre spending money specifically to advance in a game youre paying to win regardless of whether or not it helps the devs. Youre absolutely delusional if you think a majority of people are buying  ships because they want CIG to have even more money. Theyre buying these in game items because they want to use them in game. Its not a matter of terminology unless you want to twist words to fit your personal narrative so you can feel better about the fact that currently this game IS pay to win.,starcitizen,d1f8gjv,14,t5_2v94d

Swaying while aiming during movement makes sense  the world should seem to move with relation to the gun sights. But when you stop moving that relative motion should cease instantly.

7062518,0,t3_4ccfb2,Transcript by CanadianSyrup Shiver Bathory Stormy Winters Sunjammer WangPhat DesmariusTLDRToo LongDidnt Read Q What are your jobs and responsibilities in your role with CIG? A A lot of travelling around to the different offices to manage and make sure they are running smoothly. Erin is also in charge of the UK studio and runs Foundry there as well as some responsibilities in the Frankfurt office which falls under the Foundry  wing. Q How much of the Shubin Mining Platforms interior will we be able to explore in SQ? A Lots! Theres lots of different rooms areas manufacturing plants and the like. Theres different landing platforms different places to enter and lots of stuff to do inside. Q Is Squadron s featurelist final? Will there be any additions or removals? A It is finalized whats going into Squadron . It is known exactly whats going to be in the game there will be no more rounds of cuts. Weve had that known since last year. There is also shooting in a few weeks to catch any missing footage they need. Q Could you explain the differences in your and Chris roles within the same company while pointing out the benefits and challenges of working with your brother? A  Chris provides a vision and direction and pushes the envelope on technology and design whereas I offer counterpoints and make the practicalities of his vision a reality via scheduling logistics etc. Q How much will we interact with NPC crew and wingmen? A A lot of effort has been put into making sure the AI have roles and really feel alive. NPCs will respond to the way you talk to them on the ship and the way you treat them when on a mission. The target is to make the player feel as attached to NPCs as they can Q Does the landing zone pipeline benefit from improvements to the ship pipeline? Are landing zones still in development or do they need the procedural technology to be completed first?                                    A Some of the ways we do things to build ships faster also benefit the environment pipeline. The environment pipeline is designed to be very modular but not to look repetitive. Going forward we will be able to create large complex and detailed areas for the PU were already doing this for SQ. The procedural stuff will come online later this year with the new streaming tech. Q Do you ever find yourself being challenged with a dream big mentality vs a be realistic mentality? A Focused on getting the cores features and some of the smaller things around it. Yes its a big task to work out next steps and focusing it down from there. Q What will the Squadron  team do after the first episode is released? A Well go out for drinks and then go straight to work on Episode Two. Theres more ships and environments to create along with other elements but we will be supporting the PU and creating ships for that as well. Q Has your experience with the Lego series or other past games helped you with CIG at all?  A Star Citizen is hard to compare anything to but the work on the Lego series helped teach about scheduling and organisation. But keeping tight to the schedule has been the biggest lesson brought over from previous works. Q Next major milestone youre excited about? A Getting the Starfarer flyable into your hands. Were already flying it and look forward to having players fly it in the near future Persistence is very close. So shopping and buying stuff and will introduce Alpha UEC which allows us to test the currency that will be used in the PU. Procedural tech integration is coming soon after persistence which will make a huge difference because its not just planets but everything else is affected as well.Full TranscriptIntro Erin Roberts ER Hi everyone and welcome to another episode of  for the Chairman. Im filling in for Chris this week. Hes actually in the UK working on Squadron  and Im gonna be in the USA for three weeks Im spending a week here in LA and then  two weeks in Austin catching up with everybody. Im working with actually Tony Zurovec and Todd Papy and people who do a bunch of the PU design stuff discussions over here and so on and so forth. So Im really looking forward to that. As always Id like to thank subscribers for making this happen. Anyways lets get straight into this with some questions. So first question I got here is from... Josh asks What do you do on a day to day basis to help keep things moving within CIG and what are your responsibilities as Global Head of Production? ER So theres a couple of things I do because theres one is. Obviously as you say im Global Head of Production so that involves a lot more travel in terms of going around the different offices coordinating with the different production faults and making sure we have our plans for what were delivering and the different masters not only for Squadron  but also on the Persistent Universe theres a lot of planning and were just making sure we have the right resources in the right places and the right the ownership of which studios and so forth. So theres a lot of that level of things. But also I directly run the UK office and so theres a lot of stuff I do on that side and also when im travelling im very fortunate to have some very good support staff in the office which keep things moving while im away. So theres basically two levels theres one thats a much more global level and theres also just the much of a micro level on the office level in the UK. So thats basically the two different responsibilities that I juggle a lot. As well as the Frankfurt office is actually part of Foundry  and although thats managed by Brian who does an awesome job over there as well I have some responsibilities for that side as well. Amontillado asks Weve heard that stations like the Shubin Mining Platform in SQ are going to be as much as  km long. In the baby PU today we have large stations like Port Olisar but can only access much smaller portions on it. How much of Shubins interior can we expect to be able to explore in the SQ? Lots! Obviously Port Olisar is just a place for you to spawn get your ships and move out. In Squadron  and also as youll see much more space stations and environments come into the Persistent Universe there will be very huge areas you can run round. And so it wont be just one or two rooms its actually a huge installation and you can  theres lots of different rooms areas manufacturing plants and so forth within this huge installation. So yes its not just like a large external you know looks externally large but theres isnt much you can do inside. Theres different landing platforms different places to enter and a lot of stuff to do inside. So yes its a huge first person environment inside the stuff in Squadron  and also youll see that within the Persistent Universe. Daz asks When Squadron  is released do you expect to get all features you hope for into the final release? Or so you see the possibility of either cutting certain nice to have features in for launch or adding not yet available technologies to episode  in a later patch? So weve already been working on that sort of round of what we want put into Squadron . So weve known for a while exactly what were putting in and were working towards that so theres no more rounds of cuts or other things well be taking out. Its just really just working through exactly what we know we want in the game for the first episode of Squadron  and so the plan is we will go with what we have we will work towards getting that in and have it to you guys obviously as soon as possible. Yeah at the moment weve already had those discussions actually last year in terms of what kind of stuff we were going to take out and what we werent and so forth. So at the moment weve got a very tight plan of exactly what content is going in there and what levels will be like and so forth and also we know exactly what were doing with shooting in a few weeks which is just a sort of catchup of stuff we didnt get in the last one right so in week two were doing just to get the last material and then thats basically whats going to go into the game at the moment what we have is what we plan to put into the game. Doc asks Could you explain the difference of your role in the company to that of Chris? Where do you see the challenges and benefits to work with a close family member on the same project? Chris and I worked together for a lot of years so Im... obviously I was working with him for  years while Chris was making films and stuff. Obviously in the early days I worked on Wing Commander with him Strike Commander Privateer  and then of course at Digital Anvil we did Star Lancer and stuff like that as well.  So weve got a pretty good working relationship. Obviously we have disagreements about stuff but at the end of the day I feel we both listen to each other and at the end of the day Chris is the CEO.  So if we have a discussion and he wants to go in a certain direction and I cant convince him thats the direction we go but our relationship in that side of things is really good.,starcitizen,d1gwbf5,53,t5_2v94d

7091695,0,t3_4cp3d6,What exactly would they be adding a second seat for? As far as I can tell its simply to appease those who pledged for it off of concept.What exactly is the copilot supposed to do? It doesnt have enough hardpoints to justify the need for a second gunner like a SH does it doesnt have secondary functions and the need for an optimal gunnery position like the Reliant. As far as I can tell the copilot would do nothing more than sit there and add mass to whats supposed to be one of the most agile ships in the game. You could slap on some extra hardpoints and give it a second seat but at the end of the day the price is supposed to be justified because its an exotic ship reflecting its rarity and moderating its ownership on that basis.You could play this game all day with CIG but the bottom line is that each ship is supposed to have a specific niche in the lineup Theres an overall vision for what role each ship is supposed to play. And because that role might not be apparent to us with the limited implementation of the current build its best to give CIG the benefit of the doubt and let them design the ships as they see fit. ,starcitizen,d1k7nr0,3,t5_2v94d

We did debate the merits of growing so big but were already doing weekly events and there hasnt been any real conflicts and I think everyone is engaged.

7149524,0,t1_d1qt85z,gt We dont know that. The PU isnt even close to being in beta yet so who knows? Maybe having two people on a ship will more than double the total earnings.Impossible as far as logic is concerned.   If this is true  then it forces players into roles that are not enjoyable for the sake of increased earning which will cause resentment and eventually kill the game.  We assume CIG are not bad game designers so this will not eventuate.gt Well I doubt that if there was nothing to do then I dont see any issue. Its not really afk because I can just tab back in as soon as were in any danger.You make a big assumption here.  An example of the scenario youre talking about is Mechwarrior Online a generally unsuccessful game from PGI.   The matches take  minutes to form and when they do it takes another  minutes for any action to take place within the game after which theres another  minutes for the player to be able to requeue to repeat the process.This leads to up to  minutes where youre twiddling your thumbs between games.  The developer solved this problem by instituting a punishment mechanism for players who surprisingly may not have been paying attention throughout every moment of the entire ordeal.I dare you to stare at my post and reread it constantly for  minutes in case I make any surprise edits and then at the end of that time tell me youd support that gameplay and pledge thousands of dollars to repeat it.Edit Surprise edit.

And that most certainly also includes stuff that is available ingame if its so inconvenient and hard to get that almost noone has it.That free to play payment model of SC is what has stopped me from making further contributions. The way they use and handle ship sales has left me with an uneasy feeling if theyll actually manage to properly balance the game in that regard.  I dont need The Next Best Starship I just want to fly different great ships to have different but great experiences. Im willing to pay for that convenience  but Im not willing to pay just to escape a constant level of inconvenience placed on players.

7213103,0,t3_4e4v9x,IDK if were being honest Im just sad that I know people with fewer reports and fewer contributions than me who got invites I think because they log more hours in the PTU.  I mean the way they pick people isnt clear but also the fact they werent up front about it and the NDA part are sort of... not consistent with the level of openness consistent with the expectations RSI has set. Also why the NDA? I mean I get that theyre testing extracrashy unstable Alphas... but thats what alphas are so I dont see why the NDAs the photo IDs and all that jazz. The reality is that any change can be difficult but CIG sort of did itself in by not just announcing the change. When theres a communications failure the immediate question is whether the failure was an issue of intent or competence. Had Wills post come before the email was all over the internet itd be a bit of a different beast. Also though the part that hasnt been explained why not use the existing PTU selection process but just start with smaller more selective batches instead of this emailinvite method that ostensibly would target the same testers...TLDR The change itself doesnt seem like a big deal to me but they could have handled the comms surrounding the change better.,starcitizen,d1y2nxw,1,t5_2v94d

An attempt to manipulate the Jita market biggest trade hub in EVE by suicide ganking any freightershaulers supplying the hub. Here is a great dev article on the effects of it What simply happened was the market shifted to the other trade hubs during this playerdriven event while hours of immense player content were generate by both the forces trying to disrupt the market ultimately failing to do so and those counterattacking these aggressors.Furthermore the greatest shifts in EVE economy has always come from developers in forms of minor adjustments to value of various minerals in forms of new base resoure requirements new ships etc. So while EVE economy is definitely playerdriven it has never been playercontrolled.,starcitizen,d1y7xmd,5,t5_2v94d

7233798,0,t3_4ehj4y,Hey there. Recently bought the game Ive been doing some dogfighting and losing in expected fashion. However Ive quickly come to the realization that the basic ship models are practically useless against the higher end ships avengers etc.Im aware you can purchase upgrades with real life money but how do you go about upgrading the ship using ingame methods? Or is this just a pay to win game that Ive already bought?,starcitizen,d20fhrh,7,t5_2v94d
7234128,0,t1_d20g7o2,Yeah youre right my verbage at the end there probably wasnt the best. I more meant break in the sense of changes the way many people probably think the game will be played. Im not trying to say thats a bad thing but just something that needs to be accounted for in some way.The rescuing someone in EVA example. My guess is that many people think this will be as simple as the person in EVA activating a beacon and the rescuer locating that beacon and allowing the person in EVA to come on board. If that person is traveling at xx ms and out of EVA fuel its going to be very unlikely that any PC could rescue that person without use of some special yet announced tech as catching them in your ship going xx ms would likely kill the EVAer. Or hell even being able to get ahead of them enough to be in position to catch them would be a task unto itself. Not to mention before that person is saved theres is a very high likelihood that given their inability to change velocity vectors substantially that theyll die by hitting some object in space. So yeah maybe you give an EVA suit the ability to come to a complete stop somehow but that too seems fairly immersion breaking since coming to a hard stop like that would usually kill a person from gforces.I dont know man. Yeah maybe limiting ones EVA speed to  ms isnt the answer but I find it hard to believe that allowing a person to EVA as fast as any ship is either.,starcitizen,d20guf6,3,t5_2v94d

I totally sympathize with people. Id LOVE to see the Cat or Reclaimer. But I completely understand CIGs reasons for doing it this way. Prototype test and solidify mechanics then move to the next mechanic. Avoid doing large components wrong and going back to do them over which noone wants.

7250211,0,t1_d22a7ta,As a former EVE Online player and a Guns of Icarus player...  Youd really be surprised.  Organizations even small ones will likely organize regular mining operations throughout the week where X number of players attend.  The Org has  Orion and a few players have their own Prospector...  The Mining Foreman knows that he needs Y number of actual players on the Orion to operate it properly.  He selects which of the X number of players he needs as crew for the Orion and then selects which players Org mates that are volunteering for the operation will be flying escort fighters and which will be flying Prospectors. of the ore gathered gets sent to the Orgs industrial wing for processing into manufacturable goods that can be sold or turned into military assets aka building an Idris from the ground up or building  rounds of ammo.  The remaining  of ore would be valued priced at its processed value and sent to the Orgs industrial wing as well.  Each crew member would then get paid one or two share in wages.  Where a share would be...   maybe  of the value of  ore.For some people flying out alone is risky.  Between criminal pilots and NPC pirates operating your own Prospector in the middle of nowhere will be dangerous.  They may through the value or rare ores that would be easier to find in more dangerous space end up making more money hiring on as crew of an Orion than operating their own ship.  Or maybe they just want to learn how to manage a crew so that they can run their own Orion some day?  Or maybe they are a combat pilot thats low on funds and cant afford to equip his recently lost ship.There will be many many reasons why youd be better off as a crew member on an Orion than running your own Prospector.

The Tevarin race might have exactly what youre looking for. As lore has it first contact was made in the year  and in an effort to help them progress technologically they back stabbed us.. Story short we nearly wiped them off the universe. Anyway being that present day is  that dates the first contact at  years in the past. On top of that the Tevarin were technologically inferior to us. It has been stated that a cache of old Tevarin ships were uncovered somewhere and tech desigms were referenced. Plus and dont quote me on this I believe Big Daddy Chris even stated the possibility of finding these old ships derelict or on some market.

Its hard to get away from the technology unless you go true classic and then you might be paying extra. I imagine the future might be similar.

7326939,0,t1_d2b0u1m,gtThere are some refugees coming from EvE to SC and staying with TEST. I for example came from EvE because I hated how toxic it got.       TEST is mostly just a reddit based gaming group name that anyone can freely use there is TEST in STO CSGO even ARK Survival Evolved. Goons do a similar thing but I believe it is more regulated on who can use the name dont quote me on that though. So it is difficult for me at least to exactly identify who used what first. TEST EvE was not the first from what I was told.        TEST Alliance EvE was in alliance with Goons for awhile but right after I left Goons back stabbed TEST and took their territory in typical Goon fashion. The TEST Alliance leadership was rubbing elbows with Goons but a majority of TEST Alliance was not infavor of Goons. Since then I believe TEST has fallen reformed and is now taking back territory though I dont keep uptodate on this stuff anymore. TEST Squadron though some do troll but if it goes to far usually leadership tells them to knock it off. If it gets too bad as has happened twice in last month it is removal from the org.

7353396,0,t1_d2dzbj4,I thought the whole thing was that they werent pricing ships.  Everything you spend is a donation.  Its simple price discrimination.  People want the new thing the rare thing or the special thing and a lot of people are price insensitive.  When its an electronic good there is essentially zero marginal cost to sell it to you so everything they get is margin.  Theres no reason no to price the new rare or special things at ridiculous rates.  Lets be honest most people myself included arent buying many or any ships.  There are those however who will buy a lot of ships.  Within that group of people there will be competition informal to have the biggest rarest or most specialized ship.  Charge whatever you want while its basically useless then lower the price to get more buyers then include it in the product you were always paid to develop.  You just keep hitting up different groups with different price sensitivities.  Bottom line... this is a business not a video game.  Yet.  Once its a game the question is how much effort it takes to earn those ships that people paid frankly ridiculous sums of money to buy prelaunch.  Too long and you piss off the people who backed you too short and you piss off the people who backed you harder and have no problem complaining on the internet about being fucked by pricing that seems off to them.   ,starcitizen,d2e14fm,1,t5_2v94d

7411194,0,t1_d2kfsz1,Theres two reasons The first has to do with how floating point numbers work  the bigger the number gets the less accurate it gets. That can result in things like Kerbal Space Programs kraken a bug where a ship moving very fast or very far away would start jittering and eventually rip itself to pieces although I doubt SCs ships would do quite the same as theyre single pieces whereas KSP ships are a collection of rigid bodies. The other has to do with collision detection  in a computer simulation theres no such thing as continuous movement. Everything moves in discrete steps and while theres ways to ensure collisions happen those only work so well. For example some people make gravity generatorbased railguns in Space Engineers and in some testing videos you can see that the ammunition usually just chunks of stone didnt touch the first layer of armor but tore a chunk out of the ones farther back.,starcitizen,d2klr5x,1,t5_2v94d

The star collapses into the black hole at the end of its life. Some of the mass is expelled during the collapse aka supernova the rest is trapped in the signularity and the accretion disk. The black hole doesnt have a stronger gravity the mass is just confined in a smaller volume.The bigger issue with colonization would be that theres an active black hole where the star used to be bathing the whole system in intense gamma radiation.

7529572,0,t1_d2y081p,Eh yes and no. In this case the server performance and capacity will dictate other gameplay mechanics and development decisions so getting solid netcode in and working to a reasonably efficient degree will open doors in other areas of development. Also the new item inventory system has been something that should help netcode efficiency quite a bit so we should hopefully see some improvement soon.When there arent any other gameplay features that cant be completed or will be seriously impacted by poor optimization then well probably not see much further improvement until later in the Beta.,starcitizen,d2y2qi1,3,t5_2v94d

7534279,0,t3_4ig4cg,Its a little up in the air at the moment Newer ships such as the Reliant and the latest Constellation remodel have airlocks that can be cycled through well the fore crew elevator anyway its got a shroud thing around it so it can pressurize and depressurize without effecting the crew quarters above it. The rear cargo elevator still opens the cargo section to space.Im personally more of a fan of a star wars style shield holding the atmo in allowing big doors like the current Cutlass or Avenger. You just put on your space suit and hop out. It frees up a bit of internal space not needing big clunky airlocks and allows a bit more use of not just staying in a space suit  of the time as a hull breach is no longer a death sentence to anyone on board and unprepared. As long as the shields hold anyway.Could even go as far as a bubble around the ship so if you end up in the ctrlf in a fighter situation like uAgentMothman mentioned you can quickly get inside. Or do some repairs in your underwear if youre ballsy enough. That might be a little silly.It looks like they arent going that way but the Reliant in particular surprised me with how they managed to pack in the airlock like that and still make good use of space. It allows scenes like in Firefly when Mal had Jayne in the airlock too. Maybe it could even be manufacturer dependent? We dont know for sure yet CiG are probably tinkering with both options to get something that works.,starcitizen,d2ylzo6,1,t5_2v94d

7535175,0,t1_d2xryp3,Ive only had the game  weeks and knowing its an alpha I  was still VERY surprised to find there are no locks or anything on the ships.  That just seemed ridiculous to me in a game that is pretty much all about your ride YOU should be the only one to open and close it!  But yes its an alpha so....time will tell.    ampnbsp    Im with you people try to seize my Connie a lot and its a massive target any time I spawn it on the pad.  Someone did tell me that once you spawn it no one else can open it until you open it for the first time.  Had a guy on the pad kept waiting for me to open ask him to go away he still was there so I pretended to run back in and came out and he was prone behind one of the engines so I just went and spawned another smaller ship for mins or so then tried again.    ampnbsp    I was thinking it would be VERY nice on larger ships to have some sort of system or part of the computer that would tell you how many peoplelife forms were onboard.  Maybe even an upgradable system so very basic form youd just see like  humans onboard somewhere in the HUD or a side menu in the HUD then a more elaborate one could show you the list of player names who are onboard and then maybe the higher end upgrade would have an intruder alert system and have warnings when people who you have no put on the crew manifest board the ship and give you a little D map showing where they are.    ampnbsp    I almost feel like a system like that is a must once true lockpickingboarding and its countermeasures are in the game.  If Im parked in my connie in an asteroid field while doing a mission and a pirate sneaks up to one of the side airlocks and blows it open sure Ill hear the explosion but being the pilot seat I will have NO clue where it is coming from!  So it would be nice if on that little D map that shows yoru ships dmg it would highlight the door and the computer would say Hull breach detected.  And then maybe to go with that I or maybe one of the other  stations on the bridge could then remotely close and lock the rest of the doors so the pirate at least on the Connie would then have to break thru two more doors to get to the bridge.  And in the meantime my crew and I have to figure out how to stop them maybe with hand guns or maybe with countermeasures that Ive installed.  Say he hacked the door instead and got into the cargo hold via airlock maybe from the bridge I could then pump the hold full of toxic gas or remotely blow open an airlock to create a vaccum to suck them out.  Or maybe even just have some small automated turrets instead in the ceiling of the cargo bay.    ampnbsp    TLDR  It should be a lot harder to sneak onboard someones ship and even harder to just steal it.,starcitizen,d2ypnyo,-1,t5_2v94d

7539864,0,t1_d2ypoig,No the clients can calculate LVDR without constant supervision for the sole reason that all collisions are verified serverside as well as several random objects in range of the client. Remember when a bullet hits something its a collision. Anything with hit points is first priority stray bullets and rockets hitting random debris would be secondary... followed by debris hitting debris. So if any client is hacked and says The ship flown by MrEmouse at this LVDRwas hit by my bullet at this LVDR the server will verify that the ship can actually be at that LVDR based on its last movement update and thruster capabilities and that the ammo really can be coming from at that trajectory. If not then the server says Bad calculation heres the correct LVDR for ltobjectgt. So if someone hacks their client with an aimbot or speed boost itll just bug out from repeated resync until the server kicks the client. The server would also tell the client to perform a file verification next time its loaded. Any unmatched files will be redownloaded to the latest version. Also the reason several random objects are verified is so if a person is flying with no other players in range the client cant hide objects for example asteroids so they can just fly through them as if they didnt exist client wouldnt report collisions. If the server asks to verify the ship LVDR and several other objects and the wrong data is returned on any one object the server resends every object in close range of the client just like when exiting quantum or a jump gate and if the ship happens to be inside the middle of an asteroid it explodes.So basically... Im not trusting the clients to do the calculations instead of the server. Im allowing them to do some of the calculations so they can keep the FPS high. They must request verification and the server always has the right answer. Since the server and clients will be using the exact same formulas the answer should always be right which would mean no weird glitches clientside.Also when theres  clients within calculation range of each other on  of the calculations the server could get all the client verification requests and simply compare the results instead of making its own calculation. If every answer is the same everyone is verified object updated serverside based on crossclient calculations. The other  of the calculations would still be verified by the server just in case its an entire group using the same hack in a location where theyre unlikely to encounter anyone thats not part of the group. This would allow HUGE battles to take place without overloading the server with calculations.The clients could even take turns calculating collisions for each other once the number of nearby clients was over .  random clients could do the calculation and peer network their results to each other as well as the server. The server then receives  results from each calculation. For all calculations where one of the clients had a different result the server will perform the calculation and verify it then send the correct information to all clients. The clients would have noticed the mismatched result and ignored that input until server sends its result. For all calculations where every result matched the clients all accept them as true and the server silently verifies  of them only giving corrected information for incorrect calculations and giving the all clear for all other calculations.So now lets simulate a huge group of  ships where the ships have an average crew size of   clients total and an average laser count of   total and they all shoot off a single round from all lasers. lasers calculated by  clients each means  calculations divided by  clients equals  calculations per client. All  Results shoved in a single data packet every computer sends out  packets One to each client except itself and one to the server. Every client receives  packets the server didnt respond yet each containing  results which are then turned into  truefalse comparisons with  inputs each. Everything with a True result all the same answer is accepted. Anything with a false at least one different answer is ignored pending server result.The server receives  packets with  pieces of data each regarding  objects. The server does the same comparison that the clients did and immediately calculates any false results and sends the correct answer to the clients might be zero or could be  from a single client that wasnt patched. The server then chooses  of the good results  if no bad data  if one bad client and verifies them. If all calculations are good server sends  packets acknowledging good results on  objects. If not server sends corrected LVDR information for each object that was not correct all clients see a laser beam twitch into the correct location if it was even in their current line of sight. if not then it twitches but they dont see itIf a single client has a lot of false results maybe  within an hour? Shouldnt happen at all but shit happens they lose connection and the client is told to do a file check. If they are kicked  times within a hour window the account is flagged and theyre put on the GM Spectator list. Basically a GM will watch them play and every time a bad calculation happens itll place a little flag where the bad calculation occurred and there will be a text list of what was being calculated. The GM can then determine if it is a bug or if the player is using a hack. Bugs get squashed hackers get squashed legit players enjoy speedier gameplay in supermassive battles.,starcitizen,d2z8v8i,0,t5_2v94d

7596713,0,t1_d35m1hg,This was what made dayz so amazing.  Its the only game I had my heart race in a firefight to the point where my stomach hurt because I was so on edge defending my unconscious friend from  guys with rifles and empty stomachs. It wasnt just defending my friend that made my heart race and senses go on edge. It was the fact that we had looted gear for over  hours opened a market got drunk when nobody showed up and all of a sudden a round smacked into my buddies chest and he fell unconscious. Those periods of downtime and socializing can really change how the game is experienced. I think what cr had talked about a while back could be just the thing to provide this. He mentioned things like not showering for x amount of days would affect reputation. In dayz we would often stop running to hide so we can eat and hydrate. Doing this gives you a healthy status and lets you heal from wounds quicker and raises your overall health points so youd be more likely to be injured than die. I think things like this would be perfect to make people wander around the ship rather than staying in a turret the whole time. For example maybe you stop on a station repairs will take time as stated by cig loading and unloading cargo also takes time etc. and while your waiting on repairs maybe you go food shopping for your ship. Food allows you to cook they already talked about mixing the drinks on a starlings perfect for happier travelers so this doesnt seem as far fetched as it would normally be and the better the food the slightly better the benefits. Maybe eating food does the same thing as dayz slightly quicker to heal a shot to the helmet makes you go unconscious rather than dying and losing your character. Simple stuff like that. Making the perfect coffee makes you sprint a tiny bit faster and maybe preform repairs faster. Also I imagine larger ships like the starfarer and above might end up being half players and half npcs for most people who arent apart of big active orgs. So maybe going to certain areas with crew and talking to them or just being near them gives you a socializing with the crew bonus which maybe raises their morale and skills. I think classic mmo buffs toned down a bit could be perfect for attaining this type of gameplay. You dont have to drink coffee to save your ship but if you took the time to do so maybe those  seconds less it took to get down the corridor to repair that power box is what saves the ship. Maybe even benefits and drawbacks to them. Drinking coffee gives you faster sprint speed repair etc. But when the buff wears off you have a stamina drop caffeine crash. Or eating a full meal makes you healthy and therefore you heal faster recover stamina faster etc. But maybe your sprinting speed is lowered for a bit after eating but wouldnt last as long as the buff would which makes you think about when to eat and gain that buff but not need to sprint a lot. ,starcitizen,d35phsq,23,t5_2v94d

If the seller were to walk up and take them he would get a bounty of higher than the value of those items.I think it will end up as being a trade kiosk which players will plug cargo crates into to sell the items inside. Itll be perfectly secure as long as other players dont hack the locks on them. Either that or there could be specialised crates with built in trading systems that retrieve the item inside for you. This means that anything with sufficient cargo space could act as a merchant even the HULL series. But having trading crates on the outside of your ship puts them at risk. Anyone could EVA onto your HULL series ship and hack the crate and you wont know about it until items start mysteriously disappearing from your ships inventory. Sure your escort could pick off the thieves but that risks damaging the cargo. Youll need to have a squad EVA from your ship and fight them off.The great thing about the BMM is that its a secure space in which to trade items. I think itll have weapon scanning points in the airlock similar to what was seen in the Area  demo And this is very speculative but from this image it looks like all of the cargo crates will be sealed in a secure hold that cannot be accessed directly by visitors. You head to the negotiation room and a trader calls up the goods from the inventory that you request then you leave with them. ,starcitizen,d38q2ve,1,t5_2v94d

7633878,0,t1_d39e95y,Its changed a lot. Turantulas are still one of the good weapons to use. That being said Ive been using the mas on my khartual and theyve been slaughtering ships.The SH is still mostly king. But why wouldnt it be its supposed to be an air superiority ship. That being said yes  the Sabre replaced the superhornet but in a different way and whats great is its not impossible to take a sabre out. I fight them a lot in my little khartu al which luckily have  size s so i can pack at least half the default load of a freelancer with no missiles. The sabres are like sharks very quick and they bite hard but punch em in the nose and theyll back off. If i can avoid fire i can take them out however it only takes like  volleys from a sabre to kill me. Luckily for me comstab and the xian scout are cheat mode. The saber is quick and has a lot of firepower but if you get sustained fire onto it it wont last long. So it replaced the SH but only as an alternative style. Where the SH uses massive firepower and heavy armor to win fights the saber uses massive firepower plus speed and agility while sacrificing the armor.As far as racing all the ships are pretty good i wouldnt really say mustangs reign supreme like they did. That being said with the new afterburner and boost system the m and khartual really have the edge in racing too bad the khartu cant really fit through the rings reliably.The mantis is still unviable. crap damage for how fast it heats.Missiles are a bit better try the rattlers now theyre really fun.While hornets and sabres still dominate the game feels more balanced than it has in a while for the single seater. Cutlass freelancer and bigger ships are totally borked right now each with their own issues. But they all share the same issue of way too little hull strength for how easy of a target they are.,starcitizen,d39xhvq,1,t5_2v94d

Its much cheaper now than it will be later and it should be out much sooner than the MMO they hope to get it done this year. Dont expect it though.They have sold reduced price gamepacks twice at the second and third anniversary of the initial crowdfunding campaign but the price of the game is increasing as we near launch. So next time they sell the reduced price gamepacks the price might be more than .They have lately had a few  off code things. On April Fools Day those who clicked a link in a news post received a  off coupon. Then when they sold the Prospector mining ship they had a miner ID you could fill out and a few weeks later they passed out  coupons to everyone who filled one out.Also make sure to use a referral code to get  free game money.The Mustang is the better choice. Its worth a little more for just the ship the Mustang is normally  while the Aurora is normally .  They have a pretty robust exchange system to swap out or upgrade gamepacks so youll be able to change your mind later if you do want the Aurora or a different gamepack.Edit Oh another way to get a reduced price gamepack is the grey market  for the  game pack. Its not against the rules to do that CIG is fine with it they just dont allow it on the official forums.

7717657,0,t1_d3jeio1,I remember a while ago Chris said they developed some technology that allowed the server to predict the position of a physics object moving at constant speed without taking up much resources.  When for example a ship without pilotdebris is moving at something like ms at constant speed it doesnt need to update its position every ms to the server because its moving at constant speed in a straight line.  So the server will calculate its trajectory taking into account that it will likely not be interdictedmoved in a while and update its position with much larger margins to prevent using too much resources for a thing nobody sees.  Like right now when a ship floats away without a pilot in a straight line at ms it will respawn after a while but the server will still update its position constantly.  I guess this covers exactly what you mean because pieces of debris dont change their direction randomely and move in  direction at constant speed.  Im curious to see where theyll take this and how things like tractor beams and detection weigh into this.   ,starcitizen,d3jg0mk,1,t5_2v94d

Drake is also known for Speed with the Herald so the Buccaneer will likely be a good racing ship as well more so than the Herald which is more of a straight line speedster.gtGuns  Per Matt the Buccaneer will have more guns but likely no missilesgtMissiles  Per Matt and above the Buccaneer likely wont have missiles since it has more gunsgtCargo  Per Matt the Buccaneer will have small concealed cargo compartments built into its Hull giving it another role besides being a light fighter  it will also be a Smuggling Ship,starcitizen,d3l476y,2,t5_2v94d

7776322,1,t1_d3pgob2,I agree. This is how CIG used to be in the early days. They had poor management and communication for quickly expanding dev teams. Its likely not specifically the fault of those in charge but merely the company grew to quickly and old processes and styles no longer worked. They needed to restructure and hire the right people. I think that mostly occurred in late  to mid  particularly when Erin Roberts joined and started the UKGE teams.I think CIG are doing great now. Theres always room for improvement but i think they are in a good spot. If they share every single issue it not only wastes their time but as we have seen backers are hyper sensitive and even the tiniest bit of doubt brings glee to trolls and haters alike as well as a series of concern posts with a host of armchair analysis.

7801716,0,t3_4m5yq9,It will mean that nobody actually searches reddit anymore.Any ship pushing at .c in Qdrive is not going to be overtaken AND any missile that attempts to intercept it will require a more powerful drive to even survive the fields contacting each other.  Whether the concentrated field of the missile being stronger can do this is up for grabs.   HOWEVER a missile for use against ships that are in Cruise some kind of light EMP that cant really shut a ship down but messes up its systems would be an effective tool the problem is the way you dodge it is dump from cruise and turn.. it wont be able to turn well enough.Guns... right hit an object moving at  miles per second.  Ewar has to actually be inside the shields.  The problem is that the loudest thing a ships sensors are going to hear when Qdriving is the Qdrive itself.  Even if you get a spike into the ship before it torQuesout youre talking signal dilation and strength drop off of ridiculous proportions.  Just not feasible to hack ewar or shoot a ship.HOWEVER...  Qdrives can detect other Qdrives fields and stop before they enter.  So if you can get to within say a couple hundred meters of where a ship is going to pass with a Qfield thats strong enough to disrupt the targets drive youve got your intercept.Good luck picking that quarter square kilometer position in a  square kilometer plane... and if theyre cagey theyll drop early or often and change trajectory.   Ive got another post about a month old on the subject.Basically to successfully intercept a Q driving ship you need to follow it and make guestimates of where its going to come out.  You need to be able to do coordinate math move a group of ships to intercept it and then get in front of it.Its going to be like threading the eye of a needle by throwing the thread in the air then moving the needle under it.But dont worry ships cant Q directly to the jump hole and theyll be vulnerable while the Qdrive is in Jump mode was confirmed its the same component system.

7913925,0,t3_4nnnu3,The Redeemer is not currently a viable concept. Overt longrange gunship insertion ships for  guys are just not a thing. If youre going a long way from support you either bring enough boots to do the job in a blunt way or send in a highly skilled team covertly to do it surgically. The Redeemer can do neither of these and modifications to do so would completely change the ship.It can however be a gunship andor dropship. The catch is that there are two different doctrines on what a gunship is Something that projects an obscene amount of firepower in a limited direction or something that projects firepower everywhere all the time. You cant really do both and the current Redeemer hasnt decided which it is trying to be. This is likely to end up in serious nerfs if a unified concept isnt developed prior to the redesign.In essence the Redeemer has a bad case of Cutlass syndrome and will meet the same fate. This is wholly unnecessary and the proper solution to the problem is to split the concept into two ships that are purposebuilt and excel at their roles A longrange picketescort ship and a light dropshipgunship sort of like the Hind. Its possible to make the existing redeemer the latter and with proper design make the lower deck a module that is detachable. That can then make it a very nice utility ship.,starcitizen,d45lm8v,1,t5_2v94d

Especially larger orgs with that goal will just be able to throw a load of bodies at the Bengal until they captured and jumped it out. Same with the dreadnought. If we can fly it people will try to steal it. And if we cant fly it we can still try to steal it just because its fun.Additionally I dont hopethink that the UEE will be able to instantly deploy a carrier group when they detect a pirate carrier on their scans.

8062577,0,t1_d4m7ckv,Theyve been pretty clear up to now that the plan for things in the game to be very dynamic.  While the landing zones will stay fairly static as far as buildings theyve said the plan is to have the zones change significantly due to external forces.  For instance a wealthy area can collapse into poverty if economic forces cause it to happen.  The shiny buildings and upstanding citizens become more dingy and dangerous and different sorts of jobs can be found there.  This is all controlled by an epic AI simulation engine theyve ben calling Subsumption. The simulation churns with millions of AI agents performing similar virtual missions that are sometimes taken by players responding to events and things throughout the game universe.  Players can have an impact but as the minority numberswise they dont control things  One player cant make a big enough impact economically to do things like pricefix .  In order to keep the simulation from resolving to a static steady state I believe theyll be able to toss rocks in in the form of events like disasters or vanduul attacks.  All of this is assisted by a plan for a very dynamic instancing.Missions themselves planet and space are planned to be dynamically generated out of this huge AI system.  virtual NPCs regularly take these missions and completefail them and players could theoretically run counter missions in certain cases like intercept an NPC shipping operation.  Actions of players both remove missions from the pool as they do them and create new missions as their actions cause new requirements to crop up rescue missions for instanceProcedural planets could fit into this in more ways than just hosting semidynamic fixed landing points.  Resource spawning and gathering wilderness missions etc.  Quite possibly temporary outposts could spring up somewhere on the planet to host missions or objectives. Of course all of this is easier said than done so well see how close it comes to their vision  ,starcitizen,d4mb55w,1,t5_2v94d

Gaming has become a little tiresome to me of late because i see the same stuff come out from AAA games and it is quite tiresome. I enjoy some of the indie stuff but its been a while since i have had a game make me this excited probably since the original Halo which i loved to death.I like the fact they are trying the improbable and i would fund that x over than see me spend money on some rehashed triple A titles. Studios have become too safe and i like to see this type of stuff.And like i said i am a patient man i have been watching this game for a while but decided to take the plunge because i deemed it at a stage now where it is playable and worth while.

8096149,0,t1_d4q1ikv,The whole thing was considered a big issue because the news about it was badly handled by CIG IMO.

Theres obviously stuff that CIG ought not to tell us and stuff that they ought to feel compelled to let us know about. But in this case they didnt give us the benefit of the doubt in thinking we would understand if something went wrong.I think that at that stage the devs felt pretty downhearted about all of that time and effort largely going down the drain especially if getting the PAX presenatation to us meant crunching for a week or two to get it all in a playable and presentable state. When it all went wrong I guess that even between the devs it was a touchy subject.,starcitizen,d4q2w3d,8,t5_2v94d

8130819,0,t1_d4t5xg6,I think last week during RTV they mentioned that Bugsmashers would be changing up a little.  In the subscribers poll when I voted it had no votes for favorite CIG video.  Granted the poll is kind of shit in only allowing one selection but even now its only at  which is by far the lowest weekly video and behind even Loremakers.  Of course the whole thing is weird since they have ATV and things that are a part of ATV like Loremakers and Ship Shape.Poll issues aside I think the goal was to use this as an additional platform to deliver what people are asking for more content about whats being developed.  The bug smashing was fun for me but if I had to choose between seeing how they fixed something like a wiggling ship or whatever or seeing some cool potential new development implementations Id always pick the latter.  What will be surprising is if they manage something like this every week.This is a great addition though.  Contextual action will do wonders for situations like this.  I alway found it was really frustrating to tie opening a door and going inside to one event especially since its not even universal across ships.

8192776,0,t3_4rjnet,Another one of these? The past week has seen several posts discussing the summer lull.It happens with many games not just Star Citizen. Hell on Twitch we call it the summer slump because people become disinterested.Heres a summary By JuneJuly people have been playing the games they have for  months. May and June mark the big gaming expos that hype people up for what is to come. However no new releases come in JuneJulyAugust. People are already getting bored with playing the same thing for the past six months and now they are getting antsy waiting for the new stuff. This leads to a general lull in gaming. You see it in many games  the active playerbase starts to dwindle the people stop watching streams and youtube videos etc. On top of that this alpha in particular just introduced a revolutionary  literally  change in the way it handles data that has allbutcrippled gameplay. So combine the usual angst and restlessness of the summer slump  a patch cycle that is causing frustration with the game and you see a lot of people lose temporary interest.Point in fact this last week showed a marked increase in information from CIG compared to the prior four weeks speaking as someone who participates in weekly podcasts where we discuss said information. For the entire month of June each week was essentially a rehash of previously known info.Finally Star Citizen and I daresay game development in general although since no other bigticket game has been this open in development we can only guess has these cycles where there are weeks or months of lackluster gameplay due to bugs and waiting for the implementation of a new system.Is this any indication of anything bad? No. Its normal for gaming and normal for Star Citizen. If this was a fullyfunctional released game and we saw this decline we might want to start to question things. But hell even ED has gone through these cycles post release. EVE certainly has had  them.EDIT Also it is worth noting the playerbase of many games especially online games change during the summer. The parents who could play while their kids were at school etc. dont have as much free time. People generally spend more time outside. Kids who come home from school are suddenly available and they often change the landscape. Summer is just a wonky time for gaming as has always been. From the lowest singleviewer streamer to the big partners everyone sees a drop on twitch.,starcitizen,d51ncwi,32,t5_2v94d

You can rent other ships and try to strip them of parts to swap onto your Avenger if you want but they wont persist beyond the rental period and rentals will probably be discontinued long before live approaches.As of right now the prisoner pods cant be removed but it hardly matters as the ship is still being balanced and youre far more likely to see future patches drastically change the way the ship flies than you are to see a minor difference in weightbased handling at this point.,starcitizen,d52nx1o,6,t5_2v94d

Moderators are like a subs or forum or whatevers immune system if they are too heavy handed they hurt the community by stifling it and become an enemy of the community think AIDS but on the other hand if they do literally nothing the community becomes weak and sick because they allow everything in and the community doesnt have the ability to fight it off think bubble boy. There is an important balance they can be hands off to avoid stomping all over the community but they need to know to step in when we are neck deep in shit too. We should be able to be critical of CIG here an important point in favor of this sub is that it isnt under CIG control so we dont have to live under the forums over moderation and can discuss and post content that CIG doesnt necessarily want us to leaks subscriber vaultIm a subscriber and I am fine with it  etc the problem is that we have been under attack from a very large group for a long time now and they are taking advantage of our permissive rules to antagonize the community and just generally shit all over the place. The mod team needs to put on their big boy or girl if relevant pants and tell the people shitting on the kitchen floor that they arent welcome here and need to leave if they want to make new accounts and come back which lets be honest they will they can as long as they can behave and stop shitting on the floor.,starcitizen,d5dmon1,2,t5_2v94d

8289949,0,t3_4t0lu0,I feel like the replies to this thread are pretty black and white either people seem to strongly agree with OP or theyre doing exactly what OP is talking about  shitposting and trolling in either case this thread is a heaven of confirmation bias so Im going to put my  cents in that dont fall into one camp or another.Personally Ive been lurking in this sub for a long time Ive made a few posts I think all of which were well received and Ive read hundreds of threads from top to bottom so I think I have a pretty good idea of what the sub is like.In my opinion OP is blowing the problem out of proportion. Trolls and shitposters are a problem in any online community  it comes with the territory. Considering the amount of drama SC has been through since its inception I found the number of trolls and naysayers here to be surprisingly low.At the moment pretty much every shitpost and idiotic comment that is posted gets downvoted to oblivion where it can be easily ignored by just about everyone I wouldnt mind a  based autoban for shitposts and comments to be honest however its still possible for people that arent heavy reddit users to come here and post content they enjoy which I think is a large portion of the SC community. This includes myself I have low karma because even though my accounts over a year old I hardly post anything. But the fact that I was able to post stuff here made me instantly feel like a part of the community rather than a second class citizen like any other sub.At the moment this sub is pretty reasonable and allows for constructive criticism but uses the vote system to get rid of the BS. As someone that has modded very large communities on twitch its an incredibly fine balance to strike between complete anarchy and totalitarian oligarchy and this sub is very close to striking that balance well. I think that forcing major new rules and policies could very easily turn this sub into an echo chamber and reinforce some peoples opinions that SC supporters are cultish.,starcitizen,d5dswdx,10,t5_2v94d

8306127,0,t3_4tagln,gt  Otherwise Ill just stick to planets for landingWow  SC has done an amazing job. You are into your character so much you are willing to restrict where you go  what you do because you care that much about what your character temporarily has to wear. Having places that differentiated in feel and mechanics is a good thing.  I love it when I hear stuff like that or that someone doesnt want to fly a ship because although it does what they want it doesnt match their personal style.  In too many games people just reach for the meta build. Im hoping SC is almost as much about personal style as it is minimaxing everything although with hopefully no obvious above all else meta it will be fun to see what people do with component optimizations too,starcitizen,d5ftml5,8,t5_2v94d

8308250,0,t3_4tbpza, The real money for ships funding model is only during development None of the ships offered except for one which is nothing special in terms of specs are limited  everything will be available for acquisition in game through ingame effort. Even that one ship will be available in game it will just be much harder or impossible to get insurance for. All of the ships sold for real money even the really big nice really expensive ones comes with intro level components and gear  players will still have to spend ingame effort to outfit them nicely.Basically what it comes down to is people who help fund the game production will end up with the equivalent of a head start as if they had started playing the game sooner than others. Since SC has a heavy skill component even that head start might be overcome early by a pilot with more introductory equipment but better ability.,starcitizen,d5g364x,8,t5_2v94d

8324769,0,t1_d5howkp,Thanks for taking the time to respond in a levelheaded way. Even though I dont totally agree with you its nice to be able to have a civil conversation on the internet for a change! I think Ive said my piece on the dates  I can see where youre coming from but I think it falls on CIGs shoulders to make the timeline more clear. Dates slip in every game ever made thats no surprise  but at this point CIG have missed basically every deadline theyve ever set. Does anyone even believe Squadron  is coming out this year any more? Its supposed to  but who even knows. Things just mysteriously get cancelleduncancelled without any clear communication to the backers. Remember how Star Marine was coming out in weeks not months and then suddenly was always just the FPS part of the PU? And then recently CR talked about how it might be coming back?Its been what four years since the Kickstarter? And they were in preproduction for a year before that  at a certain point its fair to start asking where the hell the game is regardless of whatever dates may or may not be public. Ultimately I think the big difference between proantirefund people is the whole crowdfundingbackingpreorder thing. My view is very much that crowdfunding while always a risk isnt just a blind donation. Youre laying down money to a support a creative endeavour you believe in and b get something cool back. When the thing you bought in for has changed so much since you first bought in and when theres legitimate reason to be concerned that its not going to arrive in anywhere near the time that was promised or intimated or widelybelieved or whatever I think its pretty fair to ask for your money back. CIGs own site cant decide if youre buying things from a store backing a project or donating to a crowdfunding campaign  they use all three terms interchangeably to the point where its impossible to tell which is which. If I lay down money for the Starfucker  oneseat or two? that could change too! am I buying a product? Am I preordering a game? Its all and none of the above depending on who youre asking and what legal entity CIG are replying to remember when they sent tracking information to Paypal to claim that Streetroller had gotten the products he bought? Doesnt sound like a donation to me!Sorry for the rant  Im very much proconsumer rights and I get a little frustrated when I see people trying to defend CIG from a person whos just trying to get their money back from a project thats failed to deliver especially since in Streetrollers case due to his disability he physically cant play the game without the longpromised VR support that seems to have completely dropped off the radar. CIG have more money than they know what to do with and it just makes them look churlish and shady when they fight tooth and nail to avoid fulfilling the promises theyve made to the people whove funded their entire business.Anyway like I said  I think we just have two very different views on the whole situation but Im glad you were willing to elucidate your opinion so clearly and fairly. Ive been called a tard on here for less inflammatory posts so thanks for being civil!,starcitizen,d5i5g7v,2,t5_2v94d

If they saying anything then people start the stopwatches and claim they promised things then when things dont pan out they look bad see Star Marine.   On the other hand if they dont say anything then people jump to conclusions or start showing concern and they look bad See SQ.Although this is a damned if they do damned if they dont situation personally speaking Id rather they show us....rather than just keep quiet.

Might even have to wait until they do their dynamic instancing using google cloud.This isnt only because it could drain performance if any of these game featuresmechanics were added which they can but because the world will be incredibly sparse without proper instancing and netcode. I dont want to go to a landing zone or Port Olisar only to see a very few people or possibly nobody at these places because everyone is stretched out thin due to the server limits. Besides the playertoplayer interactivity the PU already feels extremely scripted as it is.

All of those systems have dependencies on all of the systems we are currently seeing drop into the client e.g. persistence. Im sure we will hear much more about the mechanics as they bubble up to the top of the work list and are ready to be implemented at which point they will no doubt be revised to fit with the rest of the game systems already created there is no point continually revising a design that isnt close to ready to be implemented yet.In short chill man. You cant build a house until you lay the foundations and you certainly shouldnt be building your Ikea bed before you have put the roof on the house EDIT Note that isnt to say very early prototypes havent been made honestly I like all of you have no clue what they are working on back there and I like all of you know how shitty we as a community can get when we see a new unfinished system that isnt exactly how we want it to be  I would rather wait personally.,starcitizen,d5wmw6h,1,t5_2v94d

8443609,0,t3_4vaqk3,OK so what your describing is definitely wrong. My main machine is an fx  r  and  gb of ram and Im running on an hdd.  Arena commander runs fine in vanduul swarm you do get a little lag when each wave spawns in but were talking a second or so not minutes. Pu is slow like it is for everyone.  One thing you could look at is cpu temps. The fx  core chips throttle at a very low  degrees c which drops the speed to . ghz until it cools down. Ive noticed star citizen uses more cores than most games so could be pushing you above the threshold. I avoided it by switching my air cooler for a cooler matter siedon closed loop liquid cooler the main advantage being it ejects the hot air out the back of the case. Havent had the issue since.  A couple of other thoughts... dont attempt to run on low settings its been commented on that its slower and laggier than medium.

8478409,0,t1_d606ugk,This is a shot version of what Im doing atm  Mall center conceptualisation market studying and doability   A first study shot of the district where the shop center will be implemented is done.    The doability represents the balance between costgains  after a studying of the prices at nearest competitorslocals then national.   once the project is validated the location is then chosen.   Either the place is already built or you have to build it  wich ironically is simpler because its easier to make new than new from old     Then    The merch team will come and mount up the shop as intended by the companygroupboss.   Each company has a different concept from competitors while using the same sell technics. What they call concept is just about adding the genuine touch taht you wont find at a competitor shop.   The sell technics are simple  everything is done so you entered the shop to buy one stuff and you get out with full bags. If you look carefully how a mall shop is made you will have to walk  and walk to get your stuff so you have to go through myriad of products and eventually youll add that to the cart.    The mall team.    Two things  either you are super rich and dont need help from the company wich will go full franchise wich means you only buy their products or usually the company loan the stock the money and a pushstarter package to help people becoming their own boss on the long term.  Or you are even richer and buy everything yourself  But if you are in this case you probably dont want to build up a mall center.    Function team and employees.     usually the starter salaries are very low. Depending of the group you work for you wont have much more unless you evolve. And know what despite beeing seen as shit jobs by many people this is one of the job you can get the richer as long as you are a hard worker.  egg  you start from  and can get multimillionary man pretty quick  in a matter of about  years minimum if you are a hard worker and also luck. Luck is about having a golden location alone and no competitor or rich district.  This is how mall development works  Short version.

8480323,0,t1_d61iitr,In  they didnt have the financial means to basically braindrain CryTek. Now they do and they indeed have a team of networking guys working on it I think we can all agree that development somewhat sped up once some former CryTek staff joined the studios. The netcode was just something they didnt worry about back in  and why would they? If they redid the netcode in  for the then intended scope it would be outdated again by now and we would be in sort of the same situation I guess. The new netcode is supposed to roll out with . and until then we shouldnt jump to any conclusions in my honest opinion. Really the only thing Im trying to be right now is realistic. They have quite a chunk of money to throw at the problem and its not like they will run out of money within the next year so theres plenty of time for improvement. EDIT Just want to make sure that I properly stress that netcode which is not cheap to write in the first place shouldnt be finalized too early into game development.

Im not just talking about quantum travel or acceleration these things can be explained away with black magic technology. For instance the broken asteroids most missions are flown around simply dont make any sense.For starters theyre as dense as the core of a meteor that makes its way to the surface of a planet yet they dont have enough gravitational energy to pull themselves together. These things should be light as feathers just a loosely consolidated pile of dust which doesnt have enough gravitational energy to compress itself into a solid mass. We should be able to fly through them like they were huge snowballs. Physically theyre as preposterous as floating islands.Gravity just exists however it wants to exist in this game. The game is supposed to be a fast and frantic dog fighting and space combat game. Its supposed to be an interactive movie.

8704596,0,t1_d6tixv9,THIS X . Ive been a supporter of something like this since way back. Heres my lengthy forum post on VGS from December  ! pasted belowIve often felt that in multiplayer games and MMOs theres this huge untapped opportunity for interaction within players. Think about how many times youve played a MMO and you look around at the other players and they are all either A just standing there in their idle animations or B running. Even in heavily populated areas like towns most people are simply standing there.In games that have emotes animated actions your character can use to show various feelings or to communicate something to someone they are often difficult to access hidden behind a menu with several clicks and scrolls. Or you have to stop and do a  command. What that boils down to is not many people use the emotes. However Ive found that when people do use emotes they often increase immersion in the game create new ways of communicating and are often simply hilarious.Why should we be bound handicapped in games unable to quickly express ourselves to others? How many times have you ran past another player in an MMO and simply jumped in the air as if to say hello and they do the same back? This is an example of players needing a system that is not in place. Imagine firing off  quick keypresses and you wave to that person or salute or shake your fist? All within a second or less.Id like to direct you to the Tribes Ascend in this case VGS or Voice Game System. Forthose who are not familiar with this system its a quick menu thats  levels deep.OomSCr.jpg You activate the first level with the V key which gives you a range of other single keys to press each attached to a category of command or response. The third keypress activates that individual voice command which you actually hear a spoken audio clip of in game. If youve never used it you might think thats a complicated system. I can assure you that its actually very intuitive. After learning common keypress sequences you find yourself firing them off in the midst of battle communicating real time with teammates and enemies. As Tribes players know the VGS chatter can reach fevered pitches and produce hilarious conversations. It can also be  essential to communication and winning a match.I propose a similar system for Star Citizen for use in two different ways.Combat CommunicationThe combat VGS system would be focused on rapid communication with wingmen shipmates and other players. For example you are entering battle and fire off a VGS for Form on my wing! or Watch my  Im going in!. Or perhaps Man battle stations we are under attack!. Sometimes in Tribes the VGS commands most effective are ones directly addressing the state of the battle such as We need more defense! and simply Attack.Downsides to the VGS system include spamming the system Tribes has a lock out for repeated spamming good idea and a break in character when you hear your voice and its a generic prerecorded clip. In Star Citizen player customization is more important than Tribes and generic voices may not suit the game.EmotesThe second application for a VGS system in Star Citizen is one that I think is less invasive and yet more beneficial. Using VGS to fire off character emotes could bring alive the multiplayer spaces Im talking about offship avatar interaction here and really liven up social spaces that have long been oddly impersonal spaces in traditional MMOs. Imagine running past a fellow player and in under a second firing off a CGS command that makes your player salute or have hi or even highfive. With a VGS emote system player emotes could evolve from not just vanity animations used for idle amusement to theatrical expression. In other words using your characters animations to expand and enforce your immersion and roleplay as needed for that particular moment. An example might be you are in a bar and VGS emote to sit at the bar and drink. Some players some in that you dont like. They surround you and VGS to make threatening gestures. You respond by getting up and making wild karate chops in the air to scare them off OR you choose to get up and drunkenly stumble about OR you get up and just start dancing. These are just examples but you can see how there could be many many options for expressive emotes which could lead to many enriched and unique gaming experiences. Other substantial emotes might include an animation for working on mechanics like an engine or typing at a console. The emote VGS system would not have to have associated audio clips with emotes. Though for certain emotes it could be interesting and fun. Of course one of the main downsides or dangers is again spamming. Turning off the emote system audio could be an option for those that do not want to hear it.So these are my thoughts. Id hate to see a bar or central meeting space in Star Citizen filed with individual players all unique and cool looking but all just standing there in their lame generic idle animations. As for the combat VGS it too could be very beneficial and also potentially annoying.Truth be told I plan to be  voice chatted in game so ironically the VGS for combat would be a secondary nonessential system. I hope that most hard core players use voice chat and that SC has a robust in game voice chat system. I think its time everyone just started using it. Headsets are very cheap now. But that said many people will not use voice and we will still need to communicate with them. And the VGS for emotes I strongly feel is fertile ground for a cool system for expression communication and fun in game.So what do you guys think about either VGS style combat communication or VGS style Emotes or both?  Should we sketch out some sample VGS command trees?Peace out to the Verse.,starcitizen,d6tpik7,9,t5_2v94d

8710438,0,t3_4zb1lg,What we can see from old data that. Starliner is designed from start to carry passengers and have some modules or variants to give spin for what type of passengers you will be transporting. From old interview we saw VIP and Military transport variantsmodules planned.Jump  is much older design so lots of unknown stuff. Its going to get bigger than old info was given and rework is needed for inside and outside of ship. But Jump  has been told be luxury yacht. Its look to be more multipurpose ship. It has better armor weapons and have scanning and other type high tech equipment. So you should be doing some exploration with few equipment changes too. of course not as well as Carrack but still do some.  comes with small hangar and  person snup ship.  Jump will be bigger than Starliner in interview so it might be able carry more VIP passengers tooDepending setup of ship. But We dont really know much about  Jump. ,starcitizen,d6ufvs6,1,t5_2v94d

They are directly sponsoring CIG and Star Citizen. They paid for their whole Gamescom trip!Do you seriously believe that Intel the multibillion dollar corporation doesnt do their research on how they spend money? You think they would allow CIG to get up on a stage in front of literally thousands of people millions if you count stream viewers and lie about what they were doing and therefore tarnishing Intels name?I guess the  positive articles from  different publications from inside and outside of the gaming world are all lying as well? Cause they all said the demo was played live for them in the press booth. Are they in CIGS pocket as well?Dude your cognitive dissonance is at ridiculous levels.

8715154,0,t1_d6v0hin, You should start out with a pistol but then you will need to buy a different gun than that. You can buy them at both Port Oly and Grim Hex. The guns you buy are permanent in that theyll persistent across sessions until a large update eg . where everything gets wiped and you start again. Similarly clothes spacesuits and armor you buy will persist and you can buy three or four or however many you want and change between them. Right now you have to go back to where you bought it in order to change again but thats temporary. Armor does replace EVA suit bit you can still EVA with armor. Eventually youll be able to swap out specific pieces of armor but again for right now its the whole thing or the other whole thing.Ammo can be found at Kareh and gun shops in crates with red boxes inside.,starcitizen,d6v16ck,1,t5_2v94d

Sure it can take a lot of blows but sitting and waiting for the other guy to get tired of punching you typically isnt a valid defensive strategy.

Not to mention CIGs pricing of ships since after the Kickstarter has rarely made sense in context of its performance as far as I can tell and when the game has released the ships ingame prices will likely change over time until it reflects the ships performance accordingly.  ,starcitizen,d6vks13,4,t5_2v94d

8719705,0,t1_d6vaojp,Yes but not being seen requires that you not be a super hot ship which the Terrapin is supposed to be. Also there are two kinds of SampR. Regular SampRthink Coast Guard and combat SampRthink USAF PJs. Both are SampR but are VERY different. If the Terrapin is used for combat SampR which the sales page indicates its tremendously lacking in firepower. If your talking regular SampR then lose the heavy armor and increase the speed to get to the people your trying to save. The ship doesnt make sense right now it just doesnt. Name another ship in the game thats supposed to be SLOW ARMORED and has ONLY ONE HARDPOINT that can use weapons its a bad combination.    ,starcitizen,d6vlqcq,2,t5_2v94d
8720124,0,t3_4zf46k,I think we are looking at speed in the wrong way. In a dogfight this thing is going to move like a brick but your goal it to escape the dogfight and get to quantum travel. Even if you get interdicted a couple of times before getting to safety you still have the armor to keep you alive whereas an m or something fast will get turned to toast as soon as they see any real combat and wont have the time to spin up its quantum drive. I think your chances to break from combat in this thing will be much higher than something conventionally fast even at maximum velocity in an m you will get caught in moment by anything using quantum travel.,starcitizen,d6vnmj6,1,t5_2v94d
8720719,0,t1_d6vq1d0,gt In terms of dev time and modularity and unique or new systems? Looks like the Terrapin would take roughly th of the time to develop as the Endeavor would....Ah but its unrealistic to think CIG will keep all  staff and all of the offices open after launch.  Once the core game engine is developed and complete theyll need to lower costs.  So theres a lot of ships that will need to be finished and fewer staff to do them in the postlaunch world. ,starcitizen,d6vqbas,2,t5_2v94d
8720953,0,t1_d6vlqcq,Uhh.. wow. Completely wrong.gt yes but not being seen requires that you not be a super hot ship which the Terrapin is supposed to beNo the Terrapin has armor plates that cover its heat radiators. It makes the ship invisible while this mode is active.  From the QAA mediumsized component has the potential to create a large signature for a small ship. In making it heavily armored the ship just doesnt have the capacity to vent its heat as efficiently as pilots would want. The revolutionary retracting armor allows the panels to lift apart weakening the ship but improving venting allowing players to effectively come up for air.gt If the Terrapin is used for combat SampR which the sales page indicates its tremendously lacking in firepower. gt Name another ship in the game thats supposed to be SLOW ARMORED and has ONLY ONE HARDPOINT that can use weapons its a bad combination.The Terrapin has an S turret which can mount dual S guns. It also has  more S hardpoints elsewhere on the hull. Its armed just fine for a noncombat focused ship.  gt If your talking regular SampR then lose the heavy armor and increase the speed to get to the people your trying to save. If they are in an escape pod there is no hurry. If they are hurt it still wont matter much if your SampR ship is blown to bits.,starcitizen,d6vrd7z,0,t5_2v94d

8721803,0,t1_d6vnnc6,And exactly that reply its not modular is kinda questionable if the UEE prizes it as APC or Medical unit. I suspect it was only meant in regards to no guns on this mount.Whilst an APC might work with simply adding a few seat rows and and bedsmedical for the SAR both would work better with removing the hanging chair of the sensor station.  So IMHO the placement of the sensor operator station looks cool but is absolutely unpractial use of the ships interior space... it probably gets moved.

8725102,0,t3_4zjejd,     can you earn ships ingame beyond what you pay for as a pledge looking at dropping  on a package initially? I.E. Earn via gameplay or buy for currency.That is the point really. All you need is to buy the cheapest package  I think and you are set. You can earn all other stuff in the game when it launches.     is there a dynamic playerdriven economy planned? I cant see anything about the ingame economy anywhere...The economy will be tightly controlled by the  of the NPCs and CIG since players make up only  there really can not be large effect like it is in EVE online for example. They do not want large organizations to screw over the rest of the players intentionally through game mechanics.     are the upgrade packages applicable to multi ship packages so if I want to swap out a couple of ships for others I can do that or is it restricted?Yes. You can not melt individual ships from the package but you can always upgrade each one to any other ship as long as it costs the same or more than the ship you are replacing.     is the subscription part available now or is this only active at release?Subscription is here only by request by the backers who wanted to contribute more to development than they already are by buying ships. It is not mandatory and the game will have no subscription once it goes live to play.     also do you guys think the subscription is worth it once youve bought in or is it better to buy in at the bottom end and subscribe or buy in at a higher level?Subscription brings you no benefit other than the access to some art pictures jump point magazine monthly and some fluff hangar items. Sometimes even early access to participation in PTU testing builds.     and finally how playable is the alpha at the moment and what sort of rig is going to run it in practice?Currently there are large issues since they are at the limits of what Cryengine network code can do. There is a huge refactor in the works that will come out at the end of this year December. but the issue is that everyone is having a really poor performance  FPS no matter if they have nvidia  or  in SLI.But when it is all said and done all you really need to be playing smoothly  core CPU running at at least . Ghz  Gb of RAM  GPU card,starcitizen,d6wa2um,2,t5_2v94d
8725139,0,t1_d6w9uvk,I would prefer a second Star Marine.  They also only plan to have planetary PG ready by the end of the year maybe.

You have to fly to its strengths use a lot of strafe so youre a harder target and try to get that nose cannon to bear on your target while making yourself a difficult target. If you get in trouble boost away and weave through nearby debris until the other guys gets tired of trying to follow you and disengages then turn around and have another go.Comparing it against the Sabre is a bit of a waste of time to be honest.

Me personally  I forgot it even said it came with  seats so it didnt even bother me at all.I will concede the Cutlass owners through brute force alone managed to get CIG to develop the Buccaneer to solve a problem of their own making. However I was highly dismissive of Cutlass owners through their time as well  feel free to search my posts on the official site.Ive said from the beginning that the Ship stat page was put up too early and is too easily changed and Im not the only one who thinks that.Disco Landos opinion on people who use the Ship Stat page for minmax!,starcitizen,d6xwhhv,1,t5_2v94d

8738654,0,t3_4zqnle,No idea on the percentage of players who are a member of at least one org.Orgs will be able to own assets such as hangars and ships. This allows you and your friends to share resources to accomplish tasks. It also makes it easier to organize a group of friends in game.Lots.Depends on the org. The org I play with usually plays  night a week but that will likely change as more of the game is added.Depends on the org. Some have a hierarchy of officers others are just a loose conglomeration of players. An org can structure itself however it wants.Im sure orgs will have rivalries and probably already do.Probably similar things to what you might gain from being in a Guild in another game. There could be org owned ships that you can borrow for a mission or other such things.,starcitizen,d6xzcfn,3,t5_2v94d

In unmonitored or low security areas of space you will be able to attack other players without much consequence however in highsec monitored space there will be severe penalties for committing a crime.There will be a lot of PvE content in the game though.  of the population of the universe will be NPCs so there will be a lot of coop with your friends doing missions against AI or you might be attacked by NPC pirates rather than player pirates.,starcitizen,d74ppb3,2,t5_2v94d

Seconds after this some one attacked me and I attacked the  thinking he was with my attacker that can be true or not I dont know I only reacted that caused me to get the P.E. status and only got to know this because the system security started attacking me.Another time I turned to P.E. because I was doing a Array mission but some one completed the mission before me A that moment I havent  know that that missions where common for everybody on the server and turned off the array without noticing the only reason that I come to know this was because hear the message that tell you that the corporation owner of the array was not happy with me.

8808517,0,t3_50sxck,Hey! Im Korean American and came to US  years ago so I can understand her just fine. I can edit the post to tell you what shes saying after watching. Generally I know that Korean gaming community has very small dedicated player base when it comes to graphically intensive games. They tend to be a lot more competitive and I dont think many people have custom pc for themselves because of cost. Since she looks like she streams regularly and has an audience it does advertise the game a bit. But I know a lot of gamers there arent gonna have a machines to run them unless they commit. Looks like in the video the guys seem like they have been playing for a while and theyre showing her around.In the hangar the crawling animation looks like the character has a diaper on him. Nothing much else in hangar. In Arc Corp shes impressed to see the graphics in general. Going through the clothing shop just messing around with friends and when she got glitched out in the weapons and armor shop just jokes around and didnt say anything about bugging out. Liked the pirate heavy armor. At the bridge she talks about being a pirate and how cool it would be but knows she cant be accessing normal civilian areas as a criminal. One of the other guys mentioned about obtaining a fake ID but I dont know if thats true? She walked around more and messed around but generally really liked the visuals. Theres no other comment about the game looks like she just checked it out just because of the graphics. But who knows we could see more of this I guess.,starcitizen,d76nwhn,13,t5_2v94d

Assume you fly down so that you are in its approximate orbital path for the next time it comes around itll suddenly fly past you at ms how do you transition into a velocity that is now relative to that?I cannot see any way of that working without them disabling the maximum limit to the cruise speed in certain situations or forcing you to quantum jump between stations.,starcitizen,d76q0gp,1,t5_2v94d

Pretending it doesnt exist and reacting like children is making all of us look bad.  As much as I love the community we have some really misguided members.  Back on topic.Ive done countless trades with them.As legit as it gets.  Even though grey market isnt officially supported by CIG  they are very well aware of it and of all the players involved.As for Star Hangar.They have a very good relationship with CIG and paypal.People do get scammed on the grey market once in a while thing is SH has always resolved those issues if a seller or a buyer they dealt with was shady.  Thats what makes them more trustworthy than others.You do pay a premium to get the rare  unavailable ships at any given point in time.  So if you miss a sale or didnt have funds at the time  these guys will have what youre looking for.  They are expensive though.  Keep that in mind.Follow safe trading guide here and hereLast point  Grey market isnt illegal.Buying ships isnt going to piss CIG off.  In fact its a part of their plan as they are giftable.If CIG wanted to kill the greymarket they would simply change that and it would shut down today.  Thats obviously not in their best interest so a symbiotic relationship formed.  Grey market serves a purpose it fuels star citizen hype  marketing.That being said Black market isnt legal.Buying an account is outside of UEE safe zone so CIG will not play nice if you have an issue with an account you bought.

Rare chance.gt Flight model is entirely subjectiveThats a thing.. I think SCs flight is better because it will have more strategic slower combat with bigger ships. So.. best of the both worlds? People just cant see the whole image right now.gt  but putting atmospheric scattering on a barren featureless planet does not make it better.You think SC planets will be featureless? Only featureless pg planets I know are in ED without anything to do in them and CIG confirmed that there will be content on planets well see if true.gt Youre not accounting for tectonic plates ravines and mountain ranges because of those plates basins tidal locking planetary composition and so on.ahhh thats what youre talking about. I can agree with that. Thanks. From scientific point of view I doubt SCs planets will be better than Elites.

8879949,0,t3_51uqwz,Saying hz tick sucks even for a game like CSGO is a bit far.  is a very acceptable starting point at least. In a strictly FPS situation sure higher is better but the PU will def not run at over . I wouldnt be surprised to see the first iteration of Star Marine to be like  at least to start. Anything less than that is def too low. And the  tick that ESEA provide players pay fees of up to  per month per player to access which even then is specifically catering to the most competitive scene not the casual or even average player. The truth is that most people playing the game care considerably less about having an incredible tickrate in FPS parts of the game and care more about other aspects. Does higher tickrate improve the experience? Of course Will the vast majority of players actually be able to tell the difference or be able to take advantage of hz over ? Most likely not. And on top of that is a significant increase to difficulty and cost of building out and maintaining and operating servers at such a higher tickrate when that same effort and cost could go to other aspects of the game that provide better or more noticeable value. The costbenefit for making it higher than  for a game that is not even a dedicated shooter doesnt make sense especially when considering the premier competitive first person shooter in the world is played at  by the vast majority of its player base.,starcitizen,d7f8ts8,25,t5_2v94d

8946039,0,t1_d7n60b7,The problem is that what you are saying isnt based in physical realism. In these circle strafes your maneuvering thruster power isnt the limiting factor. Its actually your main engines doing a majority of the work for the tight orbits. And these differing value for what you are speaking of are already in place for a lot of ships and theyve experimented with a bunch of different values. The physics of all this is really far more complicated than many realize.The only way to stop this kind of thing would be to massively reduce rotation rate it would probably still happen in this case just at a longer range or to redesign all the ships so that they arent flat.But whats the reason? Why do you think the game design should be changed to favor one axis over another?,starcitizen,d7n6k2s,2,t5_2v94d
8946084,0,t1_d7mrl4l,Wellp thats a bit sad. I like games where playerdriven crafting and items are a thing because it brings a whole custom element to your Character and Load out.If there were a SWGish resource and crafting system it would make things like control of a System or set of Mines much more valuable which in turn would drive conflict between factions to control it which is one of the funnest part of large scale games like these.A faction or Org that controlled both a solid supply of topquality resources and had Master crafters could both fund itself better and armdefend itself better which motivates political and factional alliances as well as allowing even small Orgs to specialize in doing something really well which would make the Org itself valuable as an ally.In the same way that we are going to be able to find and sell Jump points which will be a valuable profession for the noncombatoriented so would be finding and selling resource claims on various planets or asteroids especially for smaller Orgs who dont necessarily have the ability to haul refine and craft something out of those resources.Keeping those resource claims secret for Orgs might be a strong strategy or being able to foot the manpower and UECs to defend a well known topquality resource claim could be a large part of PvP with actual consequences beyond needing to respawn a Ship. I do hope that as the Space Sim portion of the game becomes solid and closer to release CIG starts exploring things like this... even if its done without the crafting... resource refinery system and asteroid control could be a much more interesting dynamic if theres more value to it than just bragging rights.,starcitizen,d7n6r36,1,t5_2v94d

8952805,0,t1_d7nuo10,Yes there will be many may active event opportunities. Some will be there to be found for explorers. Others will likely be spawned as needed to support a mission that is created and taken and removed when that purpose is fulfilled. And they will all be spread the hell out.The question is whether to keep explorers happy instead of spawning things and waiting for explorers to find them to instead probabilistically create stuff near an explorer as they go so they have something to do.  The problem with that method is it basically handing things to people for effort just for expending the effort everyone gets an A for Effort!.  I really dont think that after every half hour of flying around randomly every explorer is guaranteed to be coming back with a scanlog with  asteroid fields and  mid size ship wrecks. Making a new find has to be a celebration  not a yay found catalog entry  for this  hour run.As Ive said other places as much as people want to be explorers realism even gaming realism means either choosing the high percentage payoff and scanning something known again or more in depth then the last person or the low LOW percentage payoff of rolling the dice  and going out to find something new.  If there are  people playing and even  of them are explorers they cannot be finding stuff all the time. Space would feel a little ridiculous if that was true. Plus mining an asteroid stripping a hulk or exploring a plantary ruin will take far far longer to organize and do then it takes to run a single exploratory scan and unlike most exploration activities are likely to take several people to do well. People should actively be vying for the new info explorers have found or running their own exploration initiatives not just taking the next thing off the ever accumulating pile.Now if you want space to be less empty so Explorers spend more time pushing buttons and less time waiting in anticipation I suppose there could be a lot of worthless things for them to find that takes them a little while after doing a long range scan to get nearer and identify as pointless just another sensor anomaly or stray rock comet to help fill their time. Otherwise yeah over the likely size of the game number of players and  years of hoping to play it I really do think that the good stuff will be spread out over thousands to hundreds of thousands of scan bubbles.,starcitizen,d7nzs5e,1,t5_2v94d

8974442,0,t3_535wsh,Im not sure if any of you have done any casual selling on eBay and experienced this but if you have it is clear that the merchant loses in the majority of cases unless the credit card company has substantial evidence that the services were rendered in their totality or product was delivered as described. Unfortunately even if the seller has done their due diligence often credit card companies will decide in favor of their customers in the name of customer service. Merchants sign agreements with their merchant account providers in the case of eBay this is PayPal who in turn agree to abide by decisions of the credit card company.  As you might be able to see now there is significant opportunity for fraud and it is mostly unregulated.That said its obvious CIG is concerned that large parts of the community may begin initiating chargebacks if they believe ships or features did not meet expectation. This would lead to CIG owing creditors large amounts of money theyve already spent or otherwise used for development. Since a card holder can make a purchase and initiate a chargeback months later shady customers might try using chargebacks as a way to demo products and get their money back if they experience buyers remorse or simply decide for some reason they no longer want the product in this case ships. CIG obviously wants to deter this behavior and thus the reason for closing the entire account.,starcitizen,d7qlbq9,5,t5_2v94d

In that you can technically take your friends along on missions that you do yes... but theres no way to share any of the objectives or mission states so the mission is completely dependent on your own actions.

9015469,0,t3_53qzu1,Ive got a twin stick setup and in my configuration I have the left stick yaxis mapped as both absolute thrust as well as throttle control. And by throttle control what I actually mean is that the deviation from center position translates to a change in your throttle position. So slamming the stick forward will then. Fire thrusters forward at full blast. Increase the throttle position at maximum rateBut on the other hand you can also push the stick a little to get a little immediate thrust and slowly change your throttle level. Its a nice balance of convenient throttle manipulation and control. The only part that gets a little difficult is managing the fact that forward  back adjusts the throttle or consistent forward velocity when you try to maneuver to a stopped target e.g. landing pad precisely. However precision mode makes this a lot easier.,starcitizen,d7vipbr,2,t5_2v94d

9022400,1,t1_d7vn9mj,I disagree with this.  The original purpose of Evocati pitched to the community was to help with bug testing and quality IC reports.  If the Evocati has morphed into designcontent testing in which a small subset of the community is influencing design that never gets input from the greater community that is a problem.  These patch notes and the comments from evocati suggest its not just bug testing theyre performing.  The community was supposed to be the wider test bed for this open development so if evocati is being used for anything other than extended QA it needs to go.uwleverettcig  utherealdiscolando,starcitizen,d7wcnny,10,t5_2v94d

Im sure they could get infinitely more testers on that early phase and make it go a lot faster if they opened it wide but they didnt. Theres a reason for that.They want the mass testing in the live version and in the PTU they have evocati for something else. Putting up an NDA isnt something to do on a whim they have a reason behind it and if we want them to do what they think will get the game out as fast as possible we shouldnt block them.Ben Lesnick has said before that the evocoti system runs on goodwill after a leak a while ago and if people continue to leak it they will not see a reason to go through the effort in using it.,starcitizen,d7xzdy6,1,t5_2v94d

It has nothing to do with procession or wobble of the Earth as it spins on its axis. The reason why we have weather is because the sun warms the Earth at different intervals which creates hot and cool air.  Those pockets of hot and cool air are carried by the trade winds and the jet stream which are created by the rotation of the Earth.  Weather occurs along those boundaries EDIT I know this stuff because these two topics are one of my many hobbies.

You can build all sorts of buildings and castles and cities with your own laws and set your own local customs etc skill system and professions help you make items and perform magic rituals and the like more safely and more easily ala star citizens repair system and create magical weapons and items and learn magic spells which can of course significantly improve your combat potential but you can still potentially be killed by a random if you screw up so a new player could kill a top level one its just very hard and unlikely. Heavily skill related. Sortof like a DND game but not anywhere near as confined as actual DND. Youd be able to revive people but resurrection magic is difficult and expensive and it takes longer to do and has more potential to screw up ala star citizen repair system again! and if you fudge it bigtime maybe your friend reanimates as an abomination hungering for flesh. But entirely skillbased. No probability of failure or chance of failure or  probability of backfire  the ritual is harder to perform meaning you have a smaller window to do the right things at the right times if you are untrained. If you mess up its your own fault and its just faster and easier with the relevant skills. Lots of options and variety and no ridiculous gore is okay breasts are bad  players could ascend into demonhood for some huge bonuses ala warhammer k and potentially become an ingame demonprinceprincess with their own little subrealm which would basically be like a normal town thing with the normal building construction except in a hellscape area with demonic stuff like blood pools. Gender differences not skirted around and played for political correctness females can become succubi and get seduction related quests etc. players ascended to demons can companionparty with a new player to help them and get summonportal spells as can a variety of magic schools. Very friendly ingame new player mentorship systems allowing for a lot of newplayer help rewards for some cosmetic and convenience items and associated goodies. downloadable game where people in unlucky regions can sidestep predatory local pricing or market bans and scalpers. tldr fantasy version of the original star wars galaxies with magic player built cities and skills making things easier but not to the point of outgearingoutleveling others.

9092138,0,t3_54l3ad,It is a long article. I read it all and followed all the supporting links  which are extensive.Yes they compare Chris and Not so. But Chris comes off as driven and an achiever overall and Not so as a rather ridiculous character...to say that DS tweets every day about SC would be inaccurate. It is more like  times per day.The writer quotes DS as stating that he has engaged  law firms to look into SC. The writer is as mystified as anyone else as to why it would require . But this is DS.He quotes DS as saying he was bullied as a young man and this is his justification for his behaviour. Im surprised the writer doesnt ask why this reasoning isnt used as justification for other sufferers of abuse to abuse others. However the general tone is one of mocking DS.The full CV of both is given. The writer does not equate DSs CV to CRs. Indeed the writer notes the contrast. He notes that Wing Commander was listed among the top  games and notes Erin Roberts in subsequent successes. Its possible the article was submitted prior to the dire Youtube reviews of Line of Defense but not likely before the Steam community view of that game became evident. Both the writer and surprisingly DS acknowledge that SC has some of the best talent in the business working on it.The ongoing feud refers to a wider group than CR  DS. One exmember of the community is given a modicum of credulity. Despite noting that CIG deny his version of correspondence.They do refer to several posts in the community as examples and this same exmembers posts however they give the impression that this is the norm and any nondetractors are simply part of the rabid cult that is our community. He draws on a newspaper article from Forbes regarding this impression of rabid SC fans. Star Citizen May Not Be A Scam But It Feels Like A CultThe writer points out things we already know and have complained about ourselves. Ben Lesnicks penchant for footinmouth disease. We all noted the change in community staff and the change in approach of the community communications. I think we all agree it is better now. They quote Chris as stating he couldnt believe that of him Ben they said they had Youtube video of him acting contrary to Chris view that all employees treated all backers with the utmost respect. Which is linked.. they have a point. I have mentioned other examples on the RSI forum that they havent. CS labeling backers was given as yet more evidence that Chris view was at least inaccurate. For each point made external evidence is given and the interpretation on an individual case by case is fair. Where it distorts is when a few examples are given then extrapolated as a wide view. This in reference to the war within our community.The most informative part of the article is the back and forth emails between Kevin and Sandi Roberts. I have not seen them before. I note that until his  year probation this individual had a question asked on his behalf in more than about  of all FTC or FtD in the past. So much so that people began to notice and complain.  names became synonymous with the  for.. BeerTheBeerGod Kevin  a Goonrathi and one other. It was a surprise to find he had descended into such an acrimonious relationship with CIG. I knew he had become unpopular in the forums for leveling accusations of mismanagement by the directors but we have seen others do this and not get banned.Generally the staff were initially polite and tolerant the difficulty arose due to it occurring during the very busy holiday sale period last year early this year. We had all suffered delayed CS response time in that period. He took it personally there were reasons and so it was referred to Sandi. In one unusually frank reply from Sandi in the last days of  she states that despite the accusations against her it was actually she had been suffering sexist abuse from someone in the work place. Her response to which was thank God hes gone now.She also openly states that at times she doesnt agree with all decisions and some of Chris actions. The article refers to some of the terms she uses to refer to some backers as being less than complimentary. And they are less than complimentary. But her level of stress and distress is also evident. Which they do not acknowledge. What outsiders fail to realise is that Sandi deals with us as individuals we are not faceless cutomers to her. She doesnt resort to highhanded tactics of the usual corporate type. She behaves as if she were one of us and shows concern when things are bothering us. Despite all she deals patiently and professionally with someone who even continues to push his case even on Christmas Eve despite offering sympathy for her level of work demand while having young children. The picture is one of a stressed professional dealing with someone who will not let go of his bone in my view. He clearly seems to be enjoying having her at his beck and call and the attention he feels he gets from it. He seems to think she is sharing.I found the article interesting. It did not appear biased except in that some points were  definitely not sufficiently followed up or made clear. It appeared to criticize the community as much as anything. It ended stating that CIG could and likely would shut down all detractors once the game was released. I do not think it as scrupulously careful to present both sides accurately as the first article but this is the problem when trying to deal with characters within whole communities.Indeed there was a lack of acknowledgement of current progress and an overall skeptical tone. That they took one individuals point of view despite there being plenty of historical evidence both in CIG communications and on the forums that his view was not the full picture. Take out that individuals posting and sharing of CIG communication and we have little more than a rehash of the first article. CIG Community have never acknowledged the mistakes made when referring to backers but it is clear that they have since amended their approach.. and it shows.Despite the probability that I may be labelled a rabid fanboy I can say the following. I have not always been complimentary about the staff or the choices made by senior members of the team I have never even heard from a moderator in . years. I have been in plenty of other forums and know we have the best most tolerant moderators out there. I still firmly believe each and every CIG team member is dedicated to producing the very best that can be achieved and if Chris detects a bad attitude toward either the community or the aims of the project he deals with it. More than that even to the very top they are all members of our community and act as such even if that sometimes mean they dont appear as corporately professional as other organisations. Does that disallow skepticism no definitely not there are some in our community who are skeptical of certain aspects. I have also been on an office tour and CitizenCon  as well as several social gatherings. I have met more than a few of the senior development staff. They are always professional polite tolerant of discussion and open to any ideas you share with them. In person if not always in communications they have shown the deepest respect for the community and its members who enable them. Do they get tired and stressed? Im sure they do. Does it show sometimes? Not as often as you might expect. Noone can go into the RSI forums for a few hours and get a picture of what has been or even is happening. Only those of us who have spent time in them on a regular basis over the span of the project can have any sort of overview. The most often stated opinion of new members is that we have the nicest forums they have ever encountered and are surprised at the level of engagement with CIG staff. I would not have missed the last . years of it for anything. They think us a Chris Roberts cult?. No we are a group proud of what we have achieved as a community. Criticize and question the game if you must or even CIG and Chris.. but if you disrespect what our community has achieved together.. expect to be ostracized. Noone else in the history of gaming has achieved what we have achieved together and we have a right to be proud.I echo the OPs sentiment. We have the best community and the best staff who have dedicated their not inconsiderable talent to giving us what we requested and enabled them to do. They obviously love it as much as we do.,starcitizen,d84q82v,2,t5_2v94d

9117964,0,t3_555nhb,Okay I happen to really like the direction theyre going with the flight model changes for a number of reasons. High speeds increase the distances between ships. This is the biggest reason why I think CR and CIG are pushing for this change and I see their thinking. Closing the engagements makes fighting a bit more intimate more impactful and in my opinion more rewarding. You get to see enemy ships get shredded you have time to see the explosive payoff of blowing up your target and the slower speeds give you more time to react to both jousting matches as well as the wreckage of a downed enemy. The engagement distances and speeds limit weapon selection. With the current speeds close range weapons such as the Mantis GT Plasma Scattergun Neutron Guns and other close range weapons. When the average engagement is gtm the Mantis and Scattergun are useless. These SCM speeds also cause targeting pips on different weapon loadouts to spread out much further apart again limiting builds to monoboating or putting a few specific weapons together. Some of the slower mass drivers such as the Sledge and Neutron guns also suffer from current SCM speeds. The most common weapons I see people using are the Badger Bulldog and Panther line of repeaters simply because theyre spammy and reliable. You NEVER see the other weapons Ive mentioned. Missiles have a tough time with current SCM speeds. By slowing things down a bit I think a lot of the problems with missiles can be fixed up a bit. Then the question becomes can your afterburner fuel outrun the missiles fuel? A big problem I have with current speeds is the differences between ships is too great. The Hornet is  Sabre is  and Gladius is at  or ?. Should the Sabre be faster than the Hornet? Yes absolutely. Should that difference be ms? I would argue no. I think a ms difference is more ideal. The r goes ms! How can any other ship compete when the racers are so much faster nothing else even has a chance to catch them? By halving the SCM speeds while porportionally the differences in top speed are the same its tightened a bit to keep things closer to give the slower ships a better chance to catch the faster ones. Turrets! Jump into a Gladiator Super Hornet or Cutlass Black and try to hit another fighter. Good luck. With that. Look if you tell me its because the turrets still need work yeah I know its obvious to anyone thats tried one. However the ship speeds dont help one bit. When youre in a ship moving at ms trying to shoot at another ship moving at ms its nearly impossible when you are moving and your targets are zipping all over the place. Slower SCM speeds mean that turrets actually mean something. I want to see how this impacts gameplay when Retaliator gunners have an easier time targetting fighters. I also think this will finally help to make the Gladiator and Super Hornet more formidable fighters when loaded with copilots. This is the biggest thing Im really looking forward to with the changes.Now I want to let you in on something... a small detail that you may have missed since the specifics are redacted.YOU CAN STILL FLY REALLY FASTSCM speeds are being halved. Cruise speeds remain the same. Boost speeds are still really fast reduced from . I think but not by  like SCM speeds. So if you want to you can still push your ship faster I mean in combat it will be in limited bursts but if youre good at operating at those speeds it allows for that skill to show.SCM stands for Space Combat Maneuvering. The whole point of this flight mode is to handle space combat. Its balanced around fighting and having fun while doing it.  speeds over . isnt going to reduce the skill involved when in a dogfight. Id argue it will encourage better skill because it will reward maneuvering and positioning over who can aim their weapons at a tiny target.TLDR. I think slower SCM speeds will fix a lot of problems currently with PvP combat. Namely engagement distances weapon viability balancing as well as turret gameplay. The initial gut reaction and giving into emotion isnt helpful feedback and it doesnt look at the bigger picture. The game is still in development and now is the time to experiment and play around with different flight models to see what works and what doesnt work.I rest my case.,starcitizen,d87ty2k,5,t5_2v94d

9125364,0,t1_d88fsvp,Interesting note currently the Saber is at least  times as strong as the Khartual even ignoring the shield bug. This is because while the Khartual should have double the cooling for half the weapon load out both the ships have the same exact cooling no matter what you equip. You just need one cooler installed somewhere and weapons get a static cooldown rate.

Maybe youll have to make a certain amount of credits in a single transaction  or literally just be in the right place at the right time.These missions wont be the norm  CIG could spend everyday in a year filming mocap missions and still not have enough for a month worth of gameplay at that level of detail.But when you get a reward mission like this  I bet youll want to group up with friends to do them.,starcitizen,d89nqlw,3,t5_2v94d

Who cares what someone else is doing? There will always be someone who can grind better than you whos a more skilled pilot who can read the market better who has found something by chance thats rare and valuable. Just play your own game. How is this any different to the situation  months after launch when the person with the Aurora on launch day has had the time to build up to capital ships then some newbie to join  months after release and only have an Aurora and goes whaaaaa why does that guy have a better ship I cant keep up with that!  Your example is poorly researched. The Javelin was sold as a stripped out hull missing a lot of components including weapons. No one is going to be flying one in any functional way on day one. Itll take a large effort from a group of people to even get one to defend itself against basic attacks. Lets use a more reasonable comparison. An Aurora LN and a Super Hornet.  vs  I think. By your argument the SUper Hornet will win. Wrong. Ive seen skilled Aurora LN pilots completely own Super Hornet pilots in Arena Commander more times than Id like to count. Player skill is more important than equipment for the most part.So in conclusionPay for headstart  surePay to win? nope.EDITgt How is that not the definition of paytowinThe definition of paytowin is being able to buy things with RL cash that are unavailable any other way in the game such as gold ammo in world of tanks.

9164168,0,t1_d8ddqb0,Thanks for the reply.Yes Im hoping for a more dynamic economybased spawning regulation and less on a fixed node that must persist atallcosts. I already have the fear that mining could suck anything dry in a game that is dependent on an unlimited income meaning Nondepleting mining fieldsA method that balances stuff over time is better than a raw number that is gone at some point. And as already been said Space is big nobody would notice if the asteroid field changed a little bit as long as the general character stays intact and your local grid is semipersistent.I dont think that a hardcorepersistence is necessary nor will it enhance the gameplay by a noticable degree. Even worse It limits the things you might want to do.Want to play a little archeology Star Trekish science stuff after months of dogfighting against the Vanduul? Sorry all special locations have already been visited and been sucked dry. This is not good. If artifacts would respawn of course with a timer this would be much better for everyone who want to be free in hisher decisions on how to play this game without a goldrushhunt for artifacts in the beginning and then never doing it again.Same goes for mining btw.

9167182,0,t3_55v88d,At GamesCom CR said that the curve of real cash for introductory ships to capital ships is significantly more shallow than what theyre currently planning for UEC. Of course all subject to change.Personally and I have no evidence for this but I hope that ships in game are going to be absurdly expensive. To the extent that everything in your list would need at least one extra zero. In exchange for this I like to see at least half of the missions offered in the game have at least an option to use a company ship.Under this model really anyone at anytime would be able to accept an Aurora ES delivery contract from the starting factionscompanies. As you gain reputation with these companiesfactions this would open up other missions to pilot more and more expensive ships for them. This reputation curve would follow more of whats listed here.Start at ArcCorp get some missions flying Auroras. After about  hours of this youll start getting more combat orientated missions flying Mustangs and  series. Another  hours and youll be piloting Hornets and Sabres or Freelancers. After about  hrs youll start to be able to command Constellations for them. And so on.Thats also not considering that during this time youll be able to accept crewed missions for other players or NPCs allowing you to enjoy gameplay on those larger capital ships a lot earlier. To buy a Hornet in game and start performing more mercenary work I think youd be looking at a good month of play time.This both makes owning a ship a much bigger accomplishment while giving players access to enjoy the gameplay on a variety of ships a lot earlier.,starcitizen,d8e09y2,1,t5_2v94d

9167363,0,t1_d8d17sh,gt Its not now but it was when originally pledged. The original pledge site is there and the number is there. And this is what people are trying to compare the Polaris to without accepting that CIG have already said its a different ship.Dude its like whatever I say goes right over your head. Size is irrelevant. It just happens to be directly related with how much capability a ship has when it gets built ingame thus the Idriss size increase. What did I say two posts above? gt When the Idris was first sold IdrisM we didnt even have a size of the ship to go by.People bought the Idris based on its specification which is what matters. The Idris was pitched to have a hangar big enough to hold  hornets while also having anti capital ship capabilities its STS cannon. When CIG sold it for   for IdrisM people bought it because the specifications practically described it as a pocket carrier capable of defending itself with big guns. The term corvette or frigate just denotes the size of the ship the Idris being turned into a frigate was inevitable because the original specification said it would hold  hornets but its hangars werent big enough in the original concept. Therefore it got a size increase. The Polaris on the other hand isnt pitched as a pocket carrier nor was it ever pitched to have nearly as much capability as the Idris when it was pitched originally. Let me put this in a exaggerated analogy for you  If CIG sold a concept ship that was m long and promised it would hold  hornets and have  giant railguns to defend itself do you think thats comparable to what the Polaris is being sold as? Do you think the Polaris should be sold at the same price point or near the same price point as this hypothetical ship? Its obvious this hypothetical ship will eventually get a size upgrade because m is not big enough to hold  hornets but the size is irrelevant. Its the specifications that matter as the ship is being built the size will change to match the specifications. And lo and behold the Polaris was revealed to be ! What a surprise!gt Because CIG have said it will be between m Im going to go with that. Speculation is always fun but its not constructive when you have information from CIG that conflicts with it.Literally every ship that has ever had a concept sale has increased in size. And when Chris said the size will be m that was the original pitch not something he said when he knew what the exact size of the ship was the ship wasnt even fully concepted at the time he said it. ,starcitizen,d8e13pa,0,t5_2v94d

Mustang Beta because gotta find those mining spots cheaply sell the locations to.. yourself! have a okay combat ship if hopefully you can upgrade it do starter missions...

Wanted something that handled better and still having the cargo options..  Figured Id upgrade to an Avenger Titan so what I did was to upgrade in  increments so I could test them all out.  So first upgraded to a Mustang Alpha then Aurora LN then Mustang Beta awesome interior! then Aurora CL and finally arrived at the Avenger Titan.

9184805,0,t1_d8g7vfk,Yeah these tend to be issues with the way the specific ship is defined in terms of walls and boundaries more than problems at the root of the game engine.

I jetpacked towards it until my jets ran out waited I guess it recharges? jetted again and finally got to the ship which was spinning so rapidly I couldnt get the canopy open.

9230316,0,t1_d8ly976,Well it was clearly scripted so... Im not sure if it counts.  They had that in games like that one in Dubai... not to the same level but I was personally hoping for lush jungle and low level fog with a ship descending through the low clouds to pick up a guy running for his life from native species after completing some quest.As for view distance... on single player ARMA I can get a decent frame rate with a km view distance so while I understand what youre getting at its obviously still early days.  But I never really complained about the pop in  its still amazing theres no loading screens.What I had issue with was the day that the trees looked pretty much identical.  I wasnt expecting ARMA Tanoa level rainforest detail but it was still a little underwhelming to what I think everyone had been expecting.Dont get me wrong  its still amazing.  Its still a massive achievement that theyve come this far.  Its mostly cutting edge tech that they developed against all odds that a normal publisher would never allow because of the cost involved.  But we were built up to a much higher degree of expectation over the past few weeks so it was a little underwhelming in comparison.,starcitizen,d8m0dgz,1,t5_2v94d

No one made Chris Roberts say a few weeks ago that theyd be showing SQ yesterday.This is solidly their fault and they do not learn how to message better despite having years of experience with really big delays.On top of that the repeated missed deadlines and delays while communicating the wrong thing is obviously going to make people wonder when the game will ever be done.

9234838,0,t1_d8mkkk1,Yeah well see. Nothing will force them to do anything. Many people are happy playing GTAVs one city packed full of stuff to do. The space genere though making a comeback is still a niche market compared to MOBAs and dedicated online fps games. Its also possible that CIG can sell the tech to other companies for a pretty penny. But who knows if that will happen or the legality of the base being the Cryengine. So thats beyond any info I have. But its highly doubtful that any major game company or any at all already has tech like this that theyre sitting on and not releasing for some strange keep the market down kind of reason. Its really to do with the timeprofit ratio. One powerful advantage CR has besides not answering to any investors or corporate board is that he doesnt give a shit about the game making a profit. He only wants enough money to keep the game going as long as possible.Some people talk shit but his movie studio put out some movies that were very well recieved the wing commander games and other games he made were highly successful in their time and the dude has been prosperous in his endeavors overall. nobody lives without failureSo not caring about profits is a huge advantage to whats going into this project. That is something EA or Ubisoft or any other AAA publisher cannot get rid of.Another thing that most AAA publisher DO care about is the console market and this tech wont be on consoles in the near future. ,starcitizen,d8ml0fu,2,t5_2v94d

9236957,0,t1_d8mu3n8,CIG as a company shares all kinds of information about development with the community which will naturally contain some info regarding their internal development speeds and development direction goals. It is not possible to not set expectations when you share information like that even if you do not outright state dates simply due to giving away information about development state and development speed.Chris Roberts had a bad habit of outright sharing these internal development goals that is true but he knows about it and stopped giving out that sort of info for the most part.Stuff like  for SQ is a different topic entirely You need to set those goals publicly if you want to do media reveals. At some point you have to say a date. Thats just how it is. You wont just drop the game silently one day without having said anything about it. But even then Again its irrelevant for Citizencon The expectation for what should be revealed was set by rational assumptions about what is left to be shown and what should be shown based on development statespeed information not just because CIG stated it would be shown.However regardless of thisSean Murray and Peter Molyneux are not disliked for missing development goals  they are disliked because their games were not nearly as good as they stated. Chris Roberts or CIG has a bad track record of breaking release dates but they do not have a bad track record of underdelivering when they actually release something.

Understandably. Youre basically giving your engine to a competitor. Supposedly it was enough money that it basically saved Cryteks future though which is why they did it. Unless Crytek dies as a company and CIG no longer has any obligations to them under their license or can buy the rights to more permissive relicensing cheaply in a situation like that where Crytek is desperate I dont see CIG being in a situation where theyll be able to sell or license StarEngine to other devs sadly.,starcitizen,d8mz9hw,0,t5_2v94d

That being said in the demo planets looked mostly complete. That cloth canopy tho....As for spectrum it looks like its just  a webapp and  of corp functions could be handled through it until you get to in game interaction. And by that logic they could do it with the current corp interface as well. The issue comes with security. Do you manage and store all the corp data behind the web app server and have the game constantly query that server for corp membership status? Or do you store the data on the game server side and have the web app mirror the game server?The latter is less network intensive. Massively so. However requires being written in a compiled language. Much more time consuming for development but faster and more robust. Less CPU time to run. Spectrum on the other hand is probably written in pythonphpjavac which are scripted or JIT compiled languages. Much faster to develop with but expensive on the CPU. They could have combined this approach having a C written API that runs on the game server and is accessed with a java user interface. Each approach has security implications but I imagine that synapse will just be a better version of what we have now with the in game aspects coming in later.,starcitizen,d8p96fe,1,t5_2v94d

Yes its sort of a pain to turn to the door but it should only really take a glance and hopefully CIG would put in a layer that would detect that your intention was to close the door even if you didnt get particularly close to the actual location. In reference to the door the whole door would be the interaction point if done right you could make the inner thought slide on the plane to be in sight but contained on the door itself.This takes some thought by the UI designers and for the gameplay programmers to actually have Surfaces they can attach but I would hope they are putting this kind of thought to object interaction anyways.,starcitizen,d8pmbn2,3,t5_2v94d

Can we order them to take over control and fly and possibly to combat? In a case a player decided to take scanning activity to themselves and needed the npc to do orbital fly or just sentry the perimeter . Can we hire npc to escort us rather than having them aboard our ship? If its possible do we need to have an extra ship owned or rent or do they comes in bundles along with their ships.

9263018,0,t3_5795m8,You are analyzing its role as combatant only which is wrong and which is what makes it different from WWII era naval ships. WWII naval ships were exactly that  military things designed to kill other military things.Polaris is a militia craft. It designed for patrol small force hq long autonomous fight crew comfort etc. When it comes to combat it falls back to the bomber role yes but its not its sole purpose actually its more like an auxiliary purpose. The main purpose is patrolling and fending off small threats like small ships etc. And if a big bad force is discovered  call military and help them as much as you can by launching torpedoes.Retaliator on other hand is solely a bomber. Its not designed for anything else. And probably its much better at bombing.And the point that torpedoes are unreliable  you are not intended to launch torpedoes just like that. You need to somehow netrualize the target ability to defend itself by disabling engines if its agile and by disabling countermeasures either by hacking spamming with lesser missiles or light bombings and then you can finish it with devastating torpedo blast. And thats where harbinder and gladiator come to play  their goal is to strip off enemy target of its defences against bigger ships.,starcitizen,d8q5jst,1,t5_2v94d

9269141,0,t1_d8qwmqu,  We dont really know. This is something the devs are still working on. The original goal was at least  with optimistic goals of  but things change as the game develops.   Depends on the ship in question. Most ships come with insurance of some sort. If the ship is destroyed when you have insurance you get a replacement ship. If its a big rare ship like a capital ship then the replacement may take a while and the time it takes to get a replacement can increase on consecutive loses that is to say you cant just keep ramming your ship every time you get it and get a quick replacement. If you dont have insurance then you lose the ship. This applies to ships at least up to the Destroyer Class. The largest capital ships like the Bengal Carrier cant be purchased by players and  as such cant be insured. They exist in limited amounts at a time and are persistent objects in the game world. They have to be captured and protected by players  as they exist even if no one is online. Note that the current system of buying ships exists for funding development they wont be sold the way they are now when the game is released. While the cheaper ships can have their dollar value associated to their in game cost the higher up you go the more it changes. Ships are expected to cost  or even  times as much as their current value when we conver  to  UEC.  a Yes and no. There is no direct way to from factions in the same sense as NPC factions and there is no direct form of territory ownership. Organizations can form alliances and organizations can have some control over an area simply by being the strongest force in said area but they dont own it.  b The economy is based on supply and demand so yes player action especially concentrated actions of a lot of players combined will have an influence on the economy. However the game economy isnt intended to  player controlled they can influence the economy of certain goods or in a certain area but they cant crash the entire human economy. ,starcitizen,d8qxheb,2,t5_2v94d

If that is actually the case then we can cease conversation at this point dont read further as youve proven my exactly point to begin with.I say go shout in your safe spaceThats the closest they got to attacking you up to this point. Also dismissive but after you were. So if thats an attack you actually started it. Yes after the go to reddit that doesnt belong here etc etc etc. Uh yeh so again starting where you started sure looks like I did doesnt it lol.  That however was not the case.And then...Evarr Slipstream uhm i talk in here ALL the time. MVP poster been here since the start and you idiots want to tell me go to reddit? uhm....Thats the thing you lied here about not doing. Being outright insulting and calling names. I never lied about anything.  I absolutely said I was just as impolite back.  And still would.DanielleCIG Whoa settle yourselves This was not said.  Ever.

The people in the chat apparently dont get the option of not engaging.LOLOL nice job separating this from the entire thing which was  I want opinions from people in here  that I normally talk to.  EXPLAINING why I was asking there and not in reddit.  Not insisting anything you twit.  Omg.  Dont sit here and try to create a narrative by only giving PART of what was said.  Wow just WOW.FyreMaster Evarr here  no I do not agree with you they should NOT show an incomplete bad broken Sq level there. you now have my opnion.Evarr Slipstream so fyre youre thought is that sq is in that bad of state?Extrapolating worst possible scenario from general response. Someone who wont even know what state its in and you are prompting them to talk about how bad it must be. This would be the instigating you said you dont do. Also called just asking questions. Cant tell here if youre just trolling or you actually believe it?  It was a serious question and a serious concern.  Im also wondering WHAT people do think... do they think its in such a bad state it wasnt shown?  I mean look at what he wrote I was GENUINELY interested in thats the thought process right now.  A LOT has been written already... sq only in grey box state sq delayed indefinitely.   I went looking to see if people I have talked to normally about this stuff were agreeing this was the case or possibly had some other things I overlooked etc.  Why in the absolute hell do you think I went in there and asked the question in the first place?  Just for funsies?  Wth is wrong with you?Evarr if your lookin for a fight leave.Fair request.LOL not when he was the one who said all of this before thatignored wall of text  real nice I realize a short paragraph is tough to read for the ADD generation and all but really?  Throw an attack immediately.  Nice!That looked like the TLDR version is So not relating to SC at all I like Planitside lets talk about it  Uhm what?  So my question didnt relate to SC at all... LOL.  shows you how much people actually do read not unlike yourselfPeople think this is the palce to go to nay say the game  Like I was naysaying the game that I defend on a daily basis.  Give me a break.  Seriously.    Then he goes onI say go shout in your safe space  yeh dont even need to comment at this point on this guy.oh thats right.. THEN WE FINALLY GET TO WHAT YOU POSTED!  wt  evarr is youre looking for a fight just leave.  Yeh seems REAL fair from that point of view now... LOL.  It so helps to really post the actual instigations first doesnt it.  I mean I know it hurts seeing it out there for everyone.Evarr Slipstream syrus youre the one pushing Im looking for conversationConversation steered towards how things suck and one people dont get to opt out of apparently. How the hell was it steered towards how things suck?  Ya know the best part?  I actually dont think they do lol.  So though you try to spin it that Im a FUDDER Im so the opposite its funny.  But thats what makes your whole narrative crack me up even more.DanielleCIG Evarr Ill have to ask you to keep it to a polite conversation if youd like to continue to chat. Otherwise please post to the forum.Fair request and politely stated. Not an attack at all.HAHAHAHAHAh omfg.  This was so edited from the actual log Im dying.

And warranted.Evarr Slipstream has been kicked from the room.What more needs to be said? You started a conversation people didnt care for were told that it wasnt the place got insistent then insulting then mouthed off to a mod. Then you misrepresent all that here whining about how they were mean to you and get called out on it by just about everyone. This whole thing is BS. There are two options hereYoure so wrapped up in yourself you cant tell when youre being abrasive and insulting assuming that any slight from someone else towards you is unprecedented instead of duly earned. Classic egomania where anything you do is fine but everyone else must treat you right.Or...You are an instigator. You pop in places and just ask questions pushing the conversation towards your goal of Gosh it is kinda a messed up game. But I still like it. Even though its broken. Probably hopeless really. But Ill back it to the end! This isnt a new tactic BTW. Its old as shit. So when people think theyre being clever with it... well....Either way youre not in the right. You were told that there. You were told that here. Youre refusing to accept it. The repeated I didnt do that is not flying in the face of the logs. Crying innocent with the evidence at your feet.Self reflect. You should either try to grow as a person and recognize your flaws or stop this sad long troll and find something constructive to do with your time. And now we know the ACTUAL story.  So you can have the opinion you have and thats all good because obviously yours doesnt matter in the end does it.  What does matter is that what happened is not cool.  While you may not like me punching back when punched its going to happen.  Will edit my original post to reflect the two absolute blatent lies in the log.,starcitizen,d8raud9,-1,t5_2v94d

Also worth considering on the Khartual is that we dont yet have the Xian Lasers its suppose to come stock with. These might be super powerful but super hot perhaps giving a similar experience to the Glaives cannons..editAlso yes the Khartual is flight ready. You can fly it for free until Monday.Ill mention however there is a pretty nasty bug in its flight model right now. Often itll start uncontrollably strafing. This usually happens when entering landing mode. To fix it just turn your engines off and on while in landing mode key  by default to resolve. If it even happens while not in landing mode I need to coax it into landing mode before toggling engines to fix. This can be a bit tricky because you need to be going under  ms in order to enter landing mode. Basically just turn your ship around so your uncontrolled strafe is countering the current direction and youll pop it into landing mode. The bug also frequently crops up when entering the ship from EVA so always put it into landing mode and cycle the engines before exiting.

9371971,0,t1_d93czd1,gtThere are tons of games out there that have completely different metrics on ingame asset value compared to time spent. The primary point is that CIG likely does not plan on needing a ton of sustaining income from ingame purchases with IRL money unlike a game thats otherwise completely free to play so its highly unlikely that theyre tuning costs so that the player feels like theyre getting value by skipping some sort of grind in order to purchase the ships.Could you specify which games you are talking about? Monetized MMOs that link player time with money via selling player time or money have pretty standard mean earning rates as well as RMT markets undercutting them. That also holds true for MMOs that started as BP with or without additional subscriptions. That is the fact I was talking about. Even if CIG decides to not link monetization with player progression at all by lets say sticking to cosmetics only there still is something to be said about the value of paid items in converted playtime as well as the mean rate of player progression as a factor promoting gameplay. For example game progression balancing means that you might be fine with having to travel an hour to get to the next system or spend two hours to complete a simple mission or quest. Other people dont have the time to do that or the inclination and CIG is designing the game for both of you. I agree that we are speculating about things coming after launch here and that we dont have the whole picture. Isnt this though what we always do in games under development?

But Im a teacher and I teach kids with emotional disabilities and there are some things I see in the design of Star Citizen that are very good indicators for me. TBH I could go on about it for hours but mostly it boils down to thisYou have to give people an outlet to scratch that sociopathic itch. The piratebounty huntersmuggler might be just what some people are looking for in their gaming experience. Through ingame mechanics theyll slowly learn that dying in a stolen ship in unsecured space over and over isnt sustainable. You cant build up money and buy the things you want that way. Theyll see their victims picked up and rescued then flying by in their freshly minted insurance replacement. To cause a mild inconvenience you risk losing everything. It teaches people how to behave themselves but gives them infiction options to misbehave.As for those that just want to purely troll and damn the consequences Im sure the TOS has some line about abusing game mechanics. Should it get to the point where infiction responses arent appropriate which from the lore posts it sounds like infiction responses can scale up to having a Navy fleet drop in on you Im sure they can just be reported and banned.,starcitizen,d96cnad,1,t5_2v94d

Youve pledged your money to earn your Citizenship.Now its our turn.We the Star Citizen team at Cloud Imperium hereby promise to deliver the game you expect. You the tens of thousands of pledgers have allowed us to cut out the big publisher and build the game on our terms. To let us focus on quality free of the pressure to deliver by a certain financial quarter. To nurture a new original IP. To put fun ahead of shareholder profits.We the Developer intend to treat you with the same respect we would give a publisher. You will receive regular updates about the progress of the game. We will do a show and tell for each major milestone. Your voice will be heard and represented in our development docs and our feature wish list. You will see art and video and learn about how we intend to implement gameplay mechanics well before the rest of the world. The website will be updated and the community will be maintained. Though the limitations of technology may slow us we will always do the best for you if it breaks we will fix it.There may be delays and there may be changes we recognize that such things are inevitable and would be lying to you if we claimed otherwise. But when this happens we will treat you with the respect you deserve rather than spending your money on public relations. When we need to change a mechanic or alter something you believe should be in the game we will tell you exactly why.Your support over the past month has been incredible. Youve done your part and we will now do our utmost to live up to your expectations. We will build you the game you are dreaming about.SignedChris Roberts and the Cloud Imperium TeamThe idea that merely communicating to backers is in some way an emotional burden or will hamper development is out of line imo.

So when the second object moves all the objects on it move automatically. To add even more complexity the container objects dont just move they rotate as well so movements within  them happen along different axis than the movements of the container itself. And to add even more complexity these containers can be nested multiple layers deep people on a ship on a station he didnt mention this but others have. A major challenge in implementing this was that the game engine uses  bit positions for the level and containers but graphics processors only accept  bit. So they calculate all the positions relative to a camera in  bits in the engine then translate that to  before sending it to the GPU.I hope youre not actually ... And that this makes some sense Edit I should clarify that in CIG terminology this system is called physics grids and the object container system is more for linking things together for loadingstreamingnet code purposes.

9472673,0,t1_d9gl9y2,A lot of the computer components do not even need future proof however people define it for themselves. I hate the connotation of the word but your CPU RAM PSU and motherboard last at least  to  years before they somewhat become behind the current tech. And obviously its upto the users all the time what games they play. Future proofing is really a buzzword people always use to hope that itll be ready and still be relevant even in a few years but by default a lot of the components already stay in good position even in  years. But of course with the exception of GPU. It depends on your monitor resolution the games that you want to play and many other things factor in before the consideration of an upgrade. My point is whatever the current high end hardwares are youll be still good to go even in few years. ,starcitizen,d9gpmpn,1,t5_2v94d

9476680,0,t3_5ajluw,Because from their apparent point of view they have no incentive to do so and every reason to stay silent. Sadly their strongest incentive in a financial sense is their ships sales. Every new ship generates at least a million in its first day essentially for nothing more than a deviantart worthy concept painting or two. Conversely and in the best case scenario they get comparatively nothing for announcing new mechanics or releasing updates. Or in  a worst case scenario they may receive sharp criticism or outright hostility from the community or larger game market. This is  their own fault since their solution to past shortcomings has been to fire staff announce more ships and more features divide the community on multiple levels  three test communities and three classes of players and finally to close off development news until a near complete feature is ready to drop golf swing scanners anyone?.So with that in mind think about the next big thing on the horizon now that its November. Its not . or . or star marine or SQ......Its the anniversary ship sale...Thats where their priority is.

9584538,0,t1_d9uhisk,No matter how people individually feel about it theyve very clearly said there will be no swapping out the torpedo related areas for other things. If I wanted to use the Polaris to haul cargo can I use the hangar bay for that? What about swapping out the torpedoes for additional cargo space? If so how much cargo do you anticipate can fit using all the space available to me?The torpedo bay is nonmodular and will not be replaceable as the ships main purpose is to bring firepower. Strictly speaking you can put whatever you want inside the hangar bay as long as you can make it fit but the issue you may run into is the lack of cargo plates like the ones found in the cargo hold that allow you to attach your haul to the ship. You may find that cargo floating away when the hangar doors open in zero G.

9586147,0,t3_5c81eq,Quite the contrary. I bought more or less exclusively  ships. Why? Because while I will start out in a small vessel exploring the starting areas of the game enjoying early gameplay and so forth there will come a time when I want to progress. Now there wont be a traditional system of progression. No skills no levels and IIRC no distinct advantage of bigger ships over smaller ones in their respective niche. But what will be there is some form of grind to be able to buy the bigger ships. As I am in a position where I value my time higher than my money I simply decided that if I am able to bypass that grind by paying then I should do that. That being said I am well aware of high running costs costs of AI crew upfront investments in assets beside the ship itself etc.. So I do not expect to jump into a Polaris on day one hell or even in the first year. But pledging for a big ship now still eliminates the time needed to grind for it. ,starcitizen,d9uosen,2,t5_2v94d

It would perhaps stop a lot of the existing criticism ok would be different criticism of course and there would be a full playable game!No one thinks thats the better option and indeed it isnt even on the table. I think the main issue is that youre hung up on a very specific definition of release which isnt shared by CIG or us and simply isnt the way theyre developing. With SC theyre releasing every system to us as it gets finished then we test it and they improve it then they release something else. This is going to continue until we have a finished game at which point theyll release it for general sale and you wont be able to buy ships with real money anymore. Thats really the only difference between the current alpha and release just the point where you buy the game and earn ships in game. At no point will access be taken away from backers so theres no real line between alphabetarelease youre always able to play whatevers done.tldr Your option  has never been an option we get all features as soon as theyre ready and this will continue. When we say were willing to wait it isnt for some meaningless . that includes every system promised us in a finished package its for systems that work and are awesome.

9651187,0,t1_da2hkd3,Im sticking with easy to learn hard to master. See theres all these decisions you  get to make  gimbals or fixed and later apparently we get autoturrets as an option? missiles are getting some love etc. Also rerouting power between shields weapons and propulsion is a pretty big deal as well as managing the maneuvers and Gforces to name a few.Age of Conan for example had a deceptively simple combat system too. It was basically combos. The game showed you which keys to press like up up left right up and your character did a flashy combo ending with a massive attack when you pressed that last up key. And you had about a second to press each step or combo broke. So remembering them was a bit of a challenge. People who frequently played Mortal Kombat etc. were used to it but this was an MMO so a bit of a shock. Took people a while. But the important bit was that you also had shields left right and top. So for optimal results you had to know that the opponent is doing a combo with the last step  being up which meant that if you rearrange all  of your shields to to up it would block almost all of the damage. But you had to recognize the attack by the combo and remember which was the last step. For each class. And rearrange the shields for optimal defense in real time while doing your own combos correctly. THAT separated the good players from mediocre. A mediocre player might get positioning right and do his combos right and so on but when faced with a good player who also played his shields properly the mediocre player just flat out lost. I expect to see the same in SC  players managing their power systems will do much better than players doing  default split. And thatll take a while to master.Similarly Gforces and their management will be big in some areas. If you watch some of the good videos of racing the really good guys are moving and turning so fast they are in semiblackout mode for most of the race and on tight turns they almost black out but not quite. Like approaching the ring they are already turning so hard the whole screen is red but then it fades a bit and you can see you just passed the ring and they accelerate into red again. That takes a lot of skill. By comparison the average players are going around like theyre driving Miss Daisy.I think multicrew ships offer very interesting elements as well as far as learning goes. Its fine when you have good players but to succeed in a team environment they have to play together support each other. This can be seen in places like WoWs Arena back in the day before they botched everything up. Just being a good player wasnt enough you had to have cooperation communication and adaptability. You had to recognize a threat to the teammate realize that because of his classpositionspec he cannot deal with it and do what you can to break that or inform another teammate if he cant see it who can do it for you. Without that awareness and communication people dont get far in a ranked environment of the arena. I expect this kind of thing to be important in SC later on when you have people manning turrets controlling shields etc. Therell be a huge difference between a pilot who calls out on voice comms that the target is coming up on the port side or the gunner that requests the pilot to bank left because the target is in the deadzone and so on. Even relatively simple stuff like avatar FPS gameplay changes drastically between normal gravity and zero G where you have inertia and if youre not careful youll just float right past the corner and into the open. It can also be very jarring for an average player to be in an FPS shootout and have the enemy move along the ceiling upsidedown shooting at you. If you are not mentally prepared your jaw just drops and that hesitation is enough to get you killed.And all this is just combat on a basic level. Next comes the loadouts weapon and module choices ship choices etc. And pretty much all of this is already in the game. Then if they add exploration procurement manufacturing transport sales etc. with playerdriven economy I think the game will be sitting pretty.And yeah right now I consider SC to be unplayable. Some people are enjoying it and thats fine but during the free fly weekend I spent literally  hrs just trying to play and couldnt. Things like somebodys corpse rolling around in my cabin blocking the view completely. Loading up the arena commander battle only to be spit back into the lobby with the game saying server is full. Why would it load me if the server is full?! Getting stuck on respawn with no way to exit except kill the client. Big blue Use button stuck in the center of the screen making aiming all but impossible and doubly ironic since this happens often in a mode like Vanduul Swarm where you cant even exit the ship. And many many others. PU was actually surprisingly playable because lack of spectators meant to corpses in the cockpit being able to exit the ship fixed the Use button issue and so on. But overall it was in such a sorry state that I just couldnt justify spending money on it until I see considerable improvement. ,starcitizen,da2pj41,1,t5_2v94d

9653274,0,t3_5d41ik,I always love to talk about EVE and Star Citizen together though many dont. Ive played a few months of EVE on and off over the past  years. What I find is that its hard to continue to play seriously as a solo player after a while as it requires you to remain in specific areas. The true depth of the game in corp play and fleet ops was out of reach as it took so much time to outfit your ship and losing your ship took so much time to reoutfit and get back in the fight. Im hoping that Star Citizen will be more viable for the solosometimes group player and wont be as taxing on getting back into the game upon blacking out or whatever the mechanic is under the death of a spaceman mechanic.,starcitizen,da2yt1j,1,t5_2v94d

Also the gameplay mechanics will be different.Finally the smaller ships will be able to traverse smaller jump points and go to places faster than larger ships make it to a newly discovered asteroid field and mine it by yourself for a couple days before the larger mining operations can get large ships on scene and potentially get to planetsplaces that the larger ships cannot.,starcitizen,da9avq6,1,t5_2v94d

9706287,0,t1_da9fcu0,Yeah the checkout race thing is a bit meh. Id rather see those go out as a lottery personally.At the same time I really like the UEE warbond approach. The whole point is to raise money for development. People mass melting to get a better ship defeats a large part of the whole point.I mean the reality is we have no idea how long or how much effort it will take to earn these items in game. a  Polaris may take  hours of play to earn. An Idris may take . It could be less time.. it could be more. We dont know but the fact is these monetary values assigned to ships are currently very abstract.One thing is for sure even if you have an Idris the likelyhood of you being able to fly it competently with less than  hours of game time accruing capital etc.. I imagine experience will be there from alphabeta participation will be very difficult.I wouldnt be surprised to see someone with  well diverse ships be able to purchase and staff an Idris before someone who has an Idris and  starter ships.,starcitizen,da9iapx,6,t5_2v94d

9710455,0,t1_da9lakx,gt Actually in business terms Cash can be either card or paper moneyThis is not advice or anything legally or whatever and Im going to play fast and loose with some definitions to make it easier to understand.In business terms outside of technical accounting cash can mean whatever the company wants. As consumers we think of cash as being physical moneydebit cards since thats what we interact with on a regular basis. From a business perspective cash is typically more avoiding the whole billingaccounts receivablesome other form of short term credit. Realistically for business to business transactions cash would probably include credit card since the transaction would clear in a day or so.From an accounting perspective cash refers to cash. Kinda. There is cash and cash equivalents which is basically something the company has that isnt cash but could be converted to cash easily and on short notice at a relatively known value.So why kinda? There are two main methods basis for accounting  cash and accrual. With the cash basis accounting happens when cash changes hands. In this case credit card sales would be treated as cash but they wouldnt be recorded until after the cash was actually received. ie Credit  cash.With the accrual basis however everything is recorded immediately based on liability. If somebody owes you money or if you owe them money you record it on the books immediately regardless of when cash or anything changes hands. In this case I would think most companies would opt to increase their Accounts Receivable AR account basically a you owe us money account when they record the sale. Then when they receive the cash they reduce the AR account and increase their cash account by that amount.This approach allows for a more accurate current representation of the current position of a company at any given time. I could see a company treating credit cards as cash though even in accrual basis just because of how short term the delay is but Im not sure if that would be okay by GAAPIFRS standards.,starcitizen,daa0tej,1,t5_2v94d

9717113,0,t3_5ea2mn,We have some information and concept art about jump points.Pioneers will have to use sensors to find new jump points so ship computer alerting you when you arrived is unlikely unless you already have coordinates of that jump point in your ship computer. Orienting ship at right vector at specific coordinates could be a thing as one of the earliest lore pieces about jump point discovery was a form to claim finders fee that mention orientation and location of entrance. I think different spool up times for different jump drives was mentione by developers. I guess it would be when a jump drive would simulate Croshaws faulty quantum drive and leak radiation to open up jump point. Entrance location of JPs are fixed point but ships will exit randomly in a large area. There was queue to use jump point in the first weekly story which also had an important NPC from SQ as main character.Even if there isnt cooldown time you can not instantly turn back in a twoway jump point since you will not exit at exact location of second entrance.Since entrance is fixed point and exit is in a large area you can camp on entrance but you can not effectively camp on exit.These are jump point concepts by Gurmukh Bhasin and Chris OliviaLast two videos on Chris Olivias page arent for jump points.,starcitizen,daaufkf,4,t5_2v94d

9727397,0,t1_dac150q,I have lurked for a long time and come from the shadows to go on a small rant. Does it look strange? Yes. Does this make it very crude animation? No. This is MoCapped the actor doesnt blink that often. There are plenty of actors in film that Ive sat back and wondered why they arent blinking but I never thought that the film was crude or unrealistic because an actor doesnt blink.Nevertheless you should see the Nov.   RTV wherein Forrest Stephan discusses the fact that he was surprised that Eugene Morrows video looked strange because he didnt blink he thought animation missed blinking but when he reviewed the MoCap performance the actor never blinked. Additionally Corey Johnson states that if it ends up bothering enough people animators can add eyebrow raises and blinkingCIG surely can change a number of things if they want to but their animation is anything but very crude. Personally I like that every character doesnt have the exact average human blinking. It adds personality to each character. Same with different teeth and mouth movements. They may not look average or perfect but none of us are in reality either. I have some faith that theyll address the strangeness of blinking andor other facial features.

To keep everything streamlined I think if you want to roll a grenade this should happen if youre crouched and if you want to bounce a grenade you should be standing.

Ten times more cargo space than the Caterpillar..more than a starfarer...if you can trust ship stats..bigger power plant shields weapons armor etc etc. Again this could all be old news and wrong stats etc etc but from what has been said by CIG in the past about it could still be relevant.  The Banu Merchantman isnt just a ship its a home and a way of life. We know that a lot of backers want to become traders and merchants in Star Citizens persistent universe and weve created a ship thats more than just a sterile bulk freighter for you. The Merchantman is a traveling bazar capable of landing or docking and then inviting locals in to view what its cargo holds have to offer. The ship design perfected by generations of Banu development is intended to offer a combination of high speed and durability. While the Banu is less configurable than a Caterpillar or a Starfarer theres still plenty of room to take the ship in different directions. From black market trade platform to deadly qship its a force to be reckoned with! The Merchantman has been described as being adaptable into a fast armored smuggling ship capable of running blockades and escaping authorities Banu Merchantman Negotiation room Has rear guns turrets and forward canons vertical landing engines not just thrusters. The Banu Merchantman will be more than ready to defend itself. S Shields which is highest except for capital ships.  Person Crew. Could be old newsstats but from how its been described by CIG in the past I think it might still be relevant.

You can see your hand hovering as if to interact with the screen.Or as MrHerpDerp said have the panels light up when you are in interactive mode.I like the idea that your hands are removed from the flight controls when you cannot use them. There should also be a hard out button that takes you right back to the flight controls. Like ESC in interactive mode puts you back in control of the ship. ESC in all other instances would take you to the game menu.,starcitizen,dakvlqf,13,t5_2v94d
9798724,0,t3_5fk40h,I hope theres some sort of justification for why some NPCs would remember you. The verse is a big place and there will be a lot of traffic in various areas. That somebody would remember an individual who passed through would be shocking. Theyd need a memory augment or quick access to a database or something.I also hope that we dont have single quest givers like somebody that tons of people are trying to meet. I hope we instead have very similar quests that can be assigned by like  different NPCs for different reasons and completing one of those is how youd unlock the next quest in the chain. Maybe a rich guy had his cargo stolen and wants you to discreetly obtain it from a pirate installation. Maybe a homeless dude on the street tells you that the voices told him that alien ghosts were having dance parties on a moonbase nearby and that he needed you to bring him booze from the base. Theyd lead you to different bases of the same pirate faction for different reasons but youd enjoy the same fundamental gameplay  raiding a pirate base and pissing off the same pirate group. It provides a more unique lore experience while offering what amounts to the same quest and results in less crowding of quest givers. Personally Id also prefer quest boards  craigslist today is basically the same thing and I dont see why it would be replaced in the near or far future.Basically the idea is that its sort of a choose your own adventure type deal and you could just run around the verse enjoying yourself and more than likely organically stumble upon one of the quest givers for the overarching quest series if there is one.The crew mechanics will be interesting.

9825815,0,t3_5fz8vc,Quite enjoyed the read.Since youre famished as far as feedback is concerned I will get right to that In an everrepeating cycle each passing generation would hoist their children to stand upon the shoulders of their own discovery to continue the human races exponential march of progress. the common metaphor would be dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants I like your variation of it but I feel like it would actually evoke a stronger reaction with the reader if you changed it to ... their children to sit upon the shoulders .... Especially given the ending I feel like it would tie in better and make it more your own. I feel like the characters maybe tap a bit too heavily into common archetypes even if its obviously hard to tell from that short glimpse into their daily routine but their brief background excerpts seems rather lacklustre and very runofthemill. That point is further stressed by giving both Ross Miller and Anthony Vargas the quick temper flaw which makes them harder to distinguish. The latter is probably a more serious complaint than the former because archetypes by themselves are not really that much of an issue some stories thrive on it and if its good enough for the crew of the Serenity it could do for their Aimless peers. simple correction After another short trip across vacuum the men once again found themselves within the familiar comfort of the Aimless. Jack made sure to ask his wife to hook the the emphasis mine salvaged computer core up to the Aimless and pull its data as soon as he stepped aboard with it. While she worked at cracking the core Jack sat down with the mobiglass he had retrieved from the derelicts attached Merlin and keyed it open. The first file was a video that was delivered to a recipient in the Elysium system. ties into the paragraph posted above its tempting to turn mobiGlas into a proper noun as its a brand name but it appears the manufacturer made a conscious decision to actually write it as mobiGlas  so Id use it like that throughout your piece especially since youre not consistent with your usage. Reference mobiGlas I really liked the snow globe analogy to the point of inspiring a background tune to it in my head.Of course a lot of this is subjective and you may or may not dismiss at as you see fit. Especially the characters could just need more time and being seen from a different perspective to see that they are less onedimensional as that initial piece may have made it seem.Hope that helped.

9833029,0,t3_5fyrn6,Im really looking forward to how their music logic system will play out. Im reminded of the music logic system that was in UT. To me UT has such great iconic tracks that I love listening to on their own even more so than in game. However UT had layers added as you engaged into combat and disengaged. This didnt work so well because it rather chopped up the tracks so you could never enjoy the full track in game as parts were constantly cut in and out.Adding these layers over longer durations as the match progresses seems like a much better implementation of this kind of logic. Moreover Im really interested in their approach which has the music giving you information. Again back to UT I would only have the music on while enjoying the single player campaigns but once I got to competitions you turned it off as it was distracting you from other more useful information.While Im not sold that I wont end up doing this in Star Citizen anyway it is interesting to consider that music could be giving you useful information. I wonder if theyve thought about isolating footsteps gunshots terminal use sounds and other pickups that there may be.

Now for example if a corp came upon a large asteroid or dare i say a small moon they could potentially set up operations and defend said operation from outside players NPC or Real.If this is plausible to some degree then the same could be said about an area of a habitable planet as well if the corp was large enough and willing to invest time in defending their setup then i think it would be plausible for a corp to set up a semipermanent position.Now jumping to my earlier point IF that corp owned term used loosely that small patch of ground could the use of atmoonly defense ships be plausible?I would like to think yes but i left it open to discussion.,starcitizen,dapz3sp,1,t5_2v94d

Taking a stolen uninsured ship out in to sketchy potentially lawless space and having to pay X before you can truly do anything with it would help add some of these immersion layers and potential emergent gameplay to stealing ships.Wont stop people from stealing and blowing up your ship to be a dick but hopefully death of a space man mechanics will help penalise such griefy behavior.,starcitizen,daq9vu9,1,t5_2v94d

Patch . should change the game heavily and provide much more fun with its star marine fps arena and changes to how dogfighting works. Personally I would suggest waiting until . drops in a few weeks before downloading the gb client as there will be many more missions to do in the persistent universe and they have changed how ships handle and rebalanced a lot of things that you will otherwise have to learn twice.

9850974,0,t3_5ge9bx,Honestly if that fuelconsumptionincruise thing could be a way to finally give an advantage to ship made for long range against short range it could be really good IMO.That would solve a lot of whine. I will do some theory crafting here.I will take the Vanguard for example a long range ship. Against small fighter short range the Vanguard isnt efficient in combat against more nimble craft and atm doesnt have shield and armor complete but thats another story.. small ships can fly around the vanguard and avoid every hit and keep their weapon on the Vanguard almost all time while the V cant keep up....Now with that afterburnercruise it could change everything. If the V stay and try to wrestle with the small ships it will get rekt like before... But with that cruise and his long range fuel cell the V could break from combat and leave the small ships behind by cruising further than the short range could ever do turn around and choose where and when hit the small ships in a boomampzoom tactics....That way short range can destroy anything whos stupid enough to stay in their range and going in their groundand long range can outlast short range who try to keep up with them and destroy the stupid who try to swim in high water with them.It seem good to me if its anything like that...,starcitizen,darlrzr,37,t5_2v94d

9865922,0,t3_5gn3du,I was one of those people. No way would we have procedural planets before the game is released if ever. I mean back then procedural planets were either Minecraft like voxel creations or Space Engine... and of course how could you even get that to work on the CryEngine. As an explorer at heart Im so happy to be proven wrong. Its the one feature of Star Citizen that I just could not see happening as much as I would have liked it. I expected to see the Freelancer method with maybe a hidden loading screen and from an FPS perspective.Now heres the thing. Think of how many barren planets and moons across all the systems are planned for SC? The Ark map gives a good example but lets just agree that its a lot. Its kind of mind blowing when you think how varied these environments can be and all of the fidelity that they contain due to a combination of procedural tech and hand crafted work. Thats... so much to explore thousands of square kilometers filled with nothing and thousands more with stuff. You could easily be on the same planet with a few hundred other players and never see them but theres always that potential for a chance encounter and shoot out or to be the first to find a derelict ship hidden under the sand.As for city planets I think well still have the old method were youll be forcibly guided down to a landing pad from orbit. Youll have medium sized hand crafted locations and these will be great player hubs to meet others and team up.What Id like to know is what theyre doing for the half and half planets the planets that are mostly uninhabited but have a few cities. I could imagine being able to fly around a portion of the planet but going near a city will result in a forced docking like above.Im also really curious about special cases like Hades and Synthworld which would need a lot of unique assets. I could imagine them being treated as city planets with hand crafted locations but it would be amazing if they were procedural.,starcitizen,datjw96,9,t5_2v94d

9867970,0,t1_datobsy,well if someone knocks me out of quantum wouldnt I immediately afterburn away?  Pirates might be able to catch me they might not but I maintain distance while calculating a new quantum travel escape.   The amount of difference I maintain is wholly dependent on max speed differences not fuel consumption at max speed because the fuel consumption allows minutes of full speed travel before it becomes a problem and accelerations reach max speed in seconds.  Well before those minutes are over the result of the chase would be known.  Either the pirates wont catch me or I cant get away.  In either case thats nothing but frustration for one party... with nothing they can do about it.  If the pirates can fire at you while you run and you can fire back then at least it becomes a turtle battle about withstanding enough damage to get away or doing enough damage with rear facing guns to destroy the pirates since cruise prevents you from changing course quickly.Note If its possible for pirates to man a vessel that will always win that race they will always win that race.  Or all high value shipping will be done with the one or two vessels that pirates cant catch.  Price and availability is no obstacle and max speeds and fuel tax do not inject skill into the equation.Basically if the cruisespeed chase is what the pirating game boils down to they arent headed in the right direction for engaging gameplay.  ,starcitizen,datti64,2,t5_2v94d

9888787,0,t3_5gwovg,I own a carrack too but I toyed around with the idea of owning a reclaimer to combo with it not instead ofIt all comes down to how those carrack scanners are going to work and if reclaimer is pvp salvage only or if there will be rogue space salvage.If there is random space salvage and carrack can pick that up in scans... these two ships may have a bit of a symbiotic relationship. All theory though If reclaimer is pvp salvage only you gotta run into systems with previous group battles and harvest away. My guess is big alliances will cleaning the field with their own reclaimer and guards. That would mean reclaimer is good to own if you join the cleanup crew duties of big groups. Carrack will likely shine as the solosmall team explorers ship. Again it all depends how over powered they make our Carracks scanners. If they make its scanners one of the best if not the best in the game then exploration could become secondary to its info gathering prowess. Imagine jumping to a system sweeping with the scanner package knowing everything and everybody in it then jumping out. That becomes quite a powerful strategy tool in warfare and commerce. In my mind right now I can visualize a more fun future with a Carrack than the Reclaimer unless they add random salvage. Even then you need a way to find said salvage. The carrack just seems like there is a lot of cool things you can do to keep yourself entertained at all times. Possibly sell information or work as long range info gatherer for big alliances. No matter what reclaimer just gathers salvage and it may be hard to even find. Definitely hold off on ccu until the last minute. There is just too much we dont know yet even flying the ships will not tell the whole story of these two ships. They have complicated futures that require tons of the game world and world mechanics to be built yet and we are still mostly in the ship porn timeline of the building process. After jobs start to get fleshed out then you will know for sure which one makes sense for your preferences. Right now my gut says owning both if it all goes down how I would like. ,starcitizen,dawj5n7,3,t5_2v94d

You will then be charged a landing fee like normal and during the journey back the AI in your ship can potentially be killed or captured your ship destroyed damaged robbed or stolen.If logging out while using the bed or crew quarters feature your ship will remain in its current location but be safe from any interaction from players or NPCs.

Even if we assume that a big rogue org can steal some the UEEN will always have more.Additionally people keep throwing around the true capital ships like the Retribution and Bengalclass ships. The UEEN doesnt even need those. The largest players can get is a destroyer. Lets call that equivalent to a Fletcherclass DD from WWII. x  guns  mm Bofors about the same number of mm Orlikons and torpedoes. Whole lot of dakka in a small package.Go up one level and take a look at the Atlantaclass LIGHT cruisers. They had the same number of  guns that the Fletchers had....on one broadside. Plus a bunch more dakka. Go up another step to heavy cruisers.  guns will wreak a Fletchers day.My point is that sure the UEEN can monkey stomp an org with one of the true capital ships.

Basically being able to establish a military comms net. Currently in Discord you can create multiple channels but you cant transmit to all or inbetween them via voice.

10001146,0,t3_5iqm0i,I hate to say it......but I think a lot of these issues all stem from the way that Chris and Cloud Imperium games handles their marketing.  They want to create interest by promising XYZ features that are no where near complete and tell people that the experience you so desperately crave and have backed for years is just around the corner.  Then they start pushing ship package sales tshirt sames and other merchandise.  Which essentially is fine they need to make money to continue funding the game.  But then they dont deliver on their promises miss their own dates or have hyped features get put on the back burner star marine ect because XYZ reason and because of the nature of game development.  In my opinion a lot of people have been patient understanding and have stuck with CIG through all the BS DS and negative press. I dont know how desperate ChrisCIG is for money or if theyve simply have been breathing in their own ass emissions for too long.  But after years of delays and false promises or being told Just wait it out a little longer this games is going to be amazing! Stop complaining or you will be down voted Soon or You dont get how game development work ect ect ect.  I felt that the one thing that Chris wouldnt do was straight up LIE to us.  In my opinion its one of the big reasons why we backed in the first place...because we trusted Chris Roberts.  We trusted him and CIG with our money and to be straight with us.So when Chris Roberts tells us that they are going to show us a single mission from Squadron  then after all the delays posturing and even a video comes back and tells us that they wont be showing us anything for squadron  because the VS wasnt really a mission at all but just another demo they didnt want to spend time on? You broke that trust!  So if we cant trust what you tell us why should people continue to wait or fund this game? Because of a promise some videos and tech demo? Look I get that so many people have put too much time energy and money into this that it has to succeed in their minds.  But giving CIG a pass on this and not holding them to bare minimum of honesty is only going to hurt Star Citizen in the long run and reduce the amount of funding coming in.  Because its starting to look like the money isnt coming in fast enough anymore to keep up with what their spending and if the funding stops...well Ill let you interject the results.Please give CIG a little tough love and press upon them the need to always be honest with us.

Group all items of the same type in the item selection list It takes ages to scroll.. Add filtering options based on common metadata for the item type selected on the ship..

Im pretty positive that everything displayed could be arranged in such a way that it doesnt overlap with any of the external view or at least a very very minor amount of it.EDIT Really? Downvotes for pointing out the obvious? Come on people look at the damned image. Theres a band of info spanning the bottom  of the cockpit glass that has redundant information on it and is right over a lip that could comfortably hold most of it  or it could be displayed on the overhead console in view of both the pilot and copilot instead of rendered twice with duplicates of most information visible to both. The pilot has a big screen totally unused right in front of him. The center console is big enough to house the entire radar display with no issues. Plus putting everything with the dash elements behind it means a much more constant background which in turn means washout is pretty much a nonissue. This is a shit design and Im curious why anyone would try to claim otherwise.,starcitizen,dbd4pyj,10,t5_2v94d

10023862,0,t1_dbe3m66,Yes I watched it and Im not seeing move the way it should move.  The thrust is offset from the center of mass so it should be imparting a torque into the body causing it to spin directly away from the point of the turret.  Real world version attach a bottle rocket to a bicycle wheel and light it.  Now attach two bottle rockets one at the original point and one directly opposite facing the opposite direction to cancel the first out and watch the resulting effects.  If the wheel isnt fixed to a bike frame the first will start it spinning and the second will cause the entire wheel to accelerate in a linear direction opposite the combined thrust.,starcitizen,dbe4y3l,1,t5_2v94d
10025205,0,t3_5j933y,Personally I love my HOTAS setup. Using the new Thrustmaster TWCS which has a rather nice analog stick on the throttle which makes for a good vertical thrust control with an analog rudder for horizontal control. The better news with it it comes seen the TM so if you do decide to go dual stick you already have an ambidextrous one.

Its not comparable to say Rockstar and GTAV with a similar budget but stated as an established company with established teams.Personally this bothers me the most as someone who is also k in seeing another k in person not have realistic expectations nor appreciate underlying systems that really brings games together.

10053067,0,t1_dbhwril,The Issue council was an idea to get the community involved in finding bugs. It was an abysmal failure. The amount of reports and the quality of those reports was terrible compared to how many people were actually in the PTU. A vast majority of the playerbase just treats it as early access.The failure of the public PTU and IC is why Evocati exists. On the first Evocati test the first thing CIG said about that PTU was about both the quantity AND quality of the reports that come in. There were  firstwave Evocati and they received over  good reports on bugs from them. Full disclosure I was and am part of that group. Im trying to write this without sounding too high and mighty but I realize I might be failing at that. If so I apologize. You may be a good tester and I like to think Im pretty good at it but the vast majority of the people playing in the PTU are not. Because of this the PTU waves are essentially a stress test. CIG dont rely on them to find large bugs. That is why Subs are second wave behind the active ICGame participants. That said I am not a QA professional and neither are you. We wont have the tools a QA does. Evocati is focused testing and the PTU is mass stress testing that gets stepped up as the build progresses. Look at how . was handled. First Evocati then wave  and  PTU with restricted game access. After it was stress tested they moved to the PU and increased the load. Public PTU is a stress test.

10066910,0,t3_5jvbfb,Im not sure about . but in . when exiting your ship for a brief moment you will align with polar north of the map then snap to your proper orientation. In doing this your body will kick your space craft which will cause it to drift.Its not a big deal with ships like the Hornet because the exit animation takes you far enough away from the ship but when I fly my Khartual I need to be conscious of my orientation when getting in and out. Also if youre on a mouse an keyboard its a good idea to switch your mouse move mode from the default so that your cursor is in the neutral position and not applying any force when exiting.Once this issue is fixed probably when animations are all patched up and inner thought is fully deployed a parking break really wouldnt be necessary.Also I have to say that Intersteller clip Ive never seen that movie but what the hell?

10069038,1,t1_dbk01f0,gtFaster TTK equates to less strategyIf you want strategy you do two things. You limit the ability to run and gun possibly even running itself Stamina and you make the TTK low. Doing the first means people cant run around like Call of Duty which is what SM feels like right now. Everyone is currently running everywhere  and only stopping once they get into an engagement. Usually whoever has shot first is the winner in the engagement. Theres also the issue of recoil preventing people from engaging at longer distances. Too much recoil coupled with the wonky damage models.Lowering the TTK is what forces you to actually work together with teammates for strategy because you cant lone wolf it you cant just barrel around a corner without risking dying instantly. Otherwise well just have Halolite in close quarters on our hands if everyone is a walking tank and I havent really seen much that can be considered strategy in Halo.,starcitizen,dbk0o8r,0,t5_2v94d

10083091,0,t3_5k74tz,Itll slow down when the radar is implemented better for example by making it so walking doesnt ping the radar people will be encouraged to walk not run. Spreading out to reduce chances of pinging the radar would also make the gameplay more tactical now you need to worry about formations.Further right now getting hit in the armbodyleg doesnt matter but eventually something as trivial as being shot in the arm could ruin your ability to kill people. That would make cover more important so they wouldnt just hip fire spray and pray .Then theres friendly fire. I assume it will be in SC but it NEEDS to be in SM too. This will serve to reinforce the above measures formation and not running around will keep you off the OPFOR radar but it will also keep you from running into my grenade.

It makes suppression a thing in space which is a critical element of combat on the ground.   Come to think of it thats what SM ultimately needs.

Keep in mind that CIG does.. do free flies which unlocks the other ships for you to fly occasionally. So you will get to taste the other ships.Also in time you will be able sell your Aurora.. once game goes live  to a ship that you want to be in... once you earn the ingame credits. Also you can also look at the jobwell.. and see if you can be part of a crew on a bigger ship.. this ship may be NPC or player owned.

Where you are the closer to a station planet or hospital or rescue ship the better your chances. How you died. How many times you have died before and how recently counted against a certain number of lives that perhaps replenish over time if you dont die. Are you a griefing asshole? Cause your chances should just be increased if you are.  Nah just kidding they shouldnt take that into account they totally should.Basically I think you should presented with a respawn option if you are either dead or if you are stranded and dont want to wait for rescue via player or NPC. The further along you are in a rescue process before respawn the better your chances of escaping injury or permadeath.,starcitizen,dbszh9n,1,t5_2v94d

But the outcome is combat in Elite is very much akin to atmospheric flight combat. While all ships technically have DoF the heavily nerfed yaw combined with most ships lacklustre verticalhorizontal thrust means all but the most agile of ships behave mostly like a typical plane flying in an atmosphere.Combat in ED is mostly jousting which is seemingly what Frontier wanted.

10263263,0,t3_5myg39,As someone who recently jumped on the VR train at fullspeed I hope they figure it out.  On the practical human side of concerns FPS aiming is more of a new skill rather than sucking where its hard at first but eventually you get the hang of it found this after a week or so with Space Pirate Trainer and Raw Data going from having to take a second to line up a shot using sights and still missing sometimes or relying on AOE weapons to hitting shots reliably and almost on reflex without having to use sights so Id be less concerned about that.  The locomotion nausea is definitely a problem though I think it might be worked aroundthrough like nausea playing FPS on a screen and one that VR is going to have to figure out sooner rather than later or stick to being a teleporter genre.  Games like Onward though have a good following and standard FPS locomotion so its the kind of thing where there may be hope.On the purely technical side Lumberyard should help as it should give a mostly solution for VR that will keep being updated without the use of CIG resources directly ideally they can just merge in what they need.  On the other hand StarCitizen specifically has issues around how theyre trying to do animation and helmets realistically including all the work theyve had to do to blend a mostly static First person view and a naturally bobbing rd person without making the FP view shake like someone running while holding an iPhone and the rd person view not look like a chicken head stabilized on top of the body.  Adding in an actual persons perspective and having to naturally blend their head motion while potentially standing still while their character might be running and turning without resorting to cheating like theyve been actively avoiding ie having different rendering for first person body and third person is going to be exponentially harder.  Even existing VR games now for the most part resort to rendering players rayman style with floating hands and heads with a guestimated virtual torso so its definitely not the easiest solution.That said I definitely recommend checking out vidsgameplay of Onward as while a much rougher looking game it tackles most of these problems and has shown enough promise to get official development support offered by Valve so it might be the best glimpse of how it could be tackled currently.,starcitizen,dc7eaig,3,t5_2v94d

10281083,0,t1_dc9ddz9,Im not a hardcore player. I rarely have time for more than  hours a week and if I really dedicate time for it then maybe  if I use a huge chunk of my sunday to fly.After enough time in a specific ship you will know just what it can do and how it will behave and you will challenge yourself to push your Aurora through tiny openings in space stations and asteroid caves at full speed. Sometimes you would bump into something and explode but another bunch of hours later you would master it to the degree that you can use it to turn the outcome of a fight.This gives me a much better feeling than doing DPS exchange at low speed in Arena Commander.I know it sucks to be killed time and time again and being punished for not spending  on the current meta ship. But I miss having fun just flying even without fighting. I hope they will find another way to make the game more rewarding for entry level players. This flight model lowered the bar but it also capped the potential.,starcitizen,dc9f0vd,14,t5_2v94d

This is why EVE Online can handle thousands of players in an instance.  You point and click to move and predictable pathing takes care of the rest.  You turn your weapons on and they fire for you.

10337386,0,t3_5o03y5,I posted this around a year ago it pretty much summarizes my stanceI am in the camp that hates the idea of autoaim at all. Ive been playing a lot of Elite lately and honestly I find it incredibly easy compared to star citizen where I have to balance my piloting and aiming at the same time. I enjoy the challenge in star citizen more than ED for this reason and maintain that Star Cit is the better game although I enjoy having stuff to do in ED right now.I also HATE the idea of a gimbal automatically aiming and automatically missing my target just because I dont want to lose all ability to retaliate when a stray bullet takes out a maneuvering thruster. I like being able to blame my own ineptitude in Star Citizen for not being able to hit a target and at the same time being able to laude my own ability to make impossible shots while simultaneously dodging enemy fire.I dont like fortune playing such a large role in a fire fight and something that hits or misses at the roll of a die and not my own hands is such a thing. The very reason I use gimbals at all is to slightly reduce the randomness in my ability to be an effective combatant which I can only guarantee if I can still shoot while I cannot necessarily point my nose straight when a maneuvering thruster disappears.I like the challenge of being both pilot AND gunner rather than just being a good pilot. I like to remove randomness such that superior tactics and ability make outcomes more predictable. This is why I like our system and abhor the idea of auto aiming gimbals.This is simply my perspective. I would venture to guess others feel the same.TLDR I hate randomness in a game like this our current system reduces randomness at the cost of splitting focus for gimbal users and putting the burden of riskforpower on fixed gun users and I would rather this than any alternative Ive seen proposed.,starcitizen,dcfsuf0,6,t5_2v94d

10351948,0,t3_5o1t5r,I cant get excited about the Polaris or any other capship relying heavily on launching additional craft. Theyre currently one big example of CIGs ship design team doing things exactly assbackwards and there is absolutely no reason for it.Honestly by now weve got a pretty good spread of singleseater ships. It should be well known what sort of space requirements there are and military ships should have very standardized hangar floor amp door layouts. Pads in the civilian world would commonly come in the same sizes as well given the fluff history of the UEE navy selling off old ships. We should really be at a point where part of ship balance comes from inuniverse logical restraints rather than extrinsic dev balancing. The next huge superfighter? Well its gotta fit through standardized hangar doors and fit on a standardsized pad so everyone has a pretty good idea what the max footprint can be. Itd do a world of good for ships like the Redeemer which is currently a conflicted mess due to the fact that it is halfassedly trying to be  different and largely conflicting ships. If its going to be a light combat dropship its going to need to dock on a troop carrier frigate whatever. Fat must be trimmed to make that the case. As it stands theres no motivation to do that trimming because whether or not itll fit on a given ship is entirely up in the air due to lack of standardization.I mean FFS if theres one thing every semisuccessful military has had in common its standardizing. The UEEs longevity pretty much guarantees that by now the goddamned silverware in the mess hall probably has a couple standards dictating its design let alone the fucking flight deck.,starcitizen,dchgcc4,0,t5_2v94d
10354541,0,t1_dch7a3o,throttle control  They even had that on the afterburner with . at some point. which was awesome and worked well Dodging fire  vs X battles. weaker ships like the r aurora mustang khartual had a better chance to win fights vs hornets and sabres due to the SCM and strafe speeds differences.  Another problem i see with . is the amount of crashing into others and asteroids due to the Afterburner speedsand then on the other side the very close combat. overshooting happens way more then with the toggling system. in that regard .. worked better though if we had max afterburner speed controll which we had at some point in . this shouldnt be much of a problem its a skill thing but now we have no choice in that regard.,starcitizen,dchqxgt,1,t5_2v94d

10357439,0,t3_5o5tto,Alright mate let me tell you how I think it is. I belong to a variety of gaming communities I will list a few FIFA ARK survival evolved Battlefield GTA V Rocket League The DivisionThe above communities are ones which I have spent the most time in. I have  hours in all of these games and have been exposed to each of the communities thoroughly. I would place Star Citizens community in the top in the top  of all these communities. This includes attitudes in game and on redditforums. There will never be any type of community without conflict and toxicity. The existence of distasteful behaviour is inevitable when a community becomes as large as star citizens. I myself have asked plently of simple repetetive questions in this reddit. I am sure many of these will be in my recent posts if you wish to investigate me like you have many others who have posted on this thread keep in mind i may have deleted some due to slight embarrassment of how simple the questions were. Now the responses I recieved on those annoying posts I made were kind slightly frustrated of course but they were kind and definitely helpful. Sure i have seen the common can you please damn post these questions in the daily q and a thread responses but is that really toxic?I dont think so. Having experienced a lot of these gaming communities I know what toxicity feels like. In ark almost all players seek to harm others experience of the game. Whether it is needlessly taking and destroying your bases and belongings or killing all of your companion dinosaurs etc. This behaviour is toxic because it harms one party but is not benefitial to anyone at all. Battlefield I see a lot of abuse of new players who simply do not fully understand the game yet all whilst nobody really tries to help anyone get better.FIFA is the single most toxic community around most decide to get their enjoyment through ruining their opponents gaming experience.Rocket league is friendly and helpful mostly because the game is hard to get angry at.The division is also filled with selfishness but all in all it isnt too bad.And then you have star citizen. EVERY single time I play this game the chat is filled with people helping each other. Teaming up with one another. I have not once in recent memory witnessed received or dealt out any abuse of any sort. This is truly hard to come by in gaming communities. As for Star Citizen forums there is a lot of kindness sharing and constructive activity. However I agree with you that there is some impatience and often rudeness in the community. But in my eyes and maybe I am wrong this rudeness is far from the toxicity seen in other games. The way I see it is that the frustration seen around here at least results in the post being fixed or the issue not resurfacing again.As for your friends experience of this game they probably found the one toxic place around this game youtube comments sections and this game is a scam!! debates. A crowdfunded game as large as this is obviously going to attract controversy. But in my opinion people like that do not belong in this community which is backed up by the fact that none of that behaviour is seen ingame unlike the communities I described above. I am in no way a closed minded star citizen lover. I fully understand that this game could flop and fail. I fund and play this game because I already find it enjoyable enough to get my moneys worth yeah I really enjoy it but I understand fully that there are no promises for this game it could turn out shit. My attitude towards this game gives me what I think is a rather neutral point of view and honestly I do not see much toxicity around. If there were dangerous levels of toxicity in star citizens playing community then it would not be one of my favourite communities going around.As for your attitude towards other redditors commenting on your post I find it quite distasteful much like the toxicity you describe in your post. Ironic. I see where uour coming from and im not reallly saying uou are wrong maybe I am wrong. It is all a matter of anecdotal experience and perspective I am simply offering mine. Have a pleasant day if you made it this far. ,starcitizen,dci2r5u,1,t5_2v94d

10363483,0,t1_dciljcw,gtThere is no simple stuff when it comes to morals. Even murder could be good if it is for a cause like saving more lives. Lack of moral backgrounds understanding means that you will be unable to make a correct decision in the environment where the choice is not apparently clear by your basic morals like  in war or during terrorist attack.Yeah... except that there is not a moral dillemma here... Nah the problem for you is that you do not have a real justification for theft in this case you have no moral ground to claim the theft of an article about starcitizen as justified because it is purely an entitlement issue. And you know that very well as you have not devoted  word in all your long texts about why according to you it is morally justified to steal the gamestar article. Because you cant I can justify taking a fire extinguisher from you when the neighbours house is on fire you cannot do so for stealing an article that is offered for payment. Instead you try to rationalize try to find excuses seek refuge in creative but opportunistic nihilism and cultural relativism. You want something that you do not really need and cannot have but you take it anyway. That you and others cannot stand it that you are being called out for it is a problem between you and your conscience.gtIs it really so hard to understand that theft meaning is different in different cultures and countries.For instance  in some countries any download from certain pp sites is illegal and you will be prosecuted for thievery even if you bought the thing but for some reason has no access to your copy.In some countries you may not buy a game a music track or a movie with original text and voiceover due to exclusive localization and market distribution rights. And you can not buy it from an international distributor due to some stupid technical restriction. You may still buy a game or a movie using VPN but this is a breach of multiple EULAs and local laws in some cases. In real world you will have tons of retail laws on your side but in the internet foreign entities are not under your local jurisdiction and will not care about your problems.So you either give up pirate it or try to buy it risking much worse legal consequences. And by your definition everything but giving up is theft then no?I have stated that using a service that is offered for payment without paying for it is theft.  gtBecause my point is  theft is about laws. Stealing is wrong is about morals. What is stealing is different in different countries or cultures. How could you be so blind to not see it in the world around you?Or you fail to understand that stealing is just one of many moralYeah and here is where I call bullshit because while sure you can get pretty far by arguing nihilism and cultural relativism however . you are not truly a nihilist and . being rather opportunistic in your cultural relativism. The reality is that you nor anyone else here would be fine if you were for example asked to write a report and a competitor would steal it from your PC and handing it in preventing you to get paid for your work. While the example is far more severe the principle remains the same. gtI am not going to doxx myself and you know why. You also know that you will not go and steal my stuff simply because you will either end up in jail or if I live in Texas in grave. You suggest breaking the law by stealing physical things which is considered a crime in most countries that has access to the internet. This is very different from stealing virtual goods that is not considered a crime in many countries.And this is exactly why I called bullshit just before you are not being nihilistic and cultural relativistic because of principle but opportunistic just to rationalize the use theft for something that you would want. gtBut if you read someones other translation which is free to access? Does someones else effort give him a right to publish it for free even if it is based on someone elses material? And what if that material that took very little of effort much less than from the translator from the original creators will it change? What exactly gives one a right to publish an information for a fee? And when if ever a derivative work including say retelling on a stream or even discussion in a podcast becomes free from original copyright?Do you know answers to these questions? Oh the answer is rather simple basically all those questions require permission from the rightsholder if there is no such permission the answer is always yes it is a form of using a service for which payment is due that you are not providing and therefore it is theft There is one exception in the things you mention and that is discussing it on a podcast as that probably falls under fair use.gtDid you ever asked them to yourself? Or do you blindly follow your morals without understanding why these morals are in place in the first time?I understand very well why theft is wrong indeed do you understand why it is not allowed to go with a cart full of paper and a copymachine to a bookstore buy  book and then copy and distribute that book for free on the street?gtIs murder of a terrorist wrong?That rather depends if the terrorist is sitting in a jailcell then yes very wrong when in a combat situation it is not murder.gtIs theft of foreign plans to attack your country wrong?Yup technically wrong however justifyable. Just as I can justify stealing your fire extinguisher when the house of your neighbour is on fire.  gtIs breaching in a payforentry beach is wrong? And what if owners had obtained that beach using loophole in laws and there is no good beach in rather large area around.If there is no good reason for you to be there then yes very wrong and here we come at a very big distinction between this example and the theft of foreing plansfire extinguisher. When the reason for your theft is just because you feel entitled to something that is not yours and what you do not need or others need to survive then yes theft is wrong.gtYou do not know answers for these questions because you only have your blind morals. If those morals to ever collapse under superior circumstances  if you will ever be forced to kill or to still there will be nothing left to hold your hard. You may end up serial killer or an ordinary thief. That is why morals are something that we teach kids. When kids grow up we teach them basis for those morals so even if circumstances will shift they will still be able to make right decision.On the contrary there is nothing blind about my answers. However the amusing thing is that you try to argue why theft is under certain circumstances not wrong however the actual situation is much simpler. You want to rationalize theft of a luxuary article. You do not need the information provided in the gamestar article hence why the circumstances of a moral dilemma do not apply as there simply is no moral dilemma here. You feel entitled to information that is behind a paywall so you rationalize stealing it while it is solely for your self interest and not some grand moral justification. That is all there is to it in this case and that is also why your in other cultures there may be other definitions of theft rings so hollow. You want something that you do not really need and cannot have but you take it anyway. And yes it is that simple.gtTheft is a breach of ownership. If there is no ownership there is no thievery. In USA laws imply ownership on pretty much anything including ideas mathematical algorithms programs and any kind of information. In other countries laws imply ownership only on things that require some extra labour to reproduce  for instance ideas and information could not be owned by any party. In that case what you sell is a service  you sell your servers producing this content in a nice form but not the content. If someone copies the information but not the site  it is not illegal and is not theft. Because the information has no owner.Oh really such as where?gtYou may have noticed that I do keep myself polite and to the point still making valid arguments. You do not  you had chosen to attack and discredit everyone who disagree with your views.Oh yes heaven forbid that the upbringing of someone who rationalizes theft for their own entitlement is challenged.gtYou act much like those pseudomuslim guys in middle east who behead or beat in other countries anyone who do not follow their quite medieval and insane by our view morals and rules. But I bet you will fail to see similarities because you are talking about very basic stuff.Sure that is very polite and to the point of you though the even bigger Irony is that if you were consistent you would be fine with pseudomuslim guys in the middle east beheading people for not following medieval rules as that is simply another not universal cultural view  ,starcitizen,dcirges,2,t5_2v94d

Nice backpedal but still hyperbole. I assume you are referencing this comment  Nowhere does it indicate that stock equipment will be junk.

10413976,0,t1_dcoclw1,IMO the a is a better quality civilian ship then all other small craft its not designed specifically for combat but has been converted for this role. So the top speed and maneuverability should be somewhere below the gladiolus which is a military specific ship. With that being said the a has a large storage area and a bed so that will further decrease its performance but increase its multiroll function that a civilian who is not in the military would want otherwise get a military ship. Since it has all that extra stuff there are going to be small fast ships amp quicker military ships that will be able to out maneuver the a. Since you dont wanna be a fancypants in a lame duck the a compensates for its decreased maneuverability by having a high quality engine with huge thrust to out top speed cheaper more maneuverable craft like the mdelta avenger amp bucc. So OP is right about using it for BampZ IMO. Maybe after the MKII version itll get its BampZ capabilities back altho i didnt think they were gone. TIP avoid hard turns in combat you turn slow and you have a lot of forward momentum because of the weightspeed. ,starcitizen,dcohq1u,2,t5_2v94d

The complexity level is however pretty much unprecedented and the sync up between the AI itself and the character model is as they mention in the video not working as intended.What I mean is that creating the AI itself isnt an unknown in theory it just hasnt been done in a real game environment. There was for example an AtV last year showing their work on making the AI move a character model around inside a Constellation. Weve also seen them work on AI seeing other character models and reacting to them etc. So the pieces are being worked on.

Making a tshirt takes about  days.Female character model is coming along Josh says theyre working on animation variants for females and look forward to having it in our hands when its ready. Theyre currently planning to have  hair styles for players and facial hair is being worked on for Squadron  when theyre happy with facial hair theyll bring it over to players.Full Summary The show is about to begin! Your transcribers today are just myself CanadianSyrup! Josh Herman will be the featured Dev on the show today so sit back and relax as Happy Hour is about to begin. The show is live! Starting things off is Jared and Tyler talking about their plans for PAX South. CIG will not be attending PAX south officially. Any CIG employees there will be because its on their own time as fans. Todays guest streamer is BristolBoy a Star Citizen streamer on Twitch  The org hes in is TacticalAdvance an exclusive org. For the first part of the stream theyre gonna play around in GrimHex for a bit which is the Port Olisar for Criminals. Character Art Director Josh Herman will join the stream shortly. Currently theyre browsing GrimxHex and doing a quest involving finding three datapads. Josh Herman has arrived! What does a Character Art Director do? Oversees the production of character creation and essentially anything to do with characters he has a hand in.  Josh likes the XiAn because theyre quite different from the other races in that they live a lot longer as well as their antigravity tech which gives an opportunity to make them stand out from the other races. Theyre also a trade oriented race and travel alot which will play into their style. Are the XiAn Animal like in a way like the Vanduul are humanoid but reptilian in a sense? Theyre aggressive looking like a predator would their skin is translucent which makes them more shiny so you could say they have a reptilian nature but still humanoid. Do you think well see things less humanoid and more creature like? Josh Im sure we will but they have to fit a certain paradigm in that they can fit in cockpits and etc. Non sentient animals will definitely fit that question though as youve seen the giant worm and you can expect to see more. Also Flying Spaghetti Monster confirmed by Tyler. Disco got the gift of missiles to his rear while talking to Josh Time of making a character from concept to final It depends on armoured or costume. Armour is more complex because they have an undersuit and then putting armour on top so youre creating two characters essentially. For a costume though its a simpler and that takes around  days its broad because of other factors that can be involved but a costume head to toe is about that much time. Just to make a tshirt however is about  days.  Whats your favourite character so far? Probably the Nomad character so far. Are you looking into more cloth physics for other clothes? Yes theyre looking into more than just the clothing the nomads wore. Also theyre looking into capes as well. When designing a costume do you give them themes? They theme things in the sense of what the costume is designed for like mining combat etc. It helps artists distinguish what is asked of the costume but its by no means restricted in that they can only do certain styles because of what the occupation is. Having worked on Ironman do you feel developing for a game rather than property gives you more freedom? Hes worked on quite a few Marvel characters that have their own specific style but it is restricted in that you can only do that style whereas Star Citizen you can get very creative especially with alien races. What sort of customisations can we expect for a character to wear? Goggles glasses hats. Theyre working on earings and studs for your nose but that presents its own challenges. Jackets shirts pants shorts shoes. The one thing theyre working on now is making it so if you have a tshirt and you put a jacket on it wont erase whats underneath.  Will pockets or holsters be a feature? To add onto a previous question this is where themes comes in that do we want a costume to have pockets or certain capabilities? If we dont what advantage can we give to supplement that. Theyre asking chat for designs on an ingame tshirt theyd like to see. One of them is a Tony Zurovec You know. They also asked Tony if he knows how many times he says it and he said He knows. He also joked it would be fun to have a button in the verse you could press that would simply say You know. Someone mentioned a shirt would the three Vanduul moons.  A couple more ideas Replace me shirt thats red. Another shirt that says All landings pads are full.   Chat wants a Red ONE shirt. Jared was muted so Tyler could give his idea of a red shirt with a ONE on it. Do you have any information that youd like to share about Female character models? Currently theyre working variant animations for the female alongside the male model as since theyre two different models they have to make two sets of animations. They dont have an ETA but soonTM. Will clothing be restricted to gender? Theyre not sure right now most things are built to be worn by everyone but thats a design question in what is restricted. There will be certain items for sure that are restricted however. Will hair be modular in how it looks? Short long curly etc? Theyre working towards about  styles but you wont be able to modify that style. Will hoods on a jacket be able to be put on or off? Its a good question but they dont quite know yet. They would like to but thats something for design to figure out. Will different armours have different stats? Yes. Armour will come in heavy medium light but will also be geared towards certain environments or scenarios. Progress on facial hair? Theyll have options for it. Theyre currently working on the facial hair for Squadron  characters. Theres a little more tech involved with it and once theyre happy with it for Squadron then theyll bring it to players. Tattoos They want to have them but have to figure out the design around them. How will it implement them can they draw them place them where they want etc. Whats your best memory since working at CIG? The last CitizenCon was his biggest memory. He had only worked at CIG  months prior and being able to attend it and meet the backers who have supported the project was awesome. If youre attending PAX South and want to meet Jared and Tyler there will be details on the Barcitizen website for tomorrows PAX South Bar Citizen.,starcitizen,dczhuuv,13,t5_2v94d

Doesnt it add MORE game play options and opportunities since there would be more time for that game play to take place? If not then why not just apply the same logic to ship combat? Why shouldnt all ships just all die in one hit regardless of armor?

Id prefer we dont accidentally and permanently ruin anyones ability to enjoy VR.When asked if the  million stretch goal was being cancelled its clear from the Reddit post this was not the intention of the responseEspecially since the link provided was basically criticising AAA devs for adding VR support without building the game specifically for VR considering SC wasnt built specifically for VR,starcitizen,dd74zw0,1,t5_2v94d

Turn  degrees to point your main rear thruster against the vector you want to arrest.  Your main thruster is the most powerful and will decelerate you faster.As for racing there are a couple possible reasons You could be accidentally entering Landing Mode N Your engines could be damaged from hitting stuff You could be out of boostafterburner fuel There is a bug where AFB just stops working seemingly without cause. Only solution Ive found is to die and respawn or get out of the pilots seat and sit back down if youre in a game mode where this is possible. It could also possibly be a lack of power or something to the engines though our HUDs currently give us practically no information to determine if this is the case.

10600715,0,t1_dd9bwaa,gtYeah its a shame that inevitably SQ will be judged in the context of its crowdfunding record and development time instead of simply being judged as a decent game or not. Thats exactly it. Its one of the less remarked upon downsides of a protracted development cycle that expectations continue to swell quietly to fill the growing expanse of time. The highprofile cast and Roberts pedigree only inflates the expectations further. And then theres the recordbreaking and still growing CIG war chest. Expectations would be high enough with a  year dev cycle  but if its  or  I fear theyll be absolutely stratospheric. At some point it simply becomes impossible to live up to them. The release of a merely good game gets treated critically like a some tragedy or travesty rather than welcomed news.

What we dont want to do is have an API that might allow players to run around and say automine or do any of that kind of stuff because it sort of defeats the purpose of existing in the world. We are placing a lot of emphasis on not making the player do tasks that would be considered tedious doing the same thing over and over again that doesnt have much challenge so I would say were not going to allow automation of any gameplay.,starcitizen,ddfppzm,3,t5_2v94d

I am also not some sort of cynical negativistic weakling that backs away from my own promises when things get difficult. A pledge is a kind of a promise that is given in good faith and I believe that CIG is still working in good faith to meet their end of the deal to the best of their ability. It has always been a sort of a moonshot of a game and I am proud to have been a backer so far. Sure there are questions and things that have shaken a bit of the trustworthiness but I believe at the core that things are still proceeding in good faith and that even if it does not make it the efforts have continued in good faith.

10700938,0,t3_5t2mfk,Nice episode.Interactive sequence to start up the ships at long last! I hope that it will tie into more simulated parts of the ships avionics. I remember that image file from a year and a half ago filled with switches and knobs made by Zane for cockpit interactions. This has been a long time coming.The holographic shader art and design really needed a pass so Im glad that its happening.Vintage SH looks criminally good Im still a fan of the old design. I cant wait to see how the new one based on the reworked FC will look. At least we wont have levitating wing panels and bits when wings get shot off now.The ship pipeline is amazing and sure has come a long way. Theres nothing that can replace the kind of experience theyve built. Theres not much to say its very sensible and robust from what I can tell despite the insane functional complexity of the ships. Its an incredibly complicated process and they have barely touched on the tech they actually use for ships maybe in part . If anything Im wondering about landing gears now that . will bring hydraulics as a new functional requirement. Maybe thats another element that theyll integrate into the pipeline if they come across  issues. Still I think they are well designed enough in the first place to just work and all ships seem to have enough clearance built into the design.As a sidenote Im always amazed at their sketches. Even though when it comes to scifi my heart will always belong to the aesthetic of Rob Cunningham and Aaron Kambeitz theres incredible stuff in SC. And so much of it! The bar is extremely high.The buccaneer greybox looked pretty cool. Nothing screams drake more than a fire extinguisher right next to the pilot.Im pretty happy about Elwins bit with the animations. Hes entirely right about the character even simple animations lend to the world. That kind of worldbuilding language is often neglected and that was a thing that really struck me on his TNGS work.

Real time fps combat and ship to ship boarding action are some of the core features that set this game apart from other space sims. You could absolutely play as a mercenary marine without ever getting behind a flight stick though you would have to either contract a player or npc to ferry you between conflict zones or join an organization that would handle the logistics for you.

Squadron  similarly is now in the third year since its supposed initial release date with a myriad of hastily typed explanations as to why sure to follow this post and despite building hype and generating sales about it CIG couldntwouldnt even show a chunk of gameplay last year promising that it was coming SOON and then reneging on that promise shortly afterward. These things should be important to you and definitely are important to people looking at this project from the outside and trying to decide whether or not to fork over their hardearned cash.Youve also conveniently left out  perhaps under the argument that they were not significant or major deadlines the fact that both the hangar module and Arena Commander suffered significant delays  delays which were so important that Chris Roberts felt the need to write a special Letter From The Chairman about them whether or not they were promised at a specific date or just hopes. Chris Roberts has made a mint on helping you guys get your hopes up for things and then apologizing profusely and saying Were going to do better we swear every time he cant deliver. This should bother people. Im not telling you all to panic and set your hair on fire over it but the most staggering thing about this is every time Ive seen someone suggest that backers try and hold CIG accountable for some of this shit theyre met with an unbelievable amount of hostility because at the end of the day there are people who dont want to hold Chris accountable because if you really start taking a cold hard look at things the reality is immensely concerning.

So it seems that part of players expect stability. PTU is focusing on assuring the basics of the live patch are stable enough and not too much buggy. Why ? To avoid repatching gb all the time and getting complains from all the backers expecting a stable build at release. In short  give a stable release I dont want to repatch or to disconnect all the time. Complains andor dramas are work to handle. CIG is being smart the way they are doing it      So PTU makes totally sense  it is a way to be sure that majority of the backers taking part in that process are there to help knowing the focus and not to complaining at first bug they encounter  It is a healthy way to share progress step by step ,starcitizen,ddz3b1d,6,t5_2v94d

10866593,0,t1_de0rrqa,Well there were several different attempts to create bomber escorts with the most successful being twinengined longrange heavy fighters. Some of these experiments included bomber variants with additional turrets and no bombbays intended to act as guardians to the rest of their squadron. Other experiments included the use of shorterrange fighters who would escort the bombers for only part of their journey before turning back. Sometimes the use of droptanks would be used to allow a boost to these shortranged fighters ranges. However of all these options the purposebuilt longrange heavy fighter was the most successful.Its been a while since I played Star Citizen as Im kinda giving it a break for the moment but have they implemented range limitations yet? I recall that quantum fuel is limited but I also seem to recall that even airsuperiority short range fighters such as the hornet have an insanely generous quantum fuel tank...

10873794,0,t1_de1jkn2,I think that something similar is on the cards but the ramp up in challenge will happen between objectives instead of during them. This is according to Tony Zurovecks outline of their procedural quest systemgtIts not difficult to create a large randomly generated world.  The problem is in making a vast universe thats actually interesting  thats able to hold your attention for an extended period of time.  On the mission side for example were aiming to algorithmically construct a lot of our missions but were going to leverage our designers capabilities instead of trying to entirely replace them with mathematical equations.  Well have the traditional handcrafted missions whereupon the player gradually progresses through a detailed storyline but as with all MMOs the problem with that approach is that youre always struggling to create enough new content to keep the player base entertained and if thats your only method of content generation the quality tends to suffer as a result.  In your quest to deliver a large quantity of content you tend to lower your standards and create a lot of really simplistic missions that arent very interesting that are identical whether youve played it once or a dozen times that arent even remotely fun to repeat and that often have little to no direct linkage with the previous or subsequent missions youre offered.  For Star Citizen were going to try and do something a lot different.  Designers are going to handcraft individual mission components and then specify how those pieces can be customized at runtime and linked to others to form coherent chains that effectively represent small unique stories consisting of multiple sequential mission objectives.  Responding to a simple distress call then becomes a lot more interesting because  just like in real life  you never know what might unfold as a result.  Prevent a freighter from being destroyed by brigands and you might collect your reward and leave.  Search the computer core of the attackers ship though and you might ascertain the location of one of their remote outposts.  Infiltrate that base and you might learn where they stash their stolen booty and make off with a fortuneif you can figure out how to defeat or draw away the heavily armed ship defending it.  I think that the end result is going to be considerably greater than the sum of the individual pieces and provide players with a much more diverse and interesting world to explore where there are a practically infinite supply of threads that when pulled can dynamically instantiate long strands of a story that the player can choose to pursue or ignore as they see fit.What I could see happening is that one player could find clues to a much tougher quest on a milk run mission then they would assemble a team of buddies or friendly strangers over the spectrum when they realise that they couldnt handle it solo. This would turn into your Destiny style raid.,starcitizen,de1jz0h,5,t5_2v94d

10905860,0,t1_de4nspk,What??? No. Thats completely wrong. Whered you get that idea? WHAT IS ITEM .? Item . or Item Port . is a new entity system that allows for object hierarchies. A database that stores what each item is what it can do based on what state its in. At its core its a serialization of items both ship and first person related. This allows far smaller amounts of data being sent between server and client helping reduce bandwidth issues. Items are attached to parent items Your grenades are attached to you. You are inside your ship. This can reduce traffic because most of the time you dont need to know where grenades are if they cant affect you. Only when you get close enough or when it can affect you does it matter. Item . is also about the next iteration of ship components. Heat sinks power plants weapons IFCS computers etc.  Its used a foundation for other systems. Combine that with something like the piping system and you can disable gravity by knocking out the power to the gravity generator.  It does allows for a contextual use menu. So instead of USE its Open Door Close Door Lock Door Kick Door or even Hack Door.  It allows for better AI The AI can know what objects are what it can manipulate and their state so it can perform actions like unlocking doors to achieve its objective. It allows for localization So the actions can be in French Spanish etc. The properties for items means it can be damaged repaired etc. Its talked about in the Repair doc Whats possible with Item .? New Interactions Item piping decompressions docking etc. Too much? You can watch an informative videoA GUI frontend that looks like Blueprint  may be used but only to make things faster. And it makes it easier for nonprogrammers to interact with the system. Its not a way to program the game. Its purpose is nothing like Blueprint.WHY DIDNT WE HAVE ITEM . SOONER? Because they had to make it. CryEngine was designed for  people.  They never designed it for an environment with millions of entities. Its complex and needed to be used for other systems Weve got contextual actions now instead of a generic USE button. But we need this for repairs better network performance better persistence grabby hands the character interacting with objects decompression etc. While the basics of the system have been implemented all the other features requiring it like repair havent been implemented yet.QUOTES ABOUT ITEM .FTC Episode  Question   Will there be more slots in the instances around Crusader in the future?gt Were working on optimizing code but were actually in the middle of a massive backend rewrite  completely changing the way the serialization works to a much more efficient logical way. Which is the item port the item . system weve talked about which weve recently got going. It is a fundamental part of that because were restructuring some of the way that entities are set up  so were changing it completely from the way it was done in the old CryEngine to be a very componentbased setup much more logical and were only really serializing data that we need to serialize rather than big globs of data and its not nearly as I guess fixed as the old system was. Because the old system was really built for small  player or  player multiplayer games  deathmatch FPS shooterstyle whereas weve got something that we need to be up for long times hours or days of time have the server up and have hundreds of people on it.FTC Episode  Question   Will we have the option to turn all of the lights off in a ship?gt So the answer is yes. This is one of the big things that we keep talking about  Item System .  which is really a refactoring of the items and the entity system and will fold across into how the characters  what we call players inside the code  and vehicles will function. Its to allow a lot more functionality and control.gt gt When we have enough of the base code in well just do a pass on all the items and well move over to the Item . functionality which will allow a lot more  for instance for ships in multicrew and seats or stations youll be designate control over different things like passive control of a turret to another seat have different seats have control over things like engineering power distribution and stuff like that shield management and also just ship systems.FTC Episode  Question   Are there any plans for maintaining individual engine controls or engine stress? Such as if you push your engines too hard or one fails you can turn updown the power or fuel mixture.gt Yes there definitely will be along the same lines as all the Item . stuff that I was just describing. The more  bigger ships will allow the engineer to have more control over various items or components of the ship one of which could be the engines and therell be the potential to try to push more power out of it. We may even sell engine overclocking style modules that you could put in for a racer ship or something. And its always a trade off putting a bit more fuel or power into it potentially could increase the heat output but maybe also damage your ship.gt gt So were going to have that whole overclocking style set up that weve talked about for weapons and it would be things for like engines and thrusters too. And thats definitely on the bigger ships where the engineer comes in and they are tweaking and doing that and adjusting it based on what they are seeing on the feedback loops. And I think it will be pretty cool.gt gt So those are all things that we are doing. Thats all why were are trying to make the components of the ship what we call items but they are components  and by the way theyre not just for spaceships they can be on a vehicle like a rover or something or a buggy theyre on players like if youre running around in your armour suit then youll essentially be  youll have your armour suit on and itll have a power plant on the back to power it for instance and a little life support item on the back and if youve got EVA youll have an EVA item attached to you. So players are set up the same way we set ships up. And weapons guns are the same the ammo magazine is an item that plugs into the gun item. If you wanted to put a scope on top that plugs in. A silencer would plug on the front. So it all uses the same interconnected what we call items and item ports although really thats  I say its Entity . rather than Item . because really this is the paradigm that works for everything we have. So it would be stuff that a player uses plugs into stuff a space ship uses stuff that vehicles use. So there you go.FTC Episode  Question   Would any kind of notification on their Mobiglass alert them that a pirate was attempting to disable a door lock and loot their ship.gt Yes definitely. One of the design objectives that people are working on now that we sort of got persistence in is the whole idea of control locking safety on your ship cause right now you can just fly up to someone elses ship and open up its back door and go inside. Which obviously doesnt make a vast amount of sense especially when we have persistent ships and theres real value to them. So one of the next stages of stuff will be to put the kind of security systems in place this partly comes with this item . stuff that were talking about where you can control various items. An item will be a door an airlock and you can sort of lock things down or shut it or open up to a friend if he was to arrive.FTC Episode  Question gt So you probably would have noticed that performance from . to . has degraded a little bit. And that has been an ongoing trend because weve been adding more things in more AI more things so like if you go to Port Olisar you can buy items in the shops and you also have various pick up  wreck  like things you can pick up at wrecks around Yella and all that. And so essentially the core of CryEngine was never built to simulate this many items and objects and weve had a long term refactor that weve been working on the Item . that keeps on getting mentioned is one of the core ones  part of it but were basically refactoring the way the whole entity system updates were refactoring the fundamental gt So weve done a lot of top level changes on top of the CryNetwork but its just not going to be good enough handle systems this big and this much data going back and forth. So weve long had a full rewrite of everything in CryNetwork on the table and weve been working on it and now with what happened and what you could see on . and the framerates and everything its just clear were at the limit of what the current engine will handle without these new systems that weve been working on for quite a while coming online.,starcitizen,de4v1pb,26,t5_2v94d

10918606,0,t3_5vzqyk,There are a bunch of factors that play into this most of which are classed as issues or temporary by me..     Pips are buggedmisaligned on some weapons.    Gimbals sometimes stop working after suffering some damage or reswitching between gimballed and locked.    Pirate ai recharges shields extremely fast dont hit them for a few seconds and theyll recharge their shields again.     Pirate ai has great accuracy and does not appear to suffer from a overheat mechanic.    Pirate ai can occasionally fire backwards.    Pirate ai does not need to reload a pirate gladius can fire its scorpion ballistic cannon indefinitely.    Pirate cutlass use pyroburst cannons which last time i checked can  shot most small ships if not moving.       Shields on most medium sized ships are extremely weak and get taken down within seconds by a single pirate.    All medium sized ships suffer from the same problem where consistant damage to  part can destroy the entire ship rear of the constellation is red  get the fuck out of there.     Many pirate ships dont create a high enough heat signature for rockets to lock on to them at distances greater than m.  Pirate ai cheats.    When pirate ai tries to create distance it will stick to the players speed.. meaning you can speed up to ms with the pirate sticking at the same distance in front of you.    Pirate ai will sometimes oneshot you through the cockpit.  And much more crap.. it all comes down to dont stop moving.. dont chase them if theyre creating distance and if your shields are down.. panic. ,starcitizen,de66e2o,7,t5_2v94d

All the firepower of a gimbal super hornet  additional gun ALL at size  instead of   size  vs  size .Anyone who has ever played open world PvP games will understand this ship is a gankers wet dream. Defence is irrelevant when youre careful and choose your engagements offense is everything and as soon as the DPS race starts you will just crush with a ship like this. I expect to see complaints nonstop about constellations and catapillars being disabled in seconds by a hurricane they didnt see coming.Not just PvP either it will HOSE low level PvE content like no other and probably make a fantastic low to mid level mission runner for fast profit.I predict a severe nerf to its stats before star citizen goes gold.

If we are lucky we can test this on a real CFD software another redditor reached out to me and he is atm in the process of realizing just that. So we might be able to compare our simulation with a real professional CFD software that is used to build real flying airplanes.For example the M if the simulation is correct it suggests that the body is exactly doing the opposite then it should on a plane it is not promoting lift but it drags the whole ship towards the ground.I will make a voice over for the next video just because so many people apparently want to hear my voice D,starcitizen,deahxpa,2,t5_2v94d

11004720,0,t1_defcdxh,I expect that problem is that you would need a lot of tech to continually check if ship A should remain attached to ship B rather than if you have a system where it checks if Ship A has correctly docked to Ship B and then once docking complete has come up on screen you stay docked until someone does something though the docking system to change that rather than continual code testing for detachment.  The real physics is more fun but making Ship A an attachment on Ship B once you dock and let the server do more important things will run better and not require a ton of extra coding.  CIG will certainly be coding docking but coding soft docking which can be detached by any change in either ship would be a LOT more complex.

11067334,0,t3_5xvgky,I have a question for anyone who cares but first a disclaimer  this is NOT a criticism.  Im asking out of genuine curiosity here.Why are people so excited about mining?Maybe its just me but resource gathering always felt like the most tedious part of any game Ive played be it a space sim a sandbox game or whatever.  I reluctantly tolerated it in Minecraft because I could do it on the side while I explored dangerous caves full of monsters and because it was satisfying to build things with raw materials I had personally torn from the earth.  Otherwise its always felt like a tedious chore and I avoid it whenever possible.Ive read about the various mechanics CIG is putting into mining and how it wont just be mindlessly staring at a rock while a mining laser does its thing.  Even so I just cant see how this wont get boring and repetitive.  Can someone enlighten me?Again Id like to reiterate that Im not criticizing here.  Star Citizen is a big game and I dont expect the entire thing to be magically tailored to fit my personal tastes.  Even if I never mine a single chunk of ore I suspect there will be plenty for me to enjoy.  Im just curious why mining is such a big deal for so many people.,starcitizen,demgzw9,2,t5_2v94d

When you won you could take currency back or items.

11103779,0,t1_deqkjhy,gt What Im saying is that the data describing those placements is of a nontrivial size for a typical AAA game.I kind of figured their system would be something of a hierarchy of data files where the top say a planetary base would own a number of children which describe the types locations and orientations of prebuilt rooms and objects which are detailed in other files. So a simple structure of two rooms and a corridor might be Room A of type RM is here Room B of type RTT is there Corridor of type CBL connects this point to that. And when it went to load the room of type RM it would find another hierarchy file which contains positions and orientations of other prebuilt components... maybe some of them are the names of model files and others are the names of other hierarchy files to load. This would keep the streaming data to a minimum and the only data found on disk would be the relatively generic pieces. Granted someone could pull out a chunk and say Hey this looks like a hangar but they wouldnt know where or if it was even in use yet.I was wondering if they could manage an encryption solution but kept getting stuck on the key having to be local. Yours is an interesting solution for that. Once transmitted it could be used to crack the local files and distribute the information of course. Youd have to break the secrets up into smaller pieces and encrypt each piece with its own key pair depending on how far youd want to go to keep secrets.In terms of streaming one thing working in SCs favour is that the highspeed travel is linear. So other than stopping short of your destination your client knows where youll end up and can begin streaming in data for that region immediately. Jumps may take as long as  minutes though most will be significantly shorter I believe. And Im certain they will prioritize streaming to bring in the exterior of a structure before interior pieces depending on windows etc. perhaps using a technique similar to the level of detail system used by models.,starcitizen,deqlqz3,1,t5_2v94d

11119266,0,t1_des9a45,To me the player driving of the economy in Eve is one of its least attractive features.  Its just another form of PvP where guys with trillions of isk completely dominate and control access to anything and everything they want.  Its not an economy its vendors for crime cartels.  I have a coworker who has s of trillions of isk and he plays games with the economy.  Hey watch this Im going to triple the price of X just for laughs!  Its completely unrealistic...well unrealistic in anything but Bolivia or Columbia.The cornerstone of SCs economy will be the cash sinks.  In all other MMOs money comes in far faster than it goes out which creates inflation.  Do missions get free money pick up trash get free money kill pirates get free money.  Money comes in doesnt go out.  And in Eve the money coming in is often RMT plex which is worse.In SC the money leaves in a wide variety of ways.  Docking fees landing fees taking off fees insurance  different types crew salaries station fees hangar fees fuel repairs software pirate extortion ammunition upgrades death taxes ad nausea.  Money will be pouring out of our wallets as fast as it comes in.  This is especially true since we cant craft.  We mine to make money but it costs money to mine.  Thats the biggest obstacle in games like Eve mining is  profit.  Costs you no fuel no energy no fines or fees you fly out you afk mine for a few hours you come home free cash.  In SC the Orion takes a TON of fuel plus requires parts and repairs.The economy in SC will vary wildly in both how players make money and how they spend it.  In Eve you kill shit take their stuff sell it for cash or mine and sell it or craft and sell it.  Well that and extort people with war decs.  Thats the Eve economy in total.In SC youll do bounties youll find information to sell youll mine youll haul youll explore youll do missions youll kill people and take their shit etc.  So many different ways to make cash and even more ways to spend it.  Im sure people will find ways to make massive profit but its my fond hope that TZ and his team will be watching for that and promptly screw them over.  For example I find a glitched run where I can buy something at  and sell it for  so I fill up my Hull E to the brim and head out only to find out that CIG noticed me doing it started a war in that area and the price has dropped to  essentially bankrupting me.  Thats how a living economy works not a handful of people who play  hours a week and have  of the wealth controlling prices for their own amusement.,starcitizen,descz2p,3,t5_2v94d

CIG is anyones guess or even if they will.Either CIG gets it right or they likely wont or take such a lengthy period of time it will be... Why bother? Basically sell off ships to people still fanatic enough to stay with the project and not realize that there could be a huge possibility CR is pulling another Freelancer but this time theres no publisher to pull him out and actually release.Even if StarNetwork is in such a miserable sorry state as to make the PU not even playable people will cream themselves over the planetary landings while other people who are starting to have...

11255194,0,t3_60mmsh,The Carrack will undoubtedly have longer range radar able to scan large areas quickly. It is able to carry an immense amount of cargo set up bases and to carry vehiclessnubs for covering an even larger area. It has built in jump point mapping sensors which I dont believe the Terrapin has. I imagine that it could fit them but it might need to swap out one of its utility mounts for them.The downside of the Carrack is that it probably isnt going to be subtle. Ever. Itll probably be sizeable contact in IR EM and Cross Section. If actively scanning then youll probably find contacts but theyll also probably find you. The terrapin can also active ping in which case its less likely to be reciprocally found to the innately lower EM signature. The Terrapin is also more capable of changing position quickly if it is found  it might be a slow moving tortoise but its also pretty tiny compared to the SCU Carrack.The Terrapin is also likely to be more capable of getting close enough to scan enemies with passive sensors. This means you have a comparative advantage if you know roughly where youre wanting to scan youre willing to camp or youre willing to cruise through an asteroid field on low power waiting for contacts to show up.,starcitizen,df7rcdy,1,t5_2v94d

You cant own anything in lawful space well you can but you bought it so you didnt take it.  In lawless space you own it as long as you can defend it and keep it.  CIG isnt going to add magical mechanics to protect your assets from other people if you arent there and they are then its theirs.They go on and on about the Bengal as the prime example of this.  There are Bengals out there you can find them and invest resources in fixing them up but ANYone can come take it from you if they bring enough force.  am youre Org is going offline the Germans show up and if they cant take it whole they obliterate all of your progress.This is CIGs version of a domination FPS.

CIG already mentioned how to do this and the reason its in is for game balance so they dont get km jousts instead of dogfights.

Im sorry to burst your bubble but either wayhaving more ships in a ship game is really not an issue rather its kind of supposed to be that way. Unless youre expecting an universe where there are a lot of ship manufacturers and only one or two ships for each kind of purpose. Thats just silly if you ask me.

They must have had a good reason for this but they didnt share it.Its important to keep in mind this is an Alpha.

11382270,0,t3_62foch,Originally they had that option in the user.cfg settings. They removed it because the expanded FOV only showed you the inside of your helmet. This was especially a problem in ultrawide and multimonitor displays.They need to move the camera forward within the helmet when the FOV is wider so youre seeing more of the outside world instead of more of the helmet padding. Thatll take a bit of work to get it looking just right so it might be a while since they have more important things to do right now.

It should struggle as a light fighter to run a full energy loadout with shields amp engine active so a good mix would be either laser repeaters  Ballistic railgun or vice versa laser cannon  ballistic gatling.  How to prevent the monoloadout of quad size  ballistics?  Simple shared ammo.  It is a light fighter so if you bring quad ballistics its not gonna bring a lot of bullets per barrel.    Quad size  vs Sabre Quad size  makes already more sense.  I however would like to see some downgrading  Sabre to xS xS.  Hornet at xS a xS turret for the superhornet.  Buccy at xS xS xS fixed.

11574670,0,t3_656uhf,Okay really quick one. I see a lot of talk about Item . and until a few months ago what it exactly was wasnt fully clear. Im going to oversimplify so apologies if I get things wrong. To the best of my knowledge Item . is about switching from the entitybased design of CryEngine to a componentbased design. Entities are used to describe everything inside the game that uses its underlying systems. They can be seen as special cases for which everything is bespoke. Components are instead basic pieces that can be exchanged combined and are designed to be interoperable. An object in the Item . system is made up of such components.Item . is only the base framework although it reaches very far and wide in the engine. The implementation of the games feature and porting of the existing game entites over to use Item . requires writing these components in the first place and then convert the assetslogicetc over to them.This is why Item . has been and will remain in a stage of staggered release for a long time. This is why we are now hearing about Shields . Turrets . Debris . and all the others mentioned during last Fridays Happy Hour and throughout the last year. These are Item . implementations. The room system the new cockpit experience and new item interaction system also rely on Item . afaik.Theres a ton of implications to Item . and I think well keep hearing about those in the coming months. I believe that the most important thing is that it introduced a standard in how object interact with each other so that everything interacts and is extensible in a systemic way. Anyway I hope that makes more sense. This is a large and confusing topic so please dont hesitate to correct me if Im mistaken.,starcitizen,dg7ztsl,8,t5_2v94d

SC will have way fewer planets. But each planet tells a story. Elite dangerous on the other hand is going to have beautiful planets that are going to be completely indifferent to you. I think SCs goal is more doable. With the resources and teams they have...I think its going to get there faster and better. With ED you are looking at at least  years for earthlike worlds.

Id predict it lines out about  months but will still only come around Gamescom.Edit Love how this somehow is the most controversial post of this thread.

11588782,0,t1_dg9l2vu,Sort of but probably not for the reason you think. The A is one of AMDs APUs which is just a marketing term for a chip which contains both a CPU processor and GPU graphics processing unit that should theoretically be sufficient for midrange gaming. Make a note here that Star Citizen is anything but midrange. In truth most CPUs sold today have a builtin GPU but the catch here is that they are all very weak by comparison to a dedicated GPU.That right there is the issue I suspect. Star Citizen is extremely graphically intensive so not having a dedicated GPU would likely prevent you from being able to launch. If you get a dedicated GPU video card then you will likely be able to play just fine. uBulevine s R X would fit that bill.The A could carry on simply functioning solely as a CPU and I believe it would be fine in that role.Hope that helps shed some light on the situation.,starcitizen,dg9lglu,4,t5_2v94d

11607272,0,t1_dgbbwcf,Dont assume a loud minority represents the majority of players.  They dont. is a lot for any ship especially considering what you can get value wise already for .  Thats Super Hornet money.  Anything that is Super Hornet money has to earn it by giving you equal or better value.  Some of the best value can still be found with earlier released ships.My advice for anyone who will only ever get  ship is to think very long and very hard on what they would like to get out of the game.  Thats a lot of  to invest into something like a starfighter which has a very specific role and typically little to no utility to speak of.  For an MMO a multirole craft is typically the way to go.  At least it gives you options.If you absolutely needwant something NOW I would simply wait for the two yearly sales.  Theres the Anniversary sale in midlate November which typically has the best sales and most varied ships available including many ships not normally on sale.  Then theres the Holiday sale for Christmas.  You can typically get discounts during that period as well.If you cant decide dont get anything except for the game.  Oh and ship LTI is not that big of a deal except on the insanely expensive ships.  Top individual ship modules used for upgrades are expected to rival the cost of the ships themselves and those wont come with LTI and ships will take numerous such modules so insurance costs will likely come primarily from there.This is coming from someone who has pledged well over  to this project.

11641367,0,t1_dgfiio4,yeah it will depends how far out the orbit of the jump point is relative to the other planets but I agree it would orbit like a planetIf its near middle of the system it will move quite fast and the planet closest to it will change regularly of its out on the rim it could be near one planet for a long time but gradually move father away. and closer to another.If you replaced Neptune with a jump point its a bit out on its own right now with Saturn and Uranus about the same distance on ether side note the differences in oribtal radii are NOT to scale at all..lol but about  years ago Uranus was directly between it and the sun and in about  years Saturn will be directly between it and the sun.If the jump point is in the middle of the system thats going to change a lot more frequently and we dont know how fast the orbits will be.

11644939,0,t3_665pxp,CIG completed the code and have passed it to Turbulent to build and test in the patcher.gtDelta patcher progress? From Turbulents standpoint the actual patching process is progressing very nicely. The engineers working on the project are patching the game with the new method builds are being produced with the file system and theyre ironing out the kinks. On Turbulents end theyve received the patching library and theyre integrating it into the new patcher application which doesnt look any different but underneath is completely different and allows them to bring Spectrum into the launcher but the launcher will come first and then Spectrum integration into the launcher. So right now theyre at the stage of internal testing and once theyre happy with it then theyll release it to all the developers and once its good from there then itll go to the Evocati.

I still think they need to make a cargo based starter ship one that takes double the Aurora and Mustang cargo but has next to no defence or offence ability.,starcitizen,dggbns4,2,t5_2v94d
11653026,0,t3_6674dv,The short answer to your question is The stated goals have changed over time as not only the scope of the game increased via stretch goals and as a function of much higher financial support than was originally anticipated  as well as certain technologies advancing much more quickly than expected planetary tech for example.The most recent information relevant to the question of how big will the initial release be? Is that CIG plans to release an MVP minimum viable product with a yettobespecified number of systems after which regularfree patches and updates will add in additional systems overtime.We can extrapolate from what we regularly learn about just how amazing the planetary tech looks to be that even if the initial release has relatively few star systems we still will not lack in playable content due to the sheer size of the celestial bodies.There are a couple of takeaways that are worth notingFirst iterations of a new technology usually take the longest amount of time to achieve the level of quality desired..  as more and more planets are churned out the time it takes to create the average planet will reduce as devs become more experienced with the PlanEd tools and as the tools themselves mature.Once Star Citizen becomes feature complete Alpha .X series into . it will likely transition into a Beta.  The difference between a traditional release and an MVP is that CIG has the flexibility to fairly rapidly package a final release version of the game with whatever completed star systems exist at that time once all of the blocker bugs have been resolved.Content complete traditional transition into final Beta through to release then is less of an arbitrary goal that may prolong the wait before the game is officially released and more of a week by week evaluation by CIG of when the game is ready to go live so that they can transition into live ops teams focused on creating additional star systems ships missions etc to be patched into the live game.In my opinion the Beta should be relatively short  with the playable Alpha game breaking bugs get dealt with now and all manner of other bugs are written up by us backers allowing the engineers and developers who are tasked with bug fixing to tackle that aspect of development more effectively and earlier on then in traditional game development.,starcitizen,dggvva4,1,t5_2v94d

Even with  people it will still take over a year.

11792653,0,t1_dgwkt6t,Theyve been very public about this. Combat shiptoship docking is not going to be a thing. Everything is EVA now. Thats why the prowler is based around EVA boarding i.e. the only boarding. Thats why the new cutlass had no docking collar but two big side doors for pirates to EVA out of. CIG wouldnt be designing these ships in this very specific amp intentional way if Combat shiptoship docking was ever going to be a thing.

11804297,0,t1_dgy1z41,Yes you would have to. Right now the physics are in so far unrealistic as all velocities are measured against an absolute frame of reference not relative ones. So if youd get out of the ship your ship would still do .c vs. space and you would not inherit that and just accelerate and decelerate locally but youd suddenly have a relative speed to the absolute frame of reference. The result of no mag boots is that you and your ship separate very quickly.Since MagBoots do not work technically... we have something pretty... unrealistic. But right now that is the technical state of the art... ,starcitizen,dgy23iu,11,t5_2v94d

11809365,0,t3_68hzbe,git gudJokes aside youve gotta specify if youre running a HOTAS or HOSAS dual sticks setup or youre just playing with mouse and keyboard.With joysticks you have to use fixed weapons use gimbals only if you have trackIR and the best loadout for arena commander is  tigerstriek well you cant change it anyway and two sawbucks S ballistic cannons with the same velocity as the tigerstriek. Missiles are more of a matter of taste.If youre playing with mouse and keyboard youll have to rent two gimbal mounts and two S guns. My advice is ballistics try out a couple of weapons or just check weapon velocities in order to have matching pips.Now about maneuveringHOTAS and HOSAS users have a huge advantage in maneuvering precison its still not enough to counteract gimbal aiming if your opponent is not a total noob mostly because of analog strafe and throttle. Throttle control became fundamental after . and mastering it is the first step to become better at dogfighting.About decoupled flying its really about practice and personal taste here although i wouldnt suggest using it until youve mastered coupled flying and combat. Its also pretty much useless without analog strafe so you should focus on coupled mode if youre playing with mouse and keyboard.The avenger is quite maneuverable and somewhat manageable with gsafe off. But its got a big flaw its cross section. If the enemy is over you hes gonna have a ridicolously easy time hitting you and i have to admit the avenger tends to have the toughness of wet cardboard even with full shields a hornet can kill you in a few seconds of sustained firing again mouse aiming is op here.So when engaging a player mind your orientation and roll in order to avoid exposing your back.Regarding combat tactics the best one is hitting the enemy really. The current flight model makes aiming the most important skill especially if youre piloting an heavily armed ship hornet super hornet sabre etc.... Otherwise i suggest you to use your afterburner to pick your engagements in a bad spot? leg it before its too late! Also watch out for ganks players tend stay out of the fray and pick weakened or distracted targets your good acceleration and speed should be useful in disengaging.Also asteroids and structures are your best friends you can use them to avoid fire and to try and get the upper handin a fight or use your opponents bad flying skills against him flying in asteroid fields or in thight spaces.Finally remember you have missiles! Only shoot them when youre reeeally close in order to minimize the risk of them using countermeasures and fire them in volleys of two after youve weakened or brought down their shields a missile at the right time can end a dangerous engagement and save your penguins metal ass!Edit the only sure way to get better at dogfigthing is having a ton of practice in both pvp and vanduulpirate swarm. By the way check this out Thats pure gold for new players.,starcitizen,dgyms5e,2,t5_2v94d
