For my own decks he has no place in them hes not the angle I want to play at so I havent crafted him. White wolf especially is a good card from the ones youve listed. Otherwise they are just numerous  cards that starting players have. As time goes by you unlock and become more aware of more nuanced cards targetted towards specific deck construction.

7759098,0,t3_4lkyke,You can find some recommended starter deck builds here on reddit or on youtube however I really recommend that you take some time and try to craft own decks and test them out in casual play. I recommend to try one of these  ways of building a deck.The Attack Stack and SustainBasically build up your base attack while building armour and sustaining damage. Try using Vanescula for HP stealing or Raptor for amour stacking. Your main goal is to buckle up until the final fight where you win due to more base damage and high healtharmour.Direct DamageCan be done by pretty much anyone. Basically you try and defeat the other legend before the final fight. Use spells monsters or strikebattle your opponent with weapons to damage and kill them.The WeaponsmithWorks best with Linza can be done with Ozan.

How do you differentiate types of deck?  For example how many base attack gain does a Vanescula deck have to have before its considered an AP deck?  Does the mere existence of X card e.g. Vyrewatch make the deck a certain kind of deck?  Id be very interested in this though if it could be made precise.,RSChronicle,d3ugbgu,1,t5_33z58

7824048,0,t1_d3v6iev,Yeah fair enough. I do see that point. I personally just dont feel that the issue with that lies with the raritypw aspect but rather just with the general game balance.

7832043,0,t1_d3wcyy0,Agree for the most part but I believe Ozan gt Vanescula his ability to grief rivals through hope devourer and gold stealremoval with cards such as Black Marketeer put him ahead Vanescula for me because aside from that he has a similar plan.Arianne and Raptor are definitely  and  for me though and Linza is better than Ozan but I find Ozan more fun to play.,RSChronicle,d3we0r4,2,t5_33z58
7846596,0,t1_d3xviyy,Theres actually a game design theory where its a good idea to install safety valves in your game to defend against overpowering effects that may arise and ruin game balance. Basically as a designer youre never sure how the meta will turn out or evolve. If one effect should ever become extremely strong there should be a defensive measure available to every player to shut down that effect. Youd rather ruin that one effect than allow it to exist and overpower everything else in the game.But I  agree in this case its overbearing. If that safety valve isnt specific enough then its too easy to tech into your deck get value out of a variety of match ups all while invalidating a playstyle that doesnt even have the chance to prove its overpowered. I would bet Jagex believes BKT to be a problem and will look for other ways to balance it.Thats why I thought a change where BKT gives both players a  and BKT is Aggressive might work with increased creature stats. This means it isnt effective against smaller weapons and it has a high tradeoff just for killing it. This makes it less universally applicable and only desirable as a specific counter to Weapon Linza only worth a tech slot if she were to become super dominant and oneshotting everything.Either way changing BKT is not a trivial task because there are other interactions that it keeps in check which could be pretty volatile without hard weapon removal.,RSChronicle,d3y0ydt,2,t5_33z58

As a high level yugioh player I placed in the top  at a YCS and went to NA Nats I can say that Exodia and Exodiastyle win conditions are extraordinarily unhealthy for any game. Its on the Forbidden and Limited list for a reason and many times it requires cards to be put on the listnerfed because it leaves little room there is none for player interaction. The decks that use Exodia or something similar as their win condition do it on their first turn by using combos and drawing every card in their deck until they hit Exodia or kill their opponent by doing  damage all without allowing the opponent a chance to play a single card. The only reason it still exists is because Konami is too stubborn to ban an icon of the game and can keep printing it because little kids will always buy it.Now all that being said something that is easily telegraphed and interrupted is pointless because no one would bother playing it. You want to do things that surprise your opponent not lose because youre telegraphing your only win condition by playing up to  specific cards in a row to hopefully win.The concept seems really cool but its so incredibly hard to balance ie. pendulum summoning in yugioh that its most likely not worth creating without creating an unhealthy environment for the game.  However I am glad people keep offering new ideas of conceptscards because this game is really fun.,RSChronicle,d4mo5pm,7,t5_33z58

8465408,0,t3_4vmwvn,Pulverize Basically the bare minimum probably wont slow down WeaponStrike Linza in any appreciable way. Im almost certain the x multiplier will haunt you guys whenever you design a new generic or Linza weapon. Needs to be weapon power   or something.Hope Devourer Probably knock it down to  or  armor. The effect is powerful but a  is nothing to be trifled with. It could not give any armor and still be an amazing card though.Amascut Templeguard Like Pulverize this multiplier will haunt you guys whenever you want to introduce new gold dependant stuff. Maybe it should work like Elvarg increase by  rather than ? The  damage is good though.Ling the Assassin Thats one way to fix the problem. However I strongly feel Ling and Lady Raven need a complete overhaul. Converting gold into damage is boring and difficult to stop outside consistent damage per round. Buying weapons and temporary attack and other things is much cooler and interactive. Not to mention it reinforces the whole adventurering theme much better than hoard gold and pay an assassin to kill your enemy for you. Make them grief reach I dont know but Goldzan is just not interesting or fun.Dust Devil Maybe increase its attack  significantly  instead? I understand and appreciate this is likely intended more for Dungeoneering than Constructed but DD is nowhere near as responsible for Grief Linzas power as Repurpose and Tetsu Broketana.Ice Warrior Reduce it to  gold. I would also really like to see a reappraisal of all class cards Haunted Soul so they give at least a small amount of gold to help contribute to your game plan.  is obviously way too much but Haunted Soul and Ice Warrior will be really tough to run among other class cards.Amascut Mystic Hm. Maybe heal equal to half gold remove half like current Ling? This is contingent upon gold no longer being directly converted to damage of course.I love the Morvran changes. Gorad and Bouncer will likely see a ton of play now though the former might again cause problems in the future due to his multiplier.

8595279,0,t3_4xddzz,I got a beef with Lady Raven now. So it looks like excessive gold gain has been nerfed pretty hard. If it takes  Gold to get the effect off how much average damage do you guys want to balance it out to? Its going to be far harder to get off a  damage turn which is fine OTK sucks to play against. But I feel like there is no direction for a couple of the remaining unnerfed cards. What is Lady Ravens point? Why waste all the time and effort gaining  gold for a good chance at the newly buffed aggro decks to take you out before you can get your combo off?If Party Hat is the proper way to get the combo off now then that is poor design choice. There shouldnt be two Diamonds reliant on each other in order for them to be effective Ive put some money into the game to help support it but I dont want to feel like I NEED to have two rarer cards in order for either to work. If you get one its useless until you get the second. Correct me if Im wrong though if there are other ways to get off a good combo chapter  with Lady Raven after this nerf.,RSChronicle,d6g01rb,6,t5_33z58
8601425,0,t1_d6g47jx,Well grief Linza can remove a total of  base attack. Ozan can get a total  base attack swing. Vanescula can only remove  base attack total.

8626266,0,t3_4xyib2,Hey so while I dont consider myself a pro at all I like to think Ive been around long enough to gather enough experience to maybe? answer some of these.Gold based cards are completely underwhelming yes. I mean Dragon Set is insane but who pays for that? pI think playing around and countering are two different skill levels. Playing around cards will be boring and less interactive however through playing more I think that you can learn to bait cards out and counterplay the opponents counterplays thatll eventually win you the game. Reading your opponent is a huge skill and youll likely have to invest more time into the game to learn this very well. Im not saying you personally dont know how it was more of a general point. Agree with the swingy point too. Karam is huge and Im one of the I think this card needs change. As much as others argue theres counter play you can get hit with this card out of nowhere sometimes. Make it more expensive is my argument but would that do enough? Who knows. Hope Devourer is another swingy card but thats being changed to hopefully something not so destructive.This last point is something that again is likely a skill in itself. Playing unpredictably to avoid grief if you carry a weapon over a chapter playing nd dont try and use it etc. Well see what the meta shifts to. It may well be aggro decks which arent massive risk but Im sure people will find a way to counter it. This leads to the merrygoround that is a meta. I might be totally wrong and aggro is uncounterable but thats a bridge for another day.I was scared reading the title that it was going to be a RSC is bad Hearthstone ripoff Elder Scrolls Legends is x better but glad that it wasnt.

8637359,0,t3_4y1jdg,As a miracle ariane player I really want youre idea but I dont think it will help the gold sucks problem. The thing I feel about gold is that the rewards from cards you play often doesnt justify playing them for how dificult it is to get them online. I mean even playing a heavily gold based deck majority of my nonearthstrikewave assists are  gold. If there are other supports that are in the  range that play to my end and are good enough where I have to ask myself can I justify playing this and only play one earth spell later. That would be much better. An example is archemage. I often hit him and I sometimes have to consider playing this means only earth blast into wave later instead of double earth blast. Can I afford that? and I think forcing that kind of decision onto players would need more than some free gold and an overall buff to gold supports. ,RSChronicle,d6la0m1,1,t5_33z58

9150697,0,t1_d88yrc5,This is a common theme and Im looking at it closely. One of the reasons just so everyone can see the logic for the high number on Unstable is that it can discard the other copy of itself! Potion decks and discard decks in general have always been high variance because of the random nature of the discard. Equally you can draw a great hand Ali x Unstable xStrength Pot or similar and use your Unstable concoctions in chapter  for huge burst but the discard means you are top decking for the rest of the game. That is pretty bad aggro tempo. Equally you might not be able to use your potions because you dont have others in your hand. Sometimes the only  potions you have are the Unstable concoctions so one would discard the other. Potion and discard decks have more decision points more risk and are more susceptible to bad RNG hence the higher damage number than Barker. That said if the improved Kaqemeex and Chaos Druid make things more reliable too reliable even then this downside is less of an issue and we will adjust the numbers down. Testing is ongoing as I say and with this feedback we should be able to get a tuned number for next release.,RSChronicle,d8bx12d,2,t5_33z58
