2286866,0,t3_2lffz2,Once upon a time in a land on the other side of the widest ocean...There lived a small village of folk not unlike your own. These folk were a tribe of terrifying warriors that frequently got into conflict with nearby tribes. They hated the nearest tribe of them all the tribe that followed Chief Tomsmellsbad. These simple folk wished for nothing more than to succeed in battle against their enemies in hopes of gaining a relic of great mystery and power. This journey to victory however is no small feat and one in which many sacrifices have to be made. The first sacrifice would come in the form of a goat. This goat was one of great significance so much so that it received its own special exotic name. And that goats name was Albert Einstein. Despite his namesake this goat lacked interest in the study of relativity. No this Albert Einsteins great interest lied in the key that would unlock the mysterious relic hidden behind the enemy lines guarded by Chief Tomsmellsbad but Albert knew that he would have to die for it.,Intaba,cludgdm,3,t5_34cg3
2296530,0,t3_2ljgb2,Dips torch into fire    Well I honestly cant tell you why we lost the challenge because I sat out of the challenge. I was studying for an exam last night so my schedule wasnt very conducive to hourly posting. Even though I really wanted to help the tribe I think we still made the right decision on that front.    I think the biggest thing about this vote is going forward with people you know you can trust. If we can stay unified then well work well enough together not to end up here again.    I think our tribe will still be unified. We should at least. I think we work pretty well together so even though it sucks that one of us has to go well still be unified moving forward.,Intaba,clvkf8q,5,t5_34cg3
