9893063,0,t1_dawq8ar,I sent affidavits that I made with people who knew me and had them notarized. I came in  so I had plenty of other evidence. But I thought it may give you an idea.,DACA,dax3890,1,t5_35gav
10409012,0,t1_dcnucb9,But your source says it will  wind down as permits expire not permits will be immediately void. But in practice the administration cannot prevent DACA recipients from working until their employment authorization document expires. As can be seen in the EAD above nothing on the physical document indicates that it was issued under DACA and employers are legally obligated to accept any facially valid nonexpired form of identification issued by the federal government. There is no electronic way to cancel an EAD and discriminating against job applicants simply because they are using an EAD is illegal.This is consistent with what i was told by a lawyer. No new applicants can be accepted if program ends and renewels in process may be removed however government is not legally allowed to just void the already given work authorization. ,DACA,dcnxgpf,2,t5_35gav
10475535,0,t1_dcvgnim,Just read an article on politico that theres a lot of people pressuring trump to rescind daca. I think the best option for now is to at least wait until mid February. My work authorization expires in May should have enough time to renew it ,DACA,dcvidyx,1,t5_35gav

10721755,0,t3_5t9vgw,Stop being such a babie and grow a pair. Your parents already had to leave their family their jobs and their their friends to start all over from zero hoping to give you a better life than the ones they had. Stop making it about youself and blaming them. ,DACA,ddlvblb,3,t5_35gav
10777495,0,t3_5u5zek,Yes. Ive talked to lawyers and consultants and all give me the same advice. Well see how it goes. ,DACA,ddrmcxu,0,t5_35gav
10978169,0,t3_5wqs53,I did not disclosed to my employer that I had DACA and always dreaded being asked about my situation. I talked to other people in the same situation and they told me the question was never brought up. I wanted to prepare a response incase i was asked. It seems from the people I know and me this has not been an issue. ,DACA,deccixa,3,t5_35gav
10981654,0,t3_5wstjn,If Trump changes his mind about us well know who to blame. Staying in the U.S. is a privilege for us. We can lose that privilege because of people like her. ,DACA,decqi2i,19,t5_35gav
10981930,0,t3_5wstjn,We were trying to prove ourselves to Trump and the rest of the country that most of us are good and honest people. We work hard pay taxes and follow the law. The problem was that we were just labeled as illegals that need to be deported along with the criminals. We were trying to separate ourselves from that assumption. Actions like this can undo progress instantly. ,DACA,decrmnv,6,t5_35gav
10986254,0,t3_5wqs53,I work for one of the largest Banks in the US currently and have done so since . I was very worried it would affect me but when it was time to do paperwork after getting the job they just required SS card and either a green card EAD or proof of Citizenship. I just supplied EAD and SS and there was absolutely no issue. They just want something that shows your legal right to work in US nothing else.Edit I should state I was never asked if I was a citizen or what was my status. I just filled the paperwork and provided documents as requested.,DACA,ded99i0,1,t5_35gav
10988939,0,t1_ddevvif,How is the thread pointless? When  people are in a relationship and one is worried or struggling the other should commonly help comfort the other. Do you agree or disagree? If you actually read my post correctly youd see that I never asked him to give me a solution. All I asked for was comfort after months of having received none. As for blaming my SO again did you even read my post? I didnt blame him for my situation I am hurt that he does not console me in my time of need. ,DACA,dedk7z8,1,t5_35gav
10994894,0,t3_5wzfjy,Just an FYI my bios were done in the middle of July and I was approved about  months later Day before Thanksgiving. I did lose my job as soon as my EAD expired but was rehired as soon as I got it in the mail. ,DACA,dee8jdy,2,t5_35gav
10999528,0,t1_deeq7ry,You cant have an honest conversation with liberalsprogressives about this issue or any for that matter without being called a racist or a xenophobe. Its pointless to even try. Thats why they lost power and will continue to lose power. Keep buying into that mainstream media bullshit. The fact is people will have to leave this country. Its that simple and not just the bad guys. Its not going to be easy but it will happen. Make no mistake about it. There is not enough work or money to support everyone who decided to come here illegally. Any form of amnesty will only make it worse. Employers who pay low wages to illegal aliens now will be forced to pay regular wages if their are residents paying taxes and that would defeat the purpose of hiring them in the first place. There are over  million Americans on food stamps and  million Americans living in poverty. Americans need jobs first and foremost. ,DACA,deerhxt,2,t5_35gav

11248559,0,t3_60i4gg,Lost my wallet a few years back with my EAC on it. I called support and they told me Id have to pay the whole fee again for replacement. I was worried sick thinking how I was going to come up with the money again so soon after getting it. Thankfully someone found my wallet and returned it to my house the day after!,DACA,df70a71,1,t5_35gav

11548611,0,t1_dg4vs8v,Thank you for the long and detailed response.  I did not help my student apply for DACA.  She paid a lawyer whom she is very upset with and a legal assistant helped her fill out all the paper work.  I provided her with a letter confirming her enrollment in the ESL program at our community college that was sufficient evidence for other students i.e. they used the same form successfully to apply for DACA and was given to me by my boss.However I feel responsible because the letter noted that she was denied for not proving enrollment in school.  How do you prove that you plan to attend a GED class after acquiring enough language in the ESL class?  ,DACA,dg51de7,2,t5_35gav
11690311,0,t1_dgl42pp,Its people like you that makes me wish trump did take away DACA. Sites like Reddit showed me how much assholes disrespect a beautiful program that helps people. They abuse it and they disrespect. ,DACA,dgl4514,-4,t5_35gav
