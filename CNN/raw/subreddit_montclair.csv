2584174,0,t3_2pdthp,Bohn Hall was my home during hurricane sandy. I never dormed there previously but I had visited and known all about it. So the MSU administration thought it would be a great idea to move all the upperclassmen residing in The Village into the former freshman dorm Bohn Hall. They moved upperclassmen including many people who prioritized alcohol over pillows during the moving process into an old tightly packed building. It was mayhem. Im pretty sure a window was shattered... a chair might have gone through it. The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night quite a few times. Warm water was pretty much nonexistant.It was great.Fun fact Bohn Hall used to have the shittiest elevators on campus. Freshmen would regularly get trapped in them. A while back someone posted pictures of MSU from years ago maybe youll find something there My personal favorite Dogs Teaching! Old photo of Bohn Some mentions of Bohn and the classic rumors of it sinking keep in mind this is  Bohn Shooting Whole collection of old MSU stuff from the Web Archive Another dog,montclair,cmvw0se,2,t5_2sd9l
