The crack is there in the desert scene. I totally buy into your theory just from this minor piece of evidence here. The rest of what you have said makes sense too but only time will tell.

7690205,0,t1_d3gavfl,Like I said Im only and average player but Im diehard Halo. I play it constantly and love it. The REQ system threw me off so much initially. It was hard to figure out and when I realized it was practically only good for Warzone and WZA I was already soured on it.WZAs saving grace is its much more playable than Warzone. But still man. I find working for higher end REQ requests almost counter to the game mechanic a player that is of higher proficiency will REQ up much faster than others allowing for higher weapons allowing for more kills etc.I really really feel that the developers are seeing this and offering the Warzone Fiesta modes and the ability for everyone to go straight to Level  REQs. This would kind of be the ONLY WAY Id ever experience REQs above Level  or  before a match ends. Theyve already dumbed down the requirement for some REQs for players such as myself. Maybe they see that hell theres a TON of players that sell off all their high end REQs. Yeah thats me.,Halo_5_Guardians,d3gbs3d,1,t5_31t39
