9263973,0,t3_579dwx,I dunno about you but I can eat a bowl of oatmeal any time of day. Pretty easy to throw in the microwave. I also mix some protein powder in there if I need extra protein. Some peanut or almond butter if I need some more fat.A sweet potato makes a good snack too. Also just throw in the microwave top it how you prefer.For something you dont have to cook the healthier options are to dwindle. You could do kettle corn I recommend topping with something like nutritional yeast seasoning for some nice umami flavor or potato chips. If youre trying to gain theyre not too bad as long as youre hitting the gym hard.,gainitmeals,d8q9wcf,4,t5_2un09

I cannot back this up with studies but I strongly feel this may be correct as most things like this have a biochemical underpinning... The only alternative being cognitive.,gainitmeals,de7ntkr,1,t5_2un09
