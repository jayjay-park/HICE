11302563,0,t3_617u66,Bring it but have it folded up and youll most likely be fine.I wouldnt be surprised if theyre anal about stuff though. They seem to be very antifan with their policies. Fuckers are making me go out and buy a pointandshoot camera because they wont let me bring my professional DSLR in. And before you ask I attended WM  at Metlife Stadium and that stadium had no issue with it.,WrestlemaniaPlans,dfd4nbf,1,t5_3a7pq

11496009,0,t3_640ci4,Getting wrestlemania tickets isnt hard. Getting Raw tickets however is a different story. Last year for WM I purchased them separately because I live in Dallas so travel package was unnecessary. I was able to get a Raw ticket through Ticketmaster on the presale nosebleeds but I got in without going overboard on pricing. This year I purchased a travel package but it was for  nights not  so I had to buy my Raw ticket off stubhub. Such an amazing show so it was all worth it. After each night youll be exhausted tired hungry maybe drunk so definitely stay in town after those shows. I wouldve hated to drive  hours right after each show. Honestly travel packages provide you better seating for each show. For NXT and HOF I got low level s seats and for WM I got low level risers. gold package. Its almost like they reserve your seating then sell the rest to the general public. I know travel packages are pricey but they come with a quality hotel great seats and very convenient rather than having to piecemeal it. I had to save up for it all year long but made my experience much more better.,WrestlemaniaPlans,dfz2ljf,1,t5_3a7pq
