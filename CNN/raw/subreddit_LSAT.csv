1251052,0,t3_28ejyj,This can be broken down.First  You will be defined as a splitter.  Someone with a low GPA and a high LSAT assuming you get a  which should be your goal anyways.  When you are applying for law schools theyre going to look at your GPA and LSAT score and say What in the logical world of the Supreme Court Justices is this?! and you will have to explain yourself as to why you are a splitter.  This will happen and its best to shed light on it as well.  Some schools favor splitters.  It is  possible to get into a T school with your GPA and a high LSAT score.  Its becoming more common and with the lack of people enrolling into law school you are at an advantage right now. Second  How hard is it to jump from a  to a ?  Get use to this answer it depends.  It depends on you!  If you want something and put the WORK into it you can achieve it.  I do believe that some people are destined to get a lower score than others thats how the world works.  However I believe thats a small minority and that if you scored a  cold diagnostic that you should be fine making that jump.  Hell you could possibly get a  to be honest.  It just depends.Third  Please dont use Kaplan Fourth  This is a real world example.  Really figure out why you want to go to law school.  What is your passion in the subject matter?  Narrow it down.  Is it the logic you crave?  Or is it the debate of whether or not a certain word in a contract means one thing or another.  Do you like making a well constructed argument using the evidence before you?  These are all things to deeply consider.If you have any questions on how to study and whats the best option let me know.  If you have questions about the legal field let me know.

Use earlier PTs for drilling and taking sections while you are studying the bibles and save the newer PTs for taking full length practice tests under simulated testing conditions closer to your test date.I disagree with others suggestions of LSAT Trainer and questions sorted by type.  I used the bibles and the Trainer and I thought that the Trainer was junk.

2775705,0,t3_2rv1n4,I havent seen anything yet. Eventually me LSAT Hacks sage LSAT Blog and Manhattan will have explanations but no one seems to have finished yet. I blame the holidays.I did make a rough draft of my thoughts on logic games. These are not explanations but rather general impressions on how this section compared to past LSATs. Is this sort of thing useful?Note I havent included any images yetDraft of thoughts on December  Logic GamesI finished this logic games section in around  minutes despite making fairly major errors on games  and . I describe those errors and how I fixed them below.Errors arent a cause for panic. Everyone makes mistake. The key is to plan for it and have processes to fix the mistakes.These are not explanations for the games. Instead theyre commentary I wrote directly after taking the section timed. This commentary includes some stuff I dont normally write about such as discussion of how the LSAT is changing.Full explanations will follow.Game  Band solosLSAC has been responding to the amount of prep people are doing by making games nonstandard. This trend continued on the December  LSAT logic games section.The first game was a sequencing game. Sequencing games used to be very formulaic. They were hard for beginners but very easy once you trained for them.New sequencing games introduce twists. Starting around preptest  LSAT sequencing games included the variation A is before B or after C but not both.This just means the followingA  B  C orC  B  AA lot of novice students mistakenly draw it as A  B or C  B and forget to draw the full implication of but not both.Game  introduced a further twist on this rule. The fourth rule says that the saxophonist is after the percussionist or after the trumpeter. This seems like a standard ruleP  S  T orT  S  PThe twist is that the second and third rules force the percussionist to play before the keyboardist and guitarist. So the second option of the fourth rule can be combined roughly like thisT  S  P  K  G    V is before K but I cant easily draw this by typingThus the fourth rule cleanly splits the game into two scenarios and in one scenario almost everything is determined. This is highly unusual for a sequencing game. Look out for this type of combination in future games and practice this game until you know it cold.Game  Public lecturesThis game didnt present any rules that were unusual. However it combined pure sequencing rules and dual rows of linear variables in an unusual way.Dont worry if that last sentence made no sense. Logic games doesnt have a set vocabulary. Basically this game has two rows of variables historians and lecture subjects. Whats unusual is that one rule places a historian in front of lecture subjects. I found this a bit hard to keep track of.I didnt spot any major up front deductions in this game. Modern LSAT games generally have few upfront deductions. Instead the games test your ability to clearly draw the rules and remember them. Heres how I drew my main diagramNote This diagram is actually WRONG. L doesnt have to be fourth. I included this error to show you that even experts frequently make mistakes.The difference is that I have habits set up to catch my mistakes. The tenth question was unusually hard for me because of this error. But I was confident I wasnt forgetting a rule because the rest of the game was easy. So I checked my drawings and deductions and found the error. That let me produce this drawing for the final questionThen I checked all prior questions to see if the error had had any effect. It didnt. Apart from the unusual mixing of variables theres nothing new about this game.Game  Woven rugsFor the past couple of years almost every LSAT has included a weird game that most people find really hard. The games either have unusual language in the setup or a way of setting up the game that doesnt match the pattern of previous games.However these weird games still use the same principles tested on other logic games. If you are good at the skills underlying logic games these games are not actually harder than the rest.The problem is that a lot of logic games training focusses on game types. If you learn to approach games based on their type your approach will be rigid and prone to failure when a game cant be fit into a box.A stronger approach is practicing with games sections in their entirety and repeating entire sections. The second run through a section will let you master games in greater detail and learn the principles underlying games in general. I cant comment too much on the specifics of this game. My diagrams looked like thisI made no upfront deductions and I didnt worry about it. My initial sketch above is just an experiment to see a possible scenario if White was in a group. Since the game was unusual I had to draw a scenario to get a feel for it.On the questions I simply followed the constraints each question set and then applied the rules. For instance this was my diagram on question I got there with these deductions.. If peach is alone orange cant be in. . Five of six colors are used. That means all other colors are in.. That means white is in. White needs three spaces.. Only F T and Y are left.. F and T cant go together so one goes solo and the other goes with W.. Only Y is left. Y also goes with W.Game  University PhotographyThis game seemed like a standard grouping game. But I made a mistake I didnt notice the rule in the setup that said each university needed two photographers. I didnt notice this oversight until question  and I had to recheck several questions to fix the damage.This is why you should check every answer on logic games. I noticed the problem on question  because no answers seemed correct. But when you make a mistake its also possible for multiple answers to be correct. If that had been the case on question  and I didnt check all the answers I would have picked the first correct one and moved on.As a result I would not have caught my setup error and I would have made three mistakes on this game.Heres my setup. The at least  was pencilled in after question Note that since I knew exactly what error I made I just had to check those questions where I saw a diagram with fewer than two photographers. So this error didnt actually cost me much time.The game itself was not that unusual. The main unique feature was the fourth rule. It tells us what happens if K is not assigned to Thorne.Our brains are no good at dealing with things that dont happen. The LSAC knows this and they test it ruthlessly. Pay special attention to rules like that.Notice that the fourth rule also interacts with the second and third rules. The fourth rule says that if K isnt at Thorne then M is. Rule  says that M and L go together. So if K isnt at Thorne we can also say two other things L is either at Silva or not assigned G is not at Silva because Rule  says that is at Silva then S is at ThorneMost questions tested the interaction between rules   and . If you can spot in advance that there are interactions between rules then youll be prepare to check for those when the questions ask about it. Which they will.,LSAT,cnjl5xc,5,t5_2qsf8

3613632,0,t1_cq3skai,I agree that it is just a numbers game but hoped that if you hit em with your best smile theyll look the other way ... Back to business. The first time i took a local lsat prep class. I had consistently seen  improvement throughout the span of the course. I was also taking  hours in undergrad working and had to commute an hour to get to the course every day. I had also just gotten on birth control and was seriously an emotion wreck of constant sobbing i wonder if that had something to do  all the stress. Im off that pill already lol It was exhausting but the course instructors assured me that I would see an increase in points once I was in the exam on test day. I was  and pretty stupid because looking back that makes NO sense. Second time I started studying slowly on my own reviewing the materials I had gotten from that course which honestly is very very helpful and started taking prep tests on my own and already saw major improvement. Then i got tired of that material and bought the Bibles along with the LSAT books that have  exams in them. I studied logic games and logic questions reading comp is the easiest one to me so i didnt bother to buy the books for about a year and was kicking ass on my prep tests given my start score of  that is. I think my highest score on prep tests was a . Test day comes around and Im confident that it will be my last time taking it because I hadnt scored below a  in over a year. I epically fucked up my games section though and score came back to  AGAIN. After being slightly depressed for a week or  I took my Bibles out ordered some new Prep tests and took the february exam at a different location and got my point increase to . I could technically apply to schools with this score and pray slaughter some chickens meditate and hope of being the  or  people that some schools will take with that score but I didnt apply for  reasons.  I want to know that I was not defeated by this fucking exam. as silly as that sounds. I feel a subconscious need to be validated by my score.   I already missed the deadline for Fall  and have more time to study and potentially blow my previous score out of the water for application season . I know that I want to start school in fall  for sure so no matter what the out come fall  WILL be my final attempts. Thoughts? ,LSAT,cq46hr8,1,t5_2qsf8

3870284,0,t1_cqxdlhy,Its good that you arent rushing to finish passages or having any issues with that. Im with the above poster read the passage then quickly skim the passage while making a mental note of how the passage is laid out. This will help with your question issue in a couple of ways. First if you know are stuck between two answers and know the layout of the passage the main point etc then you can eliminate one of those answer choices with confidence because it brings in too much extra information is too narrow is too broad or whatever other reason. The second is this I would recommend that when you read a question FIND THE ANSWER FIRST. Always look back at the relevant parts of the passage and come up with an answer or few that could answer that question. For the global questions such as Which of the following would the author agree with? just quickly resummarize the passage to yourself and make sure you understand what the passageauthor is arguing. Once I started to find the answers and prephrase BEFORE going into the answer choices I was able to be much more accurate because it allowed me to eliminate while giving me a good idea of what to look for. Much of the difficulty in RC are that the answers can be very similar and going into the answers can trip you up and slow you down if you dont know exactly what you may be looking for. Having an idea of what the answer is before hand can help with that.,LSAT,cqxg2m9,1,t5_2qsf8

4509981,0,t1_csybe4b,True and I definitely acknowledge that I cant say with certainty that it did. I will note my PT scores moved up in consistency following my two sessions generally staying at . At the same time though a single question or two is all that causes that type of shift and so its the best sample size.Additionally I did have a firm grasp on the flaws and the different question types. I just found that certain questions would give me an undue amount of trouble or I would get a very difficult question correct and then lose points on an easy question. Addressing those questions were what I sought to work on and because I was only getting about  LR questions wrong per test there isnt a ton that needs to be reviewed.In terms of the specific things I asked about I picked out the questions that I had undue difficulty with or that didnt click for me even after reviewing it and reading other explanations on. Part of the session was just me bringing up those questions and then working through themdiscussing them. By working on those questions and talking about the conceptual angle of the question typewhat the correct answer is doing to the stimulus I improved my handle of those few weak spots. For example there was a strengthen question about ancient building techniques it was maybe the third question on that practice test. I selected the correct answer but was unsettled by it because the answer was very weak and interpreting some of the alternatives creatively made them much stronger. I discussed this during one of the sessions and he noted that in that question it was strengthening the stimulus by removing a potential weakness. Also it was the correct answer because none of the other choices strengthened the argument and some only weakened the argument. That might be a simple distinction but it was one I had come to by instinct and hadnt made the mental incorporation of that into my perspective on strengthen questions.Beyond that I also had specific questions about timing strategypacingtest day warm upetc that I posed to him and we discussed. ,LSAT,csz4qwu,1,t5_2qsf8

However I wouldnt take issue with the LSAT testing this because there is a language shift from financial rewards to high salary and everyone is expected to see that especially since answer c gives you the hint to think about it  is an issue but its fairly rare on the LSAT for them to attack a surveys results like that especially because we are supposed to believe the premises and hate on the conclusion.

7640711,0,t1_d37t9e4,Before I launch into a detailed explanation let me just offer the cautionary tale. You should go to law school because you really and truly want to be a lawyer. You certainly dont need to pick a practice area now and no law school will expect you to have done so yet but I get the sense that you may be applying to law school as so many do myself included because you dont really feel like you have other options. If thats the case you may be in for a career you dont like and a crushing debt load. Just some food for thought.Now on to the substance. By writing an application Im guessing youre referring to a personal statement? As I said above admissions officers wont expect you to have your whole life planned out not least because you have to learn a little bit about law before you figure out what you like and what you dont. The best personal statements pair a topic that the writer is genuinely passionate about with an argument about how this passion relates to being a good law student and a good lawyer. If youre passionate about helping the downtrodden then you tie that passion and hopefully some relevant volunteer or work experience to public interest law. If youre passionate about technology you tie that to intellectual property law. If youre passionate about sports you tie it to sportsentertainment law etc. So figure out a passion first and then think critically about how it relates to practicing law.Admissions officers at top law school read literally thousands of personal statements every year. If your heart isnt in what you write their eyes will glaze over and youll end up in the rejection pile. ,LSAT,d3apfzg,1,t5_2qsf8

I took the first offer I got which was doing patent law of all things. Im not a tech guy. I did it for two years hated it and I quit. So I wrote a novel  available on Amazon!  and Ive got a second one in the works. If writing pans out for me then Ill probably do that and teach LSAT for the rest of my life.

8080325,0,t3_4pu9b2,What test you start with should be based on how many tests you predict that youll take. Probably estimate how many full tests and tests worth of sectionsproblems youll do and then add  for extra cushion. Subtract from  and use that as a starting point. You want to use all the newest tests you can roughly in order from oldest to newest in order to do the best you can.If you think theres a decent chance youll need to retake then maybe start on a test thats a bit older and save a variety of newer ones to study for the new one.And maybe take more modern ones every so often to gauge how well youd do on the actual test.You already have those real old tests so you might as well do those first. Then Id recommend skipping head some tests because I doubt youll cover every test by September and Id recommend against it because doing that many will lead to burnout.My recommendation for you seeing that you have maybe  or so days until Septembers test Finish up the really old tests you have. Then use PTs  for individual sections practice fodder and experimental sections. Then do  as individual sections or  part tests. Then do  as  part tests.Along the way maybe save  or  from every  and dont do them in case you need them for a retake and then while studying for the retake do  and then all the extras. And maybe do like PT as a  part test right after you finish drilling individual sections to test your progress and then PT  as a  part test to check your progress after having done all the  part tests. Thats be about  tests after you take out some in case of a retake and use some as experimental sections which should be more than enough for the next two months.,LSAT,d4oay5y,2,t5_2qsf8

8937081,0,t3_52orss,I had a student who took a Kaplan course and didnt improve so he came to me.  He let me borrow his old Kaplan course materials for a week so I could use some of the terminology he was more familiar with.  I have about two pages of notes of things I noted that they were teaching that was wrong but the most glaring example is that they didnt distinguish between necessary assumption questions and sufficient assumption questions.  Thats like pants on your head stupid.Other reasons that they have a bad reputation their teachers only have to score in the top th percentile the lowest of any of the major companies.  See related point below about teacher pay. the training that their instructors receive is minimal with the majority of it being in the Kaplan Method.  Literally they will have people training to teach LSAT in the same training class as people training to teach ACT. they pay their teachers at or near the bottom of the scale which means they generally get the teachers that cant get hired at a better company.  CX score requirements. their retail books historically did not use real questions.  That has changed and the course has always used real questions but it greatly contributes to the reputation of being an inferior product. they have the lowest average score improvement off any major prep company  points IIRC.Most people will improve just by taking multiple practice tests with no instruction and most people will benefit greatly and immediately from learning any basic approach to the games section.  Also some people are naturally gifted and with some basic exposure to the logic behind the LSAT will see some great improvement.  All three of those reasons contribute to an explanation of how an inferior prep product can still be somewhat effective for many people.Very generally Kaplan does a fine job with low scoring students.  The difference between a necessary and a sufficient assumption is probably not helpful and may actually be overly confusing for someone scoring  and they may actually benefit from that sort of dumbing down of the concepts.  It also works fine for people who really just need the motivation to keep working on it and dont have the discipline to do so on their own and dont have a better option available to them.As far as your experience my guess is that you would have seen at least the same improvement and likely greater from using a better resource.  You are way way WAY above their average score improvement.  In fact you are way above the average score improvement for any prep company so your experience really isnt going to be very representative.  All of that being said congrats on your score!

9004638,0,t1_d7tzl6n,I just read it again and for a second I saw what you meant by the problem with logical equation between received and interpreted and affect development. I reread it and Ill do my best to explain it. E. A work is not part of world literature if it affects the development of only one national tradition. Reworded If it affects the development of only one national tradition then this work is not a part of world literature. Ok read the last  lines of the stimulus. All  of those ways are methods of affecting the development of a national tradition. The first way is a positive way the second way is a negative way and the third way is in a way of radical otherness. They dont use the words development for the nd and rd ways but its paraphrased as decadent tendency in the nd way and home tradition in the third away.This is super tricky and luckily I didnt notice that trickiness the first time. I think subconsciously I understood all three of those ways to mean development.  If I did notice a possible equivalency flaw this question would have taken a little bit longer. However all of the other answers are very wrong and unsupported. When I see conditional logic Im going to focus on that. ,LSAT,d7u7u5a,1,t5_2qsf8
9013899,0,t3_53q0c9,For parallel reasoning I would highly recommend first looking at the conclusion sentence. This is not always the last sentence. Notice any ifs must be probably and likely. You can usually eliminate  answers right away by doing this.And assumption questions can be broken down into two groups of questions sufficient and necessary assumptions.I am going to assume you know the difference. For necessary it guarantees the conclusion to be true. So look at the conclusion and find an assumption that goes above and beyond to make that true. It usually has more than you need for the conclusion to be true but not always. Necessary assumption I highly recommend looking up the negation test. Its where you negate the sentence. If the negation makes the conclusion impossible then thats your answer. Example of negated sentence The car always runs. Negation The car doesnt always run.gt That means at least one time the car doesnt run. If this sentence ruins the argument then this is your answer. Go through necessary assumptions and negate all the possible answers and I promise you your accuracy will go up.You may notice that I am mentioning looking at the conclusion a lot. Everyone knows its important but I still people subtly identify it and dont center their approach around it. Its what the whole argument about so focus on it the most. Ive missed many questions by misunderstanding what the conclusion says.,LSAT,d7vbwk2,2,t5_2qsf8

As a silver lining majority of people I know in law school wrote it twice  bombed first and did very well the second time around and all of these people did well in law school too. This test does not define you it is tricky because of the time and the tendency for some people to overthink and second guess themselves. I am trying to tell myself that I did in fact take it too lightly even though I studied a lot and a part of me thought that somehow I had a natural intelligence that would shine through come test time. I too am trying to remind myself that there is always another chance to write in December or maybe even next year  and also so many other things to do and experience in the meantime while you try to make sense of the things going through your head.

If you havent used them the PowerScore Reading Comprehension Bible and Workbook are excellent tools.If youre taking the December LSAT and worried about your speed my strategy would be to first pick the three passages you like the most and work through them carefully. Focus on getting them all right on the first  and then just guess D on the last passage questions.

Youll learn it then youll do it then youll do it easily and automatically. Or thats the idea.If speed is your issue maybe try just reading a bunch. Novels academic texts etc. Not blogs or reddit.

9957820,0,t1_db4fgle,I never said all of science. You erroneously assumed that it when I said science I meant all of science. There are many scientific professionals from various different scientific fields that have completed studies on the topic of cognitive disorders and why certain accommodations allow them to perform to their full potential on certain tests or in classrooms.What was wrong with the old system is that people that did need accommodations that had received accommodations their entire lives were being denied and it left little to zero recourse for people diagnosed later in life to receive the accommodations they need. Theres a lot of evidence of people that had documented accommodations their entire lives being denied. Thats not right.For what its worth we are in complete and total agreement that only people that truly need accommodations should receive them. I personally think youre taking one statistic the higher accommodated testing scores and taking that to assume the entire system is broken when we all should know from studying for the lsat that there could be an alternate cause or it could be the effect of something other than having extended time. The answer to your other point about telling schools about accommodations quite simply is discrimination. A disorder or a disability does not mean you cannot do a job as well or even better than other people. By denoting accommodations on the test you are alerting law schools to a factor that legally cannot be taken into account while considering employment or admissions. Now obviously we live in the real world and people are denied jobs because they find out something about a disability or disorder all the time. But that doesnt make it right.You seem to be making an implication that is unsupported by any time of logic or reasoning that needing accommodations means someone will not be a good lawyer or that others will make better lawyers because they didnt need accommodation. How ableist and discriminatory of you. Because a person learns differently or processes information differently or suffers from a psychiatric condition or a physiological illness that requires them to receive any type of accommodation does not mean they are not as smart as any person that does not need accommodations. It does not mean that they will make a worse lawyer than those that do not require accommodations. At least that is what you seem to be implying.Honestly that thinking stymies me. I get that these kinds of disorders and disabilities still have a very big stigma but honestly people that want to work in crafting and defending the law should be able to progress with the times and broaden their horizons to be able to see that as science and technology progress we learn about how peoples brains work and we are not all the same in that respect. Study after study shows that standardized tests favor one of the many learning types. Studies show they favor males and caucasians too. ,LSAT,db5j2i5,1,t5_2qsf8

10122786,0,t1_dbqzlqk,When I saw outside thinking I meant within the rules of the game. Regardless I play a lot of chess. The same part of the brain that is used for chess is used for math. The same goes for the LSAT. Someone who has done a lot of math has a stronger neuron connection in that part of the brain which then helps with LSAT  in regards to logic games. For example I can speak in several languages I can guarantee I can memorize something faster than you because I have been using and training that part of my brain. por ejemplo en el idioma del espanol hay muchas palabras parecidos  como rebalar rebajar bajar etc. You can try as hard as you want to proof that in order to suceed in the LSAT you must practice it for hours which is true and that is something everyone should. But not everyone taking the LSAT is the same. For example I do not party nor drink. I never found that kind of stuff appealing. I wake up everyday and go to my local book store and read books  from economics math history etc. I find that more appealing. Of course I have a higher cognitive ability and knowledge than someone who is always drinking and partying. Use the example of the guy I stated above who crammed everything in two week before the LSAT. Is that something you would do? I certainly would not in fact I would study for at least  months straight before taking it. ,LSAT,dbr07sf,1,t5_2qsf8

Zoes interests and projects could be so diverse and varied that she hasnt drummed up a name for herself in any niche. Its possible that due to her focus Fisher at least has. ,LSAT,dddr2mi,1,t5_2qsf8

10971879,0,t1_debkfwo,Great question! The blueprint crouse is awesome at preparing you in foundational LSAT training. Its designed to produce the most amount of impact on scores for the most amount of people. Where it was lacking for me was helping me identifying the unique issues I was having with the exam. For example when I switched to reading the stimulus before the question stem it helped me analyze the argument in a more efficient manner. It got to the point where I could read a stimulus and already know accurately what my job would be. Reading the question first distracted me from the argument. Now Im not saying do one over the other but it made a big difference in my score. ,LSAT,debo71h,1,t5_2qsf8

11091862,0,t1_dep5est,One additional point to your thoughts about LSAT changes to competeThere are a number of less drastic measures LSAC could take straight away to make their exam more attractive. For instance implementing a ScoreSelect type system where applicants can pick and choose which scores to report would be huge! And since law schools now only need to report the highest scores it seems like a reasonable accommodation.They could increase the repeat policy from three times every two years to something less severe. Or for that matter do away with it altogether! Who really cares after all and given the landscape ahead of us LSACs gonna need that extra cash flow.They could tidy up this stupid score release behavior and either get scores out in a more timely manner or at least announce a day and stick to it.Andor my personal favorite LSAC could remove the digital licensing stranglehold theyve recently adopted and make it easier for test takers to purchase and access prior exam content. Every barrier to convenience they erectand these days theyve built a wall that Trump would slap his name onis one more reason to pivot towards newlyemerging alternatives. Theyd better be careful. ,LSAT,dep93w1,9,t5_2qsf8

If money isnt a problem theres no reason why you shouldnt get them. But personally I just worked off the free explanation videos am broke af. The most valuable lesson I learned from sage which does not require paying is printing at least  clean copies of those games you get wrongare confused then try out their methods as elaborated in videos on them over the next few daysweeksmonths until their methods grow into you. ,LSAT,dgart3v,1,t5_2qsf8

11654651,0,t1_dggu6qt,Nooo i never got the workbooks just the bibles but I do imagine the workbooks are helpful. After going thru the bible I bought a few of the older ten actual books to work thru and would drill LR sections one day and then maybe RC sections another day that way I would still end up using the whole test and not leaving sections undone. The key with doing that drilling is to mark every question you arent positive about even if you get it right and then go review why the wrong answers are wrong and the right answers are right. Use resources like the manhattan forums or lsathacks and so on to fully understand every question from each section.For example yesterday I took an lsat and scored really well only missing  questions altogether. However I still marked around  questions as ones I wasnt  confident on and went back and reviewed all of them.,LSAT,dgh2i2b,2,t5_2qsf8

Theyre always the questions when I know exactly what the answer is going to be before looking at the answers. Questions like whats the conclusion what part does x play and some whats the flaw questions are generally the ones I move on on. ,LSAT,dgojw14,5,t5_2qsf8
11728152,0,t3_67bf0q,The apparent discrepancy is between what wed expect and what we find. This is always the case with these questions. Here we are told that people  to  spend the most money. So...EXPECTED Advertise to  year olds since they spend the most.FOUND Advertisers actually target  year olds.We need to bridge the gap. Answer E is wrong because it doesnt even come close to bridging this gap the way D does. Your assumption would bridge that gap but its a huge assumption especially since as others have said its about print media. But the truly damning factor for E is that D directly bridges the gap by telling us two important things  what we EXPECT would actually have no effect since people  fall into the category of people who dont change their habits so theres no point in advertising to them after all and  targeting  is how you can lockin people who never change their habits so the payoff from your advertising is actually a lifetime of buying much more valuable than any smaller age groups spending power.Remember you are instructed to pick the best answer. This is essentially a comparative task. E is wrong because D is right and its not even close. Use this as a learning moment for yourself to calibrate your habit of making assumptions for this sort of question. D is spoton so you should not stretch so much to make assumptions for other answers. In cases where every answer looks pretty crappy thats when you see which one requires the least assumptions to make work.,LSAT,dgpf0by,1,t5_2qsf8

Do the foundational exercises at the beginning of lesson . Build your toolkit of LG diagrams and understand the major game types and variations. Be able to ID games in LG sections.

The birds were so annoying to set up. Without an eraser that question was annoying and took up a full page by the end of it. I feel like looking back I would have benefited from reading the question slower despite being timed. Missing anything in the setup really slows you down on a question like that. Having to go back and correct an error you made earlier feels terrible.,LSAT,dgyaoy1,1,t5_2qsf8
