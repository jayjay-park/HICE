91516,0,t1_ceoez6l,How saturated should you go? Thats a good question there is no set rules for using saturation and a lot of it at least for me is just getting the right feel for it. But a darker colour does not mean less saturation sometimes it means the oppositecolours and stuffIn this I made some simple colour strips starting with your original colours and going darker then I took the highs mids and lows and plotted them out on the colour picker. Right off the bat you can see that the only difference between yellow and orange is that orange is more saturated and yet it looks darker. Then the mid tones for the darkest one is at the same value at the shadows for your colours yet it looks darker. This is all colour theory stuffs and colour theory is important in my last comment I linked one colour theory guide here is another that Ive used in the past that I found quite helpful. For the blue light you added I say it looks better maybe a bit too much blue or not dark enough again its a practice thing.Basically when you need a dark colour get a DARK colour and dont half ass it. Go too far then dial back I think some wise chap said. I had this issue in the past and my colour pallet looked the exact same as yours what helped me get through that was realizing that I should probably break out of that one strip on the saturation and spread out.I messed with curves and popped this out I lowered the saturation on the blue a little bit not perfect but its something to think about.Im rambling yeah.look at colour theory.,MLPdrawingschool,ceoujol,2,t5_2skv4

403538,0,t3_1ynivt,Critting sketches is naturally quite hard. We have no idea what you may fix with further refinement so the little details arent really crittable. The big stuff is though and the only big thing Id like to point out is your work with her mane. Youve got three different angles but the mane is the exact same in each one. Here check this out I cropped the mane out of the bottom Sweetie and added it to the top right Sweetie. See how the mane would work for either angle? Dont let that happen. Like her marshmallowy adorable body the mane will also differ according to how shes positioned. Everything has volume and everything will look different at a different angle. except a sphere I guess come to think of it...So I guess what Im saying is use more volumes. If you need any advice on those weve got some solid guides in the sidebar. Need more? Dont be afraid to ask any of us.So I guess thats really it.

751264,0,t1_cgpgf7o,This is probably about the apparent kink between the upper hairline to the left of the horn and to the right. If you try to draw the hairline behind the horn the ends dont quite seem to meet I suspect its mostly an optical illusion  there is a kink there but it looks much more pronounced due to how we extrapolate curved lines behind objects. It can probably be fixed by straightening out the hairline on the right side a tiny bit and raising the part where it intersects the horn The red path is actually two cubic Bezier curves. When I tried fitting a single curve it ended up being much more mismatched   . Maybe this explains the optical illusion were picturing the line as a single cubic line even though it doesnt need to be.Heh I managed to bring up math in a topic about drawing ponies.

1591031,0,t3_2chri2,You have improved indeed. Youve also made pretty significant style changes. Looking through your gallery my suggest for improvement would be to start working on more expressions. The majority of your works have either a regular smile or a really big smile. Your technical skill is improving but there isnt a lot of storytelling going on. It doesnt need to be some huge epic scene this one is great because it is more than a pony smiling shes mad because her glasses are broken. It evokes questions from the viewer how did she break them did someone else break them is she going to have to cut a bitch? This one is also good for the same reason she is sleeping in the middle of the day weve all been tired enough some days after hard work to just lay down and nap for a bit so we can empathize with her on some level. One way to add a lot of strength to your composition without much effort is to follow the rule of thirds. TLDR dont center your subject. When your subject is centered it draws all of the viewers attention and makes the rest of your piece weaker because their eyes cant flow naturally over the entire scene.Let me know if you have any questions!,MLPdrawingschool,cjfpxpo,5,t5_2skv4

1649634,0,t3_2d8i5i,It can be if you use it wisely. Thats how artists are traditionally trained copying old masters. So when you do it set the bar high for whos work youre copying and be mindful of their mistakes and of what you want to learn from that piece. If a piece has a really interesting composition fantastic use of color or interesting interpretation of anatomy study that. The original artist is only human and you dont want to accidentally inherit their shortcomings. This is especially true of pony fanart.Just make sure to always credit the original if you decide to upload it online. Its just good manners.,MLPdrawingschool,cjn3lu9,12,t5_2skv4
1649966,0,t3_2d8i5i,i wouldnt quite call it copying someones art more basing your work of an original piece. Its never good to just straight up copy someones work since its not just extremely hard but it also doesnt let you develop your own art style. though if you are just starting or trying to get better trying to emulate someones style or using someone elses art as a base can be a pretty good method from personal experience. I think i made that a little too complicated so ill shorten it. Its okay to copy someones art but try to form it in your own way. its also good to emulate someones style for practice. If you post any art thats based on someone elses art online make sure to point out whos art its based on give a link to their profileart.Hope this helps!,MLPdrawingschool,cjn540j,1,t5_2skv4

1803651,0,t1_ck6dhe2,Alright well midtones refers to values and values are how much white or black is in a color. White is of course the brightest value and black is naturally the darkest. Therefore midtones are in the middle. Right now all your values are dark dark dark. Id suggest not using pure black bring some much much brighter values in and remember to use some stuff in the middle. Shades mids highlights. Use each of them.Now the how do you use them part. Most will tell you to do a thing called dark to light. Dark to light is starting off with you darks adding your mids and then your highlights in order to shade any given object in a piece. Its helpful because you only need to find where the light hits your subject you dont need to find both where the shade and the light will be. Start with your darkest dark as a whole fill and add in lighting where its appropriate.Dont be afraid to push! go too bright realize its too bright and pull back a little bit. Finding a balance means knowing where both extremes are after all otherwise you cant really balance the two extremes. Right now youre working with extremely black values.,MLPdrawingschool,ck6hxwv,1,t5_2skv4

Observing how light reflects off objects breaking it down into simple forms and recreating it is the most likely way to gain an understanding. Start with simpler shapes and work up to organics. The wings are suffering from what you point out but part of it is their basic form. As I said take a look at how bird wings are constructed and why they are constructed the way they are and practice drawing them in different poses and angles.

2871866,0,t3_2sss1q,Is the first picture like a before and the second an after?  I just want to make sure before I say anything about the first one.  As for the second one you got a few things I wanna comment on if you dont mind!  First and foremost is while you may be going for a more abstract style I want you to go back and actually make these ponies as per the original styling.  This helps you in multiple ways the most important of which is to be able to manipulate the base model so that even with a bit of abstraction you can tell what part is what.  On this piece I had a hard time figuring out what that little bit jutting out of her face was...til I realized it was her muzzle!  She has no noseholes or anything and the muzzle isnt shaped like a pony muzzle so it was a little hard to identify!  Other things like the ears being super thin and the arms being uneven in terms of length would be helped by going back and examining guides like this  The second thing is your linework.  While its all right on the arms and torso where you were making long swooshy marks it seems to become lumpy and uneven in areas where you make more detailed marks the bit of hair by her eyes her eyes in general hair outline ears etc..  To help with this swoosh!  What is swoosh?  Swoosh is making quick sweeping strokes and not going slowly for each and every detail!  Making hair?  Swoosh back and forth!  Mess up a bit?  Erase and redo the mark!  Digital art is great for this since you can always CTRLZ and redo the mark you just tried to do!  This will help to make your linework feel stronger more confident and a lot more consistent!  I hope that helped!,MLPdrawingschool,cnuj5uv,3,t5_2skv4

3673512,0,t3_32gd0c,I made a quick pair of paintovers to show what could be improved. The contrast kinda died but thats a paintover for you.A few notesNot all outlines are treated equally. If its colored and pointed at your light source lighten it up.Let something win. In order for your brights to feel bright there should be an area of dark. Right now the rendering is fairly equal across all the parts do some overall shadows and overall lights to really push the idea of three dimensions.Darks may be important but how dark and where you put them are also important. That ear out in the open? yeah it has no reason to shadow that much. A little yes and so an overall mark will take care of the dark dark of it.More overall marks more marks over a large area to both unify that area and separate it from others. Say the ear face and foreground hoof are all more in light while the rest of shy is in shadow. This pushes forward the faceearhoof and mutes the rest. Rendering and casting light are sometimes separate. Making a form d and showing its proper lighting sometimes contradict. You want shys mane to feel round as it comes off the head yet its facing the light the entire time. Round it out first then a... whatchamacallit.... overall mark will lighten it.,MLPdrawingschool,cqb063l,5,t5_2skv4

3961112,0,t3_35sx1c,Hey there that is a pretty nice job with ms paint. As others have said you should check out the free scene. Krita is pretty awesome right now.So some mild critique. Watch the shape of your eyes as you give expression to the face. Your eyes are in a very flat relaxed pose but the eyebrows you have added are a arched questioning look. Use the size and shape of the eyes to help express this as well. If you were to raise the eye lid on the right eye and lower the left one you would add to the overall questioning look of your pony. ,MLPdrawingschool,cr7sthx,1,t5_2skv4

4006863,0,t3_36c1j2,While I have multiple activities I think of as passions . right now music has always been the primary one. Ive gathered a decent amount of semiprofessional equipment and am pretty much ready to theoretically put together an album. Except Im still terrible!I was really glad when a friend linked me to this subreddit because of all the guides the hard work of uviwrastupr uMynameischumpy and all the other artists really helped put together for me how two dimensions can create a threedimensional setting how to utilize perspective and shading and understand how composition works. Theyre so comprehensive and I havent even gotten through all of them! And its all done for free which is incredibly helpful because I often find myself very short on time and money. Mostly money.So my visual art has been improving at drastic rates which is really encouraging but my music has not been keeping up which is really discouraging. I really love having tutorials and being able to have someone to show me the ropes but Im not sure where to look for that for music. I was in high school band for a couple of years so I understand the barebones basics of music theory and Im currently saving up the cash to buy Syntorial and learn the intricacies of synth patching but I dont really get how mixing works or what I should be looking for in audio hardware or even completely why my mixes seem to sound like crap even when the individual tracks are cool. My singing needs some work too. Reddit.comrmusicschool isnt exactly a thing. It feels like Im trying to learn without a reference.Are there any professional musicians here? How did you learn what works and what doesnt? Are there any cheap as free resources to accelerate personal development?,MLPdrawingschool,crd0gzv,3,t5_2skv4

4356474,0,t3_3aoj49,Equestria seems quite peaceful. Weapons are scarce powerful magic is scarce resources are plentiful and theres no sharp ideological or class division. It should be clear how all these contribute to lasting peace. However there are hints in the show and the comics of a history of violence and war. Id love to see this history fleshed out more especially all the events around  years ago.There are a few war related pieces of art I immediately think of. Bolt Thrower do a lot of music with war especially WWI themes but in a much more mature way than other music Ive heard. Lest We Forget and When Cannons Fade are highlights. I love Studio Ghiblis Grave of the Fireflies and its really interesting comparing the Japanese interpretation of the themes to my intuitive interpretation. All Quiet on the Western Front is fantastic too especially being from the German perspective not the AustraliaUKFranceUS I usually see. And Full Metal Jacket is a classic too. The Fallout games have a really interesting view on war too.Im not too interested in wars although some of the technology involved computers aircraft etc can be interesting. I do have some old gear from my grandparents time in WWII  a haversack belts some other bits and pieces which are in surprisingly good condition for being  years old.,MLPdrawingschool,csgphoc,2,t5_2skv4

4473116,0,t1_csu8jh1,Really good advice about silhouette. The mane  hairstyle are a perfect example of how a silhouette can communicate an individualized identity.gt adding OCs in relations with main characters in the show is a taboo as wellThat makes me uncomfortable too but I dont want to make any hard rule against it. Its kinda like when Shining Armor was first introduced. It was weird to hear Twilight talks admirably about her brother even though she never mentioned him for nearly two seasons. Now it feels normal because Shining Armor appears in more episodes and merchandises. OCs dont have that ability so their relationship cant overcome that sense of inauthenticity. Also it seems kind of wish fulfillmentish.gt Horsewife has been giving me a chuckle lately.Horsewife is a good example of a simple design that is still recognizable. ,MLPdrawingschool,csuibjn,1,t5_2skv4

4740089,0,t1_ctq1bnz,gt I know this isnt quite the same thing but Ive always found book art to be really neatThat is really cool. It is a little bit of what Im talking but also using the book as sculpting material like marble or clay. The fact that it is made out of a book played a part in the meaning of the work.gt I was looking for some artwork about a week ago and found this lovely piece by Tsitra thats also like this.Oh man that piece took awhile for me to understand. But once I figure it out I am astonished by how clever this is. It is both twilight and Twilight Sparkle. Using the pink of a twilight sky to get Twilights cutie mark color is just smart.,MLPdrawingschool,cts16ra,2,t5_2skv4
4742908,0,t3_3elggx,Standing horse anatomy is not my strong suit but lets take a look!Her left lower limb as in the one not partially obscured by her belly could be turned slightly inward if you wanted.  I think her hips look alright for an upright equine otherwise.  Some things I noticed is the earlike shape in the middle of her mane doesnt match with the flow of the rest of her mane assuming that shape is supposed to be upturned hair.  The fluff on her chest kinda makes it look like shes melting maybe localize the fluffiness a bit more to the center of her chest.  She also appears to be balancing on her tail by adding wings you could make the argument that shes hovering.  Lastly its nitpicky and may be a part of the design but her bow doesnt seem to be centered on the back of her head.  Cant really see anything else and those lines are very clean.

All parallel lines are vanishing correctly things that are supposed to line up to the horizon do and everything looks forshortened correctly. Its unusual to have the horizon at an angle like this but I think it really works here.One thing to check all the ponies are below the horizon line so we should be seeing more of the tops of their heads.

7409161,0,t3_4gr2rl,The legs on that middle wrong are honestly like really wrong. How are you constructing them? Youre lacking a lot of joints in the legs.Remember a horse has knees heels and toe joints just like a person does. The Bone structures in mammals are equivalent in almost all species.Heres an example of how the legs there should be constructed  Hip  Knee  Heel otherwise called Hock  Toe joint just above where the hoof attachesIts very important to think about them in the same way that youd think about human limbs because youre already an expert at those. Heres what I mean Its not just a comparison its literally the same bone structures which have been modified slightly through evolution of different species.The construction of those faces is too human as well especially on the leftmost image. You shouldnt be adding a human jaw the muzzle is the jaw. So you can construct the muzzle just using the face circle and centrelines like so,MLPdrawingschool,d2kdg8p,1,t5_2skv4

Im going to do what you guys recommend and use a reference for shaping. I rather enjoy doing the smaller details such as the eyes. I also spent way too much time trying to get the multi coloured saliva to look good well that is one of the weirdest sentences I have ever typed. I have personally found the sketching part to be the most frustrating but getting use to the movements is taking time. Still give it time and Im sure I will develop the skills.
