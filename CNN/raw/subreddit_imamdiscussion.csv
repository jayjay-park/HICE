3985797,0,t1_craljrh,It appears to be recommended for use on at least somewhat irritated skin too  acne sun burns itchy etc. link  link link these arent peer reviewed journals though because I appear to have forgotten my password to get into my university accessed databases I just used it like  days ago how did I forget already. Most of the stuff Ive seen in conjunction with problematic for irritated skin was use of the essential oil. Could definitely use better sources though  the owner from DMM posted a book link that I think she gets information from I should dig it up and see if its easy to obtain an ecopy just for curiositys sake. I guess to make a haphazard comparison its like me making a post that said something to the effect of why does your lotion contain dihydrogen monoxide haus of gloi?!  someone who was just driving by the thread might see that and be like what is that a bad ingredient? Its water but youd either have to know that or look it up. Or if I made a post asking why dont shiro shadows have wonderflonium in them?  the tone to me comes out as reading like the company is making a mistake when its not an ingredient that necessarily has to be in there in the first placeHopefully that makes sense haha. I guess my personal perspective is that DMM doesnt get talked about that often and isnt in the golden tier of brands BUT I recognize that my perspective isnt necessarily the truth. I just noticed a trend with the most recent  product releases where there wasnt that much chatter over the formulation of other brands new releases.And your last point is totally valid  perhaps people feel safer questioning brands that dont have huge fan bases because of the brigading.,imamdiscussion,cram77y,3,t5_388od

4105340,0,t3_37l11t,I started buying indie when I saw some very pretty swatches of Femme Fatale. So I ordered them and even though they took forever to come I loved them when I got them! After some time udaisyismydog recommended some products when I mentioned I wanted to go cruelty free with makeup. I fell down the rabbit hole with Shiro and then Hello Waffle. And it was love from there after. I really adore the customer service its great to be able to chatPM the owners and have a conversation that isnt just a random CS rep using formulaic lines. Honestly its one of my favorite parts. And now Im falling in love with indie perfumes. SAVE ME. ,imamdiscussion,cro8ev1,3,t5_388od

5052395,1,t1_cuuyzdr,I mod subs so let me clarify this for a sec because I think the term head mod can cause some confusion.When you look at the mod team box on the sidebar of a subreddit theres an inherent pyramid. The mod at the top has the power to remove all mods below them and that continues on. Everyone has the power to remove those below them. In addition to this mods are given permissions as to what they can and cannot moderate. This determines whether or not mods can edit the wiki change the CSS etc. Theres no way to know what the permissions are unless youre appointed a position or the team discloses them. You can actually see this through the mod team about page. All mods have full permissions with the exception of AutoMod.In addition if the top mod is causing serious issues the rest of the team could contact the Admins to remove them.TLDR The mod at the top of the list can remove all mods below them but apart from that it could be a totally even playing field. The only real way to know is if the team disclosed who has what mod permissions. They all have full permissions with the exception of AutoMod.,imamdiscussion,cuv072n,4,t5_388od
