1119302,0,t1_chveh9q,Thats exactly right. At least for me.I guess there are  levels of bans Shadowban Only your account is banned. IPsoftban Only accounts registered AT THAT IP are banned but accounts made elsewhere will still remain valid when logged in at that IP. IPhardban ANY account that logs into that IP regardless of where else the account was registered will automatically get shadowbanned the instant the account logs in!I had shadowbans on a few accounts for a while then I got an IPsoftban in January so I registered new accounts from other IPs and eventually TOR.Then just yesterday I found my latest account was shadowbanned again so I did the usual drill. Just as soon as I logged into an account in my usual browser that account got shadowbanned. It was valid when registered on TOR but alas I cant stay logged in through TOR. How can I if theres a trick? Thats how I found out that I was IPhardbanned.I tried resetting my modem amp router clearing cookies and going to the DOS command prompt to type ipconfigrelease and ipconfigrenew. Only my IPv would change. Theres an IPv concurrent to the IPv that stays constant. I hope someone at my ISP can change my IPv.In short yes if you are IPhardbanned.If I had the capability to hack anyones reddit accounts I could log onto anyone Ive had disagreements with in order to shadowban them too. Those moderators and whatnot would feel sorry for messing with the wrong Redditor. Alas I dont have the haxxing skillz.,ShadowBan,chviwob,1,t5_2sn3b

Luckily they saw that we were really two different people and unbanned this account. his is still banned though unfortunatelyWhat I dont understand is how they could have thought we were the same person.

1729278,0,t3_2cdyix,Thank you for the help! I found out I was shadowbanned due to a nice admin on one of my favorite subreddits and was really confused because I had no idea what shadowbanning was. The posts from this subreddit helped me realize the steps I needed to take to appeal my ban. sporkicide kindly told me the reason it was due to my ignorance of a rule and after promising to not continue with that behavior in the future the admin reversed my ban.
