3552263,0,t1_cpx0cva,gt well I use to do cycling when i was a little bit younger just didnt do it for exercise purposes.And I used to run and do all kinds of sports as young. Now I cycle for exercise. Lol.gtAnd I do watch anime I just didnt put it up there PSome of my all time favorites are Code Geass Death Note Hataraku Maousama Log Horizon and Sword Art Online.Good taste you are a brave man putting both Log Horizon and SAO in the same sentence. Most anime fans would go nuts right now.I dont have too many favorites. But Code geass and SAO are probably up there for me aswell. gtINFJ is my personality type.If you got some time over do the test and then read about your type.Well I do like alot of psychology and filosofy. And was so intrigued that I took the test. And funny enough it matched about  of what I thought I was.Apparently I am INTP with a mix of Architect. Was so funny the two things I have thought of the most recently as career paths. Were the very first  favorable careers mentioned in the results.  And almost every other career after that was something I could imagine myself doing.This MBTI is probably something right up my alley I jsut didnt know about it before now.,StayAWhile,cpx6jio,2,t5_37kbs
