368975,0,t1_cfj00uj,Thanks for the reply. I had never seen them be aggressive until the one pet shop. I dont know if they just didnt feed then and had to many or what. There were all types and sizes. Its what got me thinking again that maybe if I leave this guy alone for too long he may get territorial. Maybe Im just being crazy. Once again thank you for the reply. Its nice hearing from someone else that they are crazy aggressive. ,Goldfish,cfj0d1e,1,t5_2rmri

2925221,0,t3_2tnb5l,You can swap the media over from the old tank! As long as its not infected will ilness swap as much media over as you can.  It will shorten the cycle time of the new tank. Do not rinse or scrub the media with anything but tank water. I siphon a bit of water from the tank  scrub my filters and media put it back in and its good to go. Hopefully I helped if I not one of the more experienced fishperts will be in to help  Im sure of it! ,Goldfish,co0lv38,1,t5_2rmri

9326549,0,t1_d8y5i41,Yeah they seem to be once a year  There is going to be a suped up show in DC next year I think. There was a post a long long time ago when they first announced it. Id have to do some digging to find it. But oh my goodness its so worth waiting until the show. I wont buy fish outside of the shows anymore. Im too cheap to deal with shipping and the quality was amazing. Here are a few pictures from the show here earlier in the year. Show quality are definitely expensive but you can save a ton of money by growing them out yourself. It takes a lot of work getting those giant fish and people will definitely charge for it. My breeder tamasabas were about  a piece as babies while the full grown ones from the same line were about  I think. Have you checked out dandy orandas at all? Now thats a way to bleed money for nice fish lolgtId like something overly bred pretty creature that just shows up all the shoes at the store Now when you say overly bred are you thinking things like crown pearlscales pom poms or are we talking the king of all goldfish the tosakin There are so many ways to go lol gtThe needs were the worse. I couldnt find any good sources and I like to know what Im getting myself intoone of the biggest reasons I spend so much time on here answering questions. I really dont fault people for getting their information crossed because there are so many sources that seem credible if youre a new comer but once you keep fish for a while realize these people have never owned goldfish before. I try to give all my recommendations based on my own experiences and what ive been told from trusted sources. ,Goldfish,d8y7iwd,1,t5_2rmri
9542098,0,t1_d9p8xsn,Ammonia?No nitrites and no nitrates is alarming. You should have nitrates if the tank is properly cycled. Also the small tank and small filter is going to be a problem very soon for you,Goldfish,d9p9fea,12,t5_2rmri
9831208,0,t3_5g1ruu,Dont worry about it. Take good care of them now. Do big weekly water changes and feed well on the best foods on the market. Some dont get as big as other no matter what their care and there is nothing you can do now if they were stunted. A couple months in a small tank isnt going to stunt them unless the water changes were inadequate which is true of a larger tank as well. ,Goldfish,dap10l9,2,t5_2rmri
