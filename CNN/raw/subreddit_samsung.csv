137096,0,t3_1vniqi,Oh man I am sorry to hear that. Same thing happened to me. Note II was in my bag even in a case safe for a few hours and when I came back to it saw the same thing. Glass was fine but internal LCD was cracked. In fact it was so busted despite the small crack that no light would emit from the lcd.I had the phone brought into a repair place and they said the entire digitizer would have to be replaced which can cost upwards of  dollars. Unfortunately I think youll have to either pay for a repair like that or do your best to convince your carrier to help you. I was able to haggle with ATampT enough where upgrading to a Note  became feasible.Good luck and sorry about the issue!,samsung,ceu1n2f,3,t5_2rkar

1816153,0,t3_2fa404,Im sorry to hear about the phone. I would try to boot into recovery modeTake battery outWait  secondsPut battery inHold power button AND volume upRelease power button when the Samsung logo appearsDo not release volume up until you see recovery mode If you still get no response from the phone make sure the charger works and that the battery is not damaged. You can take the battery out and on a flat surface spin the battery. If it continues to spin the battery needs replaced. Also while the battery is out look for signs of water damage. There shod be a small white sticker under the battery. If its colored your phone has water damage. If none of that works see if you have any insurance or warrenty on the phone through your carrier. If by now nothing works Im not sure anything will so why not get a small screwdriver and take the phone completely apart. It might be possible that there is hardware damage. Realisticly you might need a new phone. Let me know if any of this helps!,samsung,ck812bo,1,t5_2rkar

6255670,0,t3_3v56ei,About a year a go I bought a Gear  Neo on a bit of a whim.  At he back of my mind I thought Id use it for a bit and then the novelty would wear off but I find it actually pretty useful.  I cycle a lot so its good to be able to see texts and email while on the bike and answer calls.  I find the timer and alarm function really handy and the fitness tracker aspect is also pretty good.Im currently considering upgrading to a S Classic.  Ive had a play with one and the bezel navigation is really neat.   I also like the fact that it looks like a real watch rather than a sci fi toy. Ive read that you cant answer call on it like on the  Neo i.e.speaking into your watch when you get a call  this is useful for me when Im cycling.So i n summary I think they are quite useful gadgets so if youve got the spare cash give it a go.,samsung,cz0p9fc,1,t5_2rkar

8257949,0,t1_d59sds0,Not trying to be a dick but if you didnt get insurance on your phone then your option is to replace the entire display. Newer Samsung phones are not as easy to work on as the earlier models. I stopped doing repairs before the s came out but I still read repair websites. Best bet would be finding a repair shop at a decent price. Its be pricey but dude you said you chucked your phone. You know you cant be doing that with these expensive phones. Best of luck man.Edit I mentioned newer phones were harder to work on and will be more expensive in case you get a new one and chuck it again.

8607854,0,t3_4xpxhe,How much data would you expect to use in a month? Does TMobile have good coverage in your area? Coveragemap is an app on Android that is great to check for that. Basically Verizon is always going to be more expensive but in my experience has better coverage. The difference between monthly phone payments and  year contract on Verizon is the cost of line access fee.  year contracts have a  line access fee per smartphone. Monthly payments have a  line access fee per smartphone. So Verizon  monthly payment plan would be  for gb  in line access fee a note  is  per month. Assuming you get  new note s thats  per month before taxes and fees.  year contract would be  for gb data  in line access fees. So  per month. Sometimes Verizon will give you the discounted access fee if you are out of contract so potentially you moms phone if not upgraded could be a  line access fee. Depending on that  year contract would be  per month. Now on upfront cost monthly payment plans you only pay taxes upfront so about  per note  at least in my area for taxes. So  upfront.  year contracts would be . upfront per phone so  upfront. I cant speak for tmobile dont activate them at my store just Verizon atampt and sprint. ,samsung,d6hksea,1,t5_2rkar

9181331,1,t1_d8fr37s,Spot the iPhone Basher and Samsung Advocate here. Jesus you are prolific at defending this phone and how Samsung have handled it.Batteries can be defective and because of their chemistry and the substances inside them a battery malfunction can occur. It can be said for batteries in iPhones Samsung phones your TV controls your  vibrator that you use to cheer yourself up when people make fun of the Note  LITERALLY any Lithium Ion battery is capable of having these issues.The issue really comes into play with scale. With over  incidents in less than a month an organisation citing that the battery is too big for its compartment evidence suggesting that the breakdown of materials causes batteries to short circuit the fault here comes to the decision or lack of research and development to fit those batteries into that volume. As i said in my other post Which i noticed you have not responded to yet this lack of space allows for inadequate ventilation the use of faster wireless charging than anyone else has ever used allows for the heat generated to increase. Combine more heat with less ventilation and you get a chemical breakdown of the components in a battery which results in  and  points in the battery coming into contacting beginning a chain reaction which CANNOT be stopped even if the device is in a  powered off state.,samsung,d8fsurj,0,t5_2rkar

That way I could get the apps on my iOS device and start moving stuff over before actually making the device switch.Cloud services for Samsung and Android in general are nowhere near as integral or comprehensive as iCloud.

11679053,0,t1_dgj7tca,Take a picture with the camera facing straight down above the phones. I have a S and I only notice a red tint when the screen is viewed at a angle similar to the angle of your camera or greater. I am thinking that the blue or green pixels become partially obscured when looking at the screen at a angle. I dont understand what benefit a change that would cause a red tint when the screen is tilted would provide. ,samsung,dgju5il,1,t5_2rkar
11695841,0,t3_66t2so,My Bluetooth is working fine in my car but its not exactly the same as my S. When I had the S every time I connected to my car it would begin to play.music from Google Play. Now on my S it shows the title of whatever I had playing last. Even YouTube. I have to go into Google Play and start my music. Not sure what changed there.,samsung,dglqq0o,1,t5_2rkar

11733351,0,t1_dgpuego,How is the S holding up? I loved mine but it got pretty buggy after a year. I was gifted an S when it was just over a year old so I gave it away. Id imagine you need to be on custom ROMs now?I have an S in a decent case. Had it coming up a year and its still like new Its had several drops too  always the same onto wood laminate flooring from pillow height as I fall asleep... Need a softer case for it as the bang always wakes me up!Anyway regular S in a good quality case is all you need. I did recently smash the lens over the camera but that was my own stupid fault for keeping the phone in the same pocket as a tape measure while doing a survey and laying on said pocket. Fix is going to cost me  S. New back panel and camera assembly. ,samsung,dgq0785,1,t5_2rkar
