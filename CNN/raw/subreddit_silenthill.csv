750066,0,t3_22qlar,Disturbing sound design and imagery sorely miss this in new titles.A story that doesnt revolve around guilt and inner demons Silent Hill  came out more than a decade ago we dont need any more wannabes.Instead stories about series unexplored themes persecution of sexual orientation inferiority complexes etc.Female protagonist possibly middleaged possibly a mother?Nondegrading specific weaponry no picking up random weapons like rocks and bricks.Abstract monsters that all characterize part of the storys themes Downpours monsters were downright terrible at least Homecoming had the Schism. Id like more monsters with stories like the Twin Victim in The Room.Claustrophobic environments like the apartments of Silent Hill .A forest at night. These always creep me out.Riddles that are actually cryptic and difficult Homecomings puzzles sucked. Nuff said.Menu inventory system maybe with a backpack image?NO PYRAMID HEAD OR ANYTHING LIKE IT.More everyday environments corrupted a community college a shopping center a pawn shop just not anymore cemeteries or monasteries in the middle of town HOMECOMING.Better engine for lighting and textures read NOT UNREAL ENGINE.No realtime transition between the real world and the Otherworld. I prefer it happening offscreen actually. Feels more weird to me.Fewer bugs. I dont miss them at all from the older games and theyre only worse in the newer ones.Slow the combat down.

1984783,0,t3_2hfye8,Although a very interesting approach I dont think the achieved his purpose line is in reference to multiple gameplays acting in conjuction. That would be fascinating to see play out though. Almost like an interactive Twitch. I took the line in reference to statements Kojima has made about how scary the game will be.According to Kojima there are a number of developers that will make a horror game less scary because players may get too scared to continue never end up finishing or even play the game again. For Silent Hills this is more than okay with them and something they actually expect. The team are actively ignoring the scary limit and want to make the game as scary as possible.Its possible that the last he could be referring to Kojima himself. If the player stops playing then Kojima has achieved what he set out to do make the scariest game hes capable of. If it is referring to the player it most likely means that that player got out of the game everything they needed to. In a sense they completed the game not because they beat it or followed the story but because the game as Kojima is marketing it as with the above statements sets out to terrify you. By being so terrified they stop playing they achieved their purpose which is to be terrified. I think both are interesting readings.,silenthill,cksd7rf,3,t5_2rrim

The puzzles were challenging enough the atmosphere was unsettling and the concepts and characters were fantastic.The only real issues I had was Lugging the cripple around for part of the game and the combat. but I dont really believe that SH should be focusing on combat anyway.

3205492,0,t3_2wuibn,The movies are in a separate continuity than the games.From SH WikiThe producers of the film have stated in the makingof features that since the creatures that appear in the Otherworld version of Silent Hill are punished human beings Red Pyramid is being punished by having to wear the large burdensome helmet. Director Christophe Gans has also stated that Red Pyramids appearance is conjured from a female perspective on male brutality i.e. Alessa Gillespies.Red Pyramid may be based on a painting Alessa saw in the Grand Hotel just before she was burned alive by the cultists titled A Procession of Flagellants. It features men in coneshaped hats and tan robes around their waists.Another theory to Red Pyramids origins is that he may be Alessas incarnation of her father  a man unknown to her wearing a mask that conceals his identity an authoritative figure punishing those in Silent Hill that had punished her in the past. During the scene in which he attempts to stab through a door to get to Rose and Cybil Red Pyramid represents a rapist with the director stating in the BluRay commentary that Red Pyramids knife thrusts represent a woman being raped while the Creepers who pour through the door after each stab represent sperm. This is likely in relation to his location inside Midwich Elementary School at the time of the attack where Alessa was raped by the school janitor when she was  years old. Gans has also stated that Red Pyramid is a basic metaphor for male violence.For Revelation writerdirector Michael J. Bassett has stated that Red Pyramid serves as a surrogate father for SharonHeather when HarryChristopher has been kidnapped filling in for her need for a protective father figure. Red Pyramid appears twice to protect Heather. ,silenthill,cou8yj7,2,t5_2rrim

This is a really strange thing to remember but it has always stuck with me. theres a bit in the original near the end when James is talking to the pyramid heads and he says something along the lines of Leave us both the hell alone! and Ive always thought his voice sounded really over the top and nasally.

The story of Silent Hill  has almost no immediate connection to any of the other games other than subtle references and of course the location.

We shouldnt be supporting Konami due to so many things mainly how they treated Team Silent during the development of the first  being completely wreckless and handing the control over to a guy whos username is konamiwhore along with hiring people who know nothing about Silent Hill making a movie that had nothing to do with Silent Hill good movie but a bad Silent Hill story making another one that had no redeaming value and finally killing Silent Hills and shifting their focus to mobile gaming killing any confidence that many gamers had in the company.Konami will still make Silent Hill games.

6638468,0,t3_46jj41,Silent Hill  is my far and away my favourite game in the series for a lot of reasons. I dont think my feelings on it will apply to everyone but whew! Here we go.Lets start by comparing SH to other games in the series. Most of the games in the series had VERY heavy plotlines involving the presence of the cult and while its definitely not a bad story by any stretch of the imagination its all a little fantastic and can feel convoluted. Thats not to say I dislike the other games far from it! SH and SH are my other two favourites in the series. But it can all end up feeling like kind of a mess. Theres a big nasty cult that did big nasty cult things and you really just get thrown deep into it with no idea whats going on and you blindly fumble your way toward what you hope will be come explanation and even the revelations about the truth can be kind of complicated. Again thats not a bad thing. But for me I was able to get into SH much more easily and much more quickly because it was a much more personal story. You arent dumped bassackwards into a bunch of lunacy involving a cult and their crazy drugs and ritual sacrifices. Youre just some poor dude who cant move on with his life looking for his wife who apparently sent him a letter despite the awkward fact that she is quite dead. The story starts out simply enough with a strong premise that you can really latch onto. Its the simplicity of the goal that helps to support you when things start getting weird and when everything goes to hell and James does it to which makes him more relatable. He hits a low point loses a great deal and all he can do is put his head down and go well I have to find Mary. Thats all I have left anymore. As you go further and further down the rabbit hole and the literal holes and the metaphorical holes you have this increasing sense of anxiousness. You want to find Mary. You want the truth. But do you REALLY want that? Are you sure? You dread what the truth might be even as you doggedly march toward it.I really felt strongly for James. I felt bad for him. I cared about him. I wanted him to find his wife and get closure. In fact all of the SH characters are deep and make you care about them. And I think that all of the characters have something about them that its easy to relate to. They feel like real people with real problems. Maria Angela and Eddie are all phenomenal characters. Even Mary is tragic and compelling despite the fact that you only get to see her and hear from her in little snippets.The monsters are awful in the best way possible. Dont get me wrong Silent Hill has consistently knocked it out of the park with some neat monster designs in every game Grey Children in SH Closers in SH Twin Victims in SH etc but SH really hit the nail on the head with what the monsters could be and what they could symbolize. In SH the monsters were all pretty literal. Alessa was afraid of dogs so you fight scary dogs. You fight a big moth because of Alessas insect collection. SH was the first game in which the monsters had a very personally psychological bend to them and it set the standard for the games after it to follow that trend. And in SH the monsters are really well done because theyre simultaneously attractive and repulsive. The Mannequins rub their upper pair of legs together in a manner thats reminiscent of a bug rubbing its feelers together but also vaguely in a way that might remind you of a woman squirming as she rubs her legs together. The nurses are buxom and scantily clad but they twitch hideously and have no faces. And that all plays into how James feels about himself. Mary was sick and dying in a hospital and couldnt be intimate with James in a way that he as a healthy young man would have wanted. He was sexually frustrated but also disgusted with himself for feeling that way. What better way to express that so perfectly and so subtly than by making the monsters the way they did rather than just coming out and saying this is why in the game.Symbolism is everywhere in SH and the game doesnt hold your hand about it. Very very little is actually explained in game. You have to just experience it for yourself and draw your own conclusions based on what you see and how you feel about it.By that same token the fact that you can draw your own conclusions as to which ending is correct is a nice thing too. In Water is considered the canon ending by most of the team but its been stated that any of the four serious endings can be considered true because James fate is left unknown. Combine that with the fact that which ending you get is based off of subtle actions you take throughout the game inspecting certain objects multiple times reading different notes whether or not you take care of Maria that means that no matter how you play your game whichever of the three original endings you get thats YOUR ending and its no more correct or incorrect than any other ending. Also the soundtrack was pretty much just perfection. I know rambled a lot about this. Sorry!EDIT Holy crap thank you for the gild!,silenthill,d05z3le,34,t5_2rrim
6817780,0,t1_d0oye6o,Yeah thats probably a good idea though youll have to take a small step back graphically with SH that way.

That is not present in the later games. You can equate it to saying that Lethal weapon  is as good a movie as the first movie. Yes sure its more Lethal Weapon and no its not unwatchable but it is nowhere near the quality of the original. My feelings are that having a large fanbase that says Downpour is a really great game lets face it most of rSilentHill says to the developers and future developers that this is what we want and that the older games are oldhat and shouldnt be consulted structurally or artistically when considering the next game. ,silenthill,d4gv5o4,1,t5_2rrim

In my opinion Diablo I is close in a sense that its halfway atmospheric halfway... not... and that varies a ton but there are some sick riffs hidden deep down in the caves mix. The composer is Matt Uelmen. I say close because they are still very different but imo the feel is there. The only real band that comes close in regards to theme songs are Portishead.

8572097,0,t1_d6d1wyo,Hello! Great question. Youre definitely thinking about the kind of things any designer should be considering so keep at it.I think you can tell a good story with just the environment and the narrative. I think in fact you could do it with just the environment design alone. If Bocklin can do it with just one picture or Holst with one piece of music surely with all the tools at our disposal we should be able to create and sustain that atmosphere? Also assuming we are actually capable of that kind of artistic creation.I have always approached my designs through their environments. I want the levels I create to evoke the atmosphere intended for the game to work with their structure texture lighting and sound to generate and sustain that atmosphere.The things you place in that level are then the finetuning and focusing devices to say exactly what it is you are trying to convey in your level or game. Whether thats something as simple as a note or an encounter with a symbolic enemy these things are your interface for conveying your message to the player.So yeah the more of these things work together to accentuate and not detract from what youre trying to say the stronger your game will be. I think SMs chase sequences were very good when viewed in the context of the message of the game and I really think we did things in SM that todays walking simulators and narrative exploration games are only now starting to catch up to.,silenthill,d6d3e61,6,t5_2rrim

It had so much potential to be greatest Silent Hill game and gradually degraded.,silenthill,d6evlx7,1,t5_2rrim
8587700,0,t1_d6coo65,. I think what youre referring to is the rough concept I had after playing SH back then college I thought maybe I should write it as a novel and see if Konami would publish it. So I continued to develop it further and further when opportunities to pitch new story concepts SH Wii Downpour BoM. I wanted a story with a bunch of younger characters probably college aged going to SH. Because when you hear the concept you think dumb slasher film and thats incongruous with SH. So itd sort of deconstruct that idea in a SH context. I spoof this in BoMs joke ending but theres still a few seeds of what I was actually trying to do with it if you really look.. This is difficult to really pin down. I have a real soft spot for SH Love Psalm right? but in a lot of ways especially having worked on the games with him it feels like a rough draft of what Yamaoka really wanted to do. SH seems to strike that balanceambient some rockinspired ambient and then the vocals. However I like the vocal songs in SH the best not counting games i worked on because those vocals often have themes close to my heart and what we were trying to do at the time so thats not fair to judge.  I guess that averages me to SH as my favorite?  Those were the  I listened to most while working on the games given how hard SH is to listen to just as a soundtrack probably not surprising. Sorry for the nonanswer.. Im proud of SHSM as a whole. I know many feel like it was just a marketing gimmick but I really like the reimagining aspect of it and how that plays with expectations. I really like what Climax was able to accomplish without combat and just having a world to explore which is now a lot more common. Im proud of many of our sidequests in Downpour. We worked with the team a ton and tried to get them to buy in on making it weird and scary and once those sidequests started going in they had really great ideas. The theater quest the gramaphone etc. Im also proud of the dynamic story notes in BoM which Twin Perfect delved into a great deal in their recent documentary. Im happy this actually worked! Though TP hated the story they said this gameplay system was the best part of the game. I spent a lot of time in the Czech Republic Downpour at night in my hotel trying to map out this system and run simulations to make sure it could work. So its good that paid off in some way.. That depends on what you mean by Konami. Konami as a corporate entity generally did not interfere with some exceptions BoMs genre shift for example. However Konami as in the department I worked in with EPs Producers like Devin etc.  we were the group making most decisions and everyones voices factor in. So even if I said This is what should happen in an SH game. This is the SH style. if others disagreed or just though itd be better to go in a different direction then that might happen. My group had a great deal of freedom really but its important to not equate that to any one person having all the power. We had a lot of discussions and a lot of decisions went my way and a lot of decisions didnt. Thats ordinary in any creative business. Then there is how much freedom our group would give to the developers  which was also generally a lot of freedom. If you want creative people to make good passionate stuff you cant just dictate every detail of their work. Even if you did they might never come around to your way of thinking and that would reflect in their work. Konami the corporate entity wanted a successful Silent Hill franchise. Konami the ontheground people wanted to make the best game possible and I personally was trying to do that in the context of the series as a whole what is appropriate what would be new and exciting etc.. We went through a lot of revisions for Downpours monsters and I think the reaction has been fair. I cant really dive into it further than that but see the previous answer for some insight.. I would like to see it really achieve the selfcontained style that the development team hinted at in some SH interviews. So each game can be its own interesting premise and doesnt need to tie in directly in a plot heavy way to the other games. There should be some overall rules and themes and subtle callbacks but each plot should be its own beast. This is what we were trying to do with Downpour and SH and SH did it basically and I personally think its the best direction for a long and healthy SH franchise. Imagine if the movies had just told their own stories in the SH world!,silenthill,d6f1uip,5,t5_2rrim

8820690,0,t1_d77g7ng,gt ...although I know that you know that so no offense to you...None taken.Thanks for actually discussing this with me rather than just telling me that I have no idea what Im talking about.gt The characters develop proper...This is probably the only thing I have to disagree with.  Naughty Dog games tend to either eliminate character development or just do it in a way thats so simple that it doesnt even seem like they learned something.Let me explainBesides being stereotypical cardboard cutouts of the usual character tropes Drake is the loud mouth protagonist Elena is the young good girl Sully is the comic relief etc. my real gripe is that none of the characters actually...change.Four games and theres absolutely no development whatsoever.  Drake stays the same and even worse learns the EXACT same thing every single bloody game only to lose that knowledge and learn it again in the next.Apparently all these adventures that these characters have had do absolutely nothing to teach them something.Let me just take a step back here and explain this a bit.  I wont use a TV Show because I feel like that may be a bit unfair a game needs to push things along but I will use Metal Gear.At the end of Metal Gear Solid  Naked Snake begins to understand two things the first is that nothing is absolute and the second is that being a government operative is making him into a pawn hes fighting for someone elses ideas not his own and its destroying him inside.  This leads directly in MGS Peace Walker which deals with him building up his own army.  The events of Peace Walker lead into MGSV which sees him continuing that expansion but also abandoning key ideas because of what was taken from him in PW Im being as vague as possible to avoid spoilers in case you play through the series.Naked Snake more commonly known as Big Boss has a clear growth in his character.  He game he is featured in makes him understand something or change and that carries over into the next game.Uncharted just kind of...keeps replaying the same situations four times over...and at the end of Uncharted  Im supposed to believe Nate is finally done because...hes doing the same thing he did at the end of every other game retiring with Elena?As for The Last of Us it rather irks me that the biggest moment in Joels character is the loss of his daughter...ten minutes into the game.And this storytelling trope FURIATES me.  I hate when any work introduces me to characters by killing someone they care for off Im always left with the same though I dont know who this person is why do I care? So when Joels daughter was killed and the writes tried to guilt me into liking Joel I think I already stated to be a bit bitter.Conversely take Booker from Bioshock Infinite. Infinite begins by introducing me to Booker and its not until an hour or so in that Anna is first mentioned.  By this time I like Booker enough that Im actually interested in who Anna is and why Booker is carrying around this guilt.  Joel?  No.  His daughters death was cheap and wouldve been better executed as an extended sequence about a hour with Sara would have been fine to get me to care or just as a flashback.In terms of Ellie her character is so overused.  Teenage who curses all the time and has an attitude? Yeah...very different.I guess ND games are objectively sound.  They dont really do anything wrong its just that what they do right is stuff that they stole...So like a  from a game standpoint I guess makes sense.  It works and it does what its supposed to.  But  while looking at ND games as a piece of creation seems incredibly forgiving.gt TLOU isnt exactly as clever or innovate or unconventional as people WANT to make it seem. Not like SH.Im probably a bit bitter that people praise ND games but if you ask those people if theyve ever played MGS or SH theyll tell you that its not a ND game so it isnt worth it that was of course a generalization.,silenthill,d784juf,1,t5_2rrim

It just had this thing where it was so weird so confusing and so scary as fuck but at the same time I was just curious and I wanted to know more and more about it. Im just too glad I finally played years ago for myself. Its a crime for any horror fan not to play that masterpiece or at least if theyre not really a fan of games that really make you think beyond the shooting and the running try it for yourself. I am so glad I did and youre right that its so memorable. Hard to believe the game is  years old...I feel old just saying that but even then it hasnt aged and never will. Its timeless. No ifs ands or buts about that. Favorite monster of that bunch was not jyst Pyramid Head but also Legs. Its so beautiful to look at. I remember being out in the street and stopping when I saw a mannequin posing like a Y shape. Then I turnedy flashlight on and it moved like it knew where I was. I couldnt even kill it because I wanted to watch it come after me. The monsters are all beautiful and Eldritch! Theyre original in every way! I cant say anything about the story thats already been said but the only thing I can say is that once you really think about it and how much depth personality care symbolism and emotion and thought was put into it youll realize why Silent Hill  is so revered. And you know you did something right when you care about a character  minutes in. I didnt even want to kill Eddie especially when you realize what he really went through.

Cheryl was the other half and Silent Hill wanted her back because Alessa was supposed to be used to birth the God of the Order. As for Heather I believe she is the reincarnation of Cheryl and Alessa after SH finishes. spoiler My explanation is not very good but Im sure theres someone out there who could expand and explain better than me.

10533425,0,t3_5qtggj,Silent Hill s sounds were more symbolic and in tune with the moments they were played in whether by sound effects or character themes. Meanwhile Silent Hill  had this cinematic feel and flow that I cant help but love. ,silenthill,dd22w3j,4,t5_2rrim

10632168,0,t1_ddboh2o,I dont even get what was so bad about that game. I cant pinpoint it. Me and my mate just couldnt play through it something about it was just so mind numbingly.... pointless. Nothing was interesting or captivating about it it felt like going through the motions more than any other game yet it didt even go through with all the motions!I hate SH but at least there is something that has me coming back to it again and again trying to get myself to finish it once. It has great things going for it but a few that I cant get around. Downpour though I dont even have any initiative to ever pick that up again.I was even thinking you talked about Homecoming at first because I forgot Downpour is a thing!,silenthill,ddcmli8,3,t5_2rrim
10634219,0,t3_5s19l6,Homecoming since I dont think it has any redeeming features or moments. At least with Downpour theres something there from a story perspective although I didnt like how the endings worked in that game. Shattered Memories I quite like to be honest since I really liked its story and its gameplay is solid but due to the all the changes it makes I dont think its a good Silent Hill game it probably would have benefited from being an original IP so it wouldnt be compared so harshly to the others.,silenthill,ddcu7c7,2,t5_2rrim
10652041,0,t1_ddd6l6o,Maybe a DLC?,silenthill,ddeocmk,2,t5_2rrim
10655206,0,t3_5s19l6,Book of Memories absolutely. Barelythere script and Diablolite gameplay that flip flops between insultingly easy and hellishly difficult. It also doesnt even look like a Silent Hill game it feels like an indie dungeon crawler that someone modded SH monsters into.,silenthill,ddf03qu,2,t5_2rrim
10686583,0,t1_ddhliyb,I knew Yamaoka did Shadows of the Damned. I remember thinking how much it didnt sound like Silent Hill but it sounded like him. I also remember it said it was him at the beginning so I was excited. I didnt know he worked for Suda full time. I love both those guys work. I also read that they basically do what they want and make up any losses by doing development for mainstream stuff. Pretty cool company. ,silenthill,ddi8ovl,5,t5_2rrim

10771974,0,t1_ddr112h,The game is predictable i knew how the game would end on its second level the apartments. It was too obvious. The characters werent engaging and i couldnt care less about them. The main character is as deep as  cutscenes where he speaks in this game making the other  of the game which is the gameplay itself voiceless. I could go on and on. Fanboys bring symbolism in this game as some sort of a selling point but that only impresses you if youve never read something serious or watched something serious.,silenthill,ddr1tbp,-1,t5_2rrim
10774281,0,t1_ddqexgv,Thats the thing about horror. The implication is mire terrifying than the real thing could ever be when presented in front of you. The fact that the devs let you piece everything together yourself means theres a lot more room to let your brain wander. They nailed that with SH  and all the symbolism throughout the game.,silenthill,ddrafb6,2,t5_2rrim

11241252,0,t3_60eclz,Ive never once understood what the problem was that people had with this game. People complained when the character was too competent at combat in HC then complained when he wasnt competent ENOUGH in DP. I thought the story was great having an actually open world SH with side quests and more to do was great I loved twist to its ending. If I had one real complaint its that the creature designs were dull but at worst thatd knock it down to  for me.,silenthill,df66h0y,6,t5_2rrim
