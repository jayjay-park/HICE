4049839,0,t3_36xgg7,So with OMalley crowded out that leaves the Democratic party with Hillary Clinton Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders as the candidates? Their base has spent the entire Obama administration deriding the GOP as the party of old white men and now thats all theyve got. Who else are they going to run? Jerry Brown?

4658193,0,t1_cthmmye,Huh. You are right. I guess Bernie should propose a hour wage but nobody would go for that.I guess hes doing what he can though! I would rather people be paid hr than hr.Another point to be made is that other candidates interns arent paid anything at all and he pays his more than most people pay their regular employees.Out of curiosity who do you support for president? Clinton? Bush? Trump?,BernieSandersSucks,cthq15b,-3,t5_383p2
4861038,0,t1_cu78lop,And that is just the beginning. How do you feel that Bernie Sandeers has committed zero of his  net worth towards his campaign? Seems he is not even confident in himself. Also a net worth of  seems pretty low for someone whose salary is  per year. I definitely wouldnt trust that guy with any sort of fiscal responsibility ,BernieSandersSucks,cu79r0p,-3,t5_383p2

5480507,0,t3_3q44u3,I think this subreddit is united in being against Sanders but thats the extent of it. There are both pro and antiClinton people here just like there are proantiTrump proantiRand Paul etc.As for the polls I post a lot of those because they counter the false Reddit narrative perpetrated by the Sanders Cult that Hillary is behind Bernie in the polls and Bernie is just like Obama in  and other such fairy tales.,BernieSandersSucks,cwc6pkz,1,t5_383p2

6851492,0,t1_d0sthye,But thats the thing you didnt refute my point at all. Your source is a webpage that mentions hitler rejecting one single aspect of marxism that does not refute anything at all. Not only is it one thing but hitlers view on it was through a racist version of it in itself not a complete rejection. That is why I asked for you yourself to articulate in your own words how Hitlers Nazism wasnt derived from marxism when it was originally called the NaziSocialist Party. You are trying to argue that he picked that name out of a hat whether you get that or not. I also only mentioned about debating policy instead since we can directly engage each other in a discussion that wont revolve around sources since Id rather debate you personally than wikipedia.,BernieSandersSucks,d0sxaiv,1,t5_383p2

6927355,0,t1_d11fa14,I never understood that. Ive got some decent student loans Ill be paying off for the next decade or so but Ive accepted that they are my loans. I chose to go to college. I chose to be unprepared and switch my major twice essentially wasting two years of my TOPS scholarship. That is all on my head.I mean yeah college is fucking expensive and we need to do something about it but saying college should be free and all of our student loans should be forgiven is fucking insane.
