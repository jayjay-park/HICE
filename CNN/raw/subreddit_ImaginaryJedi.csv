5206818,0,t1_cvdgl0v,Let me rephrase it. Power weapons can cut through most things like hot knives through butter and they have a hard time with power armor but they can still cut through it..

10210756,0,t1_dc18259,I think it was a huge mistake for her to be put in that situation. She should have been the onw in the shock baton fight with Finn and be done with it. It being a standard Riot Stormtrooper was a huge mistake. She woops his but in combat then goes down but is only wounded or knocked unconcious. Then she is still a badasss but they dont need to put the part in Starkiller base in.HOWEVER it would have been stupod for her to fight in that situation. One one one up close a Wookie will just rip the arm off most men. Then you also have a galaxy renowned smuggler that can likely go toe to toe with you in a gun fight and a trained soldier. If she fought she woukd have instantly diedFurthermore you need to understand that from her perspective which is somewhat elucidated in the movie she believes that there is no way they will not fail anyways. She believes even after being given the codes they will swiftly be rounded up by soldiers as it is a small ragtag team against a huge military base a general and a very strong dark force user.,ImaginaryJedi,dc1g382,5,t5_2ye51
