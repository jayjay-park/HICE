3686209,0,t3_32czpr,I think everyones responses are spot on. For me when I felt hurt I responded back with even more anger and hate because I felt attacked and wanted to make my foster parent feel as bad as they made me feel. I also wanted to prevent myself from getting hurt again so in my mind pushing the adult away would make it so they couldnt hurt me.You werent out of line at all I just worded the above that way because thats how I felt as a child. Its normal that he cant put his feelings into words so hopefully our input helps.,fosterit,cqcgaos,1,t5_2s3si

5070155,0,t3_3kew2a,I cant speak for all areas but for us it was MUCH easier to get licensed through a contracted agency instead of the state. We contacted the state for almost a year trying to get info and finally being told we were in line and would be notified of class signups only to be told we would have to wait because they were prioritizing those accepting older kids. That in its self was understandable. We then contacted a contracted agency who got us right in for classes which was combined with the state classes. Any way thats my  cents. ,fosterit,cux58l2,3,t5_2s3si

5654311,0,t3_3scn7k,Most youth in foster care do not neee adoptive homes. Most kids in care have parents who want to care for them and may be able to with time and support. Or if not they likely have other biological family or fictive kin resources who can care for them. Or perhaps if none of that works out they have loving foster families who can become loving adoptive parents. But the majority of kids in care are not loose untethered orphans who need random people to come in and adopt them. What kids in care need are people who can commit to providing stability in their lives even if that is not as an adoptive home. So few people seem to understand or care about that reality. And it frustrates me that memes like this perpetuate the misunderstanding of what foster care is or what it is for. For context I am a foster parent btw. I would be thrilled beyond belief to adopt the children currently in my care. But they have a family who loves them and they may not need that from us in the end. ,fosterit,cwxz0pn,6,t5_2s3si
5704663,0,t3_3t5573,Its okay to be a little sad for yourself too. You want to meet her needs all the way but as you say you arent her family so you never can. You are doing as much as you can but youll never be the love she wanted from her bio family.

5867508,0,t3_3trgre,When you get a newborn from the hospital especially if addicted to drugs or with FASD then they will usually have an extended stay in a hospital. If your foster agency is on the ball you should get at least a week heads up that this is happening. This should be enough time to get the stuff you need.   If you are fostering toddlers usually you have less time. However only those doing emergency receiving really need to have a stash of fostering stuff. We do emergency receiving and have a room half full of containers with different sized clothing and two cribs and two toddler beds and extra blankets.    We get most of our toys beds and stuff from friends and family. They know we foster and give us stuff once they are finished using it.    Welcome to fostering and good luck with your first placement. ,fosterit,cxorey8,3,t5_2s3si
5999825,0,t1_cwvr5ix,No shes correct. I cant speak for the entire U.S. but thats the case for here in Kansas. Im not a foster parent yet but I am a CASA volunteer. Ive had  cases in my  years as CASA and  of those have given the parents an appropriate amount of time to get their act together about m to a year they didnt so they terminated rights and moved the case to adoption. Both of those were under age  at the time they were first removed from the home and m yrs by the time they were adopted. My other child was successfully reintegrated into his home  The overall goal is to not drag these children through the mud. They need to find permanent homes as soon as possible for the best possible outcome. ,fosterit,cy63vyt,1,t5_2s3si

8216621,0,t3_4rw92c,Where do you live? In Alabama the requirements are pretty simple. Every child has to have their own bed. I dont know what the financial requirements are they cant be that bad though. The state also provides daycare payments to certain eligible daycares for foster parents that with full time.

8398725,0,t1_d5r6ag7,Our first was very difficult. We had her only a short time but the only relative who could take her had decided she could not keep her in her home. We had just enough time to get attached before that family member reversed her decision.Almost three years now with two adopted kiddos and several other placements and still think about her. Will definitely be praying for you.But try to think of this It would be easiest to not get attached. But that would be horrible for the child. We get attached because we love these kids because they need it. And we bear that because were the adults who chose it and theyre just thrown into all this.,fosterit,d5rdy5g,11,t5_2s3si

8500548,0,t3_4sg3p0,Have you had kids before? In many ways I think that what youre doing might be the most profound gesture of many of these kids lives.  Even though Im LGBT  many of these kids have not had great male role models in their life and could use mentorship from one. There are silent red flags with single men adopting foster children. Im not putting you into that box  but Im sure everyone knows the elephant in the room.  ,fosterit,d644d55,1,t5_2s3si
8514211,0,t1_d5e7qzi,Wow. This is why biological kids and foster kids will always be treated differently. Also birth order is crap. When I entered foster care nobody cared about my birth order. And younger kids act out too. Bios also act out. Thank you for messing up older kids placements. And funny how foster parents would do anything for their own blood. Including going out of birth order.,fosterit,d65u28a,3,t5_2s3si
8545561,0,t3_4wrg1c,I suppose Im just thinking about the possible future if we end up keeping him. Howwhen to tell them.

9768816,0,t3_5ejqke,It seems to be a mixed bag for us. We have one worker who never fails to speak to us in ways that are really offensive. Its gotten so bad that my husband is no longer on board with fostering so our current placement will likely be our last. I really resent her for that. I enjoy being a resource for these kids but my husband and I agreed if one of us ever got too stressed by it all the other would respect that choice and be done. So thanks to one incredibly rude awful social worker my husband is over it. The rest of our team is nice though. Not fast. Way overworked. But nice. They all seem to be rooting for us to get to adopt since our foster daughters parents are both in prison and extended family isnt interested. Its nice to see that our deep love for this baby is acknowledged by most. Like our house isnt always immaculate but whenever they come they see how utterly devoted to our foster daughter we are. They like how much work Ive put into her life book and how I do little crafts for her family with her handprints or they see how we readsing to her and play with her. In contrast when this one social worker comes all she can do is make snide comments about our laundry basket having dirty clothes in it or how our home is organized. But yeah it gets much easier when you just focus on the babychild and meeting hisher needs and stop expecting things from social workers. At first I was all gung ho to be part of the team  now I dont really care what theyre doing. They wont involve me or keep me in the loop anyway. I just focus on loving my foster baby and being her mamma. If the workers come they come. If they dont I just keep doing my thing. Eventually some judge will decide her fate but I suspect that wont happen for a very long time.,fosterit,dah81js,3,t5_2s3si

11414722,0,t3_606yzn,I would like a update on your situation.  What did you decide.Actually I am grateful you made this post because I read everyones response and it made me feel a LOT better about my experiences as a Foster parent.  Kids are like a box of chocolate.  No two kids are alike.  We have had kids I wanted out the moment they arrived.  The incredible amount of guilt and shame it was overwhelming.  But you know what?  I made the call and explained exactly why those kids were not a good fit.  And guess what?  They kept calling with more kids.  Some of these kids are SO messed up I think only a saint could take care of them.  And by saint I mean someone who does not exist in reality.Have you ever had a kid attempt to molest you?  Have you ever had a kid tell a dirty lie about you in a report causing you to get interviewed?  Have you ever had a kid punch you?  I have experienced all of these things and so much more.But the system as flawed as it was accepted my weaknesses and worked with us.  We found some amazing kids we could handle.  We  still consider ourselves noobs at this whole parenting thing.  But I can say honestly there are kids out there that will fit for you.  In my state over  kids go into Foster care per day.  Even when I make mistakes I am giving those kids love and advantages they may only get once in their entire lives.  Oh I agree with you the Foster care system sucks.  I bet a lot of people are not aware that For Profit foster care exists now where private companies are given foster kids instead of loving foster parents.  And boy have I made some mistakes.But when you see a child who had no idea how to play or walk and you give them those gifts.  Then you have changed a life.  I do this as a form of service form of penance and a form of life fulfilling selfish endeavor.  I get so much out of it.  I constantly tell people I am no saint for doing this I get exactly as much back as I put in.But yes I have failed many times and my advice is this particular child may not be right for you.  Give it back take some time off.  If you change your mind take another shot.  If its not the child then give another age range a shot.  So many good kids out there are over  years old with  hope of ever getting adopted.  ,fosterit,dfpuiq7,3,t5_2s3si
