8022739,0,t3_4p1lnq,In my experience its all about getting lots of damage fast. I spawn the knights the giants and the slingers then clear the board with area attacks like rocket man fire ogre or fire wizard then buff my units with the priest once they are close to the enemy building. Bow master and monster hunter certainly help deal a load of damage as well.

10768764,0,t3_5tvt5t,Is it going to show massive rewards?  No.  Is it worthwhile if you are going to play this for a long time?  Yes.  I calculated at one point that it was roughly going to take  hours for a level to pay for itself cost to levelincrease in goldhr .  You can figure out how much time your phone spends with this game up a day and figure out how many days of play that is.  Since I leave mine idle or playing nearly the entire day  hours is about a week of play.  The only other consideration is how much gold now is worth compared to gold later.  Unfortunately workers dont scale well so the upfront gold early game is worth rather substantially more than late game.  However early game is considerably easier than late game so you need less gold then.In short Id say its mostly up to you and how much you think youll put into the game.  Id generally say its a rather substantial investment that is questionable in its worth but does become an income stream and effectively pays itself off.,GrowCastle,ddqpv8q,1,t5_3ey9r

11469778,0,t1_dfv9xq3,OK it works like this when you first start playing the game and you lvl up you get those Skill Points when you reach lvl  you will have maxed out all of those skill points areas one of those skills gives you  damage So lets say you click on your Paladins and they are lvl  and you see that they are  damage well in reality that  has already factored in that  Skill bonus if you never used those skill points to upgrade that skill then the damage your Paladins did would only be  Those bonuses gain by using your skill points are considered Passive bonuses So since they are passive and automatically are added in your Base Damage is still  but it will show as  even if you have no treasures or equipment on them because the passive bonus is not yours forever and so it will always already be factored in to the damage number you see displayed So it will display your Paladins damage as  raising them in lvl will of course raise that damage lvl and adding equipment that has a straight damage number or a damage will also raise that number BUT since your TRUE base damage is still  with no bonuses of any kind being applied the skull ring with its  damage bonus to summoned units it will give you a bonus based off of your Paladins base damage without any bonuses at all so at lvl  and your unboosted base damage is  that skull ring will add  damage because that would be  of  NOW lets say your paladins are lvl  and it is showing your damage as  no equipment on them well that would mean that with no bonuses of any kind your True base damage is  then when you factor in the  skill bonus it becomes  because  of  is  and     so the Skull Ring with its  damage bonus to summoned units would be  of  your true damage rate and  of  is  so it would be     damage.if you have a weapon that gives you  damage and a secondary item that also gives  damage then those too are based off of your True Damage which would be    so with the skull ring and those   items on your Paladins their damage would be .All bonuses are going to be based off of your True Base Damage so take off all equipment and take off any treasures that add a damage bonus then look at what damage your Paladins do then subtract that number by  and that will give you their True damage rate so any items or treasures you add will be  of that True Base damage number the  damage the Paladins do as their special kind of attack that is not based off of your True Damage that  is based off of what even number you see next to their name so if with treasures and equipment it is saying your paladins do  damage per hit their bonus will give you k X  for a total of k per hit.Sorry this was really wordy but I wanted to make things as clear as possible for you to have a clear understanding of how it works.,GrowCastle,dfw3dp5,1,t5_3ey9r
