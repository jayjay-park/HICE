5913909,0,t3_3wb2bq,Hi! I am  years and currently  weeks pregnant. I am hoping for a VBAC in April. My first is  months old. I had a CS for failure to progress and dilate. My daughter was lbs and posterior so Im sure that contributed. I have been told that if I have another big baby they recommend another CS. I had a bad CS experience felt too much and would definitely want the opportunity for a TOLAC. My husband isnt as supportive because of the rupture risk. I am also a registered nurse but my specialty isnt OB. Hope to see success stories and hear about others experiences!!  ,vbac,cxuugo0,3,t5_379x7

Even though baby  isnt on the cards for us until next year at least I often think about how I would be if I couldnt have a vbac  especially as we wont be having anymore children. Its nice to see that some professionals are thinking about support for women who dont get a wishedfor vbac.,vbac,dfszety,2,t5_379x7
