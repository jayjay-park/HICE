6481288,0,t1_czpmk71,Now this is strange because you have the same setup as me and you dont have the problem. I had to upgrade too and Im on the latest version. I get the same problem if I use the HDHomeRun app or the Live Channels. Are you using a Shield TV by any chance?,nvidiashield,czppovm,1,t5_2vz9q
