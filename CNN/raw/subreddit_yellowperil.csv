Japanese in the s to be perfectly honest. Bonus points for mixing politics with chauvinism and a lopsided understanding of history.,yellowperil,chtwwez,0,t5_31vyi
1225288,0,t1_ci7df30,gtAmericans actually produce the most COI assume you are not making a strawman argument and just noting the tendencies of redditors.  Im not aware of what redditors tend to think about.  Americans talk all the time about their percapita co and most recognize that a large part of Chinas production of export goods accounts for its CO.gtThe criticism isnt without warrant but its often racially charged as seeing other ethnicities Dont know about that.  Also I think there is a difference between criticizing Chinese culture and society and making racist comments.gtIm sure its a nice place to live but marijuana is not remotely legal on any sense or level there nationwide. Cannabis legalization is synonymous with reddit and somehow they just gloss over that and never talk about it.I have no idea about what direction this is going in.,yellowperil,ci7goll,2,t5_31vyi

4292386,0,t3_3a4ti5,... and not because everyone is required to submit all their research in English in order to get noticed and learn to read highly technical English in order to be wellread in their field. Its just pure coincidence that nearly every top ranking university is in the anglosphere I guess. Just by pure chance the list of great world universities matches up with the list of places where English is prominent and relatively easily learned. ,yellowperil,cs9h1ul,4,t5_31vyi

5793838,0,t3_3ufnut,The annoying thing is that anyone speaking up is immediately downvoted. Minorities arent allowed to be offended when jokes are made at their expense.This just means everyone should speak up more.,yellowperil,cxfa3v5,2,t5_31vyi
6186469,0,t3_409myw,To be fair you have totally ignored the context of the post you linked.  The parent comment  is clearly referring to a series of events in South Park and uTemujinRi was imitating the character that is the owner of City Wok.  No need to watch the clips Ive linked either you can read the plot synopsis at  if you want the background info.If this sub is really about discussing racism and bias in the media you should keep in mind the original source media here is a few episodes of a show that is meant to be controversial.  ,yellowperil,cysu503,0,t5_31vyi
