7284459,0,t3_4f40tv,I agree if its anything close to the rumors Luigis Mansion  and plenty of other games will look fantastic.Id really like to see a focus on lighting for the game and some particlesmoke effects for the ghosts. Make mirrors in the mansion actually reflective from all angles see windows rattle with the wind etc?Im really the most interested in LMs mechanics though. With the success of Splatoon I could see them delving into shooter mechanics a little more for the vacuum and stuff. Pair that with some beautiful new effects and the results should be very interesting ,Nintendo_NX,d267054,1,t5_37fo5

8679295,0,t1_d6iavzi,gt When a company makes something great people will pay the asking price. Whats laughable is the fact that you think its going to be  or less.Completely missed the point there. He was referring to the fact that the hardware inside the PS isnt near the asking price you know the manufacturing costs.  This is completely irrelevant to whether people think its quality or not. ,Nintendo_NX,d6qjalj,1,t5_37fo5

8818179,0,t3_50xvam,Really cool man nice work.Personally Id like a bigger analog stick like the xboxps sticks but i totally get why your style is more likely and probably much better for portability.

8964263,0,t3_531x3z,Would be amazing to experience this sensation since SNES or N. But I dont think theyre doing this way nowadays. Circuit board size implementation has reduced since snes epoque GBA nds DS... About security measures they can keep trying and surely will use a . anticopy system. But as everything is a question of time to get rid off it. What I really wish for Nintendo NX is to give me brand new game experiences,Nintendo_NX,d7pdb8n,0,t5_37fo5
