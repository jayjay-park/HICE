Next thing I know I pull an Epic Ric Flair Not useful but Hey its Epic for what that counts. Gives me a wider range to hit for an Epic Pro.Only thing I suggest is if you do take a break do it after PCC.

2839756,0,t3_2smljo,Download immortals  I am on the verge of hanging this game up too.  Not that I dont like it but for the simple fact its getting a bit ridiculous at this point with these events.  In the very near future the gap is going to be so wide between the players just coming into survivor to those who have gotten all the RTG Pros because of how good their decks are.The problem is that people who flew into SV got multiple KoTR wins now have a ton of SV Pros.   When the new tiers hit I was in the SV KoTR but my legendary pros were nothing to be desired.  I went through a stint of  diva pairs in a row with  or  of them being duplicates.  I would not mind but a week after when I got  SV pros I was getting beat up pretty bad by the MB in KoTR and I do not have many more SV pros at this time.  I do however have  SV singles because that is just my luck and good ones at that Rock SC HBK Brie AJ but not much luck with pros.I cannot believe that after going from Common to Legendary in  matches and NOT LOSING A SINGLE MATCH I hit this incredible fing wall at Fandango to where I have to go from s to s.  Make no sense and shows me that they do not know what they are doing from a programming perspective.I know people are bitching and moaning but the simple fact of the matter is the game was so much better when you got a pair for winning KoTR.  Since that...the SV Tier has made old PCC cards useless nerfing the rewards and all these RTGs that were easy for the high decks are ruining the game.  RTG Sting you say.....fultk me if it wasnt for so many of us getting that card we would really be screwed.  That RTG Sting is the least of this games problems. ,wwesupercard,cnqvkg2,13,t5_331fs

Youre going to roll a  at least  of the time. If you rolled it  times in a row just because you roll a  the first go its still  chance for the other  goes meaning that its still quite likely that youd roll a  every time.

4316948,0,t3_3aek24,Ive long believed that real tag teams should get an additional bonus when paired together. Like for the most part Jimmy and Jey probably arent going to appear in a lot of Exhibition decks because theyre low rated cards. But if you combined them got their arrow bonus  and then another tag bonus on top of that I dunno another ?. ? something? youd see them used a lot more often. I realize that it would lead to arguments about whether something was really a team or not. But Im all for anything that encourages people to seek train and most importantly USE all the cards that the game has to offer. At my current level in Exhibition every round is basically two of the four Fusion superstar cards and then the Rock or HBK. Itd be cool to see other cards but thats only going to happen if the game gives incentives for players to do so. ,wwesupercard,csc8x1i,1,t5_331fs

There is something called a fusion chamber in which you feed useless cards for better ones until you progressively get better and better fusion cards up to ultimate.You should save this card for the last fusion which wont come for a while but thats all you can do. This card is useless but all is not lost.,wwesupercard,dgvq91r,5,t5_331fs
