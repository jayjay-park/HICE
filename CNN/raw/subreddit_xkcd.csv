37875,0,t3_1uilzx,I wanted to do something similar basically regular expressions on trees.Like regular tree here forgot a lot about it tho for use on websites.Manually creating regular treeexpressions for that would take more work than youd want. The idea would be to select while browsing somehow. Using for instance user scripts alternative scriptish Not entirely clear how to do that but one way would be to do this golf thing where you basically click some stuff the matches should containas separate entities and some stuff it shouldnt.Once you had entities clicks could find stuff relative to entities which could basically be the data you wanted to extract.first checking if the regular tree actually matches more cases Of course the whole thing is fragile to changes of the website oddball cases.

245988,1,t3_1wvaiw,Kinda.But theres a problem with this approach. It relies on the same type of instinctual reaction to a persons concern that is lacking in the first parties reaction to others.If a person reacts that way to rejection theyre falling into the trap of not treating people with dignity as some misplaced reaction to their own lack of insight. What they are supposed to do is to genuinely listen to and understand people on their own terms. Thats how they get out of the trap.The kicker is that they also need to be treated that way their feelings need to be addressed honestly and with respect not just immediately disregarded as illegitimate. People not treating their others with respect is not solved by treating those people with the same lack of respect. The cycle must be broken.,xkcd,cf68zei,2,t5_2qh0z

612263,0,t1_cg8b508,gtDoes the electrolytic fluid thatas I understand it exists between the neurons build and retain an electron charge after excessive or continuous use?...Short answer NoThe movement of charge is across membranes usually within only the neuron that is firing. Maybe localized to the abuttingcontacting glia. Channels open and close that allow sodium potassium calcium magnesium and sometimes chloride ions to cross the membranes along the electrochemical gradients that have been established by active ion pumps. Each cells is constantly resetting the transmembrane electrochemical potential. The movement of electrical charge over space is a bit of a misnomer. Its adjacent voltage gated channels opening and then closing with a bit of a refractory period that allows for coherent waves of depolarization to flow along neuronal cell bodies.The whole neurons as wires concept needs to be dropped. Theyre more transducers and small computational units. Chemical input gt integration at somagt action potentials that vary in frequency and amplitutde gt chemical release at synapse. This is combined with alterations in cellular homeostasis in each neuron and the surrounding glia that may include regulation at the level of protein localization expression gene regulation and even long term epigenetic changes.,xkcd,cg9v72o,4,t5_2qh0z

Here a page from NASA calculating the temperature of a flat plate AU from the sun. It arrives at a steadystate temperature of K not high enough to char a body. That figure is actually a very high estimate because a flat plate pointed at the sun is a worstcase scenario and he forgot to include the other side of the plate.As a sanity check lets consider an object orbiting AU from the sun whose energy balance is dominated by radiative transfer. The earth averages about K though its getting warmer not near hot enough to char a human body.

Selfidentified East Asian nationalities correlated with genetic clustering consistent with extensive endogamy...etc.  The point isnt just that race can be defined scientifically in a consistent manner and that it is a useful metric for expressing genotypic variance but that even more surprisingly it corresponds so well with selfreported raceethnicity.Unfortunately you cant cite Wikipedia in response to this because the whole racegenetics discussion has been hijacked by those in the social sciences who tend to be the ones editing the Wikipedia articles and theyre not neutral and comprehensive.

9508410,0,t1_d9kpphu,Actually the case is a little more interesting than that. Android does come with a web browser called Browser that is part of AOSP the open source part of Android. The rendering itself is done by a WebView based on Chromium. Many OEMs have enhanced this so many devices like those from Samsung and LG include custom browsers.Now if you want to bundle Google Services with Android Google stipulates a base set of required apps Google Chrome among them. This is where things get interesting. On Android not only does Google Chrome not replace the WebView it doesnt even use it. Androids WebView is actually completely separate and is updated frequently through the Play Store. Chrome however is a standalone app that bundles its own engine. On Android you are perfectly free to do this which is why for example Firefox has an Android port complete with their own rendering engine and it is distributed via the Play Store just like any other app.On iOS though the story is entirely different. The WebView is Safari and any browser on the App Store must use it to display web pages. Google Chrome on iOS gets you the UI and bookmarks etc. but its still Safari displaying the web pages.,xkcd,d9l4421,2,t5_2qh0z

11406147,0,t3_62l9us,This seems to have caused a mild controversy over what being a colour actually means in the comments. Broadly speaking we can think of three scenariosAir in a room  colourless This is why kids ask why the sky is blue imho not because they dont think air cant have a colour but because they think they know air doesnt have a colour.Sky  blue. Composed of air so air must be blue.Sunset  orangered. Also composed of air and in fact even more air than the sky in a way of thinking. Yes its about angles etc.So there are three paradigms in which air appears colourless blue and orangered. In increasing order of how much air there actually is. The issue now becomes do we claim air is blue in which case we claim that the colourless case just doesnt have enough air to see the very pale blue? What about when its red? Or do we just explain the mechanism which gets rid of all the silly linguistic confusion and is probably simpler in the first place? Why is the sky blue? Rayleigh Scattering Whats that?
