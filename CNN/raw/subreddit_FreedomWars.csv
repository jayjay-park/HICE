2287562,0,t1_cltsojz,Also if you dont like those games you might enjoy Freedom Wars. Thats how it is for me at least. Its just more engaging with a style of gameplay that appeals to me a lot more. The setting in general is a huge draw for me too and the reason I was intrigued by it in the first place.,FreedomWars,clugjqk,2,t5_31d3z

2301080,0,t1_clvtzf6,Theres actually a formula for this. The category doesnt matter but the rarity and quantity do. To determine what rarity level will be produced you take the number of each rarity used multiplied by the rarity itself. The group that has the highest result determines what is made. For example lets say you used  x Rarity  material A  x Rarity  material B  x Rarity  material C  x Rarity  material Dyou would have  x R  x R  x R. The R group has a total of     . The R group has     . The R group has     . Since the R group has the highest value you make that level of items. If you were to switch out  R for  R the R total would be  and the R total would be  making the result be the R level. To make  items you need the highest category to be at least R I believe. So you could do something like  x R  x R. ,FreedomWars,clw4ow1,3,t5_31d3z

2814551,0,t1_cnnt69x,In Freedom Wars just about every weapon is viable as long as you keep up on upgrades. However some weapons are better left to your Accessory thanks to their benefit of unlimited ammunition. Namely rocket launchers and the sniper rifle.For the first few CODE levels try to pick up every weapon you can and get the highest early game power possible and dont hesitate to trade up constantly. Later on around CODE  youll be able to focus on getting weapons with more comfort and permanence since you can manufacture and upgrade them more easily around this time.Consider jumping online for CODE  as thats when your AI allies will begin to really taper off in their usefulness no matter how much you upgrade their equipment. After completing a mission online youll be able to use a free pass on the single player version of that mission and get through the story easier while also getting materials faster and more often!. ,FreedomWars,cno095r,2,t5_31d3z

2996416,0,t3_2uhmv0,Dont give up TC I failed on my first try too because I didnt kill the chains and then my battlefield became a hot mess. ltIf you want to save time do  and  online you can even just create a private room and solo and get the passes which allow you to skip those two missions and go straight to the final boss. Ive hit  years and Ive got a huge number of people in my rap sheet list thatve done it cos most of us have been playing since day  probably and basically you get a swimsuit and accessory costume your accessory gets sinner costume some accessories most notably Simeons scarf rushed to  for this!! and Abels featherhipdecoration and anklet. You get declared a secondclass citizen but because there isnt a free slot in the citizen area for you youre stuck in that white cell until someone dies MUAHAHAHA I mean. cough You also get SecondClass Citizen code names which include your fellow NPC sinners code names eg. Wolf Sakamoto and some new poses. Finally you get to run around without numbers over your head while newbs stare at you in awe.Well basically theres not much at  years waiting for you. And I love God Eater too and yes the story in this game is even more barebones than the first half of GEB so I understand why this game would feel shabby to you. Ive stuck with this game purely because combat is fun and I enjoy online. Also I need something to tide me over before MHU. Hope GERB will get localised D,FreedomWars,co8kr17,2,t5_31d3z
3232174,0,t3_2x53zw,Dampers are from the legs. Since its a Ttype lower its the one that looks like a Ramosa if I remember correctly you would have to attack the back legs.
