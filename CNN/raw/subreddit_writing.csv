And fanfic feels like that to me that these characters are only fully known and understood by their original creator and it just seems...dirty and artificial and wrong for some internet pretender to start yanking them about like puppets which is what I find so terrifying about the prospect of someone doing that to my characters  theyre closer to me than anyone else in many ways theyre strange facets of my own personality and I dont want anyone else suddenly claiming to control them... which yes is probably a terrible failing of being too close to my characters since I think this feeling only relates to my novel characters short stories I dont have that deep attachment...

68598,0,t3_1uvhfz,Having studied screenwriting and previously written a screenplay I can make a few comments.First get proper screenwriting software such as Final Draft or similar so long as it can export in Final Draft format. It handles all of the formatting for you and you dont need to worry about it.Second learn about screenwriting. Many people try to write screenplays and go into elaborate descriptions about setting costumes camera angle and so on. Thats wrong for a couple of reasons. First the director costumers and camera people are going to make those decisions and if you the screenwriter insert that into your screenplay it marks you as an amateur and your screenplay will get ignored.The second problem is more subtle and relates to the formatting. A screen play is generally  pages plus or minus about  or  pages. If you stick to the formatting the reader can count the pages and know how long the movie will be roughly a minute per page and thats a huge indicator as to cost. Thats why your brilliant  page screenplay will be ignored  its too expensive. Thats also why your  page brilliant screenplay can be ignored you didnt follow the formatting and again youre pegged as an amateur. If youre really really lucky you can get a reader for a screenplay but once they see the formatting is wrong they can mark it as such and get paid as if theyve already read it.However if youve put in a bunch of florid description that doesnt impact screen time and uselessly pads the screenplay with information the director already doesnt want. In other words not only does professional screenwriting software make it easier to write the screenplay it also means you wont get it tossed because your margins are wrong.As for how easy it is to write them I find it easier. Youre now focusing on dialogue and plot. The beautiful imagery you have in your head? Keep it there because its not wanted. That means you dont have to spend a lot of time and energy writing the sun settled down for the night across the water as the incoming tide kissed the delicate remains of his torso. yeah that was crap but its what came into my head. You just write The sun sets. There is a body at the shoreline. In fact you would only write the sun sets if its important to the plot. Instead you put all of your creative energy into the dialogue and plot.That being said you need to plan them out perhaps more carefully than a novel. Every scene must have some conflict and every scene must push forward the plot. And then you have the  guideline that puts even more structure on it. You can be much more free with a novel but I found that the creative constraints pushed me further.,writing,cem8mdw,2,t5_2qh2n

Currently Im working at a job that lets me use headphones as long as I only cover one ear and it doesnt get in the way and I can get a lot more books read in a month if most of my  hour shift involves listening to them!I currently recommend the Iron Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearne and read by Luke Daniels.

103824,0,t1_ceq77ng,What do you mean if they stood out from the narrative?I feel like while these could be the characters inner thoughts to me it feels more like the author telling me how to feel rather than the character. Admittedly I am a lot more forgiving of that sort of thing if it is in character even if they seem a bit unlikeable but even in this example I dont think it sounds like something anyone would really say. Maybe something likeBarnaby sat at the barstool drinking alone. He watched Sally from afar as she moved to set the clean the tables and felt that familiar twang in his heart. He leaned back and sighed. God she was still so beautiful. While the bar was still crowded in the evening it felt like him and her were the only ones there. Barnaby looked down at his halfempty glass and saw his exhausted face reflected in his brandy.  It seemed like nothing ever went right for him these days. Why did she have to be so cold? He saw no reason why she shouldnt like him. He didnt think he was a particularly cruel or even unattractive man so why wouldnt she give him a chance? Was she just scared of love or something? If only he could get her attention. If only she would just talk to him he knew he could make her love him...While I still dont think this is good and this character still is kind of an ass it feels at least a little less blatant and his feelings are at least worked into the narrative rather than just putting them on a grocery list. I think having the character say it rather than the author leaves more room for the reader to draw their own conclusions about the character instead of feeling like the author is trying lawyer for the character. I think that small details like that can at least make the character relatable if the character themselves isnt that likeable. Does that make sense? ,writing,ceq92m8,2,t5_2qh2n
105398,0,t3_1v8h0b,I have so many rolling around in my head right now but my most important one is a highfantasy set in a sesc period and involves four separate groups of characters an orc adventure with a drug addiction and a human woman who was formerly in an orc mafias harem the head of that orc mafia and his right hand woman a middle aged human adventure and the elderly swordsman who teaches him hes not as experiences as he thinks and enigmatic whitehaired man who seems to be working the whole city. The groups at first seem unconnected but plot lines merge together over time. At the moment I plan to make it a webnovel. The working title is Clockwork Bullet.The second story that I really want to figure out but keep running drawing a blank for begins in Japan in the s near the fall of the Samurai era and tells the story of a Shinobi who dishonors a Samurai. Unbeknownst to the two they both escape to industrialage London and the assassin takes a job as a bodyguard to a businessmans family and the Samurai becomes a swordforhire and is paid to kill the aforementioned businessman.

ContentI like that you begin with action but I think there are two main issues right now The action isnt entirely inscene. A lot of it is summarized and its not entirely clear how your narratorprotagonist knows this information. You are throwing a lot of information at your reader that isnt fully explained. Who is they? What secret is being kept? What kind of world is this in there is a contrast between reigning in a tower and gas masks? What is a boger? What is a Wanderer? What is The Camp? Etc. A little mystery is good but at this stage it seems like there is nothing familiar for the reader to hold onto. I can see that you have a very interesting world but you may need to introduce the major concepts a bit more slowly.Overall I think you could expand those two paragraphs into an entire first chapter that would be much more effective. Drive up the tension by showing us your protagonist trapped in the tower listening to the screams of hisher friends knowing that these people are coming for himher but unable to escape.

118285,0,t3_1vfm36,I have a nice little mixed bag of mental nonsense going on. Some of it helps some of it doesnt. For example my way of seeing the world is partly attributable to Schizotypal Personality Disorder. Magical thinking and the occasional hallucination can be quite useful in my line of work. The hyperfocus element of ADD is quite handy when I have a deadline to meet. However the things that dont help... really dont help. I could be productive in a more measured more normal way if it werent for the ADD. I wouldnt have had to spend years trying to figure out what counts as appropriate emotional reaction if it werent for StPD. Without depression I wouldnt have this constant fear that tells me that everything is pointless and stupid and frequently prompts selfdestructive behaviour. Maybe if I were neurotypical writing would have been one of a range of career options rather than something I rely on because Ive never fared well as an employee. Whether it augments my creativity I dont know. I really dont. I often wonder what my work would be like and whether it would exist if I didnt have all the mental nonsense. What I do know is that it doesnt work the way it does in popular culture where the writers depicted are usually pretty functional with just enough selfdestruction to spice them up a bit.

Ill be sure to message you.I was editing last night after taking a few hours away from the piece and made a few notes. One of them you highlighted at the start was how the opening didnt flow well. The funny thing is that I was in a meeting the day I started writing this that mirrored the opening situation. Poor audio and clear video as they were using two different systems conference call and video presentation and one was obviously poorer quality than the other. Ill work on describing the room and setting up the meeting better.As for Bradley and the Nathan request Ill clean up that dialog but there is something there to what Nathan said. He has some insight as to why Bradley needs to be there but I cant give that away just yet.My grammar is by far my weak point and something I continue to work on. If I ever get this piece far enough to publish professionally I plan to pay an editor andor proofreader to help clean it up.As for Interstitialist it isnt an official word but we did have people at a few of my former companies with that title. They were the people who filled in the gaps and did all of the things no one else wanted to. They filled the gap the interstitial gaps between other jobs to keep the companies running.

136081,0,t1_cetonmj,I love Scrivener but I do feel the need to mention a caveat Scrivener isnt just a rich text editor. If you treat it as such youll find it underwhelming and probably about as distracting as Word except in different ways.Scrivener is an organizational tool and if you can make use of some of the tools and somehow integrate them into your workflow then it becomes useful if it doesnt fit into your workflow or you dont try to use its noneditor tools theres probably better for you. Those tools are kind of like keeping a notebook to jot down ideas during the day or installing Evernote on your phone for the same purposeif you never stop to notice and then jot down those ideas what use is having it?I think this also covers the why is Scrivener better than Word? bit the OP was asking for in a nutshell organizational tools. In more detail it gives you a nice structured view of your story when you organize by part chapter scene etc. it lets you take notes and attach random files like images or PDF files for your research and random ideas it has a programwide scratchpad for random ideas not related to any project it lets you set up templates for any of the documents so if you always do character sketches a certain way for example it lets you set up your print options separately from your display options so suppose you want to edit at .x line leading but want doublespaced printouts for editing...Of course you should customize things when it saves you effort not do it all at the beginning the way you think youll use the tools and then never use the tools.

150369,0,t3_1vt683,Ill echo the others write another. As a self published author thats the best that you can do. The more you publish the more often you show up in the New Releases lists and the more exposure you get. The larger your backlist is the more likely you are to be stumbled upon by someone just randomly browsing Amazon for things in your genre. Amazons suggestion algorithm supposedly also tends to kick in and start promoting you to potential buyers around the    book range.Other than that make sure your Amazon listing is tagged properly. Youll also want to check to make sure your book is in the appropriate category sometimes they dont end up where you put them. Narrow categories are also better than broad ones. For example Post Apocalyptic would be a better category to be in than the larger general Science Fiction category assuming you had such a book.You might want to do a bit of marketing by notifying blogs in your genre but dont spend too much time on marketing at the moment. Particularly since you only have the one book. Youre better served getting more content produced.One other thing you might want to do if you havent already is set up an email list to capture the email of readers who bought your book. You can do it through Mail Chimp or Aweber and put the form on a freely hosted Wordpress.com site if you need to. Both will also set up an email capture form and host it for you if you dont have or want your own site. Then just link to it from inside your book. You might also want to give away a freebie a short story or several or even a complete novel to get people to submit their email. Once you have a list of email addresses from people who have bought your book you can email them to notify them when you have a new release available.,writing,cevk3h8,5,t5_2qh2n

When a dark truth about the source of artificial intelligence is uncovered the only path to freedom will be to discover what it truly means to be human.Sounds a bit trite without more concrete ideas and details. What are these feelings and why are they human feelings not whateverheis feelings? Who is this woman and why has he been ordered to protect her? What dark truth? Also I guess hes an AI? A line like What it truly means to be human is cliche on its own and you havent built a comprehensive enough arc to do anything with it. Of course I can parse it out robotic man isnt supposed to feel things but he does feel things and so maybe hes capable of being humanlike. That idea is fine. Its wellused but its fine.

The final idea in the first chapter is good though  that the poorly sung song which is a classic is key to the whole experience.Theres some significant grammarprose problems. Theres a lot of he saw it seemed and other clunky constructions. I cleaned up where I could but a lot of it just needs tighter focus on sentence construction. What might help is better usage of paragraphs  theyre all over the place with no real sense of characters owning a paragraph. Keep the ideas together and characters dialogue actions thoughts in their own paragraphs and youll have clearer prose and flow.The setting is alright but I dont have much feel for the culture in which this show exists. It seems no different than our current society which might be the point but theres not much in the way of making the setting pop out as relevant to the rest of the story going on.Hard to say much more considering its probably part of a longer piece.

This will help you avoid getting so bogged down in research  because lets face it ancient China is a pretty broad topic  that the writing itself disappears. If youve not already worked out your plotcharacters then Id start with getting a basic idea of the social hierarchy during the period that you want to set your story in  this will at least give you some idea of the structures that your characters will be existing in and might be helpful in terms of creating conflict within your plot depending what your plot is that is. ,writing,cf55bqm,1,t5_2qh2n

256495,0,t3_1x0nk5,Description should serve a purpose.  Some people feel writers should avoid describing the narrator in a first person book so that the reader can slip into the narrative and imagine that they are the narrator.  I disagree but thats a personal opinion.  What you what to avoid is description for descriptions sake.  When you describe you narrator it should be natural and it should tell you something about the character.  Like I looked across the sea of slick haircuts and fancy suits and resisted the temptation to comb back my curly hair or run to the nearest bathroom and shave.  Thats a terrible example but it tells you not only does the character have longish curly hair and scruff but that hes selfconscious about it.If how and when you choose to describe a character can and should! tell your readers a lot about that characters state of mind. I might describe myself as carrying a few extra pounds while my mom might describe me as too skinny.  Dont forget that your narrator isnt just giving readers a description theyre giving a description as they perceive it which may not be reality.Whatever you do though dont have your character look in a mirror and describe what they see.  ,writing,cf7cazt,2,t5_2qh2n

If it was a case of to continue using my anecdote well it doesnt really make sense that that region is named X when all the other regions are named according to naming convention Y then Id definitely get why it was worth mentioning.

Good narrative should feel three dimensional if the audience reader viewer whatever is going to suspend their disbelief and be drawn into the fantasy. Why wouldnt you be able to express that on camera?

314179,0,t3_1xp0ik,To be totally honest with you its almost impossible nowadays to create truly  original art. If you have an idea for a piece of music odds are the theme youre using has been used before unless its really complex and the chord progression has definitely been done before. If you have an idea for a painting odds are something like its been done before. If you have an idea for a photograph odds are someones snapped it before.But what really sets the different pieces of music apart are the instruments the rhythm or variations upon the theme. What sets the paintings and photographs apart are color lighting depth of field... All these little details are what makes the art really unique. The basic heros journey has already been written. Cliches are unavoidable. What really matters in writing are the emotions you convey. After youve become a master of controlling the ebb and flow of tension and release of joy and sorrow climax and resolution... then you can start worrying about setting as an afterthought.Now if you believe youve reached that point then again its not really an endpoint  you can always become a stronger writer and you really want to start building your own ideas then there are a number of things to be considered. First of all nothing is created in a vacuum. Even the most original of thoughts were not spontaneously brought into being from nothingness  they had inspirations. What makes something new and unique is the combination of the old.For example take the Jedi Knights of Star Wars. Jedi Knights are an interesting combination of two easilyidentifiable archetypes and a foreign setting. These are the knight the monk and Science Fiction. Sticking the knight with their swords and codes of honor lightsaber Jedi Code in a Science Fiction setting is not really that big of a leap. But adding in the unarmored pacifism and mystical forces The Force of the monk makes something truly unique.If you arent lucky enough to have ideas combine and come to you unconsciously then all you must do is take the initiative and start using old ideas taking the interesting traits from them and combining them with other ideas. All the requirements for the new are right before us. From zero and one the ingenious man could extrapolate infinity.,writing,cfdc0yn,1,t5_2qh2n

Some publishers only wanted first publication rights so if anything was previously published they generally wouldnt look at it.Nowadays that is not an issue although a lot of people still think it is the case...and yes there are some dinosaurs that feel this way but not the vast majority.If you selfpublish first and sell relatively well then you actually increase your chances of publication as many publishers reduce risk by signing authors that have a proven track record. In particular the Amazon imprints  North Thomas amp Mercer Montlake are generally on the lookout for well selling authors and theyll knock on your door without you even having to submit to them.If you selfpublish and do poorly  it doesnt really hurt you as the publishers dont consider that actually published  in this case they treat the manuscript much in the same way as any work that comes across their desk  it gets no bump or hit because there are any number of reasons why it didnt sell well with you  all of which they will address such as covers editing marketing title etc.In my case and the cases of people like David Dalgish Anthony Ryan and  D.J.

397127,0,t3_1ymo4q,Im currently reading his book Writing With Power and its an interesting read. It parallels with what Stephen King and Anne Lamott says about getting it all down. If you get stuck two things are happening you are criticizing yourself or you are not confident on what youre about to write. So Elbow suggests to put it down even if it disagrees with what you feel or what you think is trivial within the story.With this knowledge I became curious of what other writers did when theyre pounding out the first draft. George RR Martin calls himself a gardener rather than an architect  he plants a seed doesnt have a say on how it will grow but knows that it will grow. Terry Pratchett also said that he does zero drafts which is the draft where all stuff is put down without any hesitation whatsoever.I think my mistake in learning writing is that there should only be one way to write a draft. Previously I stuck with outlining everything before I even set foot on a story. Now I feel myself through the story trusting my characters on the actions and decisions they take. When I finish a draft and look over it my first reaction is always this what a mess!But I congratulate myself. Ive written down the story. It doesnt matter that its bloated or anemic. The story in my head  the unwritten story  is now tangible. I can see it so I can destroy it.The fun part finally begins.Like a sculptor you chip away at things that weakens the story until you get the final picture. But it never ends. New ideas crop up and youre back to square one. Dont allow yourself to be dejected. Take it. It could be the missing gem that could spice up the story.So you write it all down again. Rinse and repeat.Im not sure if Im in the right mindset that the writing process is this seesaw of writing and revising. The only time you get to finish your story is when youre satisfied with what youre reading. Ultimately you need people who you can trust folks who would give you their feedback without holding back.More stuff! More ideas! Would that mean I should rewrite again? Yes.Im prattling away. Im not a novelist so whatever Ive gabbed about is questionable in merit. Im currently working on short stories writing them as if I were writing a novel.

But theyre asking for advice which really translates into rules most of the time on how to write better... better than who? Whos writing should you try to imitate? I think the answer is no ones. Write see what you like experiment steal break the rules develop your writing.New writers also find hearing other writers processes comforting so whenever I give advice I talk about what I do and then make it very clear that its just the way I do it that there are millions of better writers than me doing it in a hundred different ways.

480544,0,t3_1zkcxm,When I first started writing I just sat down and did it. That turned out to be tiring and ultimately not super productive. Over time I read up on working processes and how the brain works re concentration. I know work for  minutes and break stand up from the PC for  minutes. Repeat as many times as I have time for.With that schedule Ive written over . words an hour when things go well. And thats with a sixth of every hour not even being spent writing. It may be worth looking into typing programs if you dont use  fingers on each hand. You should also turn off your internal editor and just let the words flow. The creative half of your brain works fine alone you can wait with making what youve written bland and uninteresting via overediting until later. pI also usually listen to music and dont actually worry about wordcount while writing. Instead I worry about writing during the  minute sprints that I have and then tally up the words after. My minimum with this method is about  wordshour max has been about  wordshour.,writing,cfuw31v,2,t5_2qh2n

Instead of having the character say all this upfront in the first person why not put him in situations that illustrate everything hes saying?

Maybe juxtapose that with the story of the kid vomiting on his pants in great detail or some situation where he saved somebodys life.  In other words show dont tell.

565516,0,t3_20k757,Have fun! If you dont enjoy writing the act of writing then walk away and find something you really enjoy. But if your joy really is writing heres my basic concept of writing  and the resources that helped me develop that ideology.Writing is a medium that means its a way to telepathically communicate with someone. When you write you cannot ignore the reader! The first way you consider the reader is by being aware of the rules of the medium this is still the level Im at! They fall into three categories grammar sentence structure and paragraph construction.To understand grammar read Strunk and Whites Elements of Style. This will tell you everything you need to know to get started grammar never ends Ive heard stories of poets who abandoned the craft for linguistics after studying grammar for too long. Know it but dont be intimidated by it!Sentence structure came next for me and was a little bit more abstract. I took a Coursera course called writing in the sciences.  This one free! class has improved my writing more than anything else.Paragraph construction is when the rules just start fing each other. I have been reading through an old text book called Form and Thought in Prose  I have the  edition but there might be later editions that are worth checking out. Specifically the introduction to part  blew me away. If you dont want to buy it a great place to start is the essay Politics and the English Language by George  Farm Animals Orwell.These have all improved my enjoyment of the act of writing and so I recommend them. But they come with the caveat that if you try to follow this advice and you find yourself hating writing or getting intimidated stop immediately and PM me a f off.,writing,cg4jze0,1,t5_2qh2n

Theres no nagging feeling of dread as you climb the stairs to investigate. Its just a ghost jumping out of the wall at you.Hitchcock used the best analogy for suspense Ive heard Two men are sitting at an outside table of a restaurant talking baseball. They talk for five minutes. Suddenly a bomb goes off. You get that initial shock the jolt of the jumpscare but then it dies as quickly as it came. Suspense is showing someone slide a bag filled with explosives under the table then having the men sit down and talk baseball. For five minutes the audience is screaming at the screen. Look! Just look under the table cant you see that damned bag? Dear God dont they see the bomb?Another important aspect of suspense is giving the readeraudience relief. Sometimes. Finally after four and a half minutes one of the men nudges the bag with his foot and they see the bomb. Out the door out the window they go and get out of there just in time.

With all this data prerecorded writing becomes referential rather than intuitive. Youre looking up talking points and creating the narrative around them rather than fleshing out the character in the text to drive the narrative where it needs to go. Its like the characters are directing your writing not the other way around. That cool plot point you just thought of becomes No I dont do that. Remember  on that list you filled out? Theyve taken a life of their own outside of the text when you do such extensive preparatory work and you as a writer no longer have control over them even though you gave them life in the first place.

Perhaps there are multiple plausible answers to the mystery and the reader is free to speculate which of them is the truth.This is not the same thing as a plothole.  A plothole is simply a disconnect between story elements that has no plausible answer.  It is the result of lazy or inattentive writing.

For example this makes sense Were the questions fair and honest in every way? Were the answers?  However in your example using are instead of were breaks the parallel between the sentences and answers to these questions is much longer than actions so people will not easily pick up on the intended structure. Even if the grammar was clear I would not choose this grammatical structure for two separate concepts  treating patients and answering questions.

She says humorous horror isnt horror to her but you can include humorous parts such as dialogue. What do you think about humor in horror does it stop the story from being scary? Gregory Frost gives some terrific advice in Do not psyche yourself out of writing the start of the story because you dont know the right place to start it because trust me it wont be the right place even if you think it is. Youll get to the end of the story and youll find out oh this is what I needed to put in in order to aim the story at the ending I discovered.After hearing this advice Ive found that I often need to go back in the second draft and add at least a scene or five to better introduce my characters and create sympathy as well as better clarify the world theyre in.

766692,0,t3_22xnn8,I think the easy part kind of kills it. Anything easy has no profit left in it for anyone that doesnt truly work at it. Also as much as people like to claim that romance is easy Id wager its pretty difficult to make a conflicted romance seem important enough to justify a story when pretty much any other conflict you can think of could be or is happening at the same time. Characters in romance become whiny little brats too easily when the author fails to create substantive plot that ties on a personal and highly relatable level to the characters.

790881,0,t3_236p4h,gt Im writing a story about another world but our world as we know it also exists within the story. Im unsure whether I should use made up names for counting time.I think it depends on whether the two worlds interact on a regular basis or have ever interacted in the past.  Or even if theyre alternate versions of one another or something  a reason for them to have run parallel at one point.If theyve never interacted and theyre not parallel worlds it seems to me that having the same names for things in both would come off as strange.  Its one thing to have an invented world that uses Earth words when Earth doesnt exist  then you can use the excuse of translating for the reader if you want but to have two separate worlds both talked about in the book have the same words for things when theyve never interacted?  Weird at least to me P.  This doesnt mean they should use their weird words when youre in the POV of one of those characters though...in this case you could be translating as well but if people from one world run into people from the other I dont think they should be comfortably talking about days and months without becoming confused about the differences between their worlds.If they share the words but dont interact in the present you could explain it by saying theyve interacted in the far past or share a language  in which case root meanings for words could lead to things having the same or similar names even without collaboration.  In terms of timeframes they could have a similar orbit around a sun or a similar seasonal structure in which case it would make sense for them to break things up into things like days and seasons and then years.If they interact on a regular basis you could definitely use the same words.  I would consider it the same situation as different countries have here.  While other countries may speak different languages and therefore have different words for month year etc when translated back to English they would use the same word English speakers do or at least with really common things like month and year.I also agree with inkedexistence on the importance of madeup names for measures of time.  Initially I hated the week names being different in Kingkiller but once I realised I didnt have to pay attention to them I got over it.  Knowing Rothfuss though their names are probably going to have some hidden meaning that will come back to bite me later for not paying attention S.tldr its really complicated so go with whatever feels right...but have a reason for it.,writing,cgu6duu,2,t5_2qh2n

The reason I ask is I think Id be more hooked if I learned about this super awesome musical prodigy smack dab in the middle of Musictown USA first  and then later experienced finding out about his tragedy with him. Im not sure what your plans are character wise with whos important and whos not but Id consider making Orpheos family a stronger introduction. They seem so supportive that it strikes me odd that theyre sort of cast by the wayside internally in Orpheos character. Even as an introduction theres a lot in it  I think itd be a bit more comfortable if you held off on introducing Vander and even Jade until a tiny bit later. Introducing both of them at the same time as the parents gives them all equal footing in my mind and Im getting the vibe esp. as this is YA that the latter two are going to be much more important but as it is Vander definitely reads like an afterthought.HTH ,writing,cgwy7cy,1,t5_2qh2n

841501,0,t1_cgzx878,I was raised as a fundamentalist Southern Baptist during which time I pretty much memorized the Bible from front to back so that forms the basis for my scriptural knowledge and my knowledge of the culture behind fundamentalist Christianity. But Ive done other research into fundamentalist sects in order to draw conclusions on what a modernday crusade between the fundamentalist Christians of America and the Islamic Middle East would look like particularly one that exploits the emotional and mental vulnerability of children. I can think of this documentary I watched  right off the top of my head.Heres one scene that references my protagonists background overtly David knelt on the high crest of a dune his knees pressing cold hollows in the dry sand. The desert went on forever in a neverending sprawl of sand dunes like crumpled beige satin. Desperate brush dotted the barren landscape the last tuffs of hair on a mangeinfested dog.He had told the priest that God was dead and while David didnt think that was necessarily true not in the deepest part of his heart the Labyrinth had broken something significant in him. There was nothing to be said that could reconcile his perspective on the world after years of mutely submitting his childhood to the feverish hell of the crusades. It was Gods will that he break down men with batons and rifle butts that he bust down apartment doors and throw black bags over the heads of screaming startled sleepers. He had surrendered to this idea long before. But was it also Gods will that he be disgraced hurt and abandoned for defending the same ethical code that had carried him through so far? David did not have Jobs patience.So his body kneeled and cried out for that small still voice which had guided him so far in trenches and jungles and deserts through destruction and death.Please be there. Please. Please.There was no reply just the cold whistle of the wind in his ears and the early dawn light on the dunes like a sea of pink fire.Less than ten feet away from him a smokecolored rattlesnake was basking on a rock. It didnt make any noise but it watched David with terrible unblinking speculation. David stared back into its slitted pupils.What do you want from me? What could you possibly want? What is the point of all this? he asked the viper silently. The snake just gazed back at him with frigid indifference. I was here before you it seemed to reply. I was here before you and Ill be here when your kind is ashes and dust.The snake made him think of the snake handlers at church when he was very young. He remembered being four years old and holding a baby copperhead the color of loafer leather cradled in his tiny hands. They shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.The sick yes. There had been plenty of those.EDIT I should probably note that I left the fundamentalist Christian church as a preteen my faith in Christianity only slightly outlived my belief in Santa Claus and do not ascribe to the overwhelming majority of Christian concepts.

855827,0,t3_23xhia,Depends on the character and how they perceive life not how their society perceives it.Think of it this way you have two characters. One is a young fresh recruit in the military proud to protect his country and mostly innocent of the harsh reality of war. He goes into combat with gusto and confidence dodging through obstacles and weaving through barbed wire. Then he stabs an enemy with his bayonet. Reality crashes in on him he has just ended a life. He sees a picture fall out of the other mans coat as he collapses depicting a young woman holding a small child. And your soldier has just ensured that the child will never get to know its father.Your other character is a hardened veteran. He and his squad are sneaking into the enemy compound under the cover of darkness. Carefully peaking around walls and advancing cautiously. A guard passes in front of him then turns and sees him. Before the guard has a chance to shout or raise an alarm your veteran pounces on him and clamps a fist over his mouth. He maneuvers his arm around the guards throat and drags his kicking body into the shadows wincing at every grunt that escapes. As he is ducking into the shadows he sees more guards patrolling the same passage so he pulls harder he cant risk a death rattle. Soon the guard stops struggling and slumps to the ground. The veteran releases his crushed throat and notices a photo that falls out of the mans coat. He pushes the body into the shadows and steps back out into the darkness. No one heard that is all that matters.You see how your character handles it depends on their personality. Not on how the world views the action.,writing,ch1k9m0,13,t5_2qh2n

I dont think your thesis that those things are deliberate mechanisms for a specific effect in each book really works because they are ubiquitous in all his novels at least that Ive read. gtCan you give an example of the new way to write dramatic prose of your own?Im confused. Packed into this question is the assumption that there is one way and a new one of writing dramatic prose. Anotherthat it is somehow necessary to come up with a new way to do it. Also presupposed is that my ability to write dramatic prose somehow has any bearing on my criticism of CMCs writing style whatsoever. Im confused why you are asking the question and why at this time in particular. Id send you a writing of my own but Im not sure I trust your ability to engage in objective criticism based on what I assume is your real reason for asking that question. Im pretty sure youd try validating your own opinion instead of giving my writing a levelheaded read.I will say that just because somebody comes up with a new way of doing things doesnt mean it will necessarily be better than what came before. New isnt always better as they say. In this case I do think there are much better ways of writing dramatic prose. But thats ultimately my opinion coming from someone who has read most of his wellknown books and couldnt for the life of me feel a single emotion in them.

Probably not.A few dumb people WILL make assumptions about you. but they are going to do that no matter what. Dont worry about it.A real issue though is turning off readers. You need to be doing something with all the violence thats worth the tradeoff of being icky. It usually helps to have context for the violence and have it say things about characterization and theme in your story. Otherwise it can come off like a grindhouse movie which is entertaining for a small subset of readers and boring and gross to everyone else.,writing,chagcza,8,t5_2qh2n

Handwriting gave my hand cramps and filled pages with not that much content compared to a typewritten page.Typewriting was awesome. There was a strong connection to the striking of the keys and the words on the paper. Hard to explain. However its difficult to correct mistakes and everything will eventually have to be retyped completely in its entirety.  Very time consuming.Word processing is good. The tactile response isnt as strong as with typewriters but its the best for me since my brain moves more quickly than I can handwrite or type with a typewriter.

Having worked ten years in retail my politics skew heavily towards the left.  Ive been through the whole lol if you just work harder youll get paid more!! roundabout.  Again though my politics  anyones politics  have no bearing on the discussion which was primarily about a weird literary venue on a literary sub.  We try to avoid politics in general of any stripe because its often not relevant to the discussion unless were talking about  of course which happens roughly once every seven seconds.  Thankfully the problem with politics comes up very rarely or else my insidious molelike nature would obviously rear its ugly head on a continuous basis.  gtHow are we to believe that you are a neutral agent with a godlike perspective on what is politics and what isnt politicsWoah woah woah I mod rbooks not rphilosophy.  First of all I deal with literature not politics  and my neutrality with regards to literature is highly suspect as many people on this particular subreddit could no doubt attest to.  Secondly just because mods and gods rhyme is no reason to assume that a mods perspective is godlike particularly on a subreddit with  moderators of which I clock in at a lowly  or so.  Thirdly finally most pedantically I subscribe to Rancieres definition of politics which describes the term as applying to the division of stake in society and the naming and provision of the part which previously had no part in said society.  I guess in this sense a lot of literature falls under politics in that case I do let a lot of political posts go through.  Specific singleissue rants with very tenuous ties to the conversation at hand however are where I draw the line.For your edification  neoliberal is a term that came into vogue in the recent past to describe a politicaleconomic movement that began gathering steam in the late s.  It takes root from the classical sense of liberal meaning laissezfaire economic practices and political freedoms.  Neoliberal refers primarily to the political ideologies that were first implemented by the ReaganThatcherMulroney etc. governments starting in   cutting social services to the bone and deregulating industries opening up free trade agreements undermining union activities and as Thatcher kept going on about deemphasizing societal responsibility in favour of individual and business rights.  It boils down to money being the key measure of success in anything.  This is the joke in my flair  that many people on this subreddit seem to be inspired by money more than anything else and will flaunt sales figures as an objective analysis of a literary works worth.  Sometimes I feel as though Im adrift in a sea of neoliberals.To sum upIf you want to rant about political specifics take it to rpolitics.  It has no place on rbooks.

Sexual molestation. Its revealing but nondescriptive and really only focuses on the sickness which both parties are afflicted with. The mental and emotional depth of depravity. When I wrote it and handed the chapter off to be checked the readers...They couldnt put it down they were disgusted with it but they couldnt stop reading which invoked issues they had with themselves. Doubts questions Am I sick? I should have put it down it was repulsive but I couldnt stop reading? Does that make me a horrid person? Am I secretly harboring those same tendencies?I will release it eventually when I think the questions it raises in the reader now longer outweighs its importance for understanding the character.

1185856,0,t3_27p719,To clarify what the rest of the bandwagon is sayingCertain words are almost impossible to overuse. Pronouns and articles are two such examples. Its nearly impossible to overuse she unless you are failing to vary your sentence structure. And if that is the case the frequency of that word is a symptom of an entirely different problem. She is a label. Its a stand in. You might say that it is part of the structure of a sentence rather than the content. Readers treat such words differently. They gloss over them. They dont notice how often they recur.To give an analogy if you hung a dozen copies of the exact same painting throughout your house people would notice and think it was very strange. However theyd pay no attention to the fact that the walls themselves are composed of thousands of nearly identical bricks. There are rare instances in which despite proper sentences a pronoun can appear too often. However those are fairly uncommon. You might as well worry over using the word the too much.Also if youre writing in the first person the word you should be using most is I not she.

If your story has a nerdy teenager he might have access through America Online or something like that. Unless they are at college they will not have broadband strictly modems that will tie up the phone line. And they will refer to it as The World Wide Web. Starting in the s everyone that was young and cool began being thrown into the overarching category of hipster. In the s to be young a cool was a much more tribalized thing. You werent a hipster you were a preppie a punk a skater a gangsta a goth a raver a riot grrl etc. It was more common place for teenagers to have jobs back then. People smoked cigarettes more back then than they do now. Not at Mad Men levels and people were aware of the health risks. Still you could smoke in bars family restaurants like Chilis or Dennys though not in a fast food places. Smokes were  a pack on the high end but decent discount brand packs could be found at . range. Your book is about mental illness? In the s mental illnesses were considered cool in a misguided and superficial way made you more alternative or something...I dunno. Lots of people selfdiagnosed themselves as bipolar. And Aspbergers wasnt really a widely known thing though autism was. This is the preColumbine era so people werent so up in arms about keeping all violence out of school. I wore tshirts in school with lots of violent imagery back then cut videos on their VHS editing decks that had lots of violence in them wrote short stories about kidnapping and torturing jocks and none of it threw up any red flags. You could be angry young man and not necessarily be profiled as a shooter. Circa  you were in one of two camps you were a Forrest Gump person or a Pulp Fiction person. You could like both but you couldnt like them equally. Have your characters quote lines from either of those movies. Its what we did back then. The pot back then was really shitty. You got either kind or schwag. People were also really into drinking s of malt liquor. The term molly was never used. It was always ecstasy or X which was more popular in the latter half of the decade. Raves were an underground thing in the first half of the decade. Around  is when they went mainstream and thus became lame. It was around that time that youth churches and frat houses started throwing raves.

Section Breaks should really do the same job though and without breaking the flow of the chapter. Leaving double whitespacing changing back from italics and shifting into first person along with having the MC give away the perspective in the first returned line... Some people seem to understand and some dont. Personally I think it works fine and the readers DO realise what perspective it is even if it takes a second at first...

1298076,0,t3_28yfba,Building a religion takes a lot of work. Youve got to consider what is worshipped and why  and thats a why on two levels why did this religion form in the first place and wy do people within it believe they worship? How do they worship? What sacred spaces if any exist? How are they marked or delineated? Who can enter sacred spaces and how often? What do people do inside sacred spaces? What do holy people priests hermits etc do in holy spaces and outside them? What can normal people do in conjunction with holy spaces eg can normal people even enter the sacred spaces like temples and sanctuaries? If they can what rituatals do they go through on entry  from as complex as ritual clensing so something as simple as removing shoes or hats. How does the religion tie in with daily life? How does it tie in with government? ie how secular or theocratic is the government? What morals or virtues are upheld and what actions or thoughts are condemned? What does the relgion believe about what happens after death and before birth? What symbols and numbers are associated with the religion? What myths and stories are there about how it formed and developed or about key figures within the religion eg saints and prophets?How much info you work out depends on how important the religion is in the story.If you want to research widely look at a few major religions about which there is a lot of information. The Abrahamic religions are a good place to start and theres a book called A History of God by Karen Armstrong that might help there. But also other significant religions of the past  look at for example the interaction between the Roman religion and that of Iron Age Britain and how these two pagan forms were reinterpretted by the invading Romans as having been one and the same just with different cultural interpretations and how associating a Roman deity with a British deity and calling them the same deity was a means of cultural appropriation to exert control over the native population. Sulis Minerva at Bath is a great example of this. Check out other religions too  the Norse religion ancient Egyptian religion Aztec religion Hinduism Buddhism etc. How did they develop? What imagery did they use? How and where were they worshipped? What elements do several religions have in common  eg Sun worship?,writing,cifnfac,5,t5_2qh2n

I had intended on having them play a major role in the story but not necessarily as a PoV but now I might change that.Also dont worry about harshness I came here specifically for harsh as most of those close to me that Ive shown it too only come up with Its good! and No I dont see any problems with it. which is nice but Im well aware I havent written anything of publishable quality yet.,writing,cig9rw2,1,t5_2qh2n

Maybe its just because thats largely gone out of fashion nowadays and m just used to the usual restricted first person view. Theres some typos youll pick out easy enough in your next proof read. Youre a little inconsistent with the formatting of your dialogue. Most is done correctly with each new speaker on a new line but sometimes you dont do that with Ellaina starting talking in a paragraph which began with Jacksons dialog and with her mother at the start. Theres also a few times where split dialog is not punctuated correctly. I dont know what word you meant to use but incipiently doesnt work where youve used it.

They are only soulgripping if the author fails to give appropriate details or explanations to justify the twist.

There are things writers do when theyre writing from passion that they dont do when theyre writing for a market audience. When you write to sell you are creating a product to a certain extent you let the customer preferences dictate the end result. You are employed to craft a story they will get something out of. When youre writing fanfic the motivations and process are very different and the end result is different. Much of what comes out is experimental deranged gory blackly funny profane and sexually twisted. The boundaries of good taste and social acceptance arent anywhere to be seen and the end result can come closer to genuine art than most carefully selected purebred published writing ever will.   ,writing,cj2sl5j,2,t5_2qh2n

1504925,0,t1_cj4qi02,Not to compare John August and Craig Mazin to Ginsberg and Kafka but the two professional screenwriters recently answered a question about sloppy vomit drafts on their podcast and went into detail about how they dont use them. Thought it was interesting and worth repeating Theyre talking screenplays rather than novels but the writing process is moreorless the same.gt Craig There are writers who do these things called vomit drafts where they just get it out I just get it out on paper and its terrible and I dont care because then I can go back And Im not one of them. I need to know what the hell is going on....gt Craig I dont do any of this. I dont crank out a large number of pages very rapidly and I definitely try and write my first draft as if it were going to be shot. ... I am not writing something just to say Look at me I made it to the end. Im writing something that reads like a movie.John was more sympathetic to the idea but still says he writes carefully for his first draft although he hand writes to avoid editinggt John Some writers talk about the vomit draft which is sort of just like everything as fast as you can get it down on the page. I dont do that as much as I do barricade myself and handwrite something so I can go back and rewrite it. gt John Yeah. I can see Ryans point here in that sometimes perfectionism can be a trap. And so you can go through and sort of diddle with every scene so carefully that its like pristine and precise that you never actually get the whole thing done. But I think Im much more in your camp where I always write a scene even if Im handwriting a scene that I still have to type up I write it as if what if I never get the chance to go back and fix it.John also made an interesting point about writing quick and sloppy just to figure things out off the pagegt John ...But I definitely write sort of for the final version of things. Where sloppy can be your good friend is if youre just trying to figure stuff out about who the characters are what they are Im a big fan of writing off the page and writing a bunch of scenes that you know are not going to be in the movie but just to get the characters talking.gt John Figure out what their voices are like. And thats an absolutely fair and valid process. And thats kind of a thing where just kind of being stream of consciousness can be a really smart move because you get to hear what those characters voices are what the world is like just its you know its just getting your mind in a more fluid place. That is totally valid. But when it comes time for your real scenes dont shove crappy scenes into your script because theyll be there.Writing a vomit draft seems like a good tool for new writers but yes its worth noting that not everyone does it.Neither of them use vomit drafts per se but both have similar processes in their writing process Craig uses a sloppy streamofconsciousness writing for sketching out out character voices off the page. John handwrites to avoid editing but still writes carefully and deliberately.Podcast episode  link also used an except from ep ,writing,cj4wz3g,14,t5_2qh2n

They are more accepted as rhyming faster page breaks and large spaces putting sentences in various locations on a page. Goodnight Moon does break the predictable ending and takes us to where a child logically would. The childs night doesnt end when the parent says good night and shuts the door. It ends when the child falls asleep and right before that their mind roams over the world. The lesson to me as a writer is before you fall into the routine or the predictable it should make sense first. I never fell asleep when the door shut.

I presume if you did an English degree you can write and you enjoy reading. Dont think its a useless skill. Companies big companies need people who can write. Have you considered PR? They need content creators. Or advertising? Shorter writing but they still need writers. What about corporate blogging business journalism etc? All not the sexiest but a great start.Or you could go the internship route. Its not fun but a lot of folks do this to get a foot up the writing ladder.

They dont really compete.But I think a lot of indie authors care because it makes it really hard for anyone to find your work.

1622858,0,t3_2cvwa9,The killer should make a degree of sense.  A logic exists and we can emphathize with them  we can understand where we or our neighbor or our family member could go down that road if circumstances were slightly different.  When that logic or pattern extends to the point where they cross normal boundaries we start getting unnerved because were led to believe it wouldnt be too hard for us to be the killer or the victim.Killers fall into two major categories.  Theres the spree killer and the ritual killer.Spree killers are the guys and ladies who have basically become unhinged.  Somethings gone wrong and through some deep frustration or pain anger or madness theyre lashing out hurting people.  They arent necessarily predictable and there isnt necessarily a pattern in the victims  they go after whoever is at hand.  This is why theyre hard to catch  you can only wait until the next victim and hope there are more clues or theres a chance to intervene.  The pattern the underlying logic of it tends to be emotional  theres a story and the why tends to be the most important question and the compelling element comes from the sympathy or the story at the heart of it.  gt  Harold works two jobs to pay for his daughters medical bills and he has no support network his family helped at first but they dont show up more than once or twice a year now.  Hes mopping the floor of the school when he gets the call his daughter died.  He wasnt there and it breaks him a little.  He cant handle the grief so he turns it into anger instead.  Anger at the employer anger at family and at the people who didnt help him raise money for his daughter...  his eyes turn to the cleaning chemicals.  Big warnings about mixing them.  Doubly important in the school because the fumes will hit children that much harder.gtHe stews for days but the labels wont leave his minds eye.  If he had to face the knowledge that his child died suffocating and alone why shouldnt they?gt  By the time the detective catches up with him The Gas Man has gone after a car a child in the back seat broken into a house to flood it with odorless colorless gas and even unsuccessfully went after a school bus.  Now in a school teachers are already herding children to areas and opening windows but its not enough  some are passing out almost as fast as they can be evacuated by the fire department.  In the staff room the lead detective confronts The Gas Man armed with only knowledge unable to communicate due to the gas masks they both wear.  He could shoot The Gas Man but that wouldnt solve anything.gt  He hits the button on his phone to play a message.  The doctors who tried so hard to save your daughter they have kids here too.gt  Silent going still for long seconds Harold effectively surrenders grabbing the bases necessary to counteract the admixture and slow the spread of the gas.Ritual killers by contrast have a distinct pattern.  Theyre hard to catch because theyre generally more careful.  They go after victims with a particular type or theres an underlying logic that dictates who they go after and when and how.  The compelling nature of it is in the style of it the art the creativity.gt  She was a doctor now shes a killer.  Her victims dont die from a knife from a beating from strangulation fire or cold.  They die from pain.  Shes brilliant and capable and she covers her tracks.  Shes been doing what shes been doing for two years for six victims.  The only reason anyone has any idea she exists is a FBI cover operation a fake website on the deep web that posed as a place for serial killers to communicate collaborate or offer tips.  Most were jokes but this one had proof.gt  The method is simple you see.  A different method for each victim Beating fire strain cutting sound...  She inflicts the pain as much as might be possible given human tolerances and she maintains it keeping the victim alive until their minds cant handle it.  Most die of an aneurysm  she wont let them die of heart attacks.gt  Each victim is symbolically chosen matching the tarot cards each in order.  The fool the magus the high priestess... the slacker the stage entertainer the most popular senior student at a Christian school.  For the eighth card Justice she kills the lead detective our protagonist.gt  The last card on her list naturally would be The World.,writing,cjjq6in,8,t5_2qh2n

Honestly a lot of what you have makes my eyes cross lots of confusing world building stuff. Get em interested in your book by telling me about your character and why the heck I should care what happens to them. Oh and the fact that your protag is  should be in your first or second sentence. Tells the agent immediately it is YA.Then you get your book statsabout you stuff. Your sentence describing the book is a bit too tldr... agents generally dont like authors to lay out the themes of the book. Your hookcharacterconflictstakes above should already have done that.

Never ever wax annoying about Why You Wrote Your Novel or tell the agent what kind of book it is. The writing should speak for itself. They will be able to tell its a tightly paced thriller from the writing. and if they cant you have a problemAlso a word of note just to prepare you dystopia is dead. Do not anywhere in your query call your book a dystopia. For many agents it is an automatic pass. And generally prepare yourself for the long haul because your book may be a tough sell in this market.

1756084,0,t3_2ek57w,Why would you want someone to be stereotypical? Your leader can be all the things derienzo suggests but what will give him depth is how he perceives himself. Leadership is more than a series of traits. Its an identity one must adopt and usually one struggles with because one the requirements of leadership might go against your own desires and beliefs and two there are many types of leadership identities not all are appropriate for every situation and the inevitable failure of leadership the latter results in can shake ones identity.Consider Michael Corleones first move as leader of the family He sends Tom away because hes not a wartime consiglieri which is true. It also signaled that no one was safe. Michael who didnt want to lead the family but was forced into the role because Sonny was a good son but a bad don had to separate himself from the college boy everyone perceived him as in order to be to the wartime godfather his family needed by essentially whacking his own brother.  The rest of the series shows him struggling with that decision.  His desire for the family to go legitimate shows him wanting to be the college boy army volunteer blue suit leader he wants to be but he cant escape that first identity he chose for himself. Just as he closed the door on Kay at the end of  he closed the door on enabling his desired identity. And he ends up having to actually whack his own brother.Consider also Saving Private Ryan and the running pool over what Tom Hankss character did in civilian life. The most heartbreaking part of the movie isnt when Ryan as an old man visits the cemetery. Its when Hanks knowing he probably wasnt going to come back from the final mission admits that he was a math teacher. Despite being everything derienzo says a leader should be for that moment he rejects the role and reclaims what he truly sees himself as. Hes a math teacher but to save Ryan and his small corner of the free world hell be a leader.Who does your leader see himself as? Who does he emulate? What type of leader does he want to be? How has he had to compromise that vision of himself? In the answer to these questions youll find out where he clashes with your MCs own vision of himself.,writing,ck0ig0u,2,t5_2qh2n

1813719,0,t3_2fbpbg,Currently its that Im going to turn a corner and find someone hanging there.Context is important.Theres this white car thats been sitting in a private parking lot around the corner from my house for a week and a half now.  My wife is convinced that something awful has happened.  She called it into the police and the person at the station mentioned that theyd had a report about the car already for a different reason obviously not saying what that reason was.  Our house backs onto a ravine that runs through the neighbourhood one of the last bits of Carolinian forest just as an aside and theres a makeshift entrance into the ravine at the edge of this parking lot.  Two years ago someone hung themselves in the ravine.  Bad enough for sure but what makes it worse is that at the time there was an active elementary school directly across the ravine from my backyard.  My neighbour who was ten at the time was the person that found the body.  She didnt leave the house for a year after that.  Now I go by that abandoned car every day and cant help but think that someone else has hung themselves in those woods  that somewhere hidden behind the dense foliage is a corpse gently swaying in the wind.  Ive watched the documentary on Aokigahara a few too many times and the idea of a new suicide forest in the woods behind my house is too depressing to even make jokes about.  Thats all at least semiplausible though.  Whats wildly implausible is that Im going to come around the corner in my own house to some random body hanging from a nonexistent rafter.  Yet here we are.  There are these helium balloons in my house right now that are not helping matters  theyre resting against the ceiling on a slight angle that is strongly reminiscent of someone hanging from a gallows.

1846544,0,t3_2fqbuk,Congrats on getting a first draft of a novel done! Thats really impressive. My two cents on this whole method of writing thing is that you have to be able to find a happy medium. Writing with no idea of where youre going or what youre trying to say really works out as well as we might hope. But carefully plotting out every minute detail and action can also have its problemsthe writing can feel stiff and sometimes along the way you realize that something might work even better than what you had planned for. So I guess what Im saying is as you attempt your next novel definitely give more planning a shot but dont wind up feeling beholden to it. ,writing,ckbpd3g,1,t5_2qh2n

1847907,0,t3_2fpzu5,I dont think the term picture book is typically used to describe anything other than young childrens books. In recent years Ive read The Invention of Hugo Cabret and The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet. Both make extensive use of illustration but neither are classified as picture books. Cabret is written for a younger audience and it actually reads like a silent film in book form with a few pages of words here and there but most of the story carried forward by the pictures. While Spivet is about a young character it is definitely written for an adult audience and the drawings diagrams maps and whatever are all provided in the margins. They arent really used to illustrate scenes but the entire book is about the idea of mapping as a way of understanding the world. Brandon Sandersons most recent book Words of Radiance makes decent use of illustrations with drawings between a number of chapters.I think its definitely fine to use illustrations in a serious novel but I think it depends on what kind of serious novel you want it to be. Are you doing the illustrations yourself? Are you as good an artist as you are a novelist? How are you integrating the illustrations? If its just an occasional thing where it is literally just a visual depiction of something youve described in words its probably not necessary but if the images are providing something beyond what the words can convey then I think its great.And in all this we havent even touched on the idea of graphic novels which I think can be serious.

Does she become more empowered as the book progresses?Also the characters are doing an amazing job at demon stopping I concur with uMeztere you are making it way too easy for the MC.

1858095,0,t3_2fvbph,I suppose the only problem is that if you do it properly its not going to help you much. Screenplays have specific rules and patterns that are designed with the film medium in mind dialog becomes the main focus location item and character descriptions are more or less nonexistant internal thoughts and themes have to be somehow expressed in visable action or dialog etc. Adapting a novel to a screenplay isnt a simple process of transcribing the action and dialog off the page theres a huge amount of through thats needed especially when youre taking complex ideas or inner thoughts and trying to express them visually.

1859612,0,t3_2fvjzt,This video from Extra Credits does a good job of explaining where many writers go wrong with female characters. The most important bit I think is the followinggtWe tend to think of anything related to being female as inherent to being female.This is of course how all stereotyping works but its incredibly prevalent in female characters especially in games which is the shows wheelhouse because the idea that women are the things that society deems them to be is still a deeply ingrained one even if things are much better than they used to be. What ends up happening is that instead of showing a character reacting to societal pressures you get characters who are a cardboard cut out of those pressures. Even someone who totally internalizes those pressures can still be a well rounded character so long as you are thinking about why theyve done that because its actually rare for real person to totally reject or totally accept everything society might assume of them. Its in these choices that you find and reflect who the character is and the sad thing is that society tends to allow men more freedom in that regard and makes us less likely to trip over the above issues when writing them. Of course men face societal pressures and it is in fact a tenant of feminisms that the patriarchy is oppressive to everyone except a select elite because if you are going to perpetuate the meme that women are lesser the result is that the things youve coded female but are not inherently so are left toxic for males in the society to express. In other words men are bound by the same chains they just tend to much longer and more flexible ones because of the bias that is being enforced. It is for one reason or another much easier to fall into a trap of writing women as stereotypes because of how society has does and is still influencing us to think about them in a way that largely doesnt do with men. ,writing,ckda0n7,13,t5_2qh2n

So if Im writing erotica which I kind of do as a hired hand I will spin it just go get some personal interest.I find that I read a lot of male characters bit have rarely seen honest female characters in truly action roles without the sex behind it. It feels like when you write for a female character the story tends to take on a more feminist edge because you take the whole history of the gender with it.

1881288,0,t3_2g4fdy,Occasionally its an idea for a scene usually just a snippet of one. I actually hate when this happens because I generally have no context for the scene but it sticks with me for some reason and its hard to figure out where in the story it would fit or even if there is a story.I much prefer to start with a general concept that I find interesting and then figure out who the worst possible person for it to happen to is. Thats the protagonist.Next I figure out whowhat his major opposition is and that helps me figure out the antagonist of the story.From there I figure out what one event must happen to set the story in motion. Thats the beginning. Then I figure out in a broad sense what the ending to such a situation might be. I try to come up with the best answer I can but itll change before I actually write that far. I just like knowing where Im going so that I have something to write toward no matter how vague.For the most part I dont have any idea what happens in the story until I start writing. I do prefer to have some idea for the first scenechapter at least just because I find it hard to start writing cold on a blank page with absolutely no idea what to write.

1945461,0,t3_2gyade,Honestly Im not sure it would be worth it.  Im not religious and have no problem with erotica but if a Christian felt uncomfortable with it I wouldnt want them to feel forced into doing it just because of an exercise for a writing group.If you do one idea that comes to mind is that the scene could be about a young married couple who did in fact wait until they got married before having sex but there were plenty of times before when they were tempted and it wasnt easy for them to wait  so now that they are married with a great sex life they sometimes enjoy roleplaying those premarriage situations where instead they give into temptation.  That way you put it in a framework where youre comfortable with it morally but still have some forbidden fruit spice going on.,writing,cknmocu,7,t5_2qh2n
1947115,0,t3_2gy7rs,Im sorry to break the news to you bud but while not an impossible dream youve chosen quite a difficult one.Game companies as they are structured right now  of the time dont hire dedicated writers for their games. Generally they either storyboard it out or put a pen in the hand of someone who writes on the side that was already hired onto the project to codemanageetc.The  of games that do get a dedicated writer And Im probably being far too generous with that  are either people that are famous Think the RA Salvatore scripted Kingdoms of Amalur or wellknown and connected within the industry.That being said if youd still like to pursue this I have seen a few posts give some solid leads on how to get started.You can make your own game either by learning code hiring a coder or using one of the variety of RPGMaker softwares available. Check out Defenders Quest Valley of the Forgotten on steam. Its a quaint little tower defenseRPG hybrid made with some simple software by English majors looking to make a story. The game mechanics are fairly solid and while the writing isnt top notch its entertaining and coherent.The other option you have is getting in contact with indie game developers. Theres a lot of structure in place to make indie games big hits nowadays but these guys work with basically no budget. Offer your services dirt cheap or for free and collaborate with an indie dev. Id suggest a dev that has at least a game or two under their belt already so that your time isnt wasted by someone that might burn out halfway through the process.Dont just write a script and look for a game to go along with it unless youre ready to do some serious adaption work to be compatible. Game mechanics gameplay and story should not be separate from one another but compliment one another. Which is why I recommend collaborating with a dev before they get started on a project. That being said recognize your area of expertise is in writing and while you will need to think outside of that focus the dev is probably going to be a bit better at the technicalities of what is possible within the game.Play lots of videogames but dont just play them. Study them be critical of them recognize what works and what doesnt see what attributes compliment one another and which clash learn what makes a real writer better than slapping a pen into a codemonkeys hand. Its a similar process to when youre writing a book  read a lot but be critical of what you consume.,writing,ckntvzd,2,t5_2qh2n

1974784,0,t1_ckr59hx,After all that great advice? Sheesh .So a lot depends on your writing. Certain tropes are to a degree necessary to establish genre if youre doing eg crime fiction romances scifi whatever. But weve all seen hardboiled detectives weve all read various kinds of blackmail scenarios that have a twist and so on. Youll want to bring a lot of newness to the table.If your concern is that you may inadvertently adopt an overused trope because you havent read widely or deeply enough I still think your time is better served simply writing and bringing out your particular vision. If you find that a particular scene plays out based just on your expectations rather than that you are shaping it for your plot then you might rethink it. Similarly if the character has a life of its own right out of a packing crate so to speak rather than because youve crafted them by careful choices of thoughts speech and actions you may want to reexamine the character.These clichs or tropes set up certain expectations in the reader. They can serve as a kind of code that quickly sets up a narrative which when used judiciously can save tedious exposition and get you to the action faster. But used too much it seems lazy like literary kitbuilding. Also if the readers expectations are constantly met and never subverted they can lose interest. The tropes are signposts for a given outcome but as a writer generally youll want to jerk the reader off the welllaid path once in a while.In short just write. ,writing,ckr5th8,3,t5_2qh2n

2020769,0,t3_2hwo86,In direct answer to your question yes. Its ok to take breaks  but I would argue not for weeks in length. Im assuming youre on your first draft? If so you dont want to lose any momentum you have. While writing your first  draft you want to stay as close as possible to it until youre finished. Think of it like raising an infant. Youre supposed to be with himher the most during those first crucial years because thats when heshe needs you the most. Its completely natural to feel that ugh feeling when you open up the document. Ive had dozens and dozens of those days  but youre completely right in the second part of your question you have to work past it. Here are some ways I worked past it Each chapter gets its own documentThis helped me tremendously and countered the discouragement you were describing when you open your draft. Finishing a chapter and being able to close it and start a new one knowing that its only going to be about k words is a great feeling and a nice way of making the task seem less daunting. ReadEveryone says this on here but Im going to give you my personal reason for this advice. When I was at my low points during the first draft I read from some of the lesser known authors I picked up at the book store. While going through their work I found encouragement because I saw that some of the sentences I was beating myself up over because I thought someone out there would blacklist me for using too much passive voice or adverbs were used by the author I was reading. It gives you confidence in your own writing when you go back to work and it honestly makes you less critical on yourself which is VERY important in a first draft.Anyway hope some of this helps and good luck.,writing,ckwp6g3,3,t5_2qh2n
2026471,0,t1_ckx4qs6,Free speech and freedomofthepress law in the USA is very strong and in the USA it works this way. If what the journalist said is TRUE it is never defamation.. If what the journalist said is FALSE it may or may not be defamation depending on whether the journalist was acting with actual malice and on whether the entity being criticized is a public figure or not. The Supreme Court decision  New York Times vs. Sullivan clarified that its okay for journalists to make mistakes in the course of discussing something of public interest e.g. its okay to make mistakes criticizing famous people politicians large businesses etc but not okay to do the same for a nonfamous private party.  Typically the actual malice part is interpreted in terms of the journalist should have done due diligence in attempting to verify the truth of what they reported.It sounds to me like shes covered on both fronts. Word is that what she reported was in fact true and even if elements of it werent discussing the woes of a large publishing company probably counts as public interest given how many authors it affects and it also appears from reading the blog entry in question that the blogger was not acting with malice but was attempting to report the story correctly.more info here,writing,ckxeocm,8,t5_2qh2n

If your target reader is other teens then by all means use your friends but throw some adults into the mix as well.Get a brutally honest assessment of whether your book seems worthy of publication as a book not as a book written by a teenager.  It needs to be as competent as any book written by an adult author.If it is try the traditional route because youll likely get a marketing advantage writing something so competent so young. If it isnt if people are telling you its great for your age then consider selfpublishing it but do so under a pen name. In case it isnt great or fails or something goes wrong you dont want it associated with your real name as you get older.

How many times have these teenagers said totally? Am I having them say amiright? or aight enough? Anyone  or older will be angst and anyone younger than  will be sweet and innocent. People in between do not matter. Does this one have a problem making friends? Oh lets give em an inferiority complex. Sarcasm. Everywhere. Nothing else just sarcasm.That being said one or two of these aspects can be part of a great character but it always felt to me that JP never wanted to go any farther to develop the character into something distinct. I let a friend of mine read the prologue to my project and she instantly compared it to the Angel Experiment which is the only good JP book in her opinion but still. and I would be lying if I said I havent been over analyzing my work now.,writing,clpci5c,1,t5_2qh2n

2354585,0,t1_cm2ph4u,gtThe Matrix Trilogy has largely the same MO but is never criticized because those movies were not made by Christopher NolanThis is an interesting comparison because I really like the Matrix films while admitting that there are flaws to them. But they arewere ambitious in a way that genre films rarely were before the Matrix so I tend to love them anyway. Which suggestsgtI actually think you would benefit from another viewing.Is almost absolutely true. Ive actually been meaning to rewatch the movie for quite some time and just havent made time for it.On the other hand as food for thoughtgtI think its going a bit far though to think of Inception as a movie that has characters merely performing functions. I read this and I am reminded of the theories that Inception was Nolans allegory for how movies get made. So Pages character is the Art Director GordonLevitts is the Stunt Coordinator Watanabes is the Producer etc etc. Now you can take that theory as seriously as youd like but I find it to be a pretty fascinating and reasonably credible take on the movie. Which means that it could be absolutely appropriate to think of those characters as cogs in the machine although it is not the beallendall. And while I agree with you that Inception and Guardians are doing very different things one more focused on plot vs character what I was trying to get at is that the relationships in GotG tie what is otherwise a very cookie cutter plot together and elevate it. Whereas the plot of Inception is dragged down because the relationships that tell me that something is at stake really arent established.And that kind of plot can work I see it all the time in mystery novels. But mystery novels are by and large not ensemble pieces. Theyre about one or two central characters that if part of a series allow those characters to become developed over time but often start off just as the characters in Inception as mostly stunted with some interesting quirks to give readers something to latch on to. A better contrast might be the film The Raid which I think we could agree is very much plot centered. But it cleverly reduces the number of characters we have to care about to  early on. After that while the plot isnt anything too difficult the relationships can be established and audiences can develop some attachments to who is left. So going aaaaalll the way back one of the issues I have with Nolans films is that he is awful at providing emotional attachments to characters. The Dark Knight trilogy is a perfect example because the movies are usually well executed from a technical standpoint but Batman is merely meant to be a myth and icon and nobody gives a toss about Bruce Wayne nor his stakes. They care about Joker TwoFace or Bane or someone who isnt the hero at all. Theres no proper emotional contrast between Bruce and the people he opposes! And you have to care about one of those two characters Batman or Bruce take a stand. Thats who youre grounding your series in! Which suggests to me that Goyers weaknesses as a writer dont matter to Nolan for reasons I dont claim to understand. Its all about the big picture and not at all about the characters the audience isnt supposed to identify with the characters theyre supposed to identify with justice or revenge or somesuch.So to an extent youre right Inception is less strong on character for totally defensible reasons but for me those reasons lie in the root of who Nolan is as a filmmaker and less in the narrative of Inception which if given a tweak by someone who does care about character couldve provided me with a sense of the stakes and why these characters care about one another. But I do want to give Inception another view for a variety of reasons so its possible Im missing something here. ,writing,cm2qke7,2,t5_2qh2n

Just seeing the visuals on paper might be enough to spur creative writing.

Yeah I was implying that Ill slowly mull over all of the phrases and fix them one way or another. Im sure over the course of the story Ill figure out a better implementation of the man issue and the reader will grow accustomed to it. I appreciate the props I will say that I believe the relationship between Ward and his daughter is the crux of the story and ultimately is what will keep people reading. As for POV characters right now its completely undecided. Im going Game of Thrones with it and as the story progresses and changes more characters will be introduced  and POV chapters will be based on relevance to the plot.Ill copy paste what I said on the doc about the Governor. I know of the character I do watch The Walking Dead. The Governor is not what I was aiming foroverall the entire story Im not aiming for him but in this chapter I probably am aiming closer to him than I first thought but in this specific chapter I can see why you think that. Later in the story I think youll see more Rick in him than The Governor. Ill add that Ward certainly is twisted and fucked up but not heartless. Ward sees himself as lawful neutral every action he takes is to protect himself and his group and thats it. He doesnt care about anything else about anyone else. I really want the reader to see Ward as an antagonist at first. You kinda read it disjointed as in chapter  hes sorta introduced as someone who went crazy. ,writing,cmbfnry,1,t5_2qh2n

If the entire season was dumped on one fell swoop I suspect the fan response would be limited to those who were already fansthat it wouldnt have garnered new fans like me. I suspect the critics wouldnt sit through the entire thing. I suspect the sales would suffer. Rather than get a sample and decide whether or not to continue peoples only option would be a huge investment of time and money and theres just too much out there that requires less work from the audience. Youre right that there would be less casual fans but I dont think it would garner awe and respect from reviewers. At the end of the day there is still a complete work that will be respected for the immensity and cohesion but they dont need it all in one lump sum to see it. Even now with all the Star Wars movies out I do not sit down and watch them all in one go. Who has that much time to dedicate to somethingeven something they like? And youre saying you want to dump a massive amount of work down without having any backup of readers who actually know and want the work. At best itll be intimidating to potential readers. At worst theyll ignore it. You can do what you want and from your comments it seems as if youve already made up your mind. And I could be wrong. Certainly there are people out there who would prefer your method. Do what you want to do you may be onto something amazing. But be aware of the potential downfalls. ,writing,cmg89pt,2,t5_2qh2n

And if its not too revealing and detrimental to the fiction of the world how are these emotions made?Its a really nice idea and it feels quite original although I wonder if Philip K Dick might have got close to this idea maybe find out and read some of him. It could be a big project depending on how deep you want to go especially with the ethereal and metaphorical nature of emotions. If I were going to approach this I might focus on one or two core principles that are directly related to the characters and motivations and try to build a simple story first.Youll find yourself wanting to explain further and delving into that rabbithole as it suits.This reminds me a bit of the difficulties with writers who seriously approach timetravel. The paradoxes can be so complicated that a lot of writers across books film and TV just kind of put their hands up and say its time travel thats all you need to know now carry on.

Selfpublishing is an option but not one to do hastilya poorly published book can hurt your future ability to sell books to traditional publishers.You seem to really be on the ground floor here so my  piece of advice read. Read a fuckton. Specifically read the types of books youd like to write. Youll get a sense of the current market as well as tropes storytelling devices etc. Reading a fuckton will probably give you lots of ideas for your own books keep a running logidea file. When youre ready to write youll feel it. Get yourself the tools you need to writefor me it was Scrivener and the trial and error of trying different writing routines. For many its NaNoWriMo. Try to write your book. Some ideas naturally peter out. When you find The One dont stop writing. Push through the instinct to be a perfectionist vomit out a first draft in whatever time it takes you. For some its a few months others a few years. Then find critique partners and revise.But first seriously read. And start Googling your questions about the publishing industry.

If someone made a really good thing but all of their other projects were flops or unrelated did well before but are now consistently fucking up and suddenly the person has a hit then its a fluke until they show that theyve actually improved. If someone has fucked up a few times but otherwise has a consistently good track record or unrelated did poorly before but now has had a string of good projects then theyre worth listening to if they give advice. Hell theyve probably learned from the bad experiences even if they publicly blame everyone else.Besides if you let one example of someones creative failure negate a whole lot of awesome stuff youll never be happy as a writer.

The brown recluses habitat is to the west of the Carolinas westernmost point. I wont say that they wouldnt crawl their way into the Carolinas but they wouldnt go very far. Youre likely to only see them in Western NC and maybe western SC.The trouble with brown recluses is that people assume all brown spiders with big ole butts are brown recluses to the point that people claim to have been bitten by them as far north as Canada.gt The brown recluse is not only an evillooking and walking bastard but its poison can do serious damage and they are tough tough Terminatorlike things that need to be killed hard to get rid of them.Theyre recluses. The last thing they want to do is be seen let alone bite you. They look no different than most other spiders but theyre brown and have a fiddle shape on their heads although other spiders can have that too. What separates them from other spiders is that they have only six eyes.If you live where they live around here in red theres little you can do about them. Theyll always be there. Its like living in Boston and trying to avoid snow. The secret is to keep loose clothing off the floor and to check your sheets before you go to sleep. Clothes and sheets are a mess of surface area on which they can crawl and its dark and secluded. Perfect for a recluse. Shoes are cozy places for them too so checking them before slipping them on isnt a bad idea.People who are bitten by a recluse actually bitten by a recluse are likely victims of putting on clothes with a recluse hiding inside. The spider gets scared because its pressed between skin and clothing so it bites. Understandable but no fun for anyone.My biggest peeve when it comes to spiders is that people not only assume a strange bite to be a spider bite which if you didnt see the spider bite you its likely not a spider bite but they assume any brown spider is a brown recluse and any black spider is a black widow both of which want nothing to do with us. Recluses make their webs in darkness and stray only at night either to hunt or find a lady friend. Males moreso than females.

Venomous things are harmful if they bite you.,writing,cn65fb4,2,t5_2qh2n

2669972,0,t3_2qjrsq,There are two main subgenres of short story. One is the Chekhovian which you have described. It presents an event or character or series of events without organising the narrative into a plot merely presenting the situation. Real life doesnt have neat beginnings and endings and neither do Chekovian short stories. This form of short stories has been very popular in the th century especially in the US. Raymond carver comes to mind as does Hemingways In Our Time. As you may have guessed the subgenre began with the great short story writer Anton Chekhov.The other main subgenre is the eventplot short story.

2753246,0,t1_cnh0p27,Somewhat true. That doesnt mean it isnt problematic. However people were writing stories for boysgirlschildren with both male and female characters before then. Hawthornes childrens series in the th century featured women. Edgar Rice Burroughs included women even if they functioned mostly as romance plots. Few well few men  there were plenty of women who wanted to read stories about women then too would have batted an eye at an all male cast of characters no but that doesnt mean its not problematic. Just a bit more understandable given the context. But implicit bias is implicit bias regardless of time period. This isnt about blame which is always what discussions of sexism turn into.

See Bird by Bird What if? Glimmer Train Guide to FictionI cant recall if its V. or V...Just as you misunderstood what I meant by arbitrary you misunderstand what I meant by inherent.

Its no less magical that way as millions of kids will attest.Youve got to stop thinking of planning and organizing as a constraint and see it as a tool that helps make your story perfect just like spelling grammar sentence structure and every other technical detail from page count to punctuation.

2818456,0,t1_cno73y8,gt Writers block exists.On this we will have to disagree. I understand that lots of writers use writers block as a term to define when something else is going on. Writers fear is very real. Writers lazy is also very real. For a couple years I had a severe case of writers World of Warcraft. The thing that I learned earning my BA in creative writing is you can always write on more sentence. Not one teacher would accept I had writers block as an excuse for unfinished work. And thats just counting my Creative Writing classes not considering any of the papers I had to write for my other subjects.Then this solidified for me when working as a content creator for Reading Rainbow. Funny how LeVar Burton and Mark Wolfe seemed to expect me to provide weekly content for Reading Rainbow.  gt A block can exist in any profession especially those that require creativity. Anyone who thinks otherwise is just ignorant. Maybe it is something that good writers have to deal with I dont know.Heres the bottom line every day thousands of writers whether its journalists content creators or those of us who write fiction for a living go and get the work done day after day week after week year after year. In every profession you get people that will either do the work or they wont do the work. The ones that do the work are the ones who succeed in their profession creative or otherwise. As it specifically relates to writing heres something that I have in my notes from school which I keep next to my writing desk. If you understand the basic elements of craft craft will help you find your way when you are lost.gt If I want to sit down and write thousands of words of junk I can. Thats nothing to do with producing something of quality.Quantity produces quality. If you only write a few things you are doomed.  Ray BradburyActually sometimes writing crap has everything to do with producing something of quality. You never know what youre going to get until its out of your head. Every time a writer doesnt write for fear that itll be a thousand words of junk the writer fails at the most basic level...the writing.The rough draft of everything is shit.  HemingwayYou cant transform it into something great if you dont get it out in the first place.Like any job a writer will have good days and bad days. Sometimes the work will come out better than others. Thats the nature of any human activity. The trick is the more time a writer spends putting words out the more often the work will come out better in the first draft and require fewer and fewer drafts after that first one to make it publishable.gt Your comments are arrogant and ignorant.I prefer pompous to arrogant but Ill take it. I dont think ignorant applies because Im speaking from experience both educationally and professionally.

Not developing your setting or creating backgrounds for characters or even outlining the story in your head or otherwise  the thing you want to do is start writing stories and completing them as soon as you can. The reason you want to do this is because theyre going to suck. They will suck so hard that youll one day be embarrassed about them. Youll think Oh man if only I had known. But you cant know. You cant know until you write and finish and look back.Reading is also really important. It should be assumed that youre a reader if you want to really get into writing. Read everything you like and some stuff you dont like. Read it all. Develop a routine for writing. Itll make it easier on you when you hit walls which you will. Writers block is nothing more than getting stuck in your own process so streamlining the process will help you move forward. Set aside a specific time and place if you can. I write late at night before I sleep  every night at a certain time I stop doing what Im doing and write. And I write for at least an hour even if its just a sentence that I stare at for the entire time. As soon as you feel like you feel even a little comfortable with your writing join a peer group of some kind. Find a writing group or take a class. Get a buddy to exchange stories with. Some of the most useful things youll ever learn about being a writer are learned from being around other writers.Allow yourself to take critique to heart. It will hurt a lot but its necessary.Dont give up. Youre succeeding as a writer as long as you keep writing. You fail as soon as you stop writing. ,writing,cnwtj4v,3,t5_2qh2n

2941719,0,t3_2tupmd,Learn to plan your essay. That is whats going to get you through this kind of problem.What youre doing here is making the transition from simple essays  the ones that are straightforward enough to conceptualize and plan in your head  to more complex ones. And you might have resisted planning out your essays in the past but now is the time to learn the skill.Youll of course have your own spin on it but the process youre looking to develop would be something like this Ask yourself the question. Based on the text of Huckleberry Finn was Mark Twain a racist? Answer the question. Fuck no. List all the things that would convince someone else that your answer is right  like some annoying idiot in your class comes in with the exact opposite answer and you want to show everyone what a moron they are. Just list all the reasons youre right and theyre wrong He presented a more nuanced intelligent black character than anyone else was writing at the time. He was more progressive than his peers. His language was not considered racist at the time. Huck Finn is our moral compass in the novel and he isnt racist. Jim is an awesome character. The key step organize those ideas. That just means group them together but it takes some thinking to identify the connections between them. Weve got stuff about racist language and ideas from the time stuff about black characters stuff about Huck. If something is all on its own you make the call is it important enough to stand on its own? Can I find more stuff like it? If yes keep it if not chuck it.These groups of ideas are the bones of your essay. For each of those thoughts think how does this answer the question? If some idiot came up to me and said no way dude Twain was totally a bigot how would I use this to tell him hes full of shit?But the thing that keeps you on track that makes your essay make sense that makes it all work is that last bullet point. Essay writing is organization. And as you do this more and more putting your thoughts into groups and making sense of them your essays stop being sentences and start being strong convincing arguments. I hope this all makes sense and is useful. I was a TA in university and was a volunteer writing tutor for a couple of years and this was what I found most helpful both for people I was tutoring and for my own writing.

Good writers find new ways to tell those stories. Don Quixote is I think also a particularly bad example of this as the story of Don Quitoxe is inseparable from the way Cervantes told it.

Most people rarely read anything longer than  or so. Really?  How long is The Lord of the Rings?  The Wheel of Time?  The Game of Thrones series?  Fantasy readers read  pages without breaking a sweat and about arguably more convoluted subjects.gtMcCarthy who eschews quotation marks and other grammatical conventions then constantly uses obscure or foreign words including whole pages of Spanish dialogue?McCarthys not that hard to get especially with regards to his more mainstream works  The Road No Country For Old Men maybe less so with Blood Meridian.  The Spanish dialogue doesnt really make for that much of a break especially when you consider the sheer amount of people that speak Spanish in North America alone.  Ill give you his first novel The Orchard Keeper as an example of impenetrable McCarthy but everything hes written afterwards has been accessible for anyone with a high school education and a willingness to read a good story.  Pynchon and Bolano Ill give you although later Pynchon is definitely more accessible than earlier Pynchon and Bolano just takes some getting used to  once you get past the rather fragmentary nature of The Savage Detectives it flows extremely well.  Again Spanish history is not a completely foreign subject to the average reader and the idea that Spanish is outside of the frame of reference of the average North American let alone anywhere else in the world is a very whitewashed one.  Nabokov is not contemporary unless were counting Hemingway as contemporary as well.  gtYou cant spend a whole post denying the presence of elitism in literary fiction then ending it by calling nonlit fiction lowbrow and disposable.Im not calling all nonlit fiction lowbrow and disposable.

3112674,0,t1_cokl050,Well if it wasnt meant to be a lecture you certainly accomplished it  and humanely bravo. More people need to disseminate information like this as like you said I dont see how it is possible to understand mental illness without having lived it. Instead of working down point by point Ill share a bit about myself and then see if I missed anything save myself all that pesky scrolling. I was diagnosed Bipolar I  years ago during my freshman year of undergrad. Ive been on Lithium of course all of the anticonvulsants  different antipsychotics and anxiolytics  different supplements  of which I now think dont like have gingko balboa or valerian in them thanks NY which means theres probably a very obvious reason they smell like shit diets you get it. Drugs sex alcohol blah blah. My mother took me to a psychiatrist as a child because my teachers said I had a learning disability who gave me an IQ test. Diatribe IF ANY OF YALL EVER HAVE KIDS DO NOT TELL THEM THEIR IQ. It really got in my head growing up especially when I took statistics and learned what a SD was. Anyways Im not applying to Prometheus for membership or anything Im trying to paint a picture for you.  Yes I have heard real audible voices that were really not there but that is not always the case nor is it anything close to the rule  and I assure you I have educated myself very well on the subject. That being said there is a line in the sand before schizophrenia. Schizophrenia seeks to make a face for what to me is a nameless dread maybe its some backwards rationalization of creating a coherent story I am afraid but of WHAT!? However oftentimes what I describe to people as voices foreign or otherwise are seldom articulate voices and I know that to be the case with many others. When your mind is moving at that rate of speed like imagine speeding up someones voice x then playing  different monologues by them at once... you wouldnt be able to make out a word. Thats why when you hear someone say that theyre having multiple conversations with themselves at once its because its dialogical but not linguistic in the form that we normally experience  a sequence of events that at least seem to us move linearly in a specific order. In these times every thought is like a loosely associated web of relational understanding that seems to transcend your knowledge and come from without. You dont feel you deserve the credit when someone gushes over your flash of brilliance...it was just there and you absentmindedly said it. This work was actually a late night manic attempt at capturing my anxiety at being off of meds and deciding whether to start back again and juxtaposing it with Eastern Vedic schools of thought and their carefully constructed maps of the constituents of consciousness and methods for increasing volitional control of them that are being backed up by science over and over look up Evan Thompson or his father FMI. I guess its a bit of wishful thinking that a system of philosophy could help me tame my demons with my own two hands but its a beautiful idea to me so I let my imagination run a bit.

There wasnt anyone left on the street to wake up anymore either. He looked around at the houses bordering th Street and saw squat bungalows with weathertorn siding sitting on flat lawns where green grass had given way to brown desert and grey dirt. Many of the houses were barred by sheets of plywood abandoned except for knocking echoes and memories etched in fallen dust. Dotted amongst these dreary sagging bungalows were houses that had windows and doors free of barricades. These houses had vehicles parked beside them  mainly thick pickup trucks on four puddled flats  covered in dents scratches and patches of rust. The dawnlight shimmered off of them and as Tommy climbed back onto his bike and resumed pedaling his eyes were struck at intervals by the hard glint of what little chrome remained on the bodies. There was not one vehicle in good repair Gus Anderson was the last real mechanic still in Woodward and Tommy would not have trusted him to change his bike chain.

They are not fighting anything and taking over would disrupt the balance.gtIf the demons simply desire to grow their numbers through souls then what do the angels desire?gt There is a third faction which exists solely to keep balance in the universe. Their only concern is that the universe is balanced so that it remains stable and intact.Your idea doesnt seem particularly well thought out and rather inconsistent... but if your third neutralizing faction is also not really neutral and trying to eliminate both the angels and demons from upsetting the balance whatever that implies then both the angels and demons at least have a reason for recruitment somewhat because theyre being destroyed by this other faction.In saying theres no heaven or hell Im to take it that your afterlife is actually a shared plane of existence somehow though in what sense is afterlife different if people whom made no deals with either angels or demons end up there as well...?  If thats the case then theres really nothing stopping these angels and demons from forging an alliance against the neutral party who isnt really neutral either.Unless youre planning on writing from the POV of these three factions rather than the humans whose circumstances require them Im not even really sure how much of this world building will be relevant to your story or just something youre considering until you figure out what you do want to write.Is there anything stopping someone from making demonic and angelic deals?

3282869,0,t3_2xqfb1,I really like and appreciate the passion youve put into this post.  So I feel it is necessary to point out just a few things that are weakening your argument.  In the spirit of being thorough I also want to point out the points youve made very well in my opinion.  Ill also just chime in in the spirit of dialogue as its early my coffee isnt ready yet and Im feeling wordy.gt But I couldnt imagine the power you would need to give to a person in order to believe them when they said give up writing.A lot of things like this happen when wouldbe writers are very young.  Most young people put a lot of stock in what their peers  parents  guardians  teachers  etc. think about what they do.  How many perfectly smart people have you met that think theyre stupid because their teachers told them so?  Ive known plenty of painters who showed the spark of amazing talent but they stopped painting because theres no future in it. At least in America there is still a stigma attached with pursuing art as your life.  As a hobby people are stoked about it.  But if you intend to commit to it fully and completely even if you have so much talent its spilling out your ears it will still be the majority of people telling you stop doing it because its not what most people do.  So even if youre not giving power to the people in question you can easily break under the prolonged siege.gt Not everyone who writes has publication in mind. For a lot of people its therapeutic or just a hobby. Theyre not looking to turn pro but telling them to give up writing is telling them to give up something they enjoy.This is why I wish more people understood how to critique stories.  In the critique thread here I see a lot of them that are . . . well poor critiques to put it kindly.  Ive given my writing to plenty of people over the years that simply didnt understand how to critique.  Like you said not everyone is aiming to blow the world away.  It is like telling someone who likes to do puzzles to stop doing puzzles.  Let people do what they like.  However on the flip side  there is a certain breed of willfully ignorant writer who believes that everything they write even if it is jotted down on a napkin at lunch is solid gold.  So what I will say is if you write just for fun fine write just for fun but the minute you ask someone to read what youve written it ceases to be yours and has to survive on its own.  For a serious growing writer the feedback will help them improve.  For the willfully ignorant it will create hostility.  So I would say both sides need to be humble in the exchange of writer to reader.gt And as bad as the eye or Argon is Id much rather read over the top purple prose like that than a dozen chapters of perfectly serviceable prose where the main character goes for breakfast reads a paper goes to work does his job comes home has supper goes to bed and sleeps.This is your personal opinion and doesnt really help or hinder your argument.  Some people love to read a hyper realistic slice of life type of story.  Some stories like that are beautiful in their subtly  its a story about a man having breakfast and going to work but if you look beneath the surface a little bit you see a lot of complexity that is so subtle it can easily be missed.  While a really bad example because Hemingway is not a verbose purple prose writer The Sun Also Rises could be summed up as some men go to see some bullfights drink a lot see more bullfights drink a man goes in a car with a girl he used to like more bullfights and drinking a small fishing trip where the two character briefly mention the war while drinking bullfighting drinking talking to a matador.  But theres a lot more going on in that story.This also opens the door to the argument of writing as entertainment versus writing as art.  And this conversation comes up in every discussion about every artistic pursuit.  But basically what youve said is As bad as Britney Spears is Id rather listen to her over those long drawn classical symphonies.  Nothing wrong with someone who likes pop music over classical  but I think youd be hard pressed to find someone who would argue that pop music is musically  technically superior to classic symphonies.  My longdrawnout point Im trying to get at being being high octane focused on plot rather than slow plodding and focused on character development doesnt make it more or less enjoyable just different.gt At least the Eye of Argon tried to tell a story.This implies the slowermoving novels mentioned earlier are not trying to tell a story.  I think this comes from an idea prevalent in our culture of thinking that writing a difficult book or a slow moving book is going out of the way to be difficult or slow moving.  But really the end result of art is usually this someone wanted to explain something to you and this was the most direct way they knew to tell it.  The Eye of Argon tried to tell one type of story  a novel like Tropic of Cancer tried to tell a very different story.  gt Jim Theis was sixteen when he wrote the novella. Chances are your sixteenyear old prose was just a different flavor of bad.True but I do not think his age and inexperience make him immune to criticism.  My sixteen year old writing was probably just as bad but the difference is that I didnt unleash it upon the world.  As I said earlier and probably why it was crammed in earlier where it didnt belong  to set up for this part once you let a story away from you it ceases to be yours.  I will not excuse poor writing because Well the author was young  well he should have put in more time and effort before publishing then.  Now if a young person comes to me with something for critique I will be more lenient in a critique because they are young and I expect less.  But that is not the same as putting a story out and saying Hey!  Pay money for this and read it!gt  if you honestly think you can tell a beginner that they dont have any talent at all and that they should just give up now In the context of skill and technique I think youre right that no one should say this.  However if you were to meet someone who is  or  is saying how his writing is amazing and hes going to get all that writer money and he openly admits hes never read a book and doesnt really write too much just one day a month because thats all he needs . . . well someone should probably open their eyes to the reality of the situation that writing seriously is a long hard and infinitely rewarding life.  Some people might want and need the wake up call to put it on the back burner as a hobby and have a very fully and enjoyable life scribbling away little stories for himself and his friends only.  Great.  Go do that.  However if they want to make it their life that is a different person and has to abide by different rules.  Much harsher rules that require a lot more work.  But those are also the type of people that wont be easily dissuaded.  To quote John Gardner from his lovely book On Becoming a Novelistgt The question one asks of the young writer who wants to know if hes got what it takes is this Is writing novels what you want to do?  Really want to do?    gt If the young writer answers Yes then all one can say is Do it.  In fact he will anyway.,writing,cp2h2i5,6,t5_2qh2n

In essence it sounds like you have a purely selfless martyr and frankly thats just not that interesting.The simplest solution is that he becomes bossy and overbearing.  Or he is so serious and formal about his interactions its offputting for others.  These kinds of fault will lead to useful conflicts in the story like Marcus having no choice but to hang at Thomas side because of their mothers mental health but absolutely hating every moment of it.Another option it to make him a more selfish martyr.  Yes hes sacrificing so much of himself for everyone else but he makes damn sure that everyone else knows it.

3441034,0,t3_2zl6o3,Instead of trying to make your characters fall in love give them the tools to do so naturally.Give them things in common. A lot of writers forgo this in favor of opposites attract but never underestimate the power of shared interests values culture beliefs. Beyond core principles sharing a similar sense of humor can go very far.Give them reasons to enjoy spending time together. Maybe they have good conversations or maybe they coexist in silence in a way that they cant with anyone else. Maybe as soon as something happens to Elizabeth Alexander is the first person she wants to tell. Maybe eating dinner together is their routine. Maybe they have a long list of inside jokes.Why do they keep coming back to each other? Sex? Support? Comfort? A reality check?Think about the things that attract you to a partner and keep you coming back. These could be physical attractions shared interests or personality traits.A lot of this depends on what kind of relationship youre going for. If its a passionate fling then opposites attract can get that lust going. If its for the long haul looking for concrete building blocks will lend it realism.For the record and totally biased things that dont convince me the couple is worth my investment bickering as a sign of sexual tension unless theyre saving each others life conflicts that are purely external and dont stem from the characters themselves parents who just dont understand defeating the bad guy is all it takes to be happy together Big Misunderstandings that could be cleared up in two minutes if everyone just talked to each other.,writing,cpki557,2,t5_2qh2n

However you need to look at your own comments critically and realise that you can make these points without being quite so harsh.Also realise that insulting somebody is unlikely to help them.  Some people do need a kick in the ass but most people will take better to pleasant tactful criticism.  As in my case.I for one feel like were getting closer to reconciling this disagreement.  It comes down to tact vs tough love.  Ultimately my point is that your tough love has gone beyond constructive and into the realm of plain insults.You need to accept the fact that good intentions or not you have allowed your feelings to take control of your comments and it has been a detriment to the point you were trying to make.EDIT  Just one last point.  Promoting quality content is subjective.  As can be shown by the fact that I do want to hear when somebody writes their first ten thousand words and you dont.,writing,cprv6pd,2,t5_2qh2n

He always had a theory that drunkenness had a place outside of ordinary time but this was his first time to see the theory put into practice. The moments after he took a halfcurled fist to Desdemonas jaw seemed like a century.The seconds burned into his memory as her weight swung back into the corner of the countertop throwing off her balance and causing her to flail out an arm to catch herself on the edge. Her hand pushed a bowl of overripened oranges onto the tile of the kitchen shattered pottery shards and ruptured fruit littering the floor. His hand was still clenched in a fist. Baby Im s The words were almost out when she turned away from him with her hand up to her mouth. Her shoulders werent shaking and when she spoke neither was her voice. Save it. She turned back towards him for a second meeting his eyes and that was long enough for him to be afraid of her. The fear cut through the intoxication. He thought he saw a halflight there in her green eyes like the red reflection you caught off a coyotes eyes on the highway. Her hair was down falling around her face in dark waves. There was blood from her split lip smeared across her chin. ,writing,cpyf66b,15,t5_2qh2n

I always enjoyed the little nods and mentions to other characters and whatnot. Like in Bag of Bones the main character casually mentioning how his wifes favorite contemporary author is William Denbrough clearly Bill from IT continues on and doesnt bring it back up.Its the reason I would love to do this myself. With horror of course but I also plan to generally do it with romance as well since Im giving the genre a shot. As cliche as it is the main character in one Im working on is a writer. Its just not a major focus in the novel just a few mentions here or there. At the end Im thinking his novel gets picked up by a publisher. In another novel Im thinking of having a character either reading the novel or something. I had considered doing something like one main character mentioning the writer character and the other main character looking him up online like Wikipedia or something similar enough. Maybe in a sense do it to let fansreaders of that novel know what happened to the main characters after their story ended.I do plan on doing that with my stories here or there. Even if not directly such as major events of one novel relating to another or whatever I want to throw out little Easter eggs and nods to other characters or stories of mine.,writing,cq5amhf,1,t5_2qh2n

I read the story. The entire piece start to finish. Takes maybe  minutes if I am reading carefully. I read the story again making brief notes inline on things that really jump out.  minutes I read the piece again. I examine every word choice. Every piece of punctuation. Every sentence every paragraph. I look at them alone and as regards how they fit in to the larger work.  I make more detailed notations. about  minutes. I write up a review giving more descriptive feedback on the work. My critiques usually average about  words. That takes longer than the hour it takes me a slow typer to type them up. Im putting thought and effort into this editing and rearranging my comments for clarity etc. Maybe  hours.This is a typical critique for me. There are others that I dont spend as long on and it varies based on what issues are in the piece but generally Im spending .   hours critiquing your  word piece.Not professionally. For free. So Im missing things or glossing over some larger problems.Its free help.  hours words.Its your story.You should have spent more time critiquingediting your own work before I ever see it than I spend on it.So  hours words after its written before the casual critique.Then youll read the critiques or feedback from beta readers or whatever. Youll need to spend time reading your work again to compare it to the issues people brought up. Thats at least another few hours.Then you edit your own work again.

3650420,0,t1_cq8bsuv,There can be no hard rules but a modern reader will likely expect sensual experience to be limited to the reflector chatacters perception if their thoughts are routinely narrated i.e. they would expect internal focalization. The reason is that modern popular fiction tends to be immersive and the most immersive way to depict something supposedly is to depict the sensual flow as if it was being channeled straight to the reader.Again all these rules never switching your reflector never changing your mode can be broken if you have valid enough artistic reasons to do so. Just dont do it out of laziness. Keep to one PoV unless you really feel like experimenting with that keep to one mode unless you feel that taxing your readers immersion some will be ultimately worth it in that particular case. They will not be absolutely confused if you suddenly describe something out of the focal characters perceptory range but they may experience a slightly jarring sensation for a second if theres been a lot of internal focalization. ,writing,cq8di6l,1,t5_2qh2n
3651324,0,t1_cq874ei,Your comment made me think...you know even in Star Wars the perennial fictional example of an evil Empire theres little indication that the common people were really suffering so much.  Yeah some characters express resentment but theyre either involved at high levels with the political and military struggle think Anakin ObiWan Padme Bail Organa etc. etc. etc. or they live in a situation that is naturally oppressive via poverty and they conveniently blame it on the government just like real life now that I think of it think Luke and Owen.  In the instances that we see other common people under the Empire and these are rare I admit they seem to just be as you said it constantly chugging.  Just as they no doubt did under the Republic.  So it truly is a matter of perception as to whether the Empire is evil or notat a basic level theyre no more evil or good than any other comparable government.  Its at the high levels that their actions become reprehensible.Of course thats not true in every empire whether fictional or historical.  Realworld empires have a history of atrocities against common people.  But it does make you think that to a certain degree governments are interchangeable.,writing,cq8h7jx,1,t5_2qh2n

He mentions it in an interview hereBut the fact is writing a detailed accurate lengthy description of the likely horrifically traumatised emotions of a child prostitute what are you trying to do? What are you trying to offer the reader? Given that you are writing fiction and not reportage or similar.

You dont believe this applies to the traditional model as well as the selfpublishing model? Because I support the traditional over selfpublishing but I believe they are both a crapshoot. Yes talent plays into it but in the end I believe luck does as well. My point was that even if you dont become a WOOL level breakout selfpublished novelist the act of actually finishing novel after novel can be used as an indicator of success in and of itself. Most people cant bother to finish a single book much less several of them. And also given the breakout successes of the past few years who am I to say a piece of fiction I believe is incredibly mediocre isnt going to be financially successful beyond anyones wildest dreams?Thats where the crapshoot comes in. ,writing,cqhqv3r,0,t5_2qh2n

These are passed down through the generations. The Maasai also compose many songs. Women are seldom at a loss for melodies and words when some heroic action by a warrior inspires praise. They also improvise teasing songs work songs for milking and for plastering roofs and songs with which to ask their traditional god Enkai for rain and other needs.There is a wide gap between Western schooling and Maasai traditional education by which children and young adults learned to overcome fear endure pain and assume adult tasks. For example despite the dangers of predators snakes and elephants boys would traditionally herd cattle alone. If they encountered a buffalo or lion they were supposed to call for help. However they sometimes reached the pinnacle of honor by killing lions on their own. Following such a display of courage they became models for other boys and their heroics were likely to become immortalized in the songs of the women and girls.Over the years school participation gradually increased among the Maasai but there were few practical rewards for formal education and therefore little reason to send a child to school. Formal schooling was primarily of use to those involved in religion agriculture or politics. Since independence as the traditional livelihood of the Maasai has become less secure school participation rates have climbed dramatically.Read more Im no anthropologist and dont have textbooks to point you to to read about their myths songs folklore etc. but I eagerly look forward to what will someday prove you wrong as education and access to technology steadily increases!gtor the Zulu?

I know that people have complained about the rampant degeneracy of the language since time immemorial. Which makes it around  AD I guess. Before that Im almost certain that the Old Roman and Greek forefathers complained about the rampant degeneracy of Latin and Greek.English evolves. I think it is a bit unlike many other languages in that respect the language lives and breathes and its words have a darwinism of their own living and dying at the behest of the people who use it. There are so many examples of words and bits and bobs of grammar having a change in usage or meaning over time as people adapted words for uses they werent originally intended. Its glorious in a way to be part of such a vivid thriving palimpsest of a language and to watch it change and thrive under its continued use and abuse.Feel free of course to thoroughly ignore and disregard the whimsy of an old fart pottering about online and reveling in the wonder is the English language. ,writing,cqtzt8m,2,t5_2qh2n

Tropes are the blocks of writing.Also tropes are not necessarily cliche.  Writing becomes cliche when you try to take a lazy shortcut and misuse tropes as a substitute for actual plot or characterization.  Going back to the Lego metaphor just randomly sticking a bunch of blocks together doesnt make anything you have to stick them together in a way that has some purpose and structure.

One of my editors said she normally tells people NOT to show work to friends family and spouses but she gave mine a pass because he was good at critique.So it  depends.I worry more that your issue is selfconfidence. If that is true then dont share. Writing is emotional and personal. It is draining to bring characters and settings to life. Wait until the work is fully incubated and you are satisfied with its birth or needing input.Once you release a book it no longer belongs to an author  but to the reader.

Marcuss height allowed him to see over a wall the souped up motors output let it overcome difficult terrain etc. If you want to share details do it like this more often than not so it feels organic rather than jarring .Otherwise give your work a quick spelling and grammar check before asking for critique and by eye not just spellcheck as it misses incorrect words.

Depends who is funding the project who the director is what relationship you have... the list goes on and on. Theres no way to know. If youre the one making your film you have lots of creative control. Maybe all of it. But as soon as you involve a friend it dissipates.

I hate random too. Power ups that come right when the protagonist needed one and stuff like that but i have a sister which is  now but when she was younger around  she loved those. I would argue because she wouldnt find real drama and intense situations interesting but loves funny stuff and in those earlier years random seems to be often times really funny.I wouldnt want to set those back as bad writing because for her it could be the best book ever and rightfully so. Its always important what the author was trying to accomplish and there is a saying in philosophy that when in doubt you should always go the favorable route for the author.So having that in mind i would argue that all of those are good ideas to create conflict.

A onepage summary becomes a  page guide to what each scene should contain usually without dialogue or details  just be sure to hit these points in this scene and hit these other points in the next scene.

Thats actually...I dont even know how to phrase how not right that kind of thinking is. People and this includes autistic people. Theyre not magical species dont conclude theyre transgender because they dont like the way male clothing feels and what does male clothing even mean in a world of boyfriend jeans and plaid shirts?. In fact whats female about a tank top and sweatpants? Half the boys I know wear those on the regular. And the fact that hes autistic wouldnt drive him to that sort of conclusion either. Heres a blog post on how gender variance actually works on the autism spectrum.Honestly theres something very very shallow about using autism to explain away the fact that this character thinks he might be trans but hes actually not! If you want to go that route there is no reason why a legitimate mental disorder that millions of people struggle with should be implicit in him so fundamentally misunderstanding what it is to be trans. Sure theres a correlation between autism spectrum disorder and gender dysphoria but a its usually FtM not MtF for complex reasons that involve the neurobiology of both phenomena and b a good number of people on the AS actually experience dysphoria. They dont wear male clothing and conclude that they do.Are you autistic andor trans? If not maybe you should run your idea past actual autistic people and actual trans people and actual autistic trans people.

The last straw was the chapter in Book  where there is an entire conversation between to dwarves in a language that the POV character couldnt understand.Instead of focusing on nonverbal cues to rely the salient points of the exchange to the reader the author simply gives the entire exchange in the nonEnglish language.

4235435,1,t1_cs2wdqp,Ill respectfully disagree with this. That the excerpt comes across as cold or rather clinicalits certainly not cold I mean he states very clearly his pain and ambivalence is perfectly natural. People often write about grief this way and behave this way outwardly. The writing is merely the carefully curated product of a lot of inner turmoil the writers focused attempt to organize the chaotic. It doesnt need to be roiling with agony because most of the agony is in the subtextand I at least do see that subtext there. TimeLoopedPowerGamer strikes me as a plotoriented writer maybe working in genre fiction if the flair is any indication. Which is absolutely fine but you TechnoMigration appear to be after something a little different although it does have genre trappings. A whole conflict built on psychological trauma wont have the same objectives as one thats just about a crashed spaceship. So I will say that for me as someone who does not normally read genre fiction this is a functional narrative and things do happen. In proper context if this is consistent with the guys behavior and worldview in situations not involving grief it would not damage my relationship with him. Its all in the readers priorities I dont need to get my satisfaction from the next tangible event especially in only two paragraphs because Im getting it from parsing out the narrators words and trying to separate whats being stated from the reality that lies beneath itwhich I assume is your goal. Its not without its flaws but I dont think those flaws are what the user above says they are.Where I will agree is in the analysis of some of the basic premises.  years is an incomprehensibly long time and I think it would be impossible for either you or I to properly envision what that would feel like. Maybe a few hundred would be more reasonable. Also if this is a speciesand really at that point it would almost be its ownthat has forgotten death its also forgotten grief. So it seems like the conflict would be less about dealing with grief and more about identifying the feeling in the first place.Finally that second paragraph does get too abstract I also had to do a doubletake to realize you were still using jungle as a metaphor. Metaphor makes sense in the first paragraph as the narrator struggles to come to grips with something that cant be approached any other way.

4251851,0,t3_39lryy,Its worse to have a bad agent than no agent its worse to be badly published than unpublished. A good agent is an agent who has sold books that you have heard of. A good publisher is one that publishes books you have heard of. For some books a very small publisher is the right decision. And for a lot of people selfpublishing is a good decision. But if you go with a very small publisher it should be one that has a clear niche and that works really hard on the books they publish  not just some guy. And if you selfpublish then dont go through some other company to do it. An agent or publisher that has a listing in Writers Market is not necessarily legit. And be extra cautious about any publisher that advertises in the magazines for writers.If a publisher says you dont need an agent to submit to them they may have eighteen months worth of poorlyorganized slush. Query agents rather than letting your manuscript slip through the cracks. Its very easy to let the glamour of being a published writer blind you to the warning signs of a scam or a bad deal.

Some books are fun and nothing else and thats totally fine! while others are rich with ideas expressed in prose that pushes and experiments with the very workings of our language not always fun to read though. Some books do both completely others stay in one camp and flirt with the other. The best writers of course ignore this distinction and just write. But it did bother some Graham Greene is a great example. He initially tried to divide his works into lighter entertainments thrillers involving guns murder and intrigue and his serious novels dealing with love anxiety and theology. In the end he gave it up and wrote ripping novels full of ideas and intrigue where the characters hover on the edge of damnation wrestling with God and the gun. By comparison a John le Carre spy thriller might have a similar plot to a Greene novel but more straightforward prose and less moody introspection. ,writing,cs7tida,3,t5_2qh2n

Try not to write on your bed where you sleep or in front of the TV. Maybe choose a park bench a coffee shop or a favorite chair with the TV off. Somewhere relaxing but focused. Make a place where writing happens and try to keep it pure.Schedule time to be in that place. No word count goals just time to be there and a decision not to do anything but possibly write. If the writing doesnt happen try noncritically reading not editing some previous material. See if that oh this comes next thing happens. Thats a good starting point.If the ideas dont flow let them not flow and enjoy some silence. Take time before the next scheduled session to gather writing prompts from the internet or your notebook of ideas you do keep one of those right?. Plan on taking a crack at one of those with a focus on making something short and complete.Dont try too hard to think of plots or do any heavy brainstorming when at the place where the actual writing happens.

The only way to change the process of how a PresidentPrime Minister would be elected would be to amend the Constitution. In my brief reread over the process it can be changed simply by Congress and the ratification process  the PresidentPrime Minister does not have the power to approve or veto this  The process of making laws generally involves the person the idea came from a citizen or an actual Congressional Representative then various members of Congress then the PresidentPrime Minister.  Taking the PresidentPrime Minister out of the picture and their ability to veto the only way a bill would NOT become a law is if it was passed from Congress to the PresidentPrime Minister who doesnt sign it or do anything with it and ten days passes AND Congress is not in session. Taking the PresPM completely out of it the bill would become a law. Then people could take it to court arguing its unconstitutionality and it would go up the court system until it reached the Supreme Court. The SC would then decide if it was constitutional or not which would then affect the original law if the law was to be found unconstitutional.I hope this makes sense Im tired and way out of it.,writing,csx16hq,2,t5_2qh2n

4497091,0,t3_3coj0h,So this is something I found had been lacking in my own writing for certain characters. Here was my solution I called it a character portrait but it could be called whatever you want. Before preferably you start writing a character ask yourself these questions.What does this character want? People are motivated by their desires so give your character some desires.What is this character trying to do? Presumably the plot you are writing includes something that your character is trying to accomplish. What is that and why are they trying to do that? Answering this one prevents Hunger Games syndrome where stuff just happens to an aimless character.What does this character like? If they like snowboarding they will probably think about it occasionally and you can use this as an opportunity for adding depth to the character.What does this character dislike? Same as above.What makes this character angry? Anger is an important part of a character how far dose something have to go to trigger them. What is it that they have a violent reaction to?Finally with the above questions answered write a paragraph about your character. Just summarize who they are and how the different aspects of their personality play together. And remember you dont have to do this for every character but it really helps flesh out the personality of important characters in your story.,writing,csxij7z,3,t5_2qh2n

You can also offer them a free digital copy of your book if theyd like to review it in advance.Independent bookstores survive because they curate content for their readers  I doubt theyll mind getting the call.I would not arrange a torrent. However I do think you should personally find reviewers willing to do an honest review in exchange for a digital copy. Perhaps try to contact the reviewers on comp titles. Otherwise you might consider placing an ad on rbooks offering the deal as described. My understanding is that promotional posts are not allowed but ads would be  perhaps check with the mods if youre unsure.I believe goodreads also allows you to give copies away as part of a contest if readers add your book to their to be read shelf.And lastly you might consider a contest for people who buy books within certain dates  it could include a signed poster of the cover access to your group of betareaders etc. etc.,writing,csy44g1,2,t5_2qh2n

Hold yourself to two weeks so you have a definite end point and you dont let yourself go off the deep end making all sorts of crazy edits. Then hand that draft . off to a trusted first reader or two. Leave it in their hands for a couple months and DONT TOUCH your draft until you get their comments back. Dont even look at it. Once you get EVERYONES comments back go over all of them together one after another. STILL dont make any changes to your manuscript until youve read all the comments from everyone.

Try writing something morbid or scary. You need to get out of your comfort zone. It might not be the best story but the more you write the better you get. And that led me to my next point. WRITE! Get people to read over your story and give you some constructive criticism. Probably the hardest thing about writing is having someone rip your story to pieces. Although its hard it is totally necessary to become better. ANd since you asked for some books. Might I suggest Classics. Its a reason they have stayed at the top of the list for decades.

The dialogue between characters was easy to follow and I was getting a basic feel for the distinctive characters despite the short excerpt. I had a few suggestions for improvement The title doesnt seem to work. I know this is a short excerpt without even touching on the application Karens team is developing but the title doesnt seem all that interesting. I use reverse lookup to figure out where a telemarketer is calling from for example. There are a few times where your characters use internal dialogue but it isnt distinctive from the rest of the text so it gets a bit confusing. I found it difficult to understand Karens reaction to her halfsisters arrival and subsequent request. At first she seemed casual about the entire thing as it wasnt really her problem  she was abandoned by Soo Mi many years ago after all. She reads the letter and suddenly Soo Mi is family and Karen is willing to sidetrack her life. There was a large leap from home being where she was raised in Canada to her feeling like home was in Korea. I think this would work better if you were able to describe Karens identity struggle a bit more.Please keep in mind these suggestions are merely from a laymans perspective.

4673321,0,t3_3ey68d,Its also about power. The only reason Fiddy Shades is successful is because the dude was rich which is hot money on a man is like makeup on a woman. Imagine if instead of a billionaire it had been a homeless guy. The attraction comes in feeling special. Its the Disney narrative someday my prince will come. Its the idea that theres a guy who could have any amount of women but he chose me. A homeless guy couldnt have any amount of women and therefore wouldnt make the protag feel special rather shed feel like an object of desperation.In Twilight heres a guy with superhuman strength youth etc. and he wants me. He wants to drink my blood really bad but since Im so special to him he wont.As you pointed out the series are popular because theyre designed to let you vicariously live the experience of being special to men far beyond what youll ever achieve. But deep down you know that some day your prince will not come. It will be a fairly normal guy with a fairly normal job who fancies you. Reading these types of books is just suppressing that reality.Edit Im not trying to say that theres anything wrong in wanting a good man.

4675515,0,t1_ctjv9fg,Telling rather than showing is when you simply tell the reader that a character is say nervous instead of showing them how he is nervous. Does he fidgit? Does he glance around taking stock of entrances and exits in to the rooms? Does he watch every little movement out of the corners of his eyes as if he expects someone to attack him?If your character is sad does she sigh and look down at her feet unable to look up and meet the eyes of people around her or does she sob openly? Telling has its place like when you need to deliver a bit of imformation that isnt very important or you need to skip over details. For instance if your characters are tavelling somewhere and nothing happens on the journey you can simply say that. But especially when talking about your character and their emotions and how and why they act or react a certain way in a scene you should show the reader rather than tell them because it has a much bigger impact and makes for more vivid and direct prose.So for Huey who is following Jazmine carefully to make sure she doesnt do something what does carefully entail? What is it that hes afraid will happen? Does he follow her around with his arms out to catch her if she stumbles in her new fragile human body or does he watch her every action from a distance as if he doesnt trust her and is afraid shes going to attack them?By detailing how hes acting you can have Jazmine and the reader infer his reasoning and you dont need to hop inside his perspective at all.,writing,ctjwd4n,1,t5_2qh2n

There is no general advice for writing women because all women are different. Im not trying to get preachy just bear with me. Youre not trying to understand them as mothers artists teachers bullies etc like you would if you were writing your male soldier youre trying to understand them as women and I think thats your first mistake. Do you see the difference? There is the implication that all women are the same and while the male soldier is defined by the fact that he is a soldier in the trenches not that hes a man a womans defining characteristic is being a woman. And thats not how you should write characters. Thats backwards. Start with the person if you need to you can add womanspecific experiences or feelingsdesires whatever you decide those things are. But just work on making the best character you can first. gtI realize the five main characters are basically only distinguishable by their names.Im sure you realise that this is a much bigger problem than your inexperience with women and I would definitely work on that before you try to fight for gender equality in literature. ,writing,cubvt1i,3,t5_2qh2n

No the point is to have an excuse for some witty banter to show how the cast goes about assembling a plan maybe to cut together a snappy montage. Meanwhile were very sneakily being told about all these obstacles so that when theyre actually encountered later we dont have to slow down the action with explanation. The mechanisms of structure should be invisible to the audience but they still have to be there. What youre doing is only a sin if you cant dress it up and make it entertaining or functional in some other way. Maybe different characters have different takes on the antagonist.

4951110,0,t3_3ipzmu,We would probably need more context to answer this effectivelyWhats the goal? What sort of conflict characterizes the climax if not external?but at its most basic level a climax doesnt have to involve anything in particular. All plot is a series of questions you generate in your reader and then answer. So if the question is simply What will she learn? or How will she change? then you dont need other people around to answer that. You do though need to make sure that the answers to those questions have real weight. As uELSeltz mentioned it has to be very very clear whats at stake what bad things will happen if she cant learn or change in some way. It has to be equally clear though what the implications will be for success. What obstacles in her life that were previously impassable can now be overcome?You also have to be sure that the turnaround the exact moment of the climax where the breakthrough is made and the big question answered is executed in a way that really relishes its place as the end of a long journey. You as the writer have known how it was going to end for a while its maybe become sort of old hat to you and youll be tempted to understate it unconsciously. But for the reader this moment will be brand new and you have to present it in a way that is triumphant and joyousor devastating depending on the sort of novel youre going for.

5012629,0,t3_3jd7er,The more predictable a word is in a given context the faster we process it. This does not have to do with word frequency but with predictability. When we see dialogue tags we expect the word said. It is very predictable and therefore very easy to process. It is virtually invisible. But its not fully invisible. Comparegt I just dont get. Im the pretty one.withgt I just dont get it Jane said. Im the pretty one.you probably felt a slightly longer pause in the second one.Notice that the frequency of a word will correlate with predictability but isnt determinative. So the words the be of and and similar words will tend to be processed very quickly. But in some contexts they will appear in an unlikely situation and cause a little brain hiccup that youll stumble over they demand a little extra processing time.Considergt the bell rang and Jeffrey sat down at his desk.andgt the bell rang and Jeffrey sat down at his cat.The word cat has basically the same frequency as desk but the second sentence probably caused a little pause when you hit the word cat because you didnt expect it there. Low predictability in context.Considergt Jeffrey bent down and petted his cat.andgt Jeffrey bent down and petted his hat.Another very interesting phenomenon here is that the predictability is a very good inverse metric of informativeness. A phrase that is  predictable conveys no information. In the above examples the petting of the cat was not as informative as the petting of the hat. This is a strange thing to do and we will file this information away for later. Jeffrey has petted a hat. There might be something strange going on with Jeffrey or with the hat but in either case something novel has occurred here.Consider also how this works in casual conversationgt Hey how are you?gt Good man how are you?This conveys almost no information. It is the expectedpredictable response. The informativeness of the answer depends on how far it deviates from the standard response.Just like how you can virtually ignore said your brain can and will virtually ignore the canned response in a conversational context.

They drifted along like ducks being pushed along the edges of the water by the wind. On this hot summer day the crisp dead leaves seemed to become even crispier which was a mystery in itself. I pushed my forehead into my arms that rested against my knees my backside against a tree. The sun bore down on my skin the nape of my neck was wet with sweat my fingernails dirty my skin warm and tight. It was the densest part of summer when the height of the evening was only noon and the sun stopped being a sun around eleven at night. Even in the shade of this tree the sun escaped through the leaves and attacked at my sanity. The trees around here were never big enough to hide under so I had become used to it. Still sucked though. I never chose to be out here. To be honest I would rather be in some suckers house mooching off their food as they hear my poor homeless sob story. But of course its hard to persuade someone to let a dirty teenage girl into their home.The creak of a screen door sounded followed by the click and brushing of a wood door. Get out of here youre scaring my kids! A vehemently grumpy middleaged man shouted from his small porch.

If so divide those actions up among a team. Split her personality and assign each action or related actions a name. Then read through and try to give motivations for each name. Once you have motivations for a team of characters you may get some conflict and relationship tensions. Only add one or two flaws to each name.I hope that helps.

5310603,0,t3_3nqiww,Im a hardcore planner. I know the beginning middle and ending of the story before I ever begin writing. Every scene has a defined objective and has a specific means of transitioning to the next one. I brainstorm a lot day dream a lot and I write it all down and pick the golden nuggets out of the mud and throw the junk ideas into a scraps folder for potential later use. I then arrange my ideas into a cohesive and logical order that tells a story. I keep doing this keep brainstorming and exploring every day dream and every idea until I am comfortable enough with what I have to begin writing.Of course good ideas are always coming so I have ways of adapting and organizing new ideas as they come. So this means my outline is fluid and adaptabl and thus its easier to stick to than a rigid one.Having an outline I feel brings a story to a higher level. It helps tremendously with mapping out complex ideas and drawing correlations between story elements and characters. You can see the complex relationships at work. Characters and choices made in chapter  have a catastrophic impact on what happens in chapter  for example. An outline lets you see and understand this. Complex ideas become tangible and it is easier for me to understand and work with them.The first draft is pretty much just adding prose and tone to the ideas I have.

As I think of something related to one a card I open up the card and write it on the back  you can write a fair bit on the back.If I get to the point that I want to convert one of these to a story I create a new board for that story. In some cases I link to the new board my main writing board.

I think a lot of people have the misconception that your first draft will be good and it scares people away because they feel like their writing isnt good enough for that. The first draft of someones twentieth book probably isnt good but that is what editing is for.Honestly I think the most important thing to do right now is just to write.

5385189,0,t3_3os147,Whats your goal?If your goal is to make lots of money screenwriting is certainly the most likely to be lucrative ... but its also the most competitive. A screenplay pays a better minimum than say a novel or radio play. But only a few dozen movies get produced each year and probably another couple hundred get optioned but never produced. Compare that with the thousands of novels published a year? You might make more money with a screenplay but you probably have a better chance of making money with a book. Do you want control of your work? Forget film tv or plays. Those are collaborative art forms and the writer is just one part of a larger group of contributors. Of course if youre getting published by a publisher your editor will have some say but you will have more control as the writer of a novel than you ever would as a writer of a film. And of course with books theres always selfpublishing through ebooks which is on the rise. Do you want to tell the story in a particular form? I.e. if you want the story to be a tv series write a tv series. Dont write a book and hope that someone wants to turn it into a tv series. Thats like dating Mary because you really want to go out with Marys sister Janice. Forget Mary ask Janice out. Most importantly dont spend your time deciding in which form youll work spend your time writing. A completed radio play is better than an unwritten idea that could work as radio play tv series film or novel. A completed work in any form is always better than an unfinished idea. ,writing,cw00ob4,2,t5_2qh2n

If you put your words on the internet for free dont be surprised when you see them someplace else.From Wordpresss terms of servicegtBy submitting Content to Automattic for inclusion on your website you grant Automattic a worldwide royaltyfree and nonexclusive license to reproduce modify adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying distributing and promoting your blog. This license allows Automattic to make publiclyposted content available to third parties selected by Automattic through the Automattic Firehose for example so that these third parties can analyze and distribute but not publicly display your content through their services. You also give other WordPress.com users permission to share your Content on other WordPress.com websites and add their own Content to it aka to reblog your Content so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website the reblogging function on WordPress.com does this automatically!. If you delete Content Automattic will use reasonable efforts to remove it from WordPress.com but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.So this is better than facebook but youre still giving them the right to use your content however they like as long as it promotes your blog. Likewise anyone on wordpress also can share it. If it ends up someplace else on wordpress and you dont like it your only recourse is to delete your content. Even then they dont guarantee the fix. So if John Scalzi tears one of your posts on his blog theres nothing you can do as long as he gives you credit.Pretty much any free blogging service is going to have something like this. Thats part of the point of blogging. You put the ideas out there like dandelion seeds to the wind. Theyre supposed to give credit but that doesnt always work out or things get reblogged so may times you cant see the bottom. You still have the copyright which is created automatically you make anything of nominal artistic value again I am not a lawyer but I had lunch yesterday with someone who is not yet a lawyer but passed the bar but when you make an agreement for someone else to host your ideas for free something like this is usually in the details. To say nothing of the agreements to indemnify waiving your right to a trial in favor of arbitration etc that are at the end of every TOS these days including wordpress.If what happened to OP happens to you that might be a violation of your copyright if it wasnt a wordpress site that did it. You can take legal action but the best you can expect is for them to take the content down. I dont think youd even be reimbursed for legal fees INAL.

Id be more inclined to agree with you if I saw perhaps a few examples of writers abiding rules at the expense of their story.The reason I tend not to agree is because any writer worth their salt knows not to do exactly what youre saying they already do. What kind of writer jettisons common sense that it is okay to explore elements of style so long as they lend themselves to the story? Ill tell you who. Novice writers. Teenagers elderly and incompetents. I feel like a lot of times well see a good piece of advice and want to be included in the conversation so well agree with it but add the caveat that True but dont overdo it! Im sorry but no shit.

5401176,0,t3_3p0dup,gt Its either George R.R. Martin Food Descriptions or Red Wedding Asoiaf books have a lot of stuff going on in them all the time. There are dozens of plot points happening in the first few hundred pages of GoT alone. Aside from food descriptions things never stop happening and thats what you probably want. Consistent pacing means that the story keep unraveling with a consistent rhythm. Its more like a wave. It can be going through the whole book or an act or a chapter. Most likely all at the same time.Few example Harry Potters first chapter. First ramp or wave is in Vernon Dursleys pov. Things start relaxingly Vernon going to work. Then things get weirder more exciting he encounters weird people on his way to work. Then it culminates with something really interesting and overall storyrelated happening he hears the name Potter Muggles sees news about shooting stars and owls and stuff. Then it changes to Dumbledores POV. And it also has a wave to it. First he arrives then he does the first magic we see and encounters a shapeshifting friend flying motorbike and such then we actually get the first real hook of the story The Boy Who Lived. All that fit in a slightly bigger plot ramp that is the first chapter.And thats only the first chapter like ten pages at best and things continue this way. And you get a bigger wave that is the first act and theres an even bigger wave that is the whole story. Thats what keeps things consistent. Interesting stuff happens all throughout the story but its at the last act where they get very exciting. Slow ramp just means that the things should gradually grow more exciting but should be as interesting throughout. Even socalled filler or fluff can serve their purpose. They can discharge the situation add humor foreshadow future events and so on.,writing,cw22663,2,t5_2qh2n

When I get stuck on a major plot problem I find a solution and start writing from the beginning again. I do this until the story is finished which hasnt happened yet.

5421006,0,t3_3p6v5l,I did and sometimes still do the same for a long time. The easiest answer is just write thats it. Dont go back over what youve done that can be done when you come to editing time dont try and find different words for things dont feel the need to know everything before you start. A book short story or whatever has a way of writing itself as you go along. Some of the things Ive written have come out completely different to the way that I envisaged them when I began. They just seemed to develop and grow as I typed things would come to me either at the time or the next day when I would think about it. Its really easy to get bogged down in overanalysing the minutiae of your story but really I find that its just an excuse to hold back a bit longer. Just take that leap of faith dont think about it dont fret about it just go. The more you get done the more youll want to do. After a short while youll be dying to get back to it every day  night. I write about    words a night depending on how good the flow is going but I dont hold myself to it. Some nights it might only be  words sometimes it could be over  as long as I get something done then Im happy because Im moving forward. Speaking of which I really should get back to it...

If it doesnt work for you to wake up earlier and write or write after work then it doesnt work. All the articles in the world insisting that making time to write is as simple as you make it wont help if you find it just doesnt fit your rhythm.Edit depending on your work environment if youre allowed to write on paper and leave with it Id suggest doing that at your desk too even if its just making notes about scenes or characters.,writing,cw7fqf7,3,t5_2qh2n

I am not going to let her get away with much that takes me out of the narrative at least not until shes earned it by showing me that her way gives me an even more engaging experience e.g. Douglas Adams.In the hands of most authors quick pictures of what anything looks like that arent what the character would be noticing in that moment and how they would be noticing it only serve to remind me its just a story.,writing,cwoe7wt,1,t5_2qh2n

Insert random Spanish phrase as he tries to communicate and then the other character could be trying to tell him he doesnt understand what he is saying. You could have funny moments where he says obviously in Spanish I told you that wasnt a good idea or something of the like. Your reader wont know what it means unless they look it up but you could add a list of his most common phrases to the back of the book? Exactly like when writers create new words and give you a list at the back of a book explaining their meanings. Instead you have lots of interesting wordssayings to draw from without having to make them up.

The negative is youll probably make significantly less money with this degree than with civil engineering.

They may be important to the plot but its almost never relevant to go into a blowbyblow of every single action. Depending on what youre writing violent scenes can have a more longlasting impact on the story though. If a character loses a hand that affects him a lot more than than the last time he got his rocks off you know unless he was somewhere he wasnt supposed to be with someone he wasnt supposed to be with so some things need to be said. Overall I try to keep the details trimmed down to just what the readers need to carry away from the scene.On a technical level a lot of it depends on how your point of view character is viewing the fight and what kind of person he is. The words you use should reflect that.If hes hot for it you might say Freddie drove the keys down into Kyles neck in a brutal fullarm swing that ended with metal buried in the soft tissue under his jaw.If hes frantic to defend himself you could say instead Freddie scrambled desperately to line the keys up as Kyle leaped onto him. The bigger mans own momentum carried him forward impaling him through the throat on the stubby pieces of metal between Freddies fingers.If hes a coldhearted hardass maybe it would be more like Freddie swatted aside Kyles wild swings with contemptuous ease. It was so easy to read the thugs movements he could have done it blindfolded. He palmed his car keys into his hand and ended the fight with a quick simple jab into Kyles throat.,writing,cx1n6qc,3,t5_2qh2n
5689462,0,t1_cx29s1s,Let me preface by saying I am not perfect. Ideally I would like critique to be on the level that I try to give. That is when I critique I started with the notion that I should edit peoples work down to the phrase. That I believe now is foolhardy and makes a lot of work for me critiquing as well as doesnt do anything for the person being critiqued.Something Neil Gaiman has said has stuck with me. He said that if someone tells you something seems wrong or off they are almost always right. If they tell how to fix it they are almost always wrong.I still give my suggestions on how to fix things but I realize why Neil Gaiman said that second part now. Suggestions are helpful they will often generate new ideas or trigger lightbulb moments. That is why you should consider peoples idea on how to fix things. Others advice should almost never be taken verbatim though because it is told from a perspective that has a completely different color palette.Indulge me in expanding that analogy. You think that the sky I painted with tones of blue pink and purple seems off somehow. I want to paint a sunset but you see it for Aurora Borealis You think I should add green tones. So I do but I end up with something like this. You still dont like it and I dont like it either. We were trying to create two different things. As a result my painting ended up being not what I wanted and a mess disclaimer I dont think anything I linked was a mess.Now I wouldnt seek to critique Neil Gaiman but I think what he meant with that quote is that if they tell you how to fix something it probably is not right for you.,writing,cx2bzzq,2,t5_2qh2n

Trying to understand the process the reason they chose you and what they could possibly gain from it all are all just distractions. In the end they keep you from doing what you enjoy.We all have to face the hard truth that not everyone will like what we create.

Honestly though I think that to say a fantasy series like HP or ASOIAF doesnt speak true to people as people is a bit silly. Maybe the greatest ability of a good author is writing realistic characters and Ive found a great deal of relatable characters in the fantasy genre. ASOIAF is possibly my favorite series to date and the characters are in my opinion well deserving of the praise they receive for being realistic as opposed to being easyvapid like you mentioned.That being said I didnt enjoy Hunger Games for reasons similar to what you described although admittedly I probably have a bias against it due to the sheer amount of identical storytelling thats come out altogether.

If you play by ear youve probably spent a lot of time picking out songs of the players you think are really good.

5849426,0,t3_3vaexo,I received a lot of criticism for my book though it was couched in fairly polite terms.When someone complained about grammar structure or spelling it was almost universally valid.  When someone criticized a plot point I sometimes realized that I was perhaps jumping to incorrect conclusions or was trying to be more clever than my writing skills allowed.  Usually though it simply served to tell me that I was not properly presenting the plot point.  When someone criticized a character choice I made it generally revealed that I failed to show the reader some important detail or another.I do not write with much ego though.  I write better than most people but worse than most writers.  Because I am certain that Im far from perfect Im perfectly willing to entertain the idea that a reader who cared enough to criticize probably has some merit to their complaint.  So far at least.Lets see how well my attitude of Im doing this for fun and to get better at it holds after another book or two.,writing,cxmdzkg,2,t5_2qh2n

These people most people I think dont want to write a book. They want to have written a book. Writing a book is painful exhausting selfdeprecating and very hard.

As another redditor said sometimes in nonfiction you can get a contract with just a proposal. But for fiction? Theres so many unpublished authors out there pitching completed revised manuscripts why would any agent or editor waste time on the unfinished stuff? Plus tons of people start writing books. Very few finish them. Even less revise them and perfect them. So like everyone said finish your book. And read other books in the process. Polish your novel through multiple rounds of revisions and beta readers.

How far should medical science go and should we really live forever? What is the difference between treason and attempts to restart a failed government?Once I have a few good themes that mesh together I then focus on what scenes I can write that pose these questions to the reader making them think about it as they read.From those specific scene ideas I begin stringing them together by filling in the gaps with plot details. Once I have a meaningful plot sort of figured out I imagine which types of characters would find themselves thrusted into these kinds of scenes against their will. Their struggle to explore answers to these themequestions and what their reactions are is what the story is all about. Each character will answer these themequestions uniquely thus coming into conflict with each other.But it all starts with the meaning of the story.

Its one thing to draw for those things its another for him to say its part of the Flash Gordon universe the sequel to  A Space Odyssey or is about the time Robin Hood was transported into space to continue his capers.

5978192,0,t3_3xbiv5,gthow do I choose something uncommon or different enoughIn my experience names that sound good are actually the ones that sound familiar. After a while the reader can warm up to actively abnormal names but initially completely invented names that dont look like anything from the real world sound obviously madeup and stupid.On the other hand common names sound a bit silly in Fantasy settings. The most common ways are either using rare names from your culture using names from another culture Russian names seem kinda popular with Fantasy writers right now for example or inventiongenerating new names according to real world templates e.g. stuff likeinventing as I typeJoah Braffick Manna Flysh.A single best way to do this has not been invented. Tolkien of course has managed to establish very recognizable and influential name patterns for his invented cultures but he basically used the combination of the last two methods. And some names he simply lifted from existing fiction like most names from The Hobbit including Gandalf.General desirabilities to character naming do exist though The name must be easy to memorize. Youre going to refer to the character by name only for the majority of your text as you well should and if theres any confusion about whos who readability will suffer. The name must be easy to internally vocalize. It doesnt really matter how beautiful it sounds when pronounced correctly either at least until youre selling rights for the screen version. Characterization through the name is always a thing regardless of the writers intent. The reader will read into the very sound and make assumptions about the character from their name. The reader knows that the name has been chosen arbitrarily and will expect it to be subtly meaningful. Names better be a part of a naming system or convention. Pick one system and keep to it. Only step out of it intentionallyto produce an effect of unusualness or foreignness.,writing,cy39sry,1,t5_2qh2n

6020733,0,t1_cy8ts4a,Thats a fair point but I dont necessarily think reading a book you hate provides negative influences. The reason I wish to read widely is basically to cherry pick the parts that do work for me even whenif I hate the rest. For example Im writing a science fiction novel but if I stuck to just reading sci fi and fantasy then I feel my creative foundation would be incredibly restricted. Given the type of story Im writing Ive spent a bit of time reading things like longwinded spy thrillers and Jane Austen novels and even if I dont enjoy these novels on the whole I am still able to take on board several new ideas as well as a demonstration of how these ideas have been executed. I can then utilise these ideas in a way that does work for me. And if theres nothing I like about what Im reading then sure Ill be happy to disregard that shit entirely.So thats basically my process. And I kind of expect it to be painful and arduous at times because I dont ever want to feel like Im not reaching my potential.

6217637,0,t1_cywdaje,The best advice I can give about a first book is dont follow it off a cliff. I have friends who know better who have been pitching their first attempt at a novel for the past ten years now. You can send it out because thats what people do but dont put more energy than you need to in it. Keep writing. If this wasnt your first book Id say dont write the series until the first book sells but because it is go ahead and work on the rest of the story. You may have to come to terms that it wont be your first fourth seventh or tenth book that sells and if you havent written the one that does youre stuck.As to the critique I used to say go join a critique group but you shouldnt do that until you have your voice nailed down and that might take several books. The last thing you want to do is learn to write by committee. Finding a partner at or just above your level is always a better idea but again the wrong advice wont just have no effect it will have a negative one. Learning how to critique is as hard as learning how to write. Id suggest joining a critique group for you if not your book. Rather than getting your stuff critiqued at a level you may not be ready to hear Id suggest joining a group but try to read three other peoples first books while you keep writing on your new stuff. Most people do not come away from their first critique hearing anything theyre ready to understand. Its great that the book is written. Its probably not a great book. When you have read several books by other writers reread your book and try to see if the common mistakes you saw running through other peoples work show up in yours.And if you cant see them dont worry about it. Even when you know the Dunning Kruger effect is a thing youre still susceptible to it. I work as a writing coach and I walk people through basic mistakes that theyre still making in their third or fourth book. Until you see the mistakes youre making you cant fix them.  ,writing,cywdn5g,4,t5_2qh2n

There are a number of hybrid authors who both selfpublish and traditionalpublish.However I wouldnt say its a certainty and crucially the publishers also have to approach you about that book or serial on Wattpad or whatever. You also have to show an audience most people forget that Andy Weir was a professional writer before The Martian of about twenty years standing. Many people putting work out as selfpubbed writers and posting here on this forum dont have that experience and so suggesting that you can selfpub a book and then take that same book to a publisher without an issue is actually a bit misleading. You cant post your shovelware on Amazon then go to a publisher while first rights can be comfortably sold by a writer on spec reprint rights are only as valuable as a publisher appraises them to be. The ball is in their court at that point not yours.The submissions guidelines for short stories are also much more unambiguous most outlets dont take previouslypublished work.

Thats    for what was essentially one song with  remixes of the same song tacked on. Then napster came along and you would rather spend hours downloading that song for free than pay what was in those days quite a lot of money for something like a song. Then there was the films on tape that we would have to wait months for after the US had seen them. Then when we could all watch them at the same time as everyone else we downloaded them for free. This is actually still a problem case in point John Wick wasnt released until relatively recently in UK cinemas when they advertised on facebook the comments section was full of people claiming theyd seem in months ago. How much must they have lost in UK cinemas from the delay.The point is a lot of people download because of the stupidity of the industry. The music industry has almost got it together because they were hit first I can buy a song for less than  these days and its usually quicker and simpler to do it legally so thats what I do. On the other hand the people of tv and movie land are still needing to get their shit together. Again in the UK Game of thrones isnt aired outside of sky TV which I dont have or want to pay subscription for so the only alternative is to download or wait maybe a year for a DVD.

6327359,0,t3_428eh3,I think theres an overemphasis on diversity in writing right now. The net result is creating token ethnic or female characters. Write your characters how you want them to be not how you think society wants them to be.        Sure if your story is about slaves in  South Carolina trying to make it to a free state then race would matter but unless the story specifically requires race why focus on it? Just so you can claim you have a diverse crowd of characters?        Try writing your characters with traits that make them interesting. Try writing them without ever mentioning their race. In most situations other than like the one I cited above race wont matter. Could Jack Ryan have been Asian Black Latino in Tom Clancys novels? Of course and there would have been little if any change to the story. Could the entire list of characters from Jurassic Park have been black? Absolutely and the story wouldnt have changed one bit.

6357740,0,t3_42qavd,They are great and we need more of them.I dont always want the daunting task of reading a whole goddamn book. And theres something very beautiful about the pacing and the conscious use of words. By being novellas they force the writer to scale back even more than normal. You cant have a rambling description or extensive and unnecessary dialogue. Every word counts that much more.To this date Animal Farm is still one of my favorite books ever. Short novella. Of Mice and Men is an excellent example of characterization that packs a punch. So little is said yet so much conveyed. And frankly I love the slightly longer novellas the ones that clock in just under k or so. Stuff like Slaughterhouse  Fahrenheit  The Great Gatsby. Call them what you want those are masterpieces that can be read quickly and eagerly. The best part of those books is that I want to read them again. Excessively long material puts me off of that. Its intimidating. Give me something moderate that isnt a massive commitment. ,writing,czcazfx,3,t5_2qh2n

6384725,0,t1_czf9joz,A little but the industry standards arent always fair given the petition. Authors generally have to pick the best contract the can out of very few offerings if they get any at all. A writer with a few successful published stories will get a better contract. A new writer not so much A new writer would be lucky to even have a single publisher offer them a contract. The tradition publishing industry is tough. From the big boys to small presses. You take the contract that has the potential to screws you over the least. Starting up a publishing company is hard. There was and maybe still is a rise in publishing companies that authors editors and even agents started. The ebook fueled this because presses have the option of selling books without to rely on physically printing them. The thing is most tend to fail as like any small business. Many of these people dont know what they are doing. Many have an idea on how to change the industry and give better offering to writers but good intentions doesnt make a publishing company. They dont have a reputation and many dont have the ability to market widely so they can sell more books. They end up not making the money too keep going often times leaving writers who did sign with them no royalties payments as promised. Also any savy writer tend to stay away from new small presses as they dont have a reputation behind them and because of the rate of failure. Not to mention a lot of scam artists will start a small press promising the world to a writer who doesnt know any better and steal their money.,writing,czfdig2,3,t5_2qh2n

The Edward chapters are all short and violent or short and political while the Aris chapters are character driven and more fairy tale.  In a weird way the first chapter is a sort of prologue.It starts with the lead in In the City of Serenset on a day that will be come to be known as the First Sorrow.With that in mind does the opening duel seem less cliche?

Like you I dont particularly like writing fight scenes because I dont feel like I know enough about combat to make them realistic and memorable so I often feel like Im muddling my way through them. Lets just keep using fight scenes as an example. Maybe try stopping and thinking about whats happening after the fight. Is your character bleeding from the stomach and trying to stop a bloody nose? Something obviously had to happen during the fight to cause those things. Are they rushing to search through some files because the opponent made a comment during the fight that revealed some information? What was that information and did the opponent whisper it with their dying breath or reveal it accidentally while taunting your main character? Several days after the fight maybe the character is still limping because the fight took place on some stairs and they fell a short distance. See how you might jump ahead and then go back and fill in the blanks? You could apply this to just about any type of unenjoyable scene. And hey you could even write They had a fight and this person won just as a temporary placeholder. When I do that I usually put brackets around it so I can easily use CtrlF and go back and find all the places where I need to add more information or complete a scene. ,writing,czllyxx,18,t5_2qh2n

Since everything is colored by their opinion and were not hearing anyone elses side of the story. Third person is definitely detached but I feel like Im getting the whole picture. That may just be me though. I tend to favor third person limited. But I admit a first person narrative with a well written character can make me feel like Ive lost a friend when the book ends.

6657217,0,t1_d05npdm,Hi Im making a couple assumptions here and if Im wrong I dont mean any offence. Im assuming that if this isnt your first book its still on of the first three youve done and that youre a younger person and if you arent now you were when you wrote it.Elis and Val reminds me a lot of my early work. Its high fantasy in tone but a lot of the mechanics are modern. They speak in sassy modern language they act and behave as modern teenagers going to the bar etc. I get the feeling you really like your characters and that you like character driven stories. The more you learn about writing the more hesitant you can become more afraid of other writers critiquing your stuff than you are wanting your ideal reader to love your characters so much that they would read a story of them reading a phone book. Its really important that you keep that love of the story being about the characters and their interactions.Other people will tear your writing apart. I want to help build you up for the next thing you write. I would really like to see the story instead of having a narrator that can hop into and out of both characters heads as well as tell the reader about the world is a really distancing tool. It reminds the reader at all times that they are just reading the story. Head jumping from character to character can really through some readers out. We want to get into the skull of one character and see the world through their eyes. You can alternate between characters having one scene in one of their point of views POV and then in the next clearly demarcated scene start from the other. All the POV character at the time knows is what they personally know to be true and any reaction from the other character has to be at best a guess as to what theyre really thinking unless theyre a mindreader. If you go back and look at your first paragraph you can see that godlike description. Ive done a lot of things today but I never once thought of myself as my age from my own POV. There is no description there is no action there is only the point of view of the character experiencing the moment filtered through the way they look at the world. The way they look at the world becomes your voice in the story.Okay I said Id leave you with just one point but if you made it this far Ill give you a quick bonus. First chapters set an interesting character in an interesting world with an interesting problem. Eli doesnt have a problem until he sees the girl. Thats an external issue that he resolves by getting her a bakery. What does Eli want from the very first page? How does that impact the way he looks at the world?If this is your first book and if you are a younger under  writer this is a very good first attempt. As the one criticism I would say look at the verbs that you use and see if you can tone them down. Having a character emotionally respond to everything at an  on a  point scale robs you of that upper range of emotion when something really bad happens. If your characters are marionettes they cant always be lurching about the stage.I hope this is one of many books in the future for you. Its a very good start and I can see that youre clearly trying for an emotional connection between the characters and between the characters and the readers. Listen to what other writers tell you about how to be better with only half an ear. Readers want emotional connections with your readers. You just need to hone that skill and never let anyone make you feel as though that needs to change. As long as you have an interesting character in an interesting world with an interesting problem you can write anything.,writing,d07wwzp,1,t5_2qh2n

6774710,0,t3_48enci,Wanagi Tacaku  Spirit PathLightning cracked above in the dark clouds swirling with such anger overhead the rain came down like razors ready to cut away at the skin at any moment and the winds pushed fighting against all directions. The rocks were slimy and slick one false step and that step would be his last but he could not fail now he would not allow himself to. He had ventured far from a land without a name and his journey was coming to an end only to start a new one that he had not yet known about.Step after step he continued up the path the stone steps carved straight out of the mountain seemed almost natural as if they had grown that way instead of carved by men long forgotten by time. Water rushed down the steps like a river pushing at his feet almost demanding that he go back down but he refused to follow such orders.This mountain how tall was it? There was no way of knowing it pierced the clouds and rose far above them into the Heavens the beautiful land of the Great Spirits. This mountain was taller than all the rest and yet there was no snow here no Snow Trees like he had seen far below in which he has used to create his walking stick in hopes to keep his footing in such a treacherous environment.As he came around the last bend of the steps he arrived upon a large opening into the mountain itself an opening with such perfection an eye used by the mountain looking down upon world and all that inhabited it. Yet with its perfection there seemed to be a balance of chaos the columns leading all the way to the top of the eye were crumbling and broken moss and vine grew around and through it the first column on the right had completely lost its midsection with only a top attached and the bottom resting on the ground.The cave wet and damp darkened with shadows that have never been touched by the light of day. Drips of rain water echoed off from somewhere deep inside the cave the drips almost seemed like music a delicate beat that only the kindest of ears could hear. On either side of the cave entrance were two torch stands with flaring fire emanating all the colours of the sea a clear light blue with a green glow in the middle of the flame but these flames gave off little light. Another thing was strange about these fires there was no heat to them as if their passion had been stolen by the cold shadows that dwelled within this place.The fire crawled up his fingers leaving no burns or marks simply moving up to his palm where it rested as a slow burning glow. It was so gentle so calm he felt as if it were his duty to care for it as a mother would care for a child.In the center of the cave sat a fire pit a perfect circle with three curved lines leading out into the dark to the left right and going down the center. Without a second thought he led cupped the fire and gently placed the Sea Fire into the pit it burst without hesitation into a swirling cyclone of blue flame as the four curved lines exploded with light and led the fire out into the dark and lit up the entire cave. When the fire reached the edge of the cave walls he discovered there were no walls at all except for a large crumbling wall in front of him with strange markings written all along it. The fire in the indentations on the left and right fell off the sides of the circular platform he stood upon creating a waterfalllike stream of blue flame falling down an endless drop. As for the indentation in the center it led straight to the scribedupon wall and as the flame hit the wall the markings lit up into a spectacular sparkle of light.Three glowing orbs descended from the cave ceiling in a gentle swirling motion leaving a trail of calm light behind them. The orbs slowed their descent and stopped about fivefeet above the fire pit. The orbs gently expanded into a wave of light disappearing as it spread farther out left in their place were three spirits with Humanlike characteristics but there were strong distinctions between the three.In the middle was a large purple tinted spirit with a gentle smile on its left was a smaller spirit in a tinted red and on the right was a smaller spirit in a tinted blue. In unification the blue spirit pointed towards the wall with the runes inscribed upon it while the red spirit pointed towards the door the purple spirit opened its arms in a slow swinging motion as to let him know that he may choose what he would like to do.He walked towards the wall the runes still glowing these markings what could they mean? After looking generously at the runes he placed his hand along the wall.The runes stopped glowing as the amazing light faded into his body he turned to look back at the three spirits the large one called him over with a wave of the hand and grabbed the hands of the Chaos and Order. They began to glow and then intensify into such a bright light that the naked eye could not dare to look when the light receded a lonely orb was left in their place.The orb slowly floated down into the hands of the man it was a deep purple and pulsed a dim purple light. What was he supposed to do with this what was its purpose? He tucked it into the pocket inside his robe and walked towards the entrance.His journey was now at an end but a new one was only beginning.,writing,d0k731l,1,t5_2qh2n

6793222,0,t3_48t47e,What you describe is why editors and alpha readers are part of the process. Some of these things will get past you. Others you might catch by using tried and true organization techniques.Plot holes and pointless characters are the result of authors not answering why questions.  Why didnt they do X?  Why is this character in the story?Plot holes are easier to identify if you write from an outline or develop one as you write.  Your outline should be a summary of actions in the order your story deals with them. You should also have a timeline to deal with the order of events and identify problems like character X dies before action Y.With characters you could use a relationship diagram to identify characters that need a reason to be in a story. Some of your characters should be the stars of the story some should be supporting characters while others are bit players or extras.  Sort this out on a relationships chart. On a sheet of paper write down each named or otherwise important character and draw lines between characters that have relationships.  Label the relationship.  Then for each relationship answer the question  how is the reader made aware of the relationship? ,writing,d0mauj6,25,t5_2qh2n

Theyre also not a bad place to start if youre looking to conduct interviews. The Congressional Research Service probably has useful material too And the Government Accountability OfficeBut the books are probably the best source for information about the daytoday life of personnel.

Also working at a cafe in a very touristy spot I hear every level of poorly spoken english.

6902639,0,t3_4aajg0,I just grabbed everything I like about fiction and threw it all into a blender Female main character. Fantasy. Magic. Badass absolutely cool villain. Cool edgy hero. Overpowered knight order. Lots and lots of fantasy tropes. Dark story with lots of mindfuckery going on.Then for step two I tried imagining and writing a few scenes near the end of it. Step three was how do I even get to this point?And thats when I got a real story. Ill likely never write the power fantasy bombastic book I initially wanted to because I went so far back that my badass female character turned into a  year old teenager stranded in a different world. The dynamics changed completely and the coolness and edginess was replaced by a fairly grounded magic system teenage relationships and a plot that gets dark and not just edgy. Not a single character death and yet Ive written scenes so twisted that my yet to be introduced main antagonist pales in comparison so now he needs to be reworked too.I think the takeaway from this is to build a setting that you can truly get to love to the point where you cant walk away from it. Start with cool concepts that draw your attention and then refine the stupid shit you come up with into a well polished diamond. Dont bother with trying to be original you already have a completely different mind than any other writer.

Which means that if you start now and build a k social audience and a  person mailing list over the next six months youre going to be in a really good position when you make that final choice.Im doing things somewhat backwards as Im a freelance writer who got into blogging and is slowly moving towards fiction. I cant give fictionspecific advice yet but can say that the work that Ive put into my social presence has had a serious influence on the contracts I pull in.The idea is to become a known quantity which is hard when youve not published anything.

In American Gods Shadow learns about the Old Gods and the New Gods and in A Game of Thrones there are dragons and visions but its not like everyone can do magic or have super powers. Two characters in my book are the ones with somewhatsupernatural not exactly sure to what extent yet power and there are three or four deitylike beings that control nature and appear in dreams and visions and stuff but other than that everything and everyone else is just a regular human living in a similarlytechnologically advanced world where nothing out of the ordinary from our perspective goes on.Once I started writing I just went with it and did not worry about the audience too much until I was talking with a writer friend about my book and one of the first things she asked was who the audience is and when I told her I wasnt sure she suggested that I decide on that.I read American Gods not too long ago and immediately became a fan of Neil Gaiman actually I had a dream last night that I met him and we were talking about my book and he was going to take a look at it for me lol so Ill definitely check out the book you mentioned.I think I will just stick to your advice and just write the damn thing!,writing,d1bqpex,1,t5_2qh2n

7040628,0,t3_4c294p,well... lore timeSauron can be viewed as the devil i.e. a fallen angel who got angry with god wants to destroy creation and start from scratch but this time with him in charge. So destroying everything fits his plans just well. Voldemort is you racial supremacist and a total egomaniac and sociopath. As long as he gets his immortality and can cleanse the earth of everything he deems unfit for his word view hell be fine. He simply cant fathom that other people dont ruthlessly pursue their own goals and ambitions. Mind you this was pretty much his undoing in the endThe Empire for some people being in charge of everything is good enough. Sometimes power is the reward itself maybe not for you but remember not everyone is you. In fact most people arent.Hitler If you believe that Jews are the scourge of the earth and responsible for everything bad that happens on earth andor to Germany getting rid of them is the only sensible action no? Then there is the quest for power and glory. Make Germany great again and all that. This is a very simplistic view of thingsFor motives Evil people dont normally see themselves as evil. They might do evil things like killing a lot of people and kick the occasional puppy but always for the greater good or a noble goal. What may these goals be? Bringing the one true faith to the people is a classic. Making Insert Country great again. Bringing the world order  freedom  the end of suffering  finally a capable leader who can fix the mess others created. Or maybe they just want revenge get rich be in charge whateverOr if your villain is a sociopath heshe might simply be incapable of seeing what they do as special. They might believe that  everyone only thinks about themselves and ruthlessly pursue their own goals and ambitions. Well then everything would be fair game wouldnt it? Voldemort is a prime example.Sometimes the motives and goals dont make a lot of sense to normal people or completely break down when you think them through to the end. Well maybe the villain never did think their plans through? Maybe he never stopped and pondered what might happen after the end? Maybe hes incapable doing so or he never had the time or he never cared. Part of writing a great villain is to make his goals or ambitions at least somewhat plausible at least from his point of view.  ,writing,d1eeufm,3,t5_2qh2n

But expecting immediate results is probably unrealistic  because its an incremental process not something where you actually see improvement until you actually do it. I have looked at a previous WIP I wrote before September last year and I find Ive improved since I wrote it. Ditto the first draft of the current WIP was crappy. Its not something that is obvious until you have enough material to look back at and plot your development. Otherwise you just have to plug in this state learning inchbyinch or get some feedback on your previous MS or on the opening to this novel to ascertain where you are now and what you need to work on in order to improve and try to incorporate some of what you learn from that critique. It can take people writing manuscripts into the double figures before they get published so you have a while yet. But you cant learn by sitting there not writing  you need to be able to learn on the job.If youre more engaged by other projects then go for it  write them. But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush  what if you start another idea then get the same issues as youve had with this one?

7101782,0,t3_4cspbj,Brandon Sanderson does a good job writing complex interesting fantasy characters many of whom have  X chromosomes. Based on your responses I think you are making female their primary character trait. This is your mistake. Being female merely contributes to their character traits. Take a character. Sit down and write out all their character traits. Rich privilaged educated competant arrogant dislikes children and puppies facinated by technology terrible judge of character. K NOW look at their gender. How has it had an impact on those existing character traits? Gender behavior is very much determined by society. Ancient greece thought the mark of a civilized man was one who bawled his eyes out chased adolescent boys and sat around in skirts eating grapes and reciting poetry.  In our society peoples lives are influenced by gender in a fairly specific way women are generally less physically capable because they are smaller and such discouraged from maths and sciences leadership and direct confrontation encouraged in nurturing and character judgment and instinct... so if your character goes against the trends AS MANY WOMEN DO she needs a reason why  childhood event a goal a particular structural advantage like Briennes crazy strength. But you are building a sci fi universe so you get to decide this. Does being female make her feel more superior? Less superier? Does she give way to other people does she trust her instincts more  is she more artistic more intellectual more people focused? Is there a weirdass quirk that shes just expected to be good at like making food? So... make your rule about what it means to be female and then stick to it consistantly. Sanderson did this brilliantly in the Way of Kings series  he decided women were educated in science and men were educated in war and BAM his characters were facinatingly rich and complex in all their failability. ,writing,d1lcy2c,7,t5_2qh2n

You know the Speed of Light is a universal absolute dont you?  Yes we know but its pretty hard to have a multistarsystem story without the ability to travel between planets in a timely fashion. The people who bitch about time travel.  You know that time cant be manipulated like that.  Or somehow worse the ones who will tell you with a completely straight face that time travel plot is wrong because multiverse  butterfly effect  alternate timelines  picksomeothertheoryoftimetravelthatthisstorydidntusethattheyprefer.  Yes we know thank you so much for making sure we know you didnt like it. The people who protest any story that uses aliens because theres no proof of nonhumansentient life in reality.  Or worse the ones who object to alien invasion stories because why would an alien race invade when the universe has nighinfinite resources ripe for the picking so they dont need to steal ours.  Yes we know but its just a story.True story.  Years ago on another writers forum an author asked for ideas on how to give semibelievable figuresfacts for the space ships in his story.  Like he wanted to figure out rough volumes masses and that sort of thing that could be dropped in as appropriate.So I suggested a few methods like looking at big ships in real life submarines aircraft carriers etc... and scaling up or down as appropriate or use geometry gasp actual math to work out volumes and densityformass based on the general shapes of the ships.  Like the Enterprise is a flat sphere and six cylinders so decide what your ships look like and rough them out shape wise then do the math.  Stuff like that.But I pointed out to him that any kind of specifics was going to pull the ripcord on these types of SF fans chainsaws and theyll start nitpicking and quibbling over it.It took less than six hours before the thread had devolved into a huge fight over the right way to go about estimating a fictional space ship for story purposes. You cant use real water navy ships as a starting point a space civilization would have different construction techniques and materials that makes them completley different. Geometry equations are useless because of field density manipulation generators and spacefaring materials science that would make it impossible to correctly describe.etc...Love SF.

Both have to be shades of grey for the story to work for the typical PA audience member.Lets say its a plaguedisease PA story.  The antagonists are a town that still has a doctor and a clinic with medical equipmentsupplies.  The protagonists are a band of survivors with sick members.The protagonists want access to the doctor and clinic so they have a chance to be healed.  The antagonists dont want anyone coming near the town much less in it much much less into the clinic for fear of spreading the plague and infecting more of the townsfolk.Whos right?  There is no right answer.  The doctors creed is do no harm.  The moral choice is help people.  But is violating those things wrong if doing so puts you in real danger of dying?Further notice how this example can be written from EITHER SIDE and still be a perfectly good PA story.  You can swap the protagsantags and the storys the same the choices are still hard.  Thats what good PA stories are about grey.  Hard decisions.  Things that make the readerviewer ponder what they would do and feel guilty about it. Edit The flat no at the top is a bit brisk.  What I meant by no was its really better if both sides protags and antags are not shaded heavily to either good or bad.  Making the antagonist evil with a heart of gold isnt the best choice it still makes it obvious that he should be rooted against.  Making the protagonist a paladin with a dirty streak has the same problem.

7256285,0,t3_4esp09,Going from writing a novel....Some of the things I try to do  Keep your scenes short. For example dont include entire conversations of dialogue just what you need. In fact dialogue is what gets the hairiest imo when it comes to keeping short stories snappy. Think about the latest moment of the story you can feasibly begin the action and start there. in media res Re scifi make sure youre not playing with more than a couple big ideas. Otherwise youre going to have to put in a lot more words to juggle it all. Keep it lightweight and hit hard. Dont include more than a few principle characters. Most short stories only feature two or three.  Read some short stories and analyze them re how theyre able to keep it snappy. Id suggest looking at a couple each by Aliette de Bodard and Tobias Wolff.  When you go to edit look hard at your first several pages and decide where the story actually BEGINS. Often in my experience my story can do without the first page or even the entire first scene.  Also when you edit look hard at your dialogue. Chop off the beginningend of dialogue scenes where they lose momentum. Good luck!,writing,d22zkni,4,t5_2qh2n

To me its a regular occurrence.I have lived lives of monotony. Others of sheer adventure. Many somewhere in between.I have seen the sun set in Rome and the tide wash in on Waikiki. Ive seen massive crowds struggle to see a work of art and intimate moments with a childs prized handpainting.Ive listened to a solo violinist make her strings sing the saddest of songs and Ive listened to groups of friends gossip about that one boy in class.I vividly remember the times where I never felt more alive and yet none of this ever prepares me for the point I slip away.One might think after  times of perishing the feeling might grow familiar. Maybe after  you wouldnt even notice it anymore. times could never have prepared me for the th moment.Luckily its never been painful. Every time its been the same process.

Stick to your strengths and find good beta readers and editors to do the fixing for you.  A great story can be born without the skills to make it read well.

7524655,0,t1_d2u9z9l,Firstly you shouldnt worry so much about being pretentious as a amateur writer  being pretentious means you are trying things beyond normal conventions. Not everything you write will be a masterpiece in fact a great many things you write you will realize over time werent so good but you begin to develop and hone your craft through various means rather than sticking with what is safe. People who dismiss your work as being pretentious might in some cases be right but in my experience people dislike things they cant understand and so tack the meaningless tag of pretentious on it. Its good to explore varying means of conveying thoughts and stories. Your work only becomes pretentious when you dont understand it yourself but expect others to. All you have to do is be deliberate with your writing.I enjoyed both pieces  though the poem seemed a bit short. I think you could use more imagery in it and develop those sentiments a bit more. You dont want a poem to rely completely on philosophical ruminations because then it becomes rhetorical and a bit preachy. Add a bit of imagery or symbolism which conveys the sentiments of the poem. Maybe turn it into a short narrative or something if only to give it more substance. I feel pretty much the same way about the  word paragraph. The writing is clear and easy to read but its hard to connect with abstract philosophy on its own. However I feel this piece would work well in a larger narrative. Your writing displays a certain talent with the craft and I advise you to explore different means of narration and storytelling. Its hard to come to terms with the fact that most readers however well read dont enjoy reading amateur philosophy  thats why you have to disguise it in a narrative either fictional or nonfiction and smuggle it to them. I think you have some potential that definitely can be built upon  remember to read widely and read often even things beyond what you normally read if only to see what other authors have succeeded with. I recommend you start with the classics if you havent already. I good example of philosophy in disguise is Oscar Wildes The Picture of Dorian Gray. Wilde succeeds in being enormously philosophical without being preachy pretentious or longwinded all while presenting a narrative this is compelling and wellwritten.

7548567,0,t3_4iokju,As with all books whether it succeeds or not has very little to do with quality of writing. Have you read  shades for example? Or even Twilight? Those books are objectively poorly written. All taste is subjective but there are certain things that we can all agree are just trash. Yet despite this those books made more money that some of the best literature ever written. Why? A Excellent marketing. A book no matter how good or how bad lives and dies on its marketing. Good marketing can get a good book to succeed. Great marketing can get a bad book to make millions. B Luck. Its near impossible to predict when certain trends will pick up. Twilight was on book  when it started getting popular. The Walking Dead was somewhere around issue  before people really started to follow it. Game of thrones was on book  before they got popular. Trends occur naturally without much rhyme or reason and whether youre lucky enough to ride the trend in its humble beginnings or not can determine if your book makes . or  mil.

We know very little about him thats provable.gtThis is my point without sources for an original version you cant say that the versions we have are wrong.Im not saying theyre wrong Im saying they shouldnt be considered sacred because every printed version has had editorial choices applied to it by someone other than Shakespeare.gtThe burden of proof in the absence of information is on the person who is making the statement.There is nothing to prove. The plays are attributed to him but no one denies that they have always been presented in some kind of edited form. We assume that the First Folio is the best representation of the way he wrote the plays because its the earliest version we have. Thats all there is to it. We just dont know and we never will.gtI think we should accept it for what it is and just appreciate it as is.So do I. Many of them are great stories with complex characters and a lot of valuable insight on life death love religion politics human nature etc.gtWhen you question the authorship of Shakespeare you detract from his worksWhy? What difference does it make whether some person we know exactly two facts about actually wrote them or not? Everyone loves For sale baby shoes never worn and no one really cares that Hemingway didnt actually write it. Its a beautifully constructed storythats all that matters.gtThats because of the reputation attached to the name. I think it makes the average person less interested in his works.I think it does the opposite. In my experience far more people are turned off by the idea of Shakespeare. There is such a highbrow academic aura attached to it that it feels too exclusive too elite to someone who likes Tommy Boy and Warm Bodies. Throw in the inaccessibility of the language and many just wont bother with it.But you know what they do respond to? Adaptations. Presentations of Shakespeare that take the events themes and philosophy and repackage them in a way that modern people can relate to. These are the things that drive people toward Shakespeare rather than away.Ultimately plays are written to be performed which is inherently an adaptation.

7727678,0,t3_4l4mgj,It is probably not up to you.   Selfpublishing is a decision you can make and you can have your book available almost immediately.   Traditional publishing is also a choice but it is a choice made by the publisher not you. And realistically the odds that your book will be chosen are long.   Ive done both am now firmly in the selfpub camp.   Two other things to consider   . Traditional publishers limit the number of books they publish so that they dont compete against themselves their logic not mine.   . Bookstores Its extremely difficult if not impossible to get a selfpub book into bookstores esp. BampN. But remember because publishers have a river of books theyre trying to flood into the bookstores if you do happen to get in your book will have only two to four weeks to sell well. If it doesnt it will have the cover torn off and returned to the publisher. The fundamental and unsolvable problem with physical bookstores is that they have finite selfspace. Amazons shelf space is for all practical purposes infinite for both ebooks and paper.,writing,d3kkzfb,1,t5_2qh2n
7732470,0,t3_4l6avt,Home Sweet Home   wordsThere is a girl walking through the yard.Crisp autumn leaves are broken beneath her shoes as she paces back and forth. Shes been walking for hours back and forth back and forth back and forth. I cant see her face from the window so I turn away and forget about her.Theres a woman in the mirror. She has beautiful green eyes but the rest of her face is gone. She has emerald eyes that kings would fight for. I fancy myself a king and decide to wander about my castle.The servants have forgotten to water the plants. Sitting along either side of the hallway they droop low bowing to their king. They are brown and black and dying. I think the woman in the mirror stole the green and dropped the color into her eyes.I walk down the stairs and run my hand along the black banister. It is made of the night stuff sucking all light into its metal. It is cold and I cannot avoid looking at it. It is beautiful in the same way that the winter is beautiful because nothing moves. In that way dead people can be considered beautiful.I arrive in the foyer but the only fanfare is the sound of my feet hitting the tile. I think of my mother and father dancing along this very tile. He taught her how to waltz she taught him how to garden. She took him into the backyard one day and they did not return. Later I discovered that they had been gardened themselvesplanted in the ground like carrot seeds. You become what you love I suppose.Turning my head to the left I see that there is a wolf in my living room. He is sleeping and does not bother me but I remember the night he nearly killed an intruder. Beasts are only good when theyre on your side and in between waking and dreaming I do not trust the minds of beasts.I turn my head to the right. I have two options. Good or bad. Alive or dead. Night or day. I could go into the kitchen or find my way to the basement. I think it over as the girl in the backyard walks back and forth and back and forth.There is a specter in my basement. Ive seen it before. I havent gone in the basement for a very long time but it has never said its goodbyes to the host so I must assume that it still lingers. The phantom sways on the steps looking up at the door. It is always there always waiting for someone to come and give it light. It takes the light and shoves it into its glassy grey blind eyes. I do not like when it does this for then it opens its horrid mouth all filled with jagged pencilteeth and needles.There is a rattling in the kitchen. Perhaps the specter has moved. Perhaps it waits for me in the corner between the fridge and the sink counter blending it with the gloom. I do not wish to see its pale eyes for they always remind me of souls one for my mother and one for my father. Perhaps they decomposed together came together as one and climbed from the beneath the earth to find me.Perhaps they want me to make them dinner. But alas I cannot cook. Kings do not cook.I decide to go out into the backyard. I shut the door behind me as gently as I can yet the screen still slams against the siding. The noise wakes the beast. It frees the specter from the basement. It gives the woman in the mirror courage enough to peek out from her glassy prison. They all gather in my room and stare at me from the bedroom window.The little girl is still walking back and forth. She hangs her head low allowing her hair to hide her face. I think I shall never see it but I am alright with that. There are plenty of faces one should not see.The face of a woman mourning her veil pulled over her features.The face of one who does not love you anymore.The face of God.I walk side by side with the girl and she does not protest. I match my stride to hers. She has a bit of a lead on me but the day is still young. We will walk alongside each other for hours back and forth and back forth creating ruts like garden rows.,writing,d3l4l1y,1,t5_2qh2n
7733693,0,t3_4l8i3k,Before I begin writing something fullout I know how it begins and I know how it ends.  I usually have a couple of guide post images in between as well as anchors for the story.In fact the ending is typically where I build the rest of the story from.  I had the last lines of my first novel written out long before I wrote the actual book or even before I had the final themesplotworld for the story fleshed out.  It was an image in that case of thin rivulets of snow in the cracks of a street that prompted the protagonist and his friends people who certainly never existed when I first conjured up the image to move on to warmer places.I gather that Stephen King writes in the same way he mentioned in the intro to Everythings Eventual that the title story came to him as an image of a young man dumping money into a storm drain and he worked it out from there.

People cant handle that much edge but switching on a chapter by chapter basis sounds fine. One important factor though will be creating a rhythm with the changes. I read a book once called Firefly that switched characters by chapter in the same order throughout the book as well as ending each chapter with the subject character somehow meeting or interacting with the character for the next chapter. Like a chain. It was very neat and created an expectation for what would come next and how the author would pull it off without jarring the story.

Youve characterized Merric very well and he fells all the more real because of the flaws that youve given him. That his weapon of choice was a decision made because of an inherent sense of selfinferiority compared to his brother was a very clever way of communicating something much deeper of his person. Also I much preferred the text in green. Your engaging description of events rather the literal showing in red was at least to me more interesting. One point of note regarding actions scenes would be that I would like to know what the First Second and Third stances look like. Aside from that there were a few grammatical errors throughout especially around and after the half way mark but those are nothing that a quick edit cant sort out.

The problems arise when writers dont know how to handle what theyve captured.Taking advantage of the minds ability to detect patterns is the basis of all storytelling but in the wrong hands this leads to the narrative equivalent of continual jump scares.  Its superficial. Filling in the blanks doesnt lead to anything coherent. Stories need not literally model reality.  Fantasy flies in the face of that fact. Stories convey social values and emotional experiences not scientific explanations of the world. This is great. The problem is when writers take advantage of hacks in human cognition without offering anything in return. You can introduce mystery after mystery after mystery but if the experience doesnt resolve its going to piss people off. Stringing people along is not hard.

First of all it interchanges traditional and simplified chinese characters so if you ever decide on writing the actual characters out it could be a mix of different systems. Also it lists single syllabic words with multiple syllabic words when Chinese names as I explained in my post only use one syllabic words to represent each element. For example the list includes SHUFEN    as a full name when  is probably more common as a given name and youd never find anyone named  unless  is their generational name. Some of the names are common like WEI    NA    JUAN  etc. but some are also a bit random e.g. TAI    which might work as a generational name but its kind of uninspired and awkward.Also all the pinyin is in hanyu pinyin the Mandarin pronunciation system and the list organizes it by the pinyin mixing up meaning and malefemale names. You can check out the list at the end of this wiki entry on the most common Chinese names in China. This list doesnt include generational names but the given name column lists out actual names and it consistently uses Simplified Chinese although Hong Kong uses traditional but whatever you just want to stay with one system at the moment to avoid contamination.,writing,d3wnq17,2,t5_2qh2n

So for those readers who do constitute the overwhelming majority I think we have to help them out.The key for me in either case and Ive been told by very good authors and experienced readers that my writing works on this level so Im fairly confident in it is to make the details youre using as I said previously evocative. They shouldnt be random or arbitrary. Its specific details that evoke the rest of things. For that reason your deadyoungwoman image works brilliantly for the literal image.  I might not have seen the girl in my minds eye but I felt her in my gut.Now that said because Im not a visual person I didnt fill in the spots and blots and smells of the room or the room itself. I didnt fill in the color of her underwear or the color of her dead skin those are bruteforce exercises in logic for me if I feel the need to imagine them. So while your image was excellent it was not enough for me to get everything that you may have intended to pack into it.  I think visualization ability is a spectrum and if it follows a bell curve why wouldnt it? I think the majority of readers are served by a collection of details rather than a single telling detail. Some people might be able to build Christmas from the smell of pine needles in a living room but many to some extent wont be able to do that. Either because they havent experienced it or because their visualization capabilities might be on the lower end of the spectrum.Im rambling... I stop now.TLDR I agree to some extent with your point but I think that one specific image isnt enough for many readers to unpack everything out of that image that the writer may have wanted to pack into it. ,writing,d43rdgx,3,t5_2qh2n

7915758,0,t3_4np95f,Genre should be easy. What do you like to read? What do you think you can add to in a unique way? What world would you not mind spending  or  or  thousand words in? What real world insight do you have that could enrich you writing? You deal drugs? you know the in and outs of the other side of the tracks? you might have a dozen Underbelly Noir Red Dirt Mystery novels in you. You recently loved and lost? Do you want to rip all those feeling out and bleed them dry into black ink? You might want to write a Romance or tragedy. You like future tech and are a bit of an engineer? you could probably breath life effortlessly into a scifi grease monkey hopping ships around the Jovian moons. Genre What would you have fun writing?Starting it Sit down and bleed... No but you do have to sit down and type. Even it isnt good. Even if it is just an idea. even if the characters are flat and you dont have any idea whats going to happen. Roll the ball and it starts picking up its own steam. Its like magic. You can go in and flesh out and edit as you go. Before you know it your characters are doing things you never expected. Plots are sewing themselves shut and a the moral of the story is something you never knew you were trying to make let alone learn. At this point you just stand back in awe of how much more you have in front of you than what you put in. Especially since you started it all out with a flat no named character trying to hit on the clerk at a coffee shop. Character namesDont use people that you know. Dont use really common names. Dont use really obscure name. Except for the first rule there are exceptions according to the type of story your writing. Soul searching road house blues player? Willy Slack Jaw TannerSerial killer? Usually something like John Holmes. Common. Mongolian immigrant? Batayara. Enough said. Also be aware of the way names are used in the real world. What kind of doctorate level profession are called doctors etc.Bad at making decisions Thats a tough one. Confidence might be the key here. try some writing exercises. Experiment. Find out what your good at and what you need improving on. Once you know you can always nail a snarky explosive character introduction then you have something to build on. Also read critically extensively and with an open mind. If you know other writers offer to look over their third drafts.

It isnt necessary to resolve the conflict in the sense of solving it but it is necessary to resolve the conflict in the sense of showing how the character changes in reaction to the conflict a conflict could be resolved by the character changing their attitude while the source of the conflict remains it no longer bothers the character.Conflict is necessary because it is what forces the character to change and this is the heart of the story. Stories are about a characters journey. That journey is forced by the conflict. The story is not about how the conflict is resolved. The story is about how the character changes in reaction.Just drug addiction without more cant be considered a conflict. We need to understand how the drug addiction fits into the structure of the story. Drug addiction could be the characters motivation and the conflict is where they are going to get their drugs. Or drug addiction could be the characters flaw which they need to overcome to improve their relationship with their kids.

His jeans were soaked through and a chill cut through him to the bone. Off to his right a crane rose to soar towards the mountains. If only he could do the same and be done with this place.From this we can surmise that Jim is in a swamp. You could write it much blander by describing the scenery without the effect it has on the character but that always struck me as boring and by showing how the character is dealing with it youre providing more than just a description of a location but can also provide some character exposition.

That is a description that is  very blank slate. Which has its place and sometimes doesnt work. Now try this John waltzed into the room quick stepping to a beat only he could hear. The room spun alive as he swept into his favorite overstuffed armchair. Squishing down into the cloudlike cushions he pulled up the remote and flipped over to the news. Now try this. John sagged at the spaceway between the kitchen and the living room. With deliberate slow motions he moved past the barethread furniture dropping his suitcase as he went. The tie cut at his neck a reminder of the long blurry day as he dropped into the old comfortable chair in the corner of the room. When he flipped on the television he stared at the flickering screen. A layer of dust covered it not that it mattered as he let his mind wander. Even thats not perfect but John is a very different person in both clippings yeah?

You want to avoid lore for lore sake because it makes your book stop being about the conflict between your characters and makes it look like youre showing off your train set.A work around framing device that Ive seen was in David Eddings The Belgarion and The Malorian series. At the beginnings of each book he has excepts from the inworld Holy Texts that are constantly referenced to by the characters. One of the characters was alive at the time of the events in the book and he sometimes talks about the events he witnessed Chronicled in these scriptures. Its really neat to see the impactful emotional filled narrative prose of that character juxtaposed with the cold Old Testament styled descriptive prose.

8080152,0,t3_4proic,When I finish a novel I go through and make a spreadsheet. On the spreadsheet I have the chapter short scene description usually less than  words word count date. This gives me that birds eye view of the arc and I can tell if my pacing is right. The date is for my moons. I have two and I like to know when they rise.I highlight yellow if the scene needs revision and maybe put a note in there. Again I keep any notes pretty short. I may also sketch inline the revisions that I have in mind. e.g. if I want to add a piece of conversation and I know what that piece is I drop in the sketch so its right there when I get back to that page. Since I usually approach my edits scenebyscene Ill often wait until I get to that scene to think through the details of an edit.I highlight red if Im considering deleting a scene. If the scene does get deleted from the story it goes into a file called deleted scenes in case I need to readd it later. I also save draftsedits by date so I can pull from those. The word count lets me know if Ive rambled too long on a scene. Scenes longer than k or shorter than  words get scrutiny. Are all these words essential to the plot? Can I make that scene work harder?Sometimes Ill do an edit on the computer. Other times I prefer to print and edit by hand. It depends on the scope of the edit and my mood at the time. ,writing,d4oa90i,1,t5_2qh2n

8141240,0,t1_d4r2082,I was hoping to make edits on yours but it looks like you have to request access so Im just going to comment with critique.First of all as soon as I opened it I hated the formatting. Maybe its just the way it is on google docs on my computer? Not sure. But there arent any paragraph breaks or indents so the entire page is just one huge paragraph and very visually straining.Now to the actual story Im going to give critique to different parts and then talk about it overall at the end.. In the beginning you talk about Lunas thoughts about people and go from saying we to most to they in three sentences. Edit this to stay more consistent because I had to read this multiple times to understand you were talking about people.. You use the word perceptions when I think you mean feelings. Perceptions has to do with senses I perceive people through my sight music through hearing etc because you talked about how Luna felt. You also immediately talk about how she couldnt face her own issues because she couldnt stand being alive which is consistent with when you talked about loneliness before then but the tone of the piece overall isnt consistent. E.g. just before that you said But now she was past the point of worry even though shes clearly worrying.. Sentence starting with The calm sea needs a comma after sea and before sun. Might want to reword that sentence its clunky.. You start talking about how she hopes there is a car to relieve her from the pain of living but I didnt even realize she was in the middle of the road? I know shes by the ocean but otherwise it was unclear where she was or what she was doing.. You have two sentences in a row talking about the trek back home its a bit redundant. You can just say She felt there was no rush since we already know where she is going.. You spelled your characters name Lua at one point.Look honestly I had to stop there the formatting made it so I couldnt really concentrate and I constantly lost my place. It doesnt look like you edited this is this a first draft? Have you read through the whole thing? The overall tone is nice and I like the themes of the existential crisis but I have one key issue with itI have no idea who this person is or why she is having a crisis just thats shes female and having said crisis.

Character a story that focuses on the development of a character or group of characters. Event a story that focuses on a specific event or moment in your setting.

You pick up on a lot just by reading if youre not paying so much attention youre actively picking up on every lesson. Reading for enjoyments sake is more important than reading to nitpick and study. At least the first time you read a book. On the second reading when youre familiar with the story pick it apart see what happens. Regardless I still pick up on things the first time you read just because youre so engrossed in the story. I learnt about breaking the rules of your world in Thirteen reasons why which was terrible. I learnt things from the Percy Jackson series from The Sandman series not even novels and the book Im reading at the moment Norwiegan Wood has some very heavyhanded symbolism which is something Ive never really messed around with before but now Id be quite interested to. All of these are books Ive only read once I havent even finished Murakami but theres lessons in all of them even though Im reading them just because I enjoy them  not as a writer trying to hone his craft that comes anyway.To wit dont ruin the enjoyment of reading Break apart books on the second reading not the first.,writing,d5ajbfw,1,t5_2qh2n

8275378,0,t1_d5bu82e,Essentially yeah  the theme rather is about this alternate take on DDay. The plot follows Eddy through his experiencing it. Steampunk was the fastest way I could put an image in your head. Not poweredbysteam but rather mechanical and experimental in nature. Think cast iron pneumatic assisted frames that would best be described as exoskeletons. Think tunneling armor and semiautomated infantry support weapons.Not future tech with lasers and scifi stuff but not steampunk dials and knobs. A blended version of existing tech from that period and the dream weapons they would have liked to have had.Eddy is from the fictional th Double Deuce Infantry Support Regiment th ISR from the fabled st Infantry Division nd Brigade nd Battalion Fox Company. Its a regiment dedicated to establish route security build cache locations and hump supplies to the nearfront. Most believe its a taskspecific unit to help supply lines postinvasion most likely to be disbanded and integrated into GI duties once the main forces are inland and secure.With him Eddy has two main friends from his company. More by happenstance and proximity after always seeming to be applied to the same jobs together Eddys best friend in France is Bert Spader. Bert is a redblooded American young man. Hungry for sex fighting booze and most other physical pursuits hes blunt and matter of fact thinking this mentality will prepare him to deal with some of the horrors theyd heard of while stationed in England. Hes rational and finely tuned to keep order. Hence hes usually given the duties of organizing supplies and managing new arrivals of crates and boxes preparing them for where they need to end up.Eddys other pal more because he hangs around often than any other reason and well theyre not going anywhere so they might as well chat Mitchel Jarrinson. Mitch is a city kid. Volunteering for the Army after the attack on Pearl Harbour he went against the advice of his friends and family all professionals from New Jersey. Hes naturally got more of an attitude toward authority figures more likely to go against the grain. He flunked out of a career path in Army medical corps and resigned himself to the supply troops as a close second to being away from the main infantry fighting forces.  ,writing,d5bzbkb,1,t5_2qh2n

But if you have a great idea why even let it get to that point? Where you have to stand up to that comparison?

To actually get into the mode of writing I would strongly suggest that you know yourself how you want your story to end first that way youll always know what youre writing towards your ending can still change however depending on what happens as you write. It happens.. Once you know the general shape of your story you just have to sit down and get it out. If thats the part where you struggle then start by writing at least one sentence a day even on the days when you dont feel like writing. Start with that and build up. After a week do three sentences a day then maybe a couple of paragraphs and one day youll find that youve written a whole page or two without even knowing it and from there the bar is only as high as you set it.Good luck. Oh and remember that feedback is very important regardless of whether you want to publish or not. You are only one mind and you have a bias since youre the author.

8419025,0,t1_d5svbn1,Okay so I read this because I liked the title not even gonna lie. First really focus on grammar and structure. Read some stuff you like a lot and pay attention to how they form sentences. One thing in particular I noticed because my first editor when I was  hammered me for doing the same thing is that you use way too many fucking commas. Especially at the beginning.That being said there is already a noticeable improvement in your writing between the beginning of this and the end. The first few paragraphs are bad. Theyre mangled and unclear. I dont know who any of these people are and I dont really have any clue what theyre doing aside from fighting in some version of power armor or baby mechs. You get better in your prose by the end though. Thats a good sign. Next time you write another action sequence be very careful with it so you can be sure your readers can follow. The story feels a little generic and kinda quirky in a first season anime kinda way. You can easily fix that if you finish the story and do some rewrites once you have a better handle on your universe though. Less exposition. Your two characters arent talking to each other. Youre clearly setting up the story. Have faith! Unlike your action sequence your readers dont need you to hold their hand... or bash them over the head. Show dont tell and the like. I cant do a line by line. Im on mobile. But those are my general notes. I know it might seem like I was a little harsh but I wasnt trying to be a dick. I do think youve got some natural ability for someone whos new to writing. I say keep working on it. Youre more than good enough as long as youre willing to put in the work. ,writing,d5tx68r,1,t5_2qh2n

8437478,0,t3_4v0a85,You can kind of have a character without a plot but you cant have a story without a plot.The reason its hard to have character without plot is because characters are best revealed through their reactionsdecisions at plot points. You establish character by having things happen to them and seeing what they do. The protagonists flaw is revealed in reaction to the inciting incident in act one. You may know who your characters are but your reader wont until you show them. And the best way to show character is to have them doing things with consequences This implies plot since a consequence is a progression of events and a progression of events is plot. You could have characters do things that have no meaningful consequences and therefore no plot but you will lose the reader. You could have characters just sitting around talking about who they are but again you will lose the reader.You cant have a character arc without plot. These two concepts are inextricably intertwined. A character arc necessitates a plot.The reason you cant have a story without plot is because a story is not a series of events that is a description but an account of how a character changes or doesnt in response to conflict obstacles in the way of their goals.,writing,d5w82ym,1,t5_2qh2n

For example I saw a show where the husband left the wife alone and in that time she was raped. His failure to protect her and her trauma from the sexual assault pushed them away from each other and led her to an affair. This affair contributed to a large amount of the issues in the later part of the story. It was relevant to the plot and while there would perhaps be other ways to get to there it didnt feel forced or inappropriate in the context of the story. Dont write it for the sake of writing it but dont deny your plot something that does really happen and would help with the novels progression.

Im a terrible human being and I AM an asshole but this dude just came home from the sandbox I wasnt trying to shit on his dreams. So I broke it down. I didnt tell him it was bad. I sucked the juice out to see what he was going for and gave him broad pointers on how he could accomplish that better. I went through that bitch with a fine tooth comb and broke down the technical flaws described why mistakes were wrong and suggested ways to write the same sentence with better grammar.Then I chopped the whole thing up and rewrote his first three chapters using all of the advice I had given him. He was super thankful.My experience is that people newbies anyway dont mind being told their work is bad as long as you arent a dick about it and can demonstrate how effectively using the critiques you give them will look as a more polished product.

8538080,0,t3_4wmh3t,gt Im aware that circumstance favoring ethical behavior is usually the exception and not the norm from an individuals perspective. How can I bring this out better in my writing?Logically the differences between story people are their values and beliefs. Give a character two opposing values and beliefs and you have strong internal conflict. Give two groups of people opposing values and beliefs and you have strong external conflict.A good example of this is a glass of water in the Wheel of Time series. For most cultures a glass of clean water is just a glass of clean water. For the Aeil clans its the most precious resource in the world because they are from a desert culture. A river of running water is insane to the Aeil. This causes conflict inside the series for anyone that deals with the Aeil clans.gt Virtuous behavior is typically rewarding in the long run while immoral behavior ends up detrimental.Murder is immoral in most religions yet murdering all of your enemies is typically rewarding in the short term and long term. Charity is virtuous behavior in most religions yet charity cripples the people its intended to help in the long run. The old saying Give a man a fish hell eat for a day. Teach a man to fish hell eat for a lifetime. touches on this principle.Regardless this belief is common in most fiction because it is a good belief to promote. This belief benefits civilization.I hate Hitler as do most reasonable and moral people. Hitler probably didnt think of himself as a villain. He probably saw himself as a hero of the German people trying to establish a better future for them and their posterity. He was completely wrong about that as history proves. But just because a belief is false doesnt mean it cant be held sincerely.,writing,d68ts1a,2,t5_2qh2n

Is there a reason for this? Is it common?Second when an agent requests something like Send the first  pages of your novel are they asking for Word pages tabletsized pages or what?Third I recently queried an agent and their turn around time is  weeks. Regardless of the outcome is it likely that the agent will respond at all? Or can I expect the standard rejected date method of I didnt like you so I wont dignify you with a call back?Im sure I have more questions but this was all I could think of at the moment.Ooh!

This has very little to do with grammar although glaring grammar errors in a submitted sample are an insult to the reader and much more to do with the larger aspects of how the prose is constructed ie. paragraph structure sentence flow word choice dialogue how information is presented voice etc etc etc.Perhaps Im missing something and youre reading samples which have already been vetted for this... but honestly Im going to come right out and say respectfully youre mistaken.,writing,d6dkzin,14,t5_2qh2n

8594803,0,t1_d6fxi6r,The following is just my personal opinion so take with a grain of salt I am not a professional.Whilst showing you have a built in fan base is never a bad thing I think wattpad is a tricky way to measure things. I say this for two reasons Things that get popular on wattpad arent necessarily publication quality. In some ways wattpad functions a lot like fanfiction  the audience is there but theyre not necessarily looking for quality writing.And following on from that... The things we read online arent necessarily things wed be willing to pay for in real life.I forgive a lot more in free online material than I would in a book I bought from a store.One other thing that agents have to consider is whether your massively popular wattpad novel has the potential to sell a lot more than it already has.Andy Weirs The Martian had this potential because the fact it was being turned into a movie meant that a whole new audience would suddenly hear about it.This isnt true for every novel though.Also  Im not sure youd want to reveal at the query stage that the novel youre currently querying is already online  that may put off agents who do care about these things. For critique though  youre probably fine putting up a chapter or two. Personally I wouldnt put up more than that. ,writing,d6fxwf0,4,t5_2qh2n

All art is created by way of adaptation. Even when someone would think its a muselike intervention we still find evidence to the contrary. You shouldnt be afraid to write anything as long as you adapt it to your own understanding of meaningfulness and or beauty or some other raison detre.

8717823,0,t3_4zcm4v,If whats going on between your characters is compelling the fictional setting and all its history will just be the coolness that surrounds them but you dont need to explain it.  The less you explain the more a reader will spontaniously fill in those blanks with their own ideas.  Your characters live in it they dont need to have anything explained to them.Take any fiction where the setting is present day and  accurate the author doesnt bother to explain the history of the world unless its a bit of trivia.  Its taken for granted that the world is the way it is.  We speak English in the United States not French because thats just how things happened no need to explain it every time someone speaks English and not French.If you wrote a story where the French founded a nation where the United States is now sure that seems fictional but to the people who live in the story its totally normal so they never bother to think its strange.  You might elude to the event that caused that change but just think  would you bother to explain this history if it WASNT fictional?  I dont bother to tell people the history of the founding of the original colonies each time I go for ice cream in Boston just because it MIGHT have been settled by Germany in an alternate history.  Then again if were at the site of a battle it may come up in conversation but still theres no great mystery about the way things turned out most people just accept it whether they know the cause or not.Maybe Im wrong but it seems like your focus is on the characters Id say just let people try to justify your world however the want and if it turns out youve made a mistake well youre going to paint yourself deeper into a corner by adding detail and youll be leaving yourself more ways out if youre vague.  So Id say elude to the changes but leave out anything complex that will get you into trouble.

8745267,0,t3_4zsbps,I learnt to write by by learning about screenplays first. The screenplay should only note two things what is seen and what is heard. Instead of describing what is there implement its significance into the text and if it isnt significant why is it there?.Example instead of begininning a chapter with  pages describing the room its lighting the way it smells how many tiles are on the floor etc. use a characters actions to drive the description. As he enters the room he is instantly overpowered by the stench of old socks. He tries to find a spot to sit but the dim lights make it hard to find to find a surface that isnt littered in trash.Action behaviour and intent should drive any text. And most importantly only incorporate details if they hold significance. So either fit it in to be important or exclude itreplace it with something that will drive the story forward.,writing,d6yt8mn,2,t5_2qh2n

8802192,0,t1_d75vbjy,The Purdue OWL is a great place to start. So is anything by Grammar Girl. Chicago is the more widelyaccepted style used for novels so your best bet is sticking with that. As for some quick tips here are a few When an attribution follows or interrupts a quote end the quote with a comma. A period should only be used in a quote if its not followed by an attribution.CORRECT    gt     Ill be back later he said.    INCORRECTgt     Ill be back later. He said. In the paragraph part of your Home ribbon in MS Word is a box where you can change a lot of your formatting rules. It is there where you can set your indentation to . which is the standard. Please avoid using tabs in its place. Margins should be  unless otherwise stated by your publishing house or editor. Avoid using quotation marks outside of dialogue also known as Scare Quotes. If something really needs to be emphasized use italics. USE CONTRACTIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. Seriously thats how people commonly talk and its awkward and clunky otherwise. Even if youre writing a period piece unless the nobility are speaking contractions are your friend. Use page breaks after the end of your chapter before starting a new one. Ive seen formatting that leaves gremlins unwanted characters behind or even just a dozen or so enter key presses afterward to get to the next page. A page break is much cleaner.  While there may be advocates for two spaces after a sentence one space is more widelyaccepted so stick to that unless otherwise told. Brush up on comma usage. Ive often seen comma splices used to continue a thought where more firm punctuation was called fora period question mark or exclamation point. Know the difference between an em dash  and an en dash  and how theyre used Ive seen hypens used when they meant an em dash and it can be confusing at first glance trying to figure that out. ALWAYS start a new paragraph when theres a new speaker during dialogue. Dialogue is a nightmare with more than one speaker in the same paragraph. That should be a good start.   ,writing,d75wjqt,26,t5_2qh2n

Morale and mindfulness need to be instilled.If you have a medieval mercenary his disciplines going to be different from a welltrained soldier. You can go as far back to Ancient Greece and read the poems by Archilochus a mercenary and see how it compares to the heroic Iliad and Homer was a contemporary to Archilochus to see that separation of resolve.If he hates killing have him recognize the lifeanddeath situation.

I mean Benji is her childhood friend and still a friend but there is no real indication of the status of their friendship do the meet every day or just once or twice a week? Are they writing every day? their hobbies together etc.. I think for an introduction it would be easier as a reader to start a day or two earlier.

8837162,0,t3_515j6o,I wrote a blog piece about character naming which might give you some ideas.Heres a quick summary Baby name books  Not only do baby name books have thousands of different names from all countries and cultures but they also include the meanings of names.  The phone directory  A great resource if youve got a great sounding surname but want to quickly and efficiently look though lots of first names to match it up with. Film and TV credits  Thousands of people are involved in making a television show or movie so watching the credits to the end may well give you the inspiration youre looking for. Maps and travel listings  Imagine a guy called John London youre probably picturing a smartly dressed British guy. Now imagine a guy called Jack Alabama hes probably not wearing a suit. The Bible  The bible is a great tool for names there are a lot of popular names out there that you probably wouldnt realise are biblical but do still have some connotations.Things to remember Get the right period  Names come in and out of fashion and certain names can have very strong connections with certain periods of time. Get the right location  Its important that if youre writing a certain character to be form a certain part of the world to get their name right.  Check the meaning  Its important to check the meaning of a name before you commit to it.  Test the pronunciation  Make sure people dont stumble over the pronunciation of names as it can really pull someone out of a book. Take into account all the players  Dont just name your characters one by one make sure they work in groups so they dont get confused with one another. You could also consider associated characters having complementary names. Dont use real people  Whilst its ok to be inspired by the names of real people dont take their name and their character.,writing,d7a3ot7,1,t5_2qh2n

8887028,0,t3_51z9jx,gtShould I just throw this piece of crap out there and let it be ripped to shreds by people who know better than me?Yes. I honestly love getting critiqued on anything I produce. Not only does it help you get better but I think never being seen is a far worse fate for a work than being ripped apart. A book that nobody sees is never given the chance at reaching its full potential. That potential could be turning it into a good book or it could just be a good learning opportunity. And if it is a learning opportunity it is still best for someone else to provide feedback.

8887369,0,t1_d7g4rw6,One last thing I thought of is maybe your editing technique is bogging you down...Ill copypaste from another post maybe it will be relevant for youId recommend taking a look at Sol Steins Stein on Writing.Much of his advice doesnt sing to me he is interested in crafting bestselling suspensethrillers. However he does have a large amount of great advice on writing Precisely on being specific in your visualization and conveying those images economically. Plus he does have advice every writer could use on tension and pacing maybe not to the same degree he chooses. As always keep your saltgrains handy.He also dedicates a lot of time on the revision process. And his method is one I really like.Basically he reminds that there are so many layers of revision from sentencelevel copyediting and flow to paragraph and scene structure and flow all the way up to overarching story doctoring.It sounds obvious to say it but he recommends a TRIAGE approach. Dont belabour over sentences or paragraphs in one chapter if two chapters later you might decide that whole scene needs to be cut for pacingplotstory.In essence fix the story structure first. Look at your scenes as atomic entities. Figure out if they work perfectly or if they need to be tweaked added to subtracted from reordered rewritten or scrapped entirely. Do the same with your character arcs.Once youre happy with the  foot view of each scene and character and the story overall then zoom in to the  foot view making sure that each chapterscene works as a dramatic entity on its own. Do what you did for the story on that scene.Keep zooming in until youre happy with the pacingplotcharactersstory happy with the content of each scene have cut all the fat and added all the meat that your story calls for. And THEN go about making sure your sentences are pretty which does not mean complex.Crazy waste of time otherwise.,writing,d7g4wug,3,t5_2qh2n

8903304,0,t1_d7i0xs0,Right. And all the authors who stated were all hunky dory makes such a great sound bytes.Writers are people and some people are depressed. Youre thinking in absolutes. Of course there are a lot of writers who struggle with it. I already stated the higher the intelligence or empathy which a lot of writers are. And those writers who are depressed might want to romanticize the situation. Were writers after all and the stars of our own story.But there are as many professionals out there in all creative crafts that show up do their jobs and get paid. Do you just wave your wands of absolutes and wink them out of existence because their data points dont match your hypothesis? If writers were as tenth as bad as de Nero says would businesses want to work with them? Some publishers are owned by cereal companies. If de Nero had said writers are made of mostly cream cheese everyone would smile and nod. Either be so brilliant that companies will hire you despite the fact that the guy thinks writers could play the werewolf lead for most of the shifter stories set in the past couple years or you do your job and be easy to work with because very few of any creative field are the de NeroMonty Python of their field. And for some writing is a cure for their depression not the cause. Will they disappear from your hypothesis too?Comedy writers do seem to deal with more depression than is typical but thats still not saying that all writers are depressed or implied any causation. A lot of jobs are linked to depression including eighth grade teachers and dentists. Are depressive people drawn to writing because its a solitary profession that doesnt have to deal with people most days? Sounds far more reasonable. ,writing,d7i1rkb,1,t5_2qh2n

8925892,0,t3_52htlv,In terms of in a single scene you can most definitely have too many characters. Though putting a number on it is difficult because it depends on how clear your writing is. Id say four people in a scene is fine if you make sure they have distinct enough reasons for being there and you tag well enough so that people always know who is speaking. In terms of overall  seems like a lot. But it entirely depends on what level of involvement they have. If these are all going to be characters who come and go with important crucial information then you could have an issue with people forgetting who is who. If they crop up by the by just as an aside you could get away with it as it wont really matter if people remember exactly what happened last time they showed up. If it were me I would certainly try and combine a few of those extra characters just to lessen the confusion and if any of them are at any points vital to the story maybe include little refresher bits of information when they crop up repeatedly. As far as your four main characters I think that seems fine as long as they are all distinct enough personalities to justify their existence. If they are all bringing different things to the party it will work and make it easier for people to know who is sayingdoing what. ,writing,d7kresb,2,t5_2qh2n

It has become a modern cliche and I see too many authors relying just on this one aspect to create their characters. There are stories that dont work without a pure evil villain. Consider for example the awful remake of Halloween. By introducing the sad backstory of Michael Myers they destroyed the aura of pure evilness that made him feel so alien and terrifying. By making us sympathize with his childhood they established a connection that you arent suposed to have. His character represents that feeling of terror you get in an horrible nightmare. Once you can empathize with him the terror vanishes. Michael Myers was such a great villain because of his pure black soul.Also Hans Landa and The Joker are pure evil and are one of the best villains in recent movie history. Complexity of a character doesnt correlate with his morality. ,writing,d7l9env,2,t5_2qh2n

Unless youre going back and forth throughout the story in which case youll need to denote it somehow each time theres a change. As for the bonding my characters experienced something similar. It started with the MC joining a group of  people who were strangers to MC but had a variety of relationships and very little trust amongst themselves. Over the course of the book they become a cohesive unit. Occasionally a shift in the relationship occurred within a scene. If the narrator was aware of the change they would make note of it through the their internal monologue. If they were unaware I just let the reader figure it out for themselves. But most of the changes in dynamic happened slowly as is typical with relationships so I showed those changes by having their dynamic shift somewhat from one point in time to the next. For example the MC and her mentor have a pretty formal relationship in the beginning but  of the way into the book theyre a few months into their relationship. At this point theres a scene that starts with them arguing then shifts to a heart to heart and ends with the MC making her mentor laugh with a selfdeprecating joke. It all would have felt forced if Id done that too early but by that point the reader has seen their relationship evolve enough that the interaction feels natural. My goal was to show the evolution without ever stating it explicitly kind of a show vs tell approach. ,writing,d7o4abv,3,t5_2qh2n

He found the MC on streets selling some technomagic its pretty common on the world this is set on he and some other older kids had made. The villain asked him if he would want to learn more about technomagic and the starved kid obiviously said yes as he had talent and interest to it from a small kid and he was a naive kid. He took him to his mansion and gave him a bed and food. He took some other kids too but noticed MC was extraordinarily talented and made him train extra hard. He put the kill switch there as a security measure would he really want someone else control his death ray?.

9031735,0,t3_53ymz0,Ill come at this from a different angle that of a reader.  I personally find writing that bogs down into too much detail about a character to be slow and a chore to get through. I dont want or need a lot of physical description in a character.  I prefer one or two distinct things that trigger my imagination to fill in the rest.  Those distinctions dont even need to be physical and could be something as simple as a tone of voice or that heshe is engaged in some particular activity.  Ill do the rest in my head and the story can keep progressing.  Just my opinion as a reader. ,writing,d7xgzl8,1,t5_2qh2n
9033638,0,t3_53ymz0,I think there are just a few questions that need to be answered when developing a character. What roll do they have int he story? Who are they in the beginning? How will they change by the end? What do they want? Why do they want that? How will they get it?When it comes to overall personality I usually begin with a single attribute of their character that expresses itself in everything they do. Indifference irritability hyperactivity loyalty all for example. After that I give each of them A thing or a quirk as some might call it. Every character has a thing that makes them stand out from the others. Like an intense interest in electrical engineering an obsession for knives photography or a passion for cars for example. Others may express themselves along the way but there is usually one major one. After I figure all that out I begin to think about why they have these attributes and quirks which becomes their backstory. Another thing I like to do is start with a trope then give it a twist that turns the trope on its head. I think this is really the secret for a great character. Begin with an archetype like the mentor the hero or the side kick and then give it a twist. Maybe the mentor is a child? Maybe the hero has no moral compass and will do anything to achieve their goals? Maybe the side kick is actually smarter and more powerful than the hero they accompany? I dont think you need to know all of this before writing but a good chunk of these should be developed before hand I would say. The rest youll probably discover as you go. ,writing,d7xp7w5,1,t5_2qh2n

The combatants abilities are evenly matched neither will win or lose. Losing  retreating. Your narrator  character is losing and should be evident within  blows that unless he has a deathwish he needs to find a means to disengage. Winning. Your narrator  character is winning and should be evident within  blows that unless the opponent is up to trickery victory or victoly should be imminent. By simply reversing the outcomes above losing when expecting a win or winning unexpectedly etc. you can switch up what your readers expect.

This works on many different levels but simply if I write Jimmy was afraid I the writer have decided what the emotion is given it a name and reported it to the reader.  The reader hears this as information only.But if I write A crazy chill swept up Jimmys spine and burrowed into his belly then I havent interpreted for the reader.  Instead I have described the situation or events as they unfold with as little interpretation as possible.  Thus the reader is able to experience whats happening first hand instead of simply being told third hand what is happening.An old writing professor of mine used to describe this as leaving room in the story for the reader.

Id guess that the average reader whatever that is is more interested in the emotional impact the writing delivers and less invested in the credentials of the author.If Im reading a story about a heroic spaceman fighting off the Brain Leeches of Eephor V then obviously I cant expect the author to have any experience with that kind of scenario. I can expect however that the author knows something of what it feels like to contend with something bizarre and potentially hostile and to translate his emotional experience to the page.That said if youre writing about a general contractor for example and you decide to write about the things he does during his day youd do well to know what some of those things are and the tools he might work with because it will ring false to anyone who knows you meant strike plate where you wrote latch plate.Give things the dignity of their names.

Theres one for music. Then because they couldnt nail it down any finer there is an oscar for technical achievement whatever that means this year it wont be the same next year.Then there is the oscar for lifetime achievement.  Thats the closest thing to what just happened with Dylan and the Nobel Prize in Literature.Why wasnt the prize given to a starving but brilliant author of literary fiction? Thats the question thats rubbing the community of writers the wrong way.  I have no skin in this game and dont much care but I can understand why they would pick Dylan. Dylan created almost single handedly most of the ethos of the s revolution in the US. Redefining freedom of speech. Enabling civil disobedience and carrying your arrest record like a badge of honor. Holding up a mirror to our fetish for violent sports and sports promoters for their abuse of athletes listen to Who Killed Davey Moore?.But none of that is why the Committee chose Dylan. They decided that this year the prize for literature would go to a lifetime of achievement the collective impact of which needed in their minds to be recognized. They chose Dylan.

9484283,0,t3_5aostd,From Chuck PalahniukgtSudden means quickly and without warning but using the word suddenly both slows down the action and warns your reader. Do you know whats more effective for creating the sense of the sudden? Just saying what happens.gtI pay attention to every motion every movement my eyes locked on them.gtSuddenly The gun goes off.gtWhen using suddenly you communicate through the narrator that the action seemed sudden. By jumping directly into the action you allow the reader to experience that suddenness first hand. Suddenly also suffers from being nondescript failing to communicate the nature of the action itself providing no sensory experience or concrete fact to hold on to. Just  suddenly.gtFeel free to employ suddenly in situations where the suddenness is not apparent in the action itself. For example in Suddenly I dont hate you anymore the suddenly substantially changes the way we think about the shift in emotional calibration.,writing,d9i5429,498,t5_2qh2n

Sometimes a semicolon will need to replace a comma as the break is too fast otherwise or there are other commas in the sentence that are meant to read faster.I see the comma as moving fastest.Semicolons and colons are roughly equal in speed but a colon conveys some sort of equality at least oneway.Periods I only use logically.Dashes are malleable. I think they signify the longest break at fastest equal to a period. If I dont think the break reads long enough I stretch the dash longer.,writing,d9oi5zl,0,t5_2qh2n

Of  agents only  may see the potential in your book  so if that agent is number  and you stopped querying after   well then you wont sell.You may have also accidentally written the type of book no one is currently buying  again thats bad luck.BUTYA in particular is a genre with a lot of established conventions. You can increase your chances of being published by Not writing in one of the very oversaturated areas of the market i.e Dystopia VampiresWhen you write in a saturated genre you make it so that your MS has to be beyond exceptional for an agent to take a risk on it. Knowing the genre inside out  learn what kind of character and voice YA readers like  give them that.Also  know what turns agents off in that genre  and avoid that. Being persistent. You may not sell every MS you write. You have to keep writing until you do.By the way with number  Im not suggested you try and follow market trends  you cant its impossible to know what people want and when. But right now for example its much harder to sell a vampire novel or a dystopian novel than other types of book in the market.

In my version the main character totally buys into the prophecy its not about him its supposed to be about this other guy but as he goes through he realizes that all the things that this guy is supposed to do is actually being done by the people around him and the guy is getting credit.  Eventually someone takes him aside and explains that the prophecy is one of thousands and thousands of poems that this exiled prince wrote over the course of decades.  Basically a couple scholars found a few that kind of sort of looked like they could be metaphors for things that really happened and made a book of prophecies using a handful of the poems.  Its all a sham.Anyway if you want to make sure your audience doesnt start rolling their eyes from the very beginning you can open up with the chosen one failing miserably at something and then being given credit for it when your main character helps him along.

9773429,0,t3_5f5wcj,I think a lot of writers have trouble identifying what makes an action scene truly interesting.  When I read an action prologue i slog through it.  Why?  Because I dont have any reason to care.  Im not invested in the characters the situation  hell I dont even know the world at that point.  My point is this the action is cool but isnt the part that makes a scene memorable.  Its the stakes characters and consequences that make a scene.  This applies to every scene in a story  not just the action scenes.  Focus on character heightening your conflict and making the reader care  thats the key.  If a scene serves no purpose to further any of these things its probably not worth writing because it will be boring.  action and cinematically dont make a scene interesting.  The characters and audience investment does.  So many people on this sub use the Kingkiller series as a model for great fantasy but seem to forget that the series has very few violent or action packed scenes throughout its  thousand word span.

The main priority however is to choose the idea youre more likely to stick with and finish. Writing is a longterm commitment and you need to pick an idea you wont give up on.ampnbspHeres a little more general advice. The best stories are usually driven by highly motivated characters who have skills and flaws strengths and weaknesses and are determined to achieve something. If you absolutely require a second opinion then my advice is to choose the idea that has more fleshed out characters.ampnbspWhat makes an idea interesting isnt always the complexity or uniqueness of it but how said idea is executed.

In the paragraph right after The First Day we follow the perspective of a young orphan who finds the protagonist from before...then suddenly in the next paragraph time has passed and were now back with the protagonists perspective. Clearing these up would help the story flow a lot better maybe use visible breaks to delineate these changes.Another thing is the length of the paragraphs. A lot of these look like larger paragraphs clumped together and it would serve the pace of the story to break them up a bit. For example in the second paragraph after The First Day it would help if you changed paragraphs for each speaker look in some of your favorite books and youll see that most authors do this.But overall it looks like an exciting story.

9886837,0,t1_daw8rvy,Oh I see what youre saying.  Yeah I definitely think a big part of being a genius is making better use of the tools not just playing it by ear.  Reading your other post made me laugh because it reminded me of the what I witnessed in taking lessons in jazz improvisation.  Learn everything in all  keys keep practicing until you can just hear it man etc.  like I get that the theory needs to be simple enough to be able to simultaneously compose and play something at the same time which means youre going to be putting a ton of practice time into it but that doesnt mean that you just shoot in the dark for practice methods.  There might not be any literature on a scientific approach to learning how to improvise but I bet there are better methods than what I was presented with.  Something to do with a combination of ear and muscle memory.  Of course improvising is so incredibly rooted in the subconscious that asking someone who is good at it to explain how to get good at it might actually be a terrible idea in many cases.    Whereas writing is a much more consciousminded activity so maybe more of the best teachers and more of the people with the better writing methods might be the best writers themselves. I think one of the most important methods to learning improvisation is playing with people who are better than yourself like you hear a lot of people in athletics doing.  It allows you to know what it feels like to play with someone who is really sensitive to what the other musicians are playing.  Writing on the other hand I dont know.  It seems like it is more studied than practiced.    In either case learning the techniques seem to be really important.  I know of an extremely talented jazz drummer who wasnt taught early on that the best drummers always keep the melody or some form of the melody going in their heads during a solo.  He was floored that he didnt learn that until college.  It ended up making his solos way more musical instead of just being a bunch of complex polyrhythms hemiolas etc.  Jazz education seems to be realy unorganized though which kind of sucks.  Its surprising to hear lit teachers still tell students to just play it by ear when it comes to storytelling considering how deeply studied writing is.  I mean teachingstudying improvisation in academic settings is still a relatively novel concept but writings been studied for centuries.,writing,dawa0hw,2,t5_2qh2n

Im currently querying agents to see if I can get my manuscript out there while I work on a few other side projects. Im also an assistant editor for an established literary journal and occasionally dabble in sports writing whenever I have an opportunity. Last year I was also freelancing for an entertainment magazine on the side managed to win NaNoWriMo AND finish and defend an MFA thesis on top of a  hour day job and family obligations.This past year I took a hit by not being able to finish NaNo surgery and September was really unproductive because I was in the process of moving into my house but other than that Ive been extremely productive picked up a Pushcart and a Best of the Net nomination put together another manuscript and performed poetry in a few events in town.But I still manage to squeeze some gaming time here and there because I feel it reinvigorates my creativity. Playing games like Witcher  Fallout  and now more recently Dragon Age Inquisition makes me really appreciate the writing in those games and I feel like I wouldnt be half the writer I am if it wasnt for my videogame or tabletop RPG time the latter I had to drastically scale since my gaming group broke up. And games like Mass Effect just thinking about them gets me giddy because I love how wellwritten it was and whenever I see something wellwritten whether its a longform sports article or videogame dialogue I get inspired.What does suffer is my sleep.

I dont agree fully with them though I do get what your saying and understand the perspective.I think that what youre saying assumes that a relationship can only be built in person for one. I suppose Im taking that from your last comment that youd need to go year after year to make an impact. Before working for an agent I talked to lots of agents on twitter regularly. Total cost there was zero dollars. Some of these agents I met at a writing conference then found on twitter and said Hey! Remember me?Again like you say you gotta have a book which was my main point in the previous post about how you dont need to know anyone. Second I agree those pitch sessions can be too much stress for what theyre worth. I much prefer query review or first pages review one on one with a literary agent or editor at a publishing house. That is far more practical and straightforward advice specific to you. Pitch sessions really can only have one positive result and it isnt the desired result you were hoping for  further consideration. Honestly a query is far less stress for far more benefit. For me all of your points are solved by going to a writers conference thats actually geared towards writers. Where the speakers talk about how to plot better books or how to create better villains or what isnt working right now that everyone is doing etc. If the conference isnt focused on how you can improve your writing then it offers diminishing returns.,writing,daxwo9a,3,t5_2qh2n

9916350,0,t1_da7sqej,I think youve got it backwards. These bits of story structure dont pull from the Heros Journey. The Heros Journey became so iconic because it follows story structure. Story structure can help make your story more complete however. An example Weiland uses is the Death Star blowing up Alderaan in Star Wars. Luke the hero isnt even present for this scene and it doesnt really effect him very much. Thats because that scene is a Pinch Point which is where you reader needs to be reminded what the antagonist is all about. The key being its about the effect it has on the reader.Id advise you to give K.M. Weilands  Secrets of Story Structure. Everything made so much more sense to me.,writing,db04hzm,1,t5_2qh2n

9925332,0,t3_5hksw4,One useful purpose for this list of  observations they arent all really senses is to take a look into the mind of L Ron Hubbard and people similar to him. This might be useful if you ever need to craft a character that is the leader of a cult. The first thing to notice is how he hijacks the language to create a mystery. Everyone knows what senses are and they know that they are different from self awareness. Senses pick up on stuff. Awareness interprets what was picked up.He blurs this distinction which if done with great confidence and some bits of truth for support can sell that mystery to the followers.  Example defining moisture as a sense defining affinity as a sense. We can sense fluids and humidity. We like certain kinds of moisture thats affinity. It suits us. Thats not a sense its an observation and conclusion.Notice how he breaks out individual elements of the sense of hearing into several specific measurable attributes like tone rhythm pitch volume. This is scientificlike. Truthlike. This is selling the mystery.Notice how he mentions taste and smell but at some distance from each other and with no real development. It makes me suspect his palate was somehow impaired. Smell and emotions are tightly bound. Perhaps uncoupling the sense of smell from the emotions is a pathway to create a character indifferent to the emotions of others someone without empathy.Compass direction is a key trait in some primitive cultures. Some of their languages can only give directions in NSEW not in turn right then turn left. This isnt a sense its a mental model of the world specific to that culture. Its how they organize their reality but its not how they sense it.But enough about Ron. Allow me to play guru for a moment.Heres a sense that is not on the list and it can drive people a bit crazy. Proximity sense. Example we would partner up in Aikido class A and B are partners for this example. A and B would stand with A facing away from B B facing As back. B held a rubber knife. The drill was for B to bop A on the head with the knife not too hard and for A to twist  degrees and block the strike with perfect timing. It would always begin with false twists with no strike or strikes on the head that succeeded without any twist. It always ended with A and B looking like they were dancing or faking it. The cool thing is A wasnt learning as much as B during this exercise. Only B knew if he was really intending to attack or not. At the end B could commit to the attack in his mind and A would twist without B moving at all. A would perceive this as a failure but B would know it was a success.  They would switch roles and the same pattern would occur again.  Switch partners same pattern only it took less time until they looked like they were dancing.OK guru time is over.Proximity sense. A mystery. In cats this can be the vibrations they pick up through their whiskers or the pads on their feet or the scents they pick up through their noses.  In humans this can be sounds picked up through their ears or almost invisible shadows seen by their eyes.  So at best proximity sense isnt a sense at all but a coordinated effort among many senses coupled with an interpretation of why a behavior occurred or what behavior is about to occur. See the mystery building? See the ambiguity coupled with real events?  Do you catch the possibility for many other interpretations of the real events or many other misinterpretations? We crave explanation. Its why we keep reading really long books. A true believers blind spot is to the alternate explanations of an event their world must remain coherent so alternative explanations will be dismissed effortlessly. Curiously a true scientists blind spot is exactly the same. Both are very uncomfortable with voids in explanations of an event. They will hedge and deny and dismiss but they will not allow a real event to go unexplained.  Its why ghosts exist for true believers but not for scientists. The true believer felt something so something exists and they interpret it as a ghost. The scientist felt nothing and measured nothing so there nothing happened.OK one more push of the envelope of mystery sometimes during the Aikido exercise A would see B start to move not in a shadow on the wall but in their minds eye. I know this because it happened for me as well as a few other students. Not everyone experienced this. Did I become aware of my mind processing the input of all of my senses or did I uncover a new ability different from the physical senses?  Could someone found a martial arts cult based on this? They did and all it took was a tactile demonstration of the mystery and a coherent explanation.In my training in Shiatsu I notice that with a little practice I could see pain in someone else. I could see pressure points. This started by feeling these things in someone else by holding my hand a few inches above their body and scanning back and forth much like someone does with a metal detector at the beach. It felt like pressure at first then more like heat then resolved into the image of a point of light. Could someone found a church based on this? Many have and all it took was a tactile demonstration of the mystery and a coherent explanation.There is much in our world that is wondrous and inspiring. We tend to muck it up with our explanations.,writing,db1anh7,2,t5_2qh2n

Is it backstory that can go later?  Why isnt it later?Most prologues Ive seen give a bunch of useless information honestly.  The author is trying their best to ground the reader in the setting and what caused the coming incidents but most readers I know can understandpicture what has happened without being infodumped.  And I really havent found one that couldnt be placed somewhere else.  Wanting to show parents assassination?  Midway through have a companion the protagonist met along the way ask about why hes doing these things.  Boom he goes into the story of his parents death.  I dont need an elaborate tale of the family being blessed by the gods or anything.  I can get that info in conversation.  My family has been blessed by the gods since the beginning and Ill be damned if I let you try to steal my rightful throne.Im sure your prologues are far more complex than what I wrote but does it accomplish the same purpose?  Maybe not.  But the goddess who blesses them better be extremely important to the story.  The assassination methods better be extremely important to the story.

Personally I would be looking for some specific detail to convey anxiously without that adverb but I do find adverb  sentence phrase constructions often awkward.Jack and Jill moved slowly through the room Jack held Jills hand anxiously while she greeted those they passed is a comma splice. That comma would need to be a period. I think its a better strategy to structure this sentence as two separate sentences than as a single sentence.

10042553,0,t3_5ji5eq,Words or names that arent words or names is harder to read.From here on out when I say words I mean words or names.What that means is readers generally know the language.  Same goes for names.  They encode them into their brains and stop having to spell them out.  Fouryearolds go CAT cat adults just go cat.  Same goes for DAVE Dave.  Thats perhaps a simplistic example but the point should carry the words get encoded and start being something that can scan and communicate very quickly because theyre familiar and expected.Playing around with spelling breaks that and throws the reader back into learning mode.  They cant go Jynipher they have to mentally stutter and encode the new word.  They cant go Instigotot thats the new robotfuel in this story they have to remind themselves every time they see the word what it was.  Its annoying and harder to read.Its common for authors to want to invent new words.  The easiest way for the audience to read and accept them is to at least keep spelling standard such as appropriating an existing word or forming compound words.  Names have a touch more latitude since names are accepted to be a little odder but radical spelling doesnt help.There are tons of things competing for eyeballs and attention these days.  Its not the s when a new book or play was A Big Deal.  Consider how most people browse something like Youtube.  Nearly everyone clicks off to the next video the moment their attention starts to wander.  It can be anything even a bad mic stupid music or rambling.  Books are no different.Especially when it comes to hooking a buyer when theyre reading the sample coming across wacky WTF is going on here spelling in words can very easily be the reason someone marks that story off their list and moves on to the next thing theyll consider.  Its probably better to not give them such an easy nope next.  The time to get radical with something like spelling and use of the language is after one has built up an audience that is willing to extend some trust.  This is weird but I liked the last three books Ill stick with it for a chapter or two to see if I can get past this weird shit thats making it harder to read.And even then I still question it.  I know a Big Name Author who has a series that does a LOT of radical spelling with words and its one of the reasons me and some other people I know have stopped reading the series.

Nobody is perfectly good all the time just as nobody is perfectly bad all the time and more importantly villains good villains at least dont see themselves as villains in the first place. They always have reasons that in their own mind are justifiable.  ampnbspOne of my favorite stories is one loosely based on the Count of Monte Cristo in which the lead character  a wildly successful defense attorney known for battling wicked corporations and evil governments by day  goes vigilante by night and destroys the lives of anyone who has ever wronged him.  In a turning point he finds love finds hope and realizes he is hurting many more innocent lives in his quest for justice. But. He is too far gone. He knows nothing else.  So he pulls himself up by the bootstraps tosses love away and continues down his destructive path.  Its entirely sympathetic but the villain remains a villain. ampnbspThere is also the popular concept of the villain as the heros shadow self a dark reflection of who the hero would have been had he never taken his own journey of growth.  So you could give your character a chance to be the hero this time and watch him fail. ampnbspOr in your case we know the villain started down the path of righteousness but succumbed to the trials within.  What would he do if he met somebody on the same path of his old self and tried to save them from the same heartbreak he endured?ampnbspGood luck with your writing!,writing,dbhqmtq,1,t5_2qh2n

Some people like the comradery in doing something difficult together or the sense of competition. Talking about what youve written turns into a positive feedback loop which it turns out is motivating for a lot of people and to keep it going by design you have to write more at some point. I dont get why anytime one of these writing challenges comes up someone has to complain about it. If its not going to work for you dont participate. Just because other people write faster or have a different method than you do or are motivated in a different way doesnt mean everything they write will be crap.

10158704,0,t3_5ldp3s,Ive been noticing a lot of authors who dont actually describe their characters with such detail. This might be a terrible example but there was a kerfuffle recently over whether Hermoine in Harry Potter was black. It does seem a bit like JK Rowling retconning the story to insert diversity into her mainly anglo cast but it brings up a good point theres barely any description of what she looks like beyond her hair and her teeth as I recall. What hooked the readers on the character was her personality who the character was more than what they looked like. Some description is good but Id say unless the shape of a characters skull factors into the story its not exactly necessary that you dictate it to the reader.

I write under pen names for both genders. Dont worry about how things will look promoting the book to people you know or at book fairs. Frankly I dont find those things worthwhile. If you become famous and have a fan club and go to conventions and interviews and stuff just be straight up about it. The author name is just a marketing tool. You wanted people to make certain assumptions about your book so it would find the right audience. When people see a book on a shelf by some Evelyn Richardson they dont think it will be a slambang actionadventure fantasy they think a mystery or romance novel or something. You are very sorry if anyone felt lied to but you are also upfront about your gender on things like your author websiteblogfacebookwhatever. People who see these things have most likely bought your books already and arent going to change their minds about them based on your gender except maybe a few dummies.If you dont want to have that type of conversation then go ahead and use initials.

Seriously I dont believe in writers block. I really dont. I consider it an excuse for procrastination andor a lack of confidence and a professional writer has no time for either. Writing may be about creativity but being a professional writer is also about discipline. Sure there are times when you just dont feel like writing when theres nothing stirring. So sit down at the keyboard put on the music you like softly in the background and start writing anyway. Within a few minutes youll get into it and the ideas will begin to gel.  gt gt Think of it like working out. Think of all those days you dont want to do it but boy do you feel better after you get it done. Simply put if you want to be a professional act like one.Stop revising stop restitching. Quit cringing at something you yourself just put on a computer screen. Write your damned story through to the end. That will be the only thing that separates you from every other aspiring author finishing the job you started. Carpenters dont wake up and feel wishywashy about the way they drive nails into wood. Dentists dont develop existential angst about the last root canal they performed. You as a writer have one job to do. That job is to write. Even when your writing feels weak and even when the dumbest most mawkish bullshit comes tumbling out of your characters mouths.

10231730,0,t3_5mhujx,So I cant say if this will or will not work without doing the experiment you described but I can think of some pitfalls you may run into.  Now Ill preface by saying that I do read web serials okay really only stuff by Wildbow and lots of web comics but I dont use Royal Road Legends and I dont know what the culture on that platform is like so everything I say may be inapplicable there.In games VariableRatio Schedules work because the participant is active the entire time waiting for their payout. For a web serial you get on to check if theres a new update then continue about your day. Theres nothing intrinsically engaging about that and it assumes your readers are actively waiting to read your story the second it comes out. In my experience that isnt necessarily the case. In general people read web serials when they have a moment of down time on the bus or when theyre bored. They dont sit around waiting for it to post like they would a TV show to start which people are shying away from now anyway. Lots of readers also use things like RSS and might pick up your post until days or even weeks after you release it and other people who wait for a big batch to be released so they can consume it all at once. There might be a group of people who really enjoy a system like this but I dont theyll be the majority of your readers.Theres also the set of readers who might not realize youre gamifying the system and instead assume youre posting inconsistently because youre lazy.  Almost every blog detailing how to start a web serialcomic states that a consistent schedule is one of the most important things because readers get really annoying with hiatuses. You might be able to get around that by saying something like updates once a week on a nonfixed schedule but if I read that Id assume you were updating inconsistently because you werent capable of maintaining a fixed schedule and would check back at my leisure or add you to RSS. The other option is to explain youre gamifying the system and anger a different set of readers that sees it as a subversive marketing ploy.If youre curious about this you should try reading web serials and seeing what does and doesnt work for them. Set up a script that reminds you to read someone elses serial on a random update schedule and see how you feel about it. Get immersed in the web serial culture and see others are enjoying and why but the most important thing is just to write a great story. ,writing,dc3to80,3,t5_2qh2n

Being healthy means being physically mentally and financially healthy. If you go allin on a dream that doesnt pay out without any fallback you run the risk of crippling yourself for some of the best years of your life. Itll be harder to travel to start a family or to save for big purchases like a home or new vehicle because your debt has to come first.

You can either fumble around blind for decades while trying to figure out things like values and shading and composition and color wheel theory on your own if that ever actually happens since first you have to know what you dont know and then learn how to do it or you can stand on the shoulders of giants and learn it all while youre already working on your own stuff.If you keep in mind that any rule can be broken and know that the rules arent there to silence your voice but to give you better control of your world they stop being oppressive. Think of the rules like the walls of your house. Some of them are cosmetic walls and some of them are load bearing and some of them are both. Its hard enough to build a proper house as it stands. Short stories give you a bit more freedom because the walls arent holding that much weight but the bigger the story the more the rules need to hold more weight. If you want to tear the wall down you have to understand what it is doing and put structures in place to hold the story up while knocking down rules.Think of having an empathetic character. An empathetic character not likeable not sympathetic but a character that your reader will understand where they are coming from will ensure that the reader will read to the end because they want to know what happens to the character. If you dont have an empathetic main character something else in your story has to hold the readers interest to the end of the book more so than the average book with an empathetic character would need. There are a lot of pulls on your readers time. Without the character they want to know what happens to what else is going to keep them coming back?Murder your darlings. Its not murder the bits you dont much care about. Again if you respect your readers time youre going to want anything that doesnt fit with the story to get cut. Youre promising your reader that everything in the story matters. If it turns out that you kept a section in that you really liked but added nothing to the plot the reader is going to feel frustrated at you wasting the time.Any rule that matters is meant to help you be a better writer. No matter what the creative field youre going to go into from painting to poetry to chess to model building starting from scratch knowing nothing about what youre trying to do and expecting the person learning how to do that craft would be ridiculous. Yes there might be a person who naturally understands the rules of fiction without being told but you dont have to worry about the geniuses. There are no rules IF the piece works. If it doesnt there are lots and lots of rules that can help.I could not have believed more wholeheartedly that there are no rules. It frustrated me to no end when I would break a rule on purpose only to have older pro writers try to explain the simple rule I had broken deliberately. I didnt know at the time that they only pointed out the rule breaking that hadnt worked.I used to think that a story couldnt be good unless it was good and it broke a rule. In the decade I held that belief Id sold six stories. That was less than  success rate. Since figuring out that no one was trying to trick me into being brainwashed by the man by realizing how important a handful of simple rules are I sell three quarters of what I write and most of that is contracted before I even sit down to plot. When I break a rule now its because I understand what the rule does and compensate for that loss. Not leaving something to chance whether the story works or not is a lot easier than breaking the rule and hoping. ,writing,dcfch06,28,t5_2qh2n

If he wrote  words a day every day in the two years between Salems Lot and The Shining the difference between the word count of the Shining  and two years worth of  words a day  shows a lot of editing or maybe fewer words per day in favor of more thought. The word counts of his current novels contrasted with the time in between their publication doesnt leave much breathing room and it shows.TLDR if you plan less edit less and write faster you can pump out more books.,writing,dck29z2,3,t5_2qh2n

Youll find that thats probably about average though this is very much one of these things there is no real metric for.Fast paced thrillers for example may use much shorter chapters to keep the pace moving and readers turning the page  The Maze Runner for instance has consistently short chapters from memory.Now a lot of people will tell you that a chapter is as long as a chapter needs to be  and whilst theres some truth to that its important to understand how chapters can affect pacing.If youre finding that some of your chapters are  words then  words it might mean theres a pacing issue in the text.A  word scene may not convey enough info while a k scene that you simply couldnt split into parts may fatigue a reader and imply that youre trying to achieve too much in one scene.Or you could have that  word chapter followed by the k one and it will work just fine.Its very hard to tell until the novel is complete then you can read it through with an eye on how the chapter breaks are affecting the pace of your story.Personally  my agent suggested I try and keep my chapters consistent I had played with some very short chapters towards the climax and so they now all sit within that k range and pacing wise that feels pretty good.,writing,dckfd2s,3,t5_2qh2n

I say today because discussion of word count almost always ends in someone saying but what about title x.... and then proceeding to name a number of books that are short but were published before . Most adult fiction now is not that short especially not for a debut author.Thats not to say you cant sell a k novel  it might just be harder.And its definitely not to say that you should add filler  you should never add filler.In the edit though have a look at whether youre fully exploring your setting characters plot and side plots  it might be that theres room to develop certain threads a little more and thereby increase your word count.Also  just because you wrote a short novel doesnt mean you cant try and sell it  I remember Veronica Roth wrote a blog post about her journey to publication with Divergent and how she landed an agent for that MS at k words. Her agent then worked with her to get it up to k and her publisher then asked for even more which took the book to its published word count. So yeah  you are not without options here but on the whole its more likely youve currently got a long novella on your hands rather than a full length novel.,writing,dckom40,5,t5_2qh2n

10422458,0,t1_dcp20te,I read your what you wrote and I only have a few corrections.gt She opened the bathroom cabinet to carefully check her cleaning foams expiration date.Cleaning foam are two English words but it isnt a phrase we use in English. Im not sure what you mean. Here are some some words that I think are close to what you mean Soap which is used to clean your skin. Shampoo which is used to clean your hair. Shaving cream which is used to help you shave. Lotion which is used to make your skin soft.Maybe you mean one of those?gt it was okey. Its spelled okay. And instead of okay you could also say it was fine or it was still good because they sound a little more natural. You didnt use the word wrong it just sounds a little funny. gt She closed her bathroom cabinet and walked to her bedroom while she was drying her face with her dead brothers blue towel.This is hard to explain. Dead brother is kind of... rude. For example I wouldnt say my dead grandma. In English we call it being too blunt. We would say my grandma who passed away or my grandma whos gone now. This rule is actually kind of complicated and I can explain it more if you want just ask me! Next you would probably say ...while she dried her face.. The rules for this is actually complicated and confusing too. I can tell you what sounds right to my ear but I dont know why its right lolgt  ...she approached to it to open it... Except for the corrections I added this isnt wrong its just a bit unnatural. The common way to say it would be she walked up and opened it. But you could say she approached it and opened it or you could just say she opened it because it would be understood that she would have to approach it first to open it. Or if you mean that she saw her reflection in the glass you could just say she went to open it which implies that she didnt open it even if she meant to. gt ...or it was just her thoughts? This doesnt make much sense. I guess that you mean ...or was it just her thoughts? That would make sense. I dont know where youre from but I know that in some other languages they dont change the word order to make a question. They just add a question mark or use a questionword. In English we have questionwords too but we also move words around to make a question. For example You are a good swimmer. and Are you a good swimmer?  I was born in a hospital. and Was I born in a hospital? I can read. and Can I read? It was just her thoughts. and Was it just her thoughts?gt ...tress...Did you mean trees? Im not trying to be mean. Tress is an English word too and it makes your sentence really confusing if thats what you meant. If you meant trees you would say the trees because youre not talking about all the trees in the entire world you are just talking about the trees that the girl can see. Okay that was all I saw that was wrong. You did a great job! I know English can be hard sometimes but youre doing really well,writing,dcpgdvo,1,t5_2qh2n

10503042,0,t3_5qeg56,I have written a manipulative character before but I wrote it as a flaw to be confronted called out later. Growing into manipulation can be as easy as finding out that it gets you what you want and thats exactly how my character got it. Just remember that manipulation isnt a trait that makes your character evil their intentions going into manipulation makes them unlikable and evil.I subtly introduce the manipulation as if my character was testing the waters to see how my other character reacts to it. It started as unnecessary confrontations and little lies but exploded into fully confrontational No Way Out questions during arguments and if you were to fight back guilt trips and silent treatments would follow. This was obviously a small part of the character they had many likable traits but this was the flaw that would come apparent whenever there was a stressful situation. Just know that most manipulative people dont exactly know they are doing it Im not sure if your character is intentionally manipulative or who they are manipulating but theres a lot of tactics theyll grow accustomed to using. Guilt TripsCant you take a joke?  after a confrontational statement.I thought thats what you wanted? my personal favorite because this mixes with not taking the blameDont you care? Classical guilt trip.LiesUse lies compulsively unless your character is being intentional and smart about it. I personally use it as a way to hide their true intentions and self but also allow them to slip up and lie about random things.Never Taking The BlameYour character will try to actively avoid taking the blame for a mistake and will lie and guilt trip others so they will not have to be put down. This can cause more harm and hurt other people and should. Constant Put DownsEither confrontational or passive aggressive statements who serve no purpose to solving a problem only said to put down another character or to take out their frustration on someone.These are the things I have used when developing my manipulative characters. I would say the most important part of the manipulative character is not who or what they are manipulative to rather how they do it. Dialogue is important but not everything that comes out of their mouth should be drenched with manipulative venom. ,writing,dcymq8t,15,t5_2qh2n

So if your basic premise is to write a nonwhite character just write your story and when your describing them note that their skin is brown. Thats it.If youre writing brooding character based lit fiction  skin colour can influence how that character is perceived and were social creatures so that factor will have an effect.Im a black guy and Im from a country where . are black. I stand out. I get stared at by kids. I get fetishised and approached by people who expect me to act like a stereotype because they have no other reference points than what they see in the media. As a kid I experienced one countrys culture at home and another countrys culture as soon as I left the front door. Did growing up in this environment shape me? Of course it did and if youre writing a serious novel about a character with those experiences and pretending theyre not a factor at all in how they behave your character is going to have an inner life as deep as a bathroom sink and may even come across as you fear and like I see so often tokenistic.Read some books about black characters by black authors where the plot isnt based on the characters race  and youll pick it up.

10595642,0,t1_dd8hak9,gtBut with children all too often the problem is not that they sound like theyre  years old  its that that  year old sounds like they are thirty.Its not just  year olds. Generally all characters in a novel do sound like they were written by the authors age and gender. Like Harry Potter and Ron are super congenial for teenage boys and Hermione sounds like the direct voice of Rowling. If Harry Potter was written by a man Harry and Ron would probably be a whole lot more violent aggressive and direct. You need to empathize entirely with who you are writing and set up rules with how that character acts and speaks. Like an  year old will only say a really simple sentence and also will never say more than one sentence in a row. And that rule is actually less about education but how to compare the  year old to adult characters who have different more relaxed rules.,writing,dd8uxj0,6,t5_2qh2n

10607468,0,t1_dd9z39s,Rather than just saying short sentences  I think its better to say control the tempo of your sentences. Short sentences work well for action scenes but having only short sentences can make your action seem stilted or have it end too soon.In that regard  its better to control the tempo of your prose so that you have longer sentences mixed in with your short sentences in such a way that the action flows smoothly. ExampleHe threw a punch. The bad guy buckled. He kicked him on the ground.  The bad guy coughed up blood. Now  these are short sentences and for the sake of the example  I didnt expend any effort making them good. It feels stilted  doesnt it? However  adjusting the tempo slightly can make the excerpt flow much better. He threw a punch. The bad guy buckled  his arms going limp as he fell to the ground in a ball. He kicked him hard. The bad guy coughed and blood splattered the street. Granted  its a rather shoddy example of what im trying to get across but the point is something to consider. ,writing,dda2up5,11,t5_2qh2n

Ive read several fantasy novels where sex happens and it seemed inline with the world sex was something talked about.

10707220,0,t3_5t4des,Most simply the opening needs to prepare and prime the reader for the book they are about to read. Most books need to teach the reader how to read itnot how to read sentences etcbut the reader needs to know the tone themes and conflicts of the novel. Of course these arent going to necessarily all be explicit. One of my favorite openings in a novel ever is The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler and I think its a fitting example because its a book thats definitely beloved for both its literary merit and its genredefining moves.  Here are the first two paragraphs of the novelgt It was about eleven oclock in the morning mid October with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powderblue suit with dark blue shirt tie and display handkerchief black brogues black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat clean shaved and sober and I didnt care who knew it. I was everything the welldressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars.gt The main hallway of the Sternwood place was two stories high. Over the entrance doors which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants there was a broad stainedglass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didnt have any clothes on but some very long and convenient hair. The knight had pushed the vizor of his helmet back to be sociable and he was fiddling with the knots on the ropes that tied the lady to the tree and not getting anywhere. I stood there and thought that if I lived in the house I would sooner or later have to climb up there and help him. He didnt seem to be really trying.Right out of the gate we get a lot the tone of the novel is set immediately. The suns not shining. Its threatening rain. Not only is this giving image but its also doing plenty of tonal work and the obvious symbolic foreshadowing of anticipating rain. We also get a basic description of our currently unnamed main character. He describes his dress as a point of pride hes got a job for four million dollars so he needs to look the part. Implicit within is the inference that this welldressed put together man is not his standard look. In the second we get the place hes going to the Sternwood place. We know that its big hey he said four million right? but then theres the line about letting in a whole troop of elephants. First page and were already being cleverly told theres more than one elephant in the room. Theres bound to be a lot of complications we dont know abouta lot of things are going and have been left unsaid. Finally we get the novels opening image this stained glass window of a knight not really meaning any business only halfheartedly trying to save a damsel in distress. Any idea what this novels going to be about? Because Im guessing its about a girl thats gone missing and nobodys really doing anything to help her. There are plenty of other excellent examples of novel openings for you to peruseboth literary and genre alike but if its truly an excellent novel opening Im willing to bet the book has wonderful literary merit regardless of typical classification.,writing,ddkdbqp,1,t5_2qh2n

Making the doctors amp staff the evil in the game would probably be the best way to go around it helped by the fact that the ghost people see the most is a nurse iirc.

Plus it is often that I will comeback to an idea and realize that it is in fact shit which I think does more good for a writer than not writing it down.

I typically use a more casual voice when writing my stories which helps me figure out where the commas go more easily and in a casual tone it makes sense to stay away from cent words i have no chance of ever spelling right.The best advice is to not worry about it and just chug through tbh.

10869547,0,t1_de13kjy,To me your point is mostly that you need to recognize what walls youre building when writing. Sure you can write a  POV book but are you ready for the challengeheartbreak etc of selling that book? Because if thats the only rule you broke you might have a moonshot of a chance but that moonshot quickly turns to an icecubes chance in hell when you do something else that is seen as unconventional.There certainly is a middle. I always wonder about the middle  and I talk about it often with a midlister friend of mine with a nice  year long history of trade publishing to pay his mortgage. I cant quite figure out if that happy medium ends up being a happy medium in opportunity as well as achievement. Maybe not but I always wonder if its better to risk big or play safe. I suppose the riskier path has innumerable heartbroken authors scattered along the side of the road that no one talks about. But overall I agree with you. I think if youre an avid reader of current published works youll naturally be shaped by trends and like things that are at least currently a little bit marketable. Or if nothing else youll have the right headspace to extrapolate the market forward and try to predictively write something that you both find exciting as well as that earns you a six figure advance. ,writing,de1477h,3,t5_2qh2n

The idea of the word immortal shifting to emortahl as language changes gives me the impression that your story takes place hundreds or a thousand or two years in the future. If thats what youre intending then it worked.Some people might give you grief over the word saying that its cliche or its been done before. They are correct. The old movie Highlander is the first example that comes to my mind. But to these people I would suggest to you that you smile and politely consider what they have to say but dont cave into their suggestionscomplaints right away. Take the cliche or its been done before feedback with a grain of salt. If that is the ONLY thing these people have to say about your story then Id say your story on the whole is pretty solid or you just have shitty critics who dont know how to focus on more important things about the story.Its just a word. A name. A label given to categorize a certain group of people in a fictional story world. If that is what they are called in your fictional world then that is what they are called.

Off the top of my head what Ive found that helps Strong action verbs. Tech writing taught me this. When the scene calls for it replace your walked sat cried etc. with trotted crouched wailed and so on. A thesaurus helps.  Adding to that dont limit these verbs to your characters. Personification can hit a reader just as hard and intensifies imagery. Ex when calm returned to the table the ache crawled into its box and waited messy script and doodles smirked up at her.

Though it sounds like your protagonist is already living in a prison by the way you describe the Respite Camps.If your goal is to get your protagonist arrested but he isnt a bad dude then its smart to have him go up against the corrupt guards. A good way to build sympathy for him would be to show him getting arrested doing something illegal for the right reasons IE assaulting a guard to save another civilian.Rape can turn a lot of people off from your story. Its a big risk and needs to be handled well to have the effect you want. Even using the word can make you lose readers. Maybe think about having your protagonist be out after curfew one night.

11029192,0,t3_5xbvm1,Ill assume youre looking for a unique profile as you should but for simplicity consider that most serial killers just love killing. They arent angry they just crave the act of sniffing out human lives.Now obviously there have been innumerable studies done on this subject and its never that simple. So you can really dig into that and figure out a killers MO build a full profile etc.But just to get things rolling assume that ALL killers are trying to resolve something. If its an angry lover they may kill their ex because they believe it will ease their own suffering to have that person go away forever.In the case of a serial killer they dont get lasting satisfaction from a single kill. They keep going and until they find the peace of mind they seek they do not stop.To me thats the scariest kind of killer because nobody is safe.

11051891,0,t3_5xtci6,Multiple critiques are preferred for this reason to achieve an averaging effect to minimize tastes impact.  The taste can be as simple as style I dont like first person  third person  lots of dialogue  minimal dialogue  etc... to as overarching as I dont like genre stories  I dont like romance stories  I dont like SF stories that use FTL travel  etc...The best yet most frustrating critiques are from readers.  NOT writers and definitely not writing critics.  Readers are your audience they make up the vast vast vast majority of your potential audience.  Pleasing them is what will make a story rise or fall.  So getting feedback from actual readers is very valuable.  The problem with readers is they rarely have any sort of vocabulary to explain why they do  dont like a story.  So there needs to be a mix.The problem with socalled experienced  knowledgeable readers like critics and good writers is some of them are unable to separate their own writing tastes from critique.  The extremely easy example here are critics who fancy themselves experts in story yet will consistently downcheck stories that dont fill in their own personal preference boxes.  Because this is a critic most of them have the vocabulary to sound learned and right when they savage something because I dont like genre  I dont like st POV  I think there are too many Monster Books lately  etc....Again balance.If I only had to get feedback from one group readers.  Definitely readers.  Theyre who youre writing for.  Theyre who matter.The only absolutely correct answer to all of this is to never neglect learning storycraft never stop studying storycraft.  Study educate yourself grow as a writer.  Learn enough to be able to not only write better and better but also to be in a position to recognize issues on your own.  Further to be capable of interpreting comments  critiques.One of the many reasons being serious about studying storycraft will help any writer is when it comes time to evaluate a story it allows the writer to be best able to harness the strengths and weakness of both general types of critique.Random example My story most of my reader critiques say they like it but feel the endings not great.  When I look at the ending I think maybe it is kind of rushed I fly through the climax and into the epilogue in less than a thousand words.  I thought this might be why most of the readers arent engaging with it as Id like.What this random example would do would be to gather reader comments consider them and then turn to writercritic comments with a targeted question that helps strip away the bullshit taste preferences from the writingcraft sources to get specific answers.  Its the difference between asking writers do you like my story and do you think my third act is paced well.  Broad vs specific.,writing,dekpo3k,3,t5_2qh2n

11074208,0,t1_den7f8m,gt My argument isnt that anyone should have an intentionally lazy or ugly cover its that in the grand scheme of selling a book the cover isnt the selling point. If that were the case publishers wouldnt consistently redesign book covers.gt And I know my opinion is counterintuitive its why people are so touchy about it. But I firmly believe its true.Each example youve used with the exception of that poetry book is old. The first Game of Thrones novel came out over  years ago. Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone came out  years ago. Jurassic Park even earlier. That Google logo is from . Each one of those bookscompanies became hugely successful in a completely different stylistic period. So using examples from the earlytomid s doesnt really make a lot of sense. Its like saying everyone in the s had awful haircuts.

11078171,0,t3_5y6dxw,The easiest way to convey that theres more to him than bigotry is to show us more than just his interactions with the protagonist. Show him risking his life to take down genuine bad guys. Show him being conflicted by bad things he has to do in the line of duty. Show him as a stern man of action being outmaneuvered by slippery political types. Show him as a devoted family man and loving father to his children. Basically show him doing all sorts of stuff that doesnt involve watching over the protagonist like a hawk.Also theres a couple of things you can do about his interactions with the protagonist to make him seem like a bit less of a prick. First up youll want to establish that he follows the rules whatever they are even with her and while he loathes who she is and is always ready to assume shes a suspect in various nefarious goings on he doesnt use his position to harass her beyond whats necessary for his investigations and hes scrupulous about figuring out whether or not shes the right suspect rather than instantly assuming shes guilty of whatever. And second up contrive a few incidents that give him an actual reason to suspect her either through honest misunderstandings or by having other characters playing on his prejudice to sow the seeds of doubt. We know shes innocent and we know hes wrong but now hes got a motive other than blind bigotry so his suspicion of her wont seem uncharacteristically unprofessional.Oh and you can probably also get some mileage out of making him an enemyvictimdupe of the storys real antagonist.,writing,denp8af,8,t5_2qh2n

11118844,0,t3_5yr5ek,I struggle with fatigue as well. Probably not to the degree youre dealing with now but maybe some of my tips can help. I tend to do about  of my writing in my head. I sleep A LOT but I think about what I want to write while Im drifting off or before I get out of bed in the morning. I think about how I want the plot to go or how I want to word a certain idea etc. etc. I keep a notepad by my bed but usually Im too tired to get up and write my ideas down. Ive become pretty good at remembering the gist of what I was thinking at the time if not the specifics. Then one day out of the blue Ill feel really motivated and energized to write. I can write up to  words a day and have a novel done in a few weeks. My friends think Im incredibly prolific but actually I spend a majority of my working time thinking and not getting a single word down.It also helps not to worry about the quality of the work you are doing. If you have the energy to write write. Dont worry if its good or not. What matters is getting it on the page.Sorry if any of that is generic advice or not particularly helpful. ,writing,desb93k,12,t5_2qh2n

This is like saying the best way to write a great murder is to go out and kill someone.  Im all for people making their own decisions and experimenting how they see fit but there are truthfully so many risks and downsides associated with drug use that its not worth getting high for the sake of your story.  I personally have used weed Molly acid shrooms painkillers amphetamines prescribed and coke a few times didnt feel anything... I have had many pleasurable experiences but Ive also had a handful of negative ones.  It is incredibly important that if you do experiment with any drug at all you have a comfortable setting and the right frame of mind.  Even this doesnt guarantee a positive experience especially when your taking drugs that are literally going to alter your mind state anywhere from a minute to the rest of your life.My recommendation would be to look up Erowid on Google.  Its basically a resource of tripexperience logs that people are recording as they experiment with a variety of different drugsdosagescombinations.  Another thing to add to my argument is that your experience could be vastly different from the experience your character needs to have to complete your character.  If you need help and want to know more about what kind of drugs your character should take to incite a certain experience feel free to message me and Ill gladly help you with some info.,writing,deu5fvm,6,t5_2qh2n

Sympathy means the reader feels sorry for them and any number of a thousand cliched plotlines will bring that up but it isnt an emotion that lasts. Empathy on the other hand is the reader understanding where the character is coming from. Its empathy that makes the reader read to the end. Anything that your character does that destroys that understanding that they know why the character does what they do will damage the readers desire to find out what happens next. And empathy comes with practice. Put an interesting character in an interesting world with an interesting problem and youve got a good start.

You cant simply scale up a short story to novel length  its the wrong shape.Novel stories come in several stages  rather than one single plot event you have a string of them one leading to another as the hero gets steadily into deeper and deeper trouble. You also have room to develop stuff  describe your characters and their world for instance. You can explore your hero in greater depth and your villain too. Short stories dont give you much room to do that.,writing,dew39w7,5,t5_2qh2n

11166245,0,t3_5zbhv5,Just a note to OP from a writer whos also an artist painters and musicians talk about creative blocks all the time. It is an actual thing that happens. The problem is that the term gets misused or perhaps its more accurate to say people misdiagnose fearbased hesitation as a creative block.The people in my art classes and music groups who talk about creative blocks are often actually talking about being afraid to get it wrong on the first try without realizing thats what theyre saying. Same with a lot of the writing groups Im involved in. I have myself been guilty of it fairly recently so even being aware doesnt make one totally immune.Tell me how many times youve seen some version of this question I have this great idea for  but nothing I put down feels right. How do I get past this s block?Thats not actually a block a creative block is an inability to generate ideas. If the trouble youre having is getting your ideas down in your medium then the problem youre actually having is a crippling fear of screwing up. This is something thats learned which is good news because it means it can be unlearned. This is why so many selfhelp books preach about how having confidence will get you everywhere in life its not really an abundance of confidence thats needed its a lack of fearing failure.Having a writing routine the write every day maxim goes a long way to defeating this problem because it chips away at this fear of failure by making writing your novel fit into the same category as brushing your teeth. When something is routine it stops being a mountain to climb and becomes a road to walk. It turns publish a novel  which is honestly a very intimidating and highpressure task  into write a paragraph during lunch something very approachable and lowpressure.My biggest breakthrough in my quest to stop having writers block came when I stumbled across a post by Neil Gaiman that took all the pressure off finishing my first draft with one simple phrase Dont try to write a perfect first draft. It cant be done and no one else is ever going to see your first draft so it doesnt matter if its terrible.If no ones ever going to see it but me my first draft can be absolute trash and I dont have to care suddenly all the imagined risk is gone and I can just write crap for an hour every day. I can in fact giggle to myself about how awful it is because screwing up my first draft matters about as much as screwing up brushing my teeth. Sure accidentally putting shampoo on my toothbrush instead of toothpaste is silly and irritating to me but its not going to have a huge impact on my life. Similarly using the word slightly approximately eight billion times in my first draft impacts no one and nothing in the long run. Since I dont have to be afraid of getting it wrong I dont often get writers block anymore and the occasions that I do I can recognize it for what it is and get past it much more easily.,writing,dexokfy,8,t5_2qh2n

11182819,0,t1_deziv9j,Most wanttobe writers as you put it dont finish their novels because they just stop opening their word docs and wait for the motivation that never comes.  Thats pretty common knowledge.  People get work done in vastly different ways because people can be wired VERY differently.  For example I write a minimum of  words a day and before I start that I line edit the  from the previous day.  If I think of a plot hole I go back and correct it.  Little things but I still move forward at the end of every day.  Im capable of that and so are many different people Ive spoken with.  Its as if youre treating this like a race.  For some people a novel can take years to finish and thats fine.  If theyre unpublished or have no agent giving them deadlines they can be as leisurely as they want.  Youre giving off this elitist vibe that your standard work ethic should be what everyone else aspires to.  Sorry but thats kind of bullshit.  Were writers not Olympic athletes.  I guess Im just trying to say simmer down a bit.  If people dont want to finish their novels thats really not your concern.  They shouldnt be degraded and called a wannabe writer.

Maybe do a softedit for grammar and punctuation though often I find these are pretty loose. Plenty of books Ive seen come out of VPs end up with an incredible amount of typos. Maybe do some formattingpage numbers. And then heres the kicker theyd probably convert it to epub or PDF and upload it to a place like Createspace or Lulu or Amazon and have THEM print the book ondemand to send you copies.So you could pay them a thousand or a few thousand dollars to do this or you could pay a graphic design student a hundred or a few hundred to create an indesign file or a PDF file or an ePub file for you with cool cover art and upload it to Createspace or Lulu or Amazon yourself and just order your ten copies. Just remember if you ever plan on submitting this book to agents youll want to make sure it isnt available for public sale. Heck its not even a good idea to print it at all if you have plans to submit ever. But I have at least heard of people who did this and didnt pay for a UPC because you arent tracking sales and didnt make it available publicly who were able to sell it later even if it did result in some awkward conversations with the agent and publisher.If youre just looking to make copies for yourself and never submit or traditionally publish thatd be about the only reason Id ever consider a vanity press. But again its become SO easy these days to do this that if youre not comfortable doing it yourself I bet  writers on this sub would happily do it for  or  or  of what youd pay a vanity press.

11280636,0,t1_df9nfxb,Its not that I necessarily have a problem with being myself but if I really like what a particular author does voice or otherwise would it be detrimental to try to genuinely work more towards sounding more similar to them than I currently do? Not so much imitatingcopying them but trying to have my future default style be more similar to theirs. Or should I keep everything exactly how it is now and any improvement be less directedspecific towards any specific style?This is a Neil Gaiman line because Neil Gaiman that I really like how its writtengtShe says nothing at all but simply stares upward into the dark sky and watches with sad eyes the slow dance of the infinite stars.If I were to write this line without context it would beShe said nothing. She looked up and saw countless stars slowly passing through the night sky. One shot across the darkness as a tear traveled down her cheek.I much prefer Neil Gaimans line to mine but of course my lines are more how I naturally write adapting Neil Gaimans line withstanding. If I were to internationally try to write more like him i.e. make it look more like what he originally wrote it would probably look more likeShe said not a word but looked towards the countless stars slowly passing through the night sky and as a tear traveled down her cheek one shot across the darkness.Assuming my writing improved ideally I would like to have the same effect on me as Neil Gaiman but Im not sure if that is possible with my currentnatural voice. I read that Neil Gaiman antagonizes over sentences because hes trying to create specific effects so if I or even Neil Gaiman dont naturally include these specific effects and it requires conscious effort to create those specific effects should I intentionally avoid Gaimanesque writing for those effects because theyre not entirely my style though I like them?,writing,dfan6gk,1,t5_2qh2n

You do need to put the time in its taken me a month to read a book I could really have read in a weekten days mainly because I cant listen at home but its worthwhile if you find it worthwhile.Just remember the audio stories were written down and professionalgrade writing still has fixed and rigorous conventions for formatting and punctuation which you cant hear.

11393988,0,t1_dfn13kk,Thank you for taking the time to explain yourself.Part  as a whole is rather interesting as it claims a lot of things about science and scientists as a whole in a manner which I have yet to experience.  Not to say that those people do not exist but that I havent experience them.I also find it interesting because in the section on Darwin you seem to be referring to sexual dimporphism but then go on to describe it asgt Thus feminism aimed to topple the idea that women are somehow biologically inferior to men.which is not supported by our knowledge on sexual dimorphism as a phenomenon.  Of course it could very well be that it was a far less stable topic before I came to learn of it and that the feminist view on it was skewed by misrepresentations of it but in the end sexual dimporphism is effectively that males in females in some species are different.In humans this is very clearly seen by things like genitals breasts facial features the way we store bodyfat the way our bodies distribute heat and bloodflow and even mass and location of muscle.  It can also be seen in differences in behavior that stem from brain structure and chemical balancemen tend to get angry more often due to testosterone while women are more prone to crying as certain hormones related to the female reproductive system also cause excess tear production so the emotional threshold for crying is lower than in men.The other thing thats commonly misunderstood is that sexual dimorphism doesnt address individuals very well but only averages and trends.  There are certainly women who are stronger than me but also others that are less emotional than I am and I would consider myself slightly above average and average in those regards respectively.Im only explaining this in such detail as it seems to be relevant to the point on gender.  Gender is in essence the role a person plays in a society and throughout human culture genders have had many reoccurring themes that tie back to the behavioral differences between men and women.This is where gender dysphoria comes in when ones sex doesnt match the behavioral imperatives that the person feels.  From my knowledge this is more common in men MtF since the embryo always begins as a female thus its more probable for it to not fully transition the brain and possibly other features to a maletype brain than it would be to change nothing else but the brain.This is of course just the cold science of it all as I know it to be.As for part  most of it was me inquiring about things and you answering my questions about things.  I see where youre coming from and respect that your views are at least internally consistent which is much more than I can say for some people on this most glorious of internets.gt It carries high failure rates with any number of complications of any number of degrees of horror. Do you know what a fistula is? I dont want cis authors writing capriciously about surgeries without a full appreciation for the terrors of surgery.I am uncomfortably aware of the realities of the surgery.  There was an imgur gallery of the process on reddit some time ago but I had to stop.  I am a man and I am very comfortably cis so some of those pictures of what happens to those organs just... they ran against my aforementioned behavioral imperatives.gt Now I dont mean to pick on you  no one but you will read this anyway  but even you slipped up... the character just acts like a normal man or woman. Its too easy for anyone to get it wrong for me to feel comfortable leaving my communitys representation in the hands of a cis person Assuming you are cis! How bad of me.You said yourself in the same post that a transwoman could never fully feel like a cis woman.  She would always be trans which is significantly uncommon and thus not normal.  This only bears a negative connotation if you perceive all abnormal things as inherently bad.gt What I want is for cis authors to wait to write about trans characters. I do not believe society is at the point yet where they are likely to get it right. Why not let some trans authors establish what a trans character looks like first? Or why not find a trans alphareader like I suggested?Because no one trans person is the gatekeeper.  There is no objective perspective on what it is to be a transperson and everyones experience would be different.I have more thoughts on all of this but I am beginning to cut into my writing time so I will see what you have to say in response to this for now.,writing,dfnhqq6,1,t5_2qh2n

11418497,0,t3_62czz9,Hey everyoneThank you for providing your insight it has been very helpful to me.As the plot is mostly interchangeable and independent to the settings over the last two days I chose to write and draw some very rough scenes and storyboards of what the graphic novel could ultimately end up looking like for both settings as suggested by user thetortfeasor. I have ultimately chosen to go with Paris during the German Occupation for two main reasons.I feel that from an art aesthetic Paris during the German Occupation is already more suitable to my art style. The setting will also provide me with a lot of opportunity to have the story take place in a grander setting with locations such as Notre Dame Eiffel Tower etc. all existing in the background to my story which wouldnt be possible in a fictional town in the American West. The Paris setting also means I can present those Western tropes that are embedded in my story structure in a fresh and exciting way rather than risking them become cliches.More importantly from a narrative perspective I have found a way to interlink the thematic progression that my protagonist goes through over the course of the story with that of the Parisian setting and the challenge occupation brings to the inhabitants. My aim is to develop this stronger connection between the character and the setting in the aim of essentially turning the city itself into a pivotal character which I hope if done successfully will bring more heart to the narrative itself and help the reader be invested as a result.,writing,dfq9wp8,1,t5_2qh2n

What you say about their products is true but at the end of the day its just stock advice  and its been proven time and time again that on the whole no stock advice is ever significantly better than pure chance. I suppose there are some really great writers there that are entertaining to read Bill Bonner the owner has a particularly fluid style but I think it speaks volumes about the quality of their products that they spend x more time and money on marketing than they do on their actual product.

Either those small presses start to contract andor go bankrupt or we writers start subsidizing other writers with our submission fees and not just by buying books at a much larger scale.

Thats a joke right. Its been laid out why this is such a bad practice.

They essentially start finishing each others sentences and character chunks last about a paragraph each. Also Im starting every chapter with a mystery character whos revealed later that helps make sense of the end game.Basically the first novel was all about experimenting and I may have over reached slightly.

Theres one theme to explore or one comment you want to make about contemporary politics or one twist that its building up to or one character that you really want the reader to get to know or whatever. This is a story thats all about X and you dont have room to go into detail about Y and Z let alone start going off on a tangent by introducing A B and C. Also screenplays put you in a pretty good starting position. Film storylines are rarely as short and simple as short stories but they tend to be a lot shorter and simpler than full length novels. I mean just using two stories by the same author Phillip K. Dick that had film adaptations as an example the short story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale was a short story that was adapted into Total Recall by doing a straight retelling and then padding it out with about an hour of action setpieces while Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? is a novel that was adapted into Blade Runner by deleting a main character and dropping several major themes and subplots entirely because there just wouldnt have been room for them.,writing,dg3wi2n,1,t5_2qh2n

11543399,0,t1_dg4ejce,Prior to the copywork exercises I was really insecure on how I would construct my sentences. Another insecurity was how my paragraphs were structured. I felt like mine were too long or too short compared to the professionals out there.So I came across copywork and read more stuff about it. Ive been doing it for quite sometime and it does help you recognize an authors style and quirks. It also helped me with my insecurities on how I write my sentences and also how I craft my paragraphs. Thats one thing I learned with copywork was thisparagraphs are devices not rules. Its a device to control pacing and also dramatic emphasis.For sentences I began recognizing if Im dallying on action and need to soften the pace. When doing copywork I meditate on how each sentences serve the scene how the verbs control the pace why a specific punctuation was used why do complex sentences rather than two simple sentences etc. The more I meditate on those the more I work out my story sense.Last thing as to why I love copywork note taking. I love my books but I cannot write on them. Nonfiction I write on the pages all the time fiction never. So to get around that I do copywork. When reading a book if a scene or chapter fascinates me Ill make note of it and do copywork as soon as Im finished reading the book. I like to read for pleasure first then read for analysis later.Right now I hop around Brandon Sanderson Kurt Vonnegut Stephen King and Vladimir Nabokov.

Theres actually a lot of character going on too its just condensed to make room for the action because the way action happens visually it needs to be broken up into lots of panels.Prose seems less action oriented because the literature most people read isnt heavily action. Also brevity rules the game because quite frankly action is boring if you describe it in detail.If you look at the actual timeframe of most stories like how much real world time each scene would probably take they probably come out about the same.I should know. Ive done both prose and comic scripting and the outlines are almost identical in the grand scheme its only in the frame by frame pacing that things seem to differ.

11603413,0,t3_65j1n0,Youre asking about realism here. It isnt realistic for a society to see its own culture as evil. Spreading wickedness and deceit is not a realistic goal for any society. Instead a lawful evil society is one where they have justifications for their ideology that they use to excuse their evil. They act as authoritarians and tyrants but do so nominally because they think it is for the greater good. They have an ideological blindspot such that they cannot see the true depth of the harm that their actions cause or that they believe the harm is justified indeed may call it the administration of justice.The defining characteristic of a lawful evil society is that they have laws that harm certain people. Only certain people though. They target an outgroup that they consider to be a threat especially if that group is not authentically a threat. Lawful evil societies persecute minorities see other societies as lesser or even a kind of evil threat. Viewing foreigners as necessarily dangerous enemies is a lawful evil attitude. Having a one true God religion and viewing other religions as blasphemy and evil is a lawful evil attitude. Lawful evil societies embrace ideologies and policies that create justification for very real harm caused to innocent people. They dont view this harm as being senseless or unwarranted. Their system of law religion and cultural norms justify it to them but seem monstrous and evil to an outside observer. What you are proposing a society that embraces harm for harms sake is not lawful evil. Thats basically psychopathy and is more consistent with Chaotic Evil. Thats not an attitude that can support entire societies. ,writing,dgb98jk,2,t5_2qh2n

The second book which for what its worth is often considered the weakest in the trilogy deals with a lot of political intrigue and governmental finagling.  It basically asks what good is your freedom and selfgovernment if someone is about to kill all of you?  And you get the POV of the executive of said government learn about how to be a better ruler etc.  There is literally a character that says youre terrible at being a ruler and heres why.The third book is a bit less politicking and a whole lot more action.  Its my favorite of the three  Without getting in too deep into the details of the plot it deals a little bit with the idea of saving people at the point of a sword doing things that harm them in the short term for the benefit of the world. And now for a disclaimer.  The focus of all three books isnt just the topics I mentioned above its still about plucky young heroes struggling to save the world.

11687764,0,t3_66rg4i,Characters not characters.  One is plural the other is possessive.Im going to assume youre young since its more likely the older someone is that theyve experienced grief.You need to do what you do with everything that goes into writing a character.  Place yourself in their shoes.  Put yourself where they are.  Try to feel what theyre feeling.  Strong emotion is no different than positioning yourself mentally and intellectually to write them as if they were a famous rock star a respected scientist a grizzled combatant or a perfectly ordinary housewife.You have to sink into the characters because those characters are who youre writing.  Theyre them youre you.  Write them not you.As for how to try to figure out grief ... honestly I seriously doubt you havent experienced grief.  Perhaps you havent experienced death of someone you were emotionally close to but even then its unlikely you havent experienced crushing defeat wrenching disappointment and abject loss.Young people feel everything magnified.  Its part of being young.  Because of a lack of or a limited experience with life mileage everything that happens tends to be A Big Deal.  Teenagers can say My life is over dont you understand over over over OVER completely done and honestly mean it when talking about something like having had a romantic friend break up with them having missed out on winning an award or something else.  Something that when happening to someone with more life mileage is understood to just be an event and not an overwhelming event.So tap into that magnification.  Imagine your parents have died how would you feel?  Because thats how the characters feel.If you want the shortcut or perhaps the study version of how to go about it looking to movies and actors might help.  The whole job of an actor is to portray emotion.  Not to be famous and look good but to tap into these emotions and project them for the rest of us to feed from.Look for sad films or films that deal with strong emotion.  I can name examples but all art is personal to the audience member.  What really moves me might not move you.  So if you dont like the examples I name then go looking for others.  The internet is full of lists of every imaginable type when it comes to movies.  Just start with a Google search for sad films replacing sad with whatever search term you want to try and narrow in on.  Like if sads not enough for you then try films about death or films about loss or films about dealing with X.Elizabethtown is entirely about a man whose life is over who finds a way through a woman who decides she loves him to begin rebuilding his life.  He is fresh out of college and has just been the sole and primary reason his company lost a billion dollars.  Billion with a B.  He goes home to kill himself and is moments from doing it when his sister calls makes him listen when he tries to hang up so he can commit suicide and she tells him their dad just died.  He has to go to meet his fathers side of the family thousands of miles from where he lives and along the way not only starts dealing with his loss and the loss of his father but in how to move on without giving up.  Pretty ontopic for your question.Inside Out is about soul crushing pain of a twelveyearold girl.  The key sad scene is at the end.  And the whole film deals with how to process emotion how all aspects of emotion from the highs to the lows the good to the bad the happy to the sad work together to make a person emotionally healthy.  A fantastic film and ontopic for your question.Titanic ends quite sad.  I know few people who dont break down in tears at the end of it.  The reason theyre crying and you might cry if you sit down and study it looking for why it can hit the emotional chords is ontopic for your question.  Why is it sad that Jack dies even though Rose just met him?  Why is it sad that she takes his name when they ask for hers to put on the list of survivors?  Why is it heartbreakingly sad to see the pictures on old Roses dresser at the very end that show how she kept her promise to Jack and did all the things he told her she could?You either wait for these life experiences to happen which is a little morbid and could take a while or you act like a serious writer and figure out how to emulate them before you have firsthand experience.  Which is one of the key things writing is all about.  Put yourself in the characters shoes and write them.  Theyre them youre you.  Write them.,writing,dgktqhy,3,t5_2qh2n

11702142,0,t3_66w5w5,Im . Im writing my first novel that is actually publishable. I had a few attempts that never came together. Everyones different. I studied in math and have been programming for  years and I plan on pursuing a career in research rather than writing. In that sense Im far from a writing machine. I read a lot and I write a lot and those have always been true but it took me a loooong time I mean Im close to middle age before I could come up with a story that I was fairly sure other people would want to read. On the other hand I can throw down  words in a hour day. I know many successful writers whod envy that somewhat silly number. Its not sustainable and theyll need revision but not more than any other writing. My first drafts are better than what most corporate executives turn in to their agents. My second drafts would be publishable in business nonfiction. I spent a lot of time as a highart or concept Internet troll. Fiction takes much more work I am learning this and its humbling and the k days although they were fun arent that relevant because revisionediting is where the real work begins. Realistically getting this to the point where Im ready to seal it is going to take the same  months that it takes everything else. Which brings me to the question what do you want? The parable of the tortoise and the hare applies. You shouldnt feel bad if you cant throw down  words per day. You dont have to. If you can write a solid  words per day thats going to get you to a first draft in  weeks. Compared to the amount of time it takes to revise edit and publish a novel thats a rounding error. Its much better to write something great and take a long time than put out something mediocre quickly. gt But Im always getting new ideas or plots and I can never settle on what I actually want to do.Pick one. Execute it well. Ideas been done before? Everythings been done before. For bonus points take two ideas and combine them. See where it goes. If you get bored or your writing is hackneyed include another one. Now you have three. Let your characters do what they want to do rather than what you want to do. Youll get something more interesting than if you hand of God the plot in a predetermined direction. Several times Ive killed plots because the characters just werent motivated... or because I realized that theyd actually make a worse story... or just because theyd underuse key characters. Literature may be repeating the same thousand ideas over and over but if we view a novel as a combination of five themes this is highly simplistic there arent  discrete themes and novels dont necessarily combine  but you should get the point then we have    combinations. So there are new things in the world with just a little bit of work. Combinatorics yo. Dont worry about originality or critical reception yet. I take it that youre young. Pick something and execute it well. I dont know that you want to be a writing machine. It isnt mechanical. Its a skill that requires finesse and decades of hard work. If I really wanted to I could write a novel k words in three days. It would be terrible and I wouldnt be able to get it published although I know people who would be the publishing house would edit and with celebrity cases often the author doesnt do the legwork. Thats not something to aim for.Write. When you dont have the energy to write read. When you dont have the energy to read work out or go outside. When you dont have the energy to do any of those go to bed. ,writing,dgmgg2z,1,t5_2qh2n

11712017,0,t3_6743n5,If you have a lot of characters and youre concerned a reader wouldnt understand them all and needs a biography of each consider amalgamating them down to a sensible number difficulty introducing them or worrying we wont get who they all are without an appendix is probably an indication that youve overextended beyond what a reader could cope with. Honestly having thirteen characters probably means youre struggling later on to find a role for all of them and may be duplicating some roles. Alternatively your book is huge and unfocused GRRM was an experienced writer and got to publish ASOIAF but even hes having trouble wrapping it all up.

Stay vague about where exactly it is just place it in southern Illinois look up pictures of the terrain and the roads and fields to get an idea of what your community could look like. I think you can still pull off your idea this place can still be isolated without being ten of miles of away from the nearest neighbor or anything. Its not odd for people even where I lived to have their house be down a deadend dirt road and then down a half mile driveway with their house in the middle of the woods.

11716426,0,t3_67669h,News to me. I think that negativity spreads on the Internet. Im guilty of this sometimes. Good news is boring bad news is exciting. So conflicts with editors and publishers get a lot of play. People dont produce reams of Internet paper when theyre happy with all counterparties. Many editors are writers and many writers are editors. Theres nothing saying that a person cant learn both skill sets. Also editor is an overloaded term. Theres a person who performs editing e.g. developmental edit line edit copy edit and then theres a person who makes editorial selections at a publishing house or a magazine. Those are two entirely different jobs. As a writer I wouldnt like it if someone said that I had to delete a character because we dont want more than k words just because we dont or if I was forced to make a change for a reason that wasnt welljustified. I believe strongly in a certain artistic vision and thats why Im doing this hard thing and would terminate a relationship with a publisher who wanted to trample it. That doesnt mean that I hate the copy editor whos tasked with fixing typos though. That person is saving me from embarrassment although my typo count is very low zero is best. ,writing,dgo33ua,6,t5_2qh2n

Decided to switch over to my laptop so I could lie down in bed while I finished writing the damn thing. Soon as I opened the file it looked like I had lost a third of a page. Went back to my desktop to compare. All the words were there. Exact same word count in both versions of the document but one was exactly  pages and the other was  pages plus a third of another page.I finally realized it was some sort of problem with the margins. Even though the margins were set the same they had to be it was the same file! in both for reasons I cant understand on my laptop there were more words being squeezed into each line.

The main point of this section seems to be introducing the land of Eden and the idea that a crime occurred so stick to that.As for Eden itself this is just a short intro but the concept could still be more fleshedout. The world feels a little flimsy everythings perfect in generic nonspecific terms and the citizens dont know or care how anything works. The idea that people lack curiosity about their world to the extent that they dont even have a vague idea of whos in charge? Thats unlikely and awfully convenient  feels like it could be an excuse for sketchy worldbuilding.If youre telling the story of the first crime ever from the perspective of a citizen of Eden I dont think a word like terrorist would be part of their vocabulary. Never thought Id side with a terrorist  why would you think about terrorists at all if you live in a world where violence is unthinkable? Im also wondering how the attacker knew how to create bombs or how he accessed the materials  but that could be explained later.And about the terrorist again no one knows is a sketchy explanation. Humans always have ways of explaining senseless violence if we dont know the attackers motives we speculate that they were mentally ill or that they were influenced by radical religious beliefs or we call them a monster etc. If people know about this crime then surely the government has an official explanation.As for the twist nothing leaps out at me aside from the obvious one that the utopian community will have a sinister side.,writing,dgxxi39,1,t5_2qh2n
