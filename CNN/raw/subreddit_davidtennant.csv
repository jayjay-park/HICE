The Quatermass Experiment    I thought of this one this morning and thought Id add it to the list since it is free to watch but then I noticed its free time expires in  days.  I think Ill post it separately because of that too.  It also needs a little extra background info.  This was shown as a program live on TV!  They rehearsed it as well as the camera placement all the shots and were given a specific amount of time to complete it  hours.  They were a bit quicker on the actual night and it came in about  minutes less than  hours.
