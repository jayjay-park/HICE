1148664,0,t1_chxd4zk,gt We will fill up all three continents during primetime and players can expect to be waiting in VR trainingNot really.  I dont remember the numbers off hand but Connery at peakpeak highest pop seen in a given recent week fills up one continent  fills a second and the third is maybe  filled?  Peakpeak Uberson would be less than double Connerys peakpeak pop based on the current numbers for Mattherson and Waterson.  So we would have  full continents and a  filled continent at the absolute most packed times.  This would be bad but add in Hossin and it makes a lot more sense to merge the two. Either we have two packed continents and two middling continents with Uberson or we stick to single servers and have a single packedishmaybe continent and three ghost towns. ,WatersonPS2,chyu5z8,1,t5_2w612

1264739,0,t1_cibqts8,No you wont.  DA is for recruits or friends of the outfit that we dont consider DA proper people.  Its an important distinction because if you see a DA person theyre either taking a squad spot from DA or have found their way into a different outfits squad.  Trust me if we were given the slots youd have to deal with three plus squads of full DA members.  We currently have  DA that are signed up  DA recruits and others like myself that arent attending because we were given  squad and Im not going to take time off work to make it to something where we have  times the numbers needed currently signed up.,WatersonPS2,cibwdlu,5,t5_2w612
