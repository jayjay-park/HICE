1656864,0,t1_cjo08cb,right and it has a really narrow entrance way I heard about. Okay So North entrance I guess that one takes a bit longer to get to from the main city too so less people go for it.,Gamescom,cjo0ejl,1,t5_2s2o3

8633673,0,t3_4y0rkt,Hey thereyou cant travel through the whole of NordrheinWestfalen. You got the up to date map since  August. You can see Kleve as one of the northern regions of the VRR. You can take a train all the way down to Cologne to the Gamescom. However your ticket only includes train rides with Bus Tram SBahn UBahn metro and RERB RegionalzugRegionalbahn. You can not take a fast train like an ICEIC.You can for example take the RE from Kleve Station to Dsseldorf Main Station and then the RE to Kln Messe Deutz so you just have to walk a bit to the fair grounds.Or you take the RE from Kleve Station to Meerbusch Osterath and then the RE  to Kln Messe Deutz.Those would be the fastest connections. Hope I could help you.Cheers from Dsseldorf!I wasnt able to answer via PM because I get Error  all the time,Gamescom,d6ktecz,1,t5_2s2o3
