8733941,0,t1_d6wmknt,now i am convinced you are stupid thanks for that and dont comment my post anymore thank you. . I never said anything about an ingame mirror or chrome paint or the gta  world beeing completly mirrored or something.I talk about real life mirrors that you have to hold on the gta  real life map. the physical one you get with every game or just mirror the map in the menue. . The community told me that my first findigns are based on TEXTURE MIRRORING that has nothing to do with the gta  world beeing completely mirrored through a chrome car.texture mirroring are textures on an object that you notice by looking in the middle of the object and there you will notice that they used half of a texture doubledmirrored to create the full texture of said object. NO INGAME MIRRORS just a technique programmers use.. you are stupid and not able to read there is nothing really no word on the mirrors ingame so i dont even know how you got this idea.. Thats why i dont want people like you even read my stuff cause you just dont understand it so pls go on and read something else maybe a lexicon or something that helps you understand written texts.,NMSPortals,d6xe0he,-4,t5_3fzm2

8795942,0,t3_50loi9,My theori is that the portals we see that no one managed to start is the exit of portals!Just an other theori but if you manage to reach the center without any interraction sith the atlas hou get out of the simulation and in to the real world and the portals in thus world takes you back to the simulation.

8798903,0,t1_d75hgjg,Yes and as an additionnal FYI this is the . version which was released on day  game release.So at least my understanding is that we should all be playing under this version from start aka no need to restart a new game.

8799190,0,t1_d75in35,Well I quote the patch note  For . of people all you have to do is install the update before you begin to play.  this is the part I find confusing.Did the game come with . preinstalled as one might expect in which case you wouldnt have to install anything since its already in it. Or did the game come in some older version with... a separated file you had to download and install? I didnt do that... Pretty sure  of the players didnt do that either.This is what I was calling classic Sean style aka wtf does it really even? mean.But yeah agreed on the rest not following the Atlas or playing around it in a different way anyway is definivetly worth investigating especially regarding portal activation.

9197740,0,t3_55vhnc,I dont think so.  I went through a number of black holes that were right at the edge of the center.  Some of them had already been discovered.  They just jump you to another system at the Galactic Center edge.  The best part about the galactic center is the sense of multiplayer.  I finished exploring a planet that was only half discovered.  It was like working together to finish the discoveries.  I saw many travelers along the way but it was pretty cool to see them at the center when I got there.  Knowing they had been there just a few days before me felt like we were traveling together towards the center.,NMSPortals,d8hvq56,2,t5_3fzm2

10334841,0,t3_5nzet0,So Based on infomation gleaned from Nevadander and the portal promo video...if I had to hazard a guess. The Portals are only availible to activate in Reality and the switch in front of the portal isnt availible in Simulation.Fitting in with the lore Vykeen at least those who never gave up the battle against the Sentinals probably went into hiding and went to somewhere the sentinals cannot reach via Portals. This would also make sense that the simulation can simulate the portal objects but give it no functionality as they dont know its purpose.Furthermore that would probably tie into the ruins plaques and monoliths in reality are probably something else and Atlas replaced them in the simulation to fake a story of Atlas omipotence and dominance.This then ties into the portal switch text of races asking what has happened to the Sentinals.So if you want to activate portals you may need to break out the simulation find a portal then jump through it. Then after that youll probably find a more proper ending ending of sorts...or be on the correct path of defeating the Atlas.,NMSPortals,dcfifz6,3,t5_3fzm2
