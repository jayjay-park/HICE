3056506,0,t3_2v5mxu,Because nobody assesses them for what they are but rather for what they want them to be.To copypaste from one of my previous responses on the topicgtWell Id disagree with you. What the USN needs is not more VLS launchers for situations thatll rarely occur and for which it is already amply satisfied with the fleet of CGs DDGs and SSGNs but something that fits both a peacetime mission and fills the huge mine countermeasures MCM gaps in wartime. The USNs strategic vision calls on forward presence to enforce maritime security in key areas of the globe  thats piratechasing counterterrorism countersmuggling providing HADR and other soft security stuff. This is what the USN does most of the time and pursuing these missions is done with the aim of preventing war. Having a ship like the LCS with its excellent for its size aviation and cargo capacity is perfect for this kind of stuff. Meanwhile those same aviation and cargo spaces make it eminently suitable for current and future mine hunting methods which require helicopters and unmanned waterborne vehicles. Remember mines have been responsible for nearly  of all USN ship casualties since the Korean War not fancy cruise missiles and other such threats that require an AEGIS suite and dozens of VLS cells.gtWhat good would an uparmed LCS be? Why does the USN need a frigate which will cost nearly rds to ers much as a DDG with less than half the capability? In what political and strategic situation would you need frigate level firepower but not a DDGs?gtIf the USN was a smaller navy like the European countries or Canada then yes I agree a frigate would be an appropriate use of limited financial resources to maximize capability while fulfilling a minimum number of deployable hulls. But it isnt! It still has the DDG battlefleet for when shit hits the fan so warfighting capability is there in spades. What it needs instead is something that will have the numbers needed to maintain forward presence around the globe during times of interstate peace while filling the MCM role for which theyll be the only surface asset in wartime.Source wrote my Masters thesis and made a conference poster on it.,Warships,coesz5n,12,t5_2z66v
3410672,0,t3_2za45s,I like the idea for the RN. Higher numbers of a relatively simple to build ships would keep the maritime construction industry going steadily instead of leaping from major project to wasteland and back again. Would also be more attractive to sell abroad and cover more of the costs. Seems like it would be good for maritime security antipiracydrugssmuggling where using one of the destroyers or frigates is a waste of capability especially as theyll be part of the new carrier groups soon. I think the general concept of more numbers with mission modules is probably good for the RN but the MoD as a whole seems to overstate the capabilities of unmanned systems quite a lot. Hopefully they will be capable at their core and not just sitting in the docks waiting for the right UAVs to mature.It is like the LCS but if they keep the design and construction costs down and stick to the brief I dont see why it wouldnt work.,Warships,cph1iiz,2,t5_2z66v

9133122,0,t1_d899j17,Yeah Ive been following Hasky for a while though I have seen hardly anything concrete.  What is most surprising for me is that they claim the SSN will only displace  tons which is tiny by Russian standards.  Because they traditionally build doublehull submarines their SSNs displacements are quite large Pr.  Akula is about  tons.  While the article says while automation technology will come from the Alfas the Soviet incorporated extensive automation onto the Sierra and Akula class in the mids so its nothing new.I think its unlikely that they will use a liquid metal reactor given the cost.  Their PWRs are already pretty compact.The part about composite materials is the most interesting part to me.  I saw a photo about a year ago of a  scale rudder of the Severodvinsk class made of composite.  Freeing up weight allows for more flexibility in design like making the pressure hull thicker.  While there is no doubt a benefit to composites as anechoic parts Im unconvinced that composites will make submarines much quieter except for composite prop shafts and propulsors.  I think by now were close to the limit of acoustic silencing.,Warships,d89otg9,5,t5_2z66v

9327203,0,t3_586omg,Right so Ill try to throw some insights here.Firstly Zumwalt is not meant for a surfacetosurface naval engagment. That was never her primary purpose. You can see this in her design  never were Harpoon missile canisters ever proposed to be fitted on her decks. There is an expectation however that her new largediameter VLS tubes will accommodate yettobefielded future missiles including the longawaited LRASM Longrange antiship missile Harpoons successor. So while they expect her to eventually have an antiship capability it was not a priority and so in assessing the Zumwalts combat role it should not be the main concern.Rather Zumwalt was designed in the aftermath of the Iowa class battleships retirement. With the latter gone the US Marines were left without what some of them considered to be sufficient naval gunfire support for amphibious operations. Thus when they began thinking about the followup to the Burkes and Ticos thenDDDDX was to incorporate a robust shore bombardment capability. This lasted through to today in the form of the two mm AGS which are fitted with longrange GPSguided not mind you radar or infraredoptical making them inadequate for targeting moving objects shells. Great for landattack and stationary targets less so for moving targets unless theres significant investment in both the shells and a offboard sensor to spot the target.But no proper Burke replacement would be complete without an equal if not better antiair suite. And so they tried to develop the SPY and SPY radars. These were to be shared with the Ford class carriers. In the end development of the radar systems was so protracted and expensive that only the SPY an Xband radar better suited for detailed horizon search rather than the SPYs Sband volume search made it onto the Zumwalt. Now the SPY is pretty good and can probably do most of what the Burkes and Ticos SPYs volume searchtrack could do but its nowhere as good as the SPY wouldve been for that purpose. SPY has been installed on the Ford along with the  and as of right now it appears shell be the only ship in the fleet to have both  her future sisters are going to also experience costreduction measures and receive a relatively downgraded radar suite. What this all means is that Zumwalt has a fantastic horizonsearch and missileguidance radar that suffice for her selfdefence but lacks the capability to deal with mass airspace surveillance and tracking that the Burkes and Ticos do provide for larger task groups.Zumwalt also has a pretty darn capable sonar suite to deal with underwater threats but thats received less attention in most coverage. This was so she could safely operate in shallow waters near the shore where she would have to be in order to use her guns to their full advantage. As with the radars her sonars are new though it seems theyve experienced fewer problems  at least not to the extent that theyve had to be cancelled.But anyway to answer your question directly Zumwalts built to pound dirt. Pound dirt stealthily with . shells and Tomahawks with a high degree of selfdefence but pound dirt nonetheless. This may be pounding dirt to hit operationally and strategically vital targets or just to support the land forces as they advance inland. One might argue that all of this tech was inserted not only to push the boundaries of the possible and give the USN an incredible superiority in all domains versus an adversary lacking blue water capabilities but to also replace the Iowa classs armour  what Zumwalt relatively lacks in structural resilience is partially madeup for by the investments in her defence capabilities. But as with many vessels she and her sisters may end up living lives they werent originally designed for. With the expected addition of the railguns and LRASM she may turn out to be a formidable antisurface warfare combatant as well. Alternatively they may well be relegated to what many critics view them as  mere technology demonstrators with few opportunities for deployments and employment in hotzones.,Warships,d8yai5o,7,t5_2z66v
