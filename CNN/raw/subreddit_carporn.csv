1271,0,t1_ceekiri,My friend just bought an RX after hearing me talk about my RX so I have this word of caution pretty well rehearsed it will be long since I love this stuff and will try to ELI it but Ill include a brief TLDR at the end.So a rotary engine functions like thisAs you can see its kind of like a triangle bouncing around inside of an oval.  The problem with this design is the Apex seal.  The tip of each point of the triangle rotor has a seal called an Apex seal.  It has the exact same function as a Piston Ring.A piston ring is used to tighten the tolerance between your piston and your cylinder so the explosive force is focused on moving the piston and doesnt let energy escape past.The piston ring is the black lines before the top of the piston on this normal cycle engine There are usually  per pistonIn a normal  cycle engine like in  of cars oil can get up under and onto the backside of your piston rings.  This keeps your oil and your combustion completely separate from each other.  The piston rings are the separators between the systems.Now go back and take a look at the Rotary engine again.  See how theres no real Backside of the Apex Seal?  Because behind each Apex Seal is another combustion chamber AND theres only room for  Apex seal.  This removes some necessary redundancy from the piston rings in a cycle engine.Lubricating your piston ringsapex seals are of utmost importance.  Your cars lifespan will go from  miles to  miles if you dont lubricate your seals.So now how do you lubricate an Apex seal? Theres a channel that runs from the output shaft  the rotor  the apex seal where small amounts of oil are deposited to keep it lubricated.What happens to the oil after it lubricates the Apex Seal?  Burns off.Isnt that horrible for the environment? Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuup.  But theres more emissions equipment on an RX car than most others.  My Miata has  catalytic converter.  My RX had  iirc... been awhile.The next big problem was the Apex Seal wear...The problemdifference between the RX and  motors is as you can see in the animation of an RX motor the RXs Apex Seals are dragged across the intake and exhaust ports.  Essentially grinding them down a smidge every rotation.The RX moved the ports onto the wall of the chamber.  No more grindy.  Apex seals on the RX lasted to  miles before you had to replace them.  Ive seen an RX with  on original seals.Keep in mind though this is essentially replacing your engines internals every  miles on an RX.Quite frankly I think there are vast improvements that could be made to make a rotary engine more efficientpowerfulless of a tree killer but theres no funding for it.  The change from the motor in the RX to the RX cant be understated.  The RX motor is the one in the Rotary engine demonstration video i linked.TLDR Because of how its designed it HAS to burn oil to function properly and it kills its apex seals piston rings at a faster rate than a normal car grinds its piston rings in a normal engine.,carporn,ceel036,13,t5_2rlke

136338,0,t1_cetpu2f,I understand that though. Though it would be nice to be able to get that much more horsepower off the shelf but that car is designed to be somewhat unstable. If you threw more power into it youd probably have to change the suspension and tires quite a lot to keep it from spinning out constantly.

This car is nothing but swooshes and its hard to unsee. I love that its body is so low.  Everything these days from Aventador to Mustangs and Camaros all have this VERY VERY TALL bodies.  I dont get the design.  Is it a requirement for safety reasons?  I liked it on the Chrysler c as it was kind of a gangster car where you slink down into the seat and just peak over the steering weel or the window.Its nice to see a low height body on this taken seriously.  They even tapered the back end shapes to be as low as seemingly? possible.  Nice change of pace. For some reason the spoiler shape bugs me.  I understand that it takes the form of the body but it just looks wrong somewhow.  I cant put my hands on it.It is definately going in the right direction and closer to the F.

4141226,0,t1_crs1wcx,Since friction is a function of normal force f  N increasing the contact area decreases the force per area pressure at the contact patch and thus can actually decrease traction. Like someone else said at this width its just aesthetics.  Edit wow yall dont like that. I have a BSME but Im not claiming to be a tire expert so heres some sources.  My explanation is extremely simplified and determining a tires traction isnt a onestep physics problem. That said heres some experts that agree  PhysLink  Whoever wrote this textbook as well.  Actually if you Google this you can see that its pretty widely discussed.  The takeaway is that wider tires  more grip.  Its important to note that the main benefit to wider tires is that you can use a softer more grippy compound and that that does increase traction.,carporn,crsbfti,-32,t5_2rlke

But its still a pain in the ass and isnt quite the same.  She did let me keep it for a week and that was nice.  But now if i want to drive it i have to go drop off my car and pick it up.  Then i lose access to my daily driver.  Just not convenient.  I admittedly bought the car for her and it was her car so it was only fair that she gets it in divorce.  I built the  first and she was afraid to drive it but wanted one of her own.  So I found the  for her.  My dream car since getting in this hobby was a chopped Model A Coupe on deuce rails.  So I sold my  to acquire one.  As it stands now they are both worth about the same...in fact the  is probably worth a bit more even though I have more money into the  so far.

We have a  Mercedes its leagues ahead of everything American that Ive touched from that period. I should say I mean that even when in perfect condition most older American cars are scary to drive in my opinion.

5260546,0,t1_cvjcqk7,Youre half right the aventador is actually constructed to easily split into two separate parts to ease shipping. It allows it to be stacked vertically to reduce overall stress on the unibody.It looks wrecked because the design is made to have a  surface interface. Think of a piece of x if you cut it in half it has in of contact. If you cut it at a  angle it has sin.in a  improvement. The splintering uses this logic to get  contact surface of a normal cut to ensure a strong bond area to eliminate seams.On top of that cutting it with a splinter deaign allows you to avoid a singular planar weakness. If you just stuck to flat surfaces then they will be weaker along that surface like grains of wood. Its the same logic behind how bricks are laid. They orient the bricks like this so that the single plane of contact is horizontal. Making the vertical structure more rigid since any vertical stress has to go through brick not just contact surface.Source Master of Engineering and a chronic liar,carporn,cvk3d01,6,t5_2rlke

Last I heard they keep bullshitting customers on there actually being a problem at all when it obvious there is a severe issue. GM really shit the bed with the new Z. Hell one gm statement more or less said that their  speed flappy paddle wasnt designed or intended to track and that is the reason for overheating.  Then manuals started to overheat and they blamed it on a loose boost sensor electrical connector. Then it was speculated that they started detuning press test cars on power to save on heat while owners started having them dealer serviced for overheating in F Weather.  I might almost rather have a car that caught fire.  At least insurance would cover it and I could take the payout and buy something else.

6357842,0,t1_czcaquy,Yeah I get the insurance part of it but its still such bullshit when you consider the admitably hard to analyze and put risk numbers to fact that owners of high quality older cars tend to be safer drivers and more more affectionate to their automobiles.  A driver of a  Hundai is much more likely to abuse their vehicle and drive recklessly than a driver of a showcar quality  classic automobile.  Its kindda silly how they ignore so many major factors in the analysis of risk in the name of saving costs on properly skilled analysts.  This is why I want to start my own insurance company.  The current big players in this market simply dont incorporate the inferred knowledge of a vehicle owners affection towards their vehicle when judging risk to that vehicle and its occupants.  ,carporn,czcbeei,1,t5_2rlke

I had written this off before the drive as just something retirees would like to try to rekindle their youth but I was wrong. I loved almost everything including the small touches like the vents that rise and lower into the dash. The paddle shifters were great and let me rev it near redline without any intervention. Downshifts were pretty quick with blips. And the sound! I did not expect that sound. Its a very small car for you big and tall guys. Im  and my head was over the roofline. Seats were tight.

It was put there to get it into clean air. The fact that the trunk also happened to open at the height is happenstance. And if you want to argue with that go ahead. Youre not arguing with me.

10197188,0,t1_dbzfi37,The three hp each electric motors dont work as the gearbox they just solve the same problem that a transmission is normally depended upon to solve which is that ICEs have power curves and a minimum idle speed below which they cant drop.  Considering the car runs on pure electric from a standstill and the ICE doesnt even engage the wheels until it is already moving at over mph Id say that by most standards the car absolutely qualifies as a gaselectric hybrid.

10632470,0,t1_ddcn0cb,So looking at the firing order and diluting the V down to  banks of is brings you to the below.  If the cyl.  is greater than  subtract  and assign it a more commonly seen number in regards to firing orders.Saving a lot of extra typing take a look here or just read below.  Basically the v firing order is equivalent to that of the i which is regarded for its superior smoothness and even consistent torque delivery.    Sixcylinder Arrangement        A. Inline        A six cylinder inline engine has a power    impulse every  degrees i.e.  degrees of    crankshaft rotation. The crankshaft has six    crankthrows placed at  degrees out of    phase with one another which can be arranged    only in three planes. Therefore the crankpin    phasing is arranged in pairs Fig. .. For    heavyduty diesel engines seven journals and    bearings are provided at each end and be    tween adjacent crankpins. For petrol engines    only  or  main journals are provided. The    firing order with the crankshaft arrangement    shown in Fig. . is considered.    With piston  at the top of the compression    stroke its opposite piston  is at the top of its    exhaust stroke. Rotation of crankshaft through  degrees brings pistons  and  to their TDC    and either one of these can be arrangement to complete a compression stroke. If piston  is    arranged to be at the end of compression and at the start of its power stroke then piston  must    be on its exhaust stroke. Rotation of crankshaft through second  degrees positions pistons     Inline sixcylinder arrangement    Fig. .. Inline sixcylinder arrangement.    Inline fivecylinder arrangement.    fig. .. Inline fivecylinder arrangement.    and  at the TDC so either one of these can be on the compression stroke. If piston  is made    to be on compression piston  must be on its exhaust stroke.    A third rotation of  degrees brings pistons  and  back again to TDC where piston  is    arranged to be on the compression and piston  therefore be on its exhaust stroke. A fourth     degrees rotation brings pistons  and  to their TDC. Piston  is now on its compression    and piston  on its exhaust stroke. Rotation of crankshaft through fifth  degrees brings piston     and  to TDC. Piston  is on compression and piston  on its exhaust stroke. Final rotation of     degrees completes the  degrees displacement of crankshaft and brings the pistons into    positions for the next cycle. This cycle provides a firing order of      .    If the phasing of paired crankthrows  and  and  and  are interchanged then a second    equally suitable firingorder of       is achieved. This arrangement provides excellent    dynamic balance and evenness of torque and is preferred for engines larger than . liters    provided length is not a prime consideration.,carporn,ddcnpvg,5,t5_2rlke
