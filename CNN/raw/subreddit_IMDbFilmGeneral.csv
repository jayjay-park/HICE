There is a bit of a decrease in quality but because the show is the way it is there is so much that can be explained through different theories which can save some of the more terriblemoments.

I read a comment online that said it felt like Wes Anderson and David Lynch collaborated to make The Lobster. I havent seen enough of Lynchs stuff but I guess its probably the weirdness of The Lobster that made this person think of Lynch. I also was reminded of Kubrick mostly because of some of the shots and the score I think. I didnt laugh much either but I think that could change with a second viewing.

10952855,0,t1_de8wxnc,Yes orsom. Its good to be back.World War Z the novel by Max Brooks Mels son is a total blast even though it is illogical. Contrary to what George Romero and his followers would like us to believe it is impossible for slow zombies to trigger an apocalypse. Reality would be something like the climax of Shaun of the DeadWorld War Z the film changed from slow to fast and thus made the prospect of apocalypse more tangible. But the handling is a total trainwreck. Brad Pitts family has got to be one of the most mundane families out there. Why should the viewer care for them? Everywhere Pitt goes a controlled situation goes titsup. Hes like a zombie madness magnet. Plus it all ends so horribly I wanted to throw my shit at the screen. That would be an upgrade actually come to think of it. I will concede that the moment with the soldiers hand was unexpected and hence shocking in a good way.The Bank Job was a decent picture. Something different for Statham. Number of notable Brit actors visible including David Suchet and Keeley Hawes.I love Scarlet Street a heartbreaking tale of lust and betrayal.

11068164,0,t3_5xzwvx,I like their code of conduct a lot. One interesting thing with regards to cinemas in Argentina is that Ive been noticing that there are far less people eating tacos than there once were and even popcorn all in replacement of chipas. Not sure how wellknown these are outside South America so Ill explain essentially they are baked cheeseflavoured rolls made with manioc starch hence giving them a gummier less crusty texture and are served in soft paper bags. They are a silent dry snack that have little chance of producing crumbs and thus make them the quintessential snack for cinemas as chances are that even the one sitting next to you will only perceive the soft ruffle of the paper bag and even that will be pretty immediately silenced by the sound from the film. Im unsure if this is due to a growing awareness of correct behaviour in cinema the cultural shift towards healthier foods and diets or just that chipas are much tastier than either popcorn or nachos really they are but all the same I think it presents a great improvement in the context of cinema to whats preceeded it.Of course theatres ought to ban foods not least because they can affect the climate in an audience and that can reflect itself on a live performance whereas a film does not really interact with the audience in a same way.,IMDbFilmGeneral,demkdrr,2,t5_3iwyp

11138547,0,t1_deuifii,gt Just out of curiosity were you the kind of kid who picked apart cartoons because they didnt depict reality? Do you do it as an adult when watching Bond or Indiana Jones films?Since you ask yes as a child no as an adult.One thing Im capable of doing here is imaginatively projecting myself into the situation you have laid out. You have stipulated that in each case there is no chance of my getting caught and I understand that. However being able unlike you it seems to imaginatively project myself into the scenario I realise that the protagonist in each case is not privy to all the information that you the person writing the example is privy to.In my reply I made a distinction between two types of questions you might be asking Is it morally right to take the wallet and would you in fact take the wallet. I took you to be asking the latter question but perhaps I was wrong. If you were asking the former question it makes perfect sense to assume a godlike perspective. If youre asking the latter question it does not. If I were in either of these two situations I would not have a godlike perspective.Incidentally my reasons for not taking the money in either case are not primarily based on whether or not I might be caught. I recognise that taking the money in either case would be morally wrong and that would be my primary motivation. However I would also have niggling worries about getting caught were I to do the wrong thing  however much you tell me I wouldnt  and this I am sure is reinforcing my determination to do the right thing. And perhaps its the deciding factor. Perhaps my determination to do the right thing is shakier than I think it is.gtYour example isnt quite the same because in a situation like that unless one has absolute assurance its not venomous they likely wont touch the snake unless they saw it bite someone with no ill effects.The case I offered is indeed analogous with yours. Remember  and you can go back and check what I wrote if you like  I explicitly said that this apparent snake expert is right and that the snake really isnt venomous. The reason you rightly ignored this information in predicting how you would in fact behave is that even if the snake were in fact harmless the hypothetical you in the example doesnt know this for sure.When it comes to stealing someone elses wallet even if you write the example so that you in fact have no chance of getting caught the hypothetical you in the example doesnt know this for sure.,IMDbFilmGeneral,deujk8c,1,t5_3iwyp

11424252,0,t1_dfqvz3z,Maybe I started off wrong by not showing examples of whats wrong with Arrival.  Okay they have a scene of Amy Adams explaining linguistics .  We didnt need that scene the audience can go home and figure that out for themselves or know that already.  The secondary act exposition where Jeremy Renner is narrating was completely pointless and anyone couldve figured that out or know that already.  Its also a lazy way of rushing time in the story.  We didnt need a time lapse and a bunch of information thrown at us while also ruining the tone of the film.  There was no need to put English subtitles at the end.  At that point I felt very insulted.  I couldve went back and taken all the alien symbols and form the words at the end into what they were saying.  Arrival inaccurately portrays what linguistics are and makes linguistic as simple as sit seems.  They baby fed us so much information that we couldve found out by ourselves through critical thinking.,IMDbFilmGeneral,dfqxee6,1,t5_3iwyp

11511385,0,t1_dg0nf0k,Oh I know he doesnt write his scripts Ive actually argued with some people on the AVClub because they call him out for being a storyteller he is just not in the actual writing sense but more like the visual sense. His scripts arent so much complicated but to your average person his film can get bogged down and wind up confusing even though theyre often constructed around simple stories. As for that screenplay part your average mainstream film tends to jump into the action these days and since Scott is a mainstream director a lot of his films follow more of a gradual buildup compared to a lot of the junk that gets released these days if that makes any sense. ,IMDbFilmGeneral,dg0tfit,2,t5_3iwyp

11541294,0,t1_dg464wx,Indeed Josie is not returning Piper Laurie is not returning Jack Nance RIP.  From what I recall from season  Pete was in the bank with Audrey when the bomb went off probably how the character died Josie is...stuck in the drawer knob...Im not sure if well ever get closure on her character but Im sure that despite her pained screams that saw her character off her soul will find redemption within the wood...or something..ill have to think that through some more..I cant recall Dick Tremayne being corrupt he always seemed like more of a pretentious ponce to me.  As for Leo just being a scumbag or something like Bob being at work in him as Ive mentioned before I dont see the black lodge as some separate place to me the black lodge is the psyche and the doppelgangers are the the mirror images the body images the soulless ego images of the characters which can be fully inhabited by BOB if one fails to see past them.  The black lodge itself is a realm of tricks the blackandwhite zigzagged floor the red curtain a sort of illusion of danger beyond which I believe lies the white lodge formless temple of light and pure energy.  The black lodge is sort of like a material shadow of this the manifestation of it within the mind in which demons like Bob and Mike feed upon the soul.  It is not really real although it is it is illusory.  In the finale Cooper becomes possessed because he believes in this place he falls for the trickery and runs from the demonic characters allowing him to become possessed when the place itself has no real power except to imprison one within ones own fear.  There are some things I love about the black lodge depiction in the final episode.  The full cup of coffee with fails to pour maybe showing how material things by themselves are illusory or the ego is illusory and cannot pour its coffee or that the black lodge exists outside time and the passage of time is illusory im not sure but it seems the whole thing itself is an illusion.  So characters who are very violent angry materialistic controlling like Leo yes are to different degrees possessed by Bob.  Same with Ben Horne and also desperate characters who seem to exhibit fear who live in fear like Jacques Renault at least thats what I get from that character.  Agreed about Jerry Horne hes a great character but hes always depicted as the witless Horne brother.  ,IMDbFilmGeneral,dg47h7f,2,t5_3iwyp

Densely filled with real jokes instead of Family Guy style references even the ones mumbled over establishing shots of the floor in the wee background are great.  Eightysix Bahrain.

Oh es tut mir Leid mein deutsch ist wirklich schlimm ich bin von der Sentinel...  or something...  Hilarious little touch as Henrys finding Bladdens office.  and my favorite  See this kind of stuff is just shameless. Nepal Premier Wont Resign. Theyre just trying to sell newspapers. Thats sensationalism and I wont be a part of it!  Fun cameos from Jason Alexander and Catherine OHara.  That The Paper might exist in the same universe as Home Alone is amusing.  ,IMDbFilmGeneral,dghq5je,1,t5_3iwyp
