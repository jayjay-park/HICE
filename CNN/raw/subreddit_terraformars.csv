2310957,0,t3_2lqa5f,Both. But i would start by reading the manga because some basic information you need to know about the beginning of all things are only in the Manga or in the first OVA. However in the end it doesnt really matter that much if you readwatch both anime and manga.Why both? Reading  chapters each  pages and at the same time watching  episodes isnt really hard. The battle scenes are really great to watch in motion and the censorship is getting really low. I would recommend watching the first  episodes in the uncensored version if you can find them.,terraformars,clxcm3o,2,t5_2ywam

7530067,0,t1_d2xx4po,Yeah you would think at the beginning of a time skip they would do a bit better of a job explaining whats going on especially a manga like this where there is a huge amount of external narration,terraformars,d2y4rd9,2,t5_2ywam
7684887,0,t1_d3fpm5n,Awesome thanks so much for clearing this up! SomAdolf killed the leader when the bomb went off right? Since his lightning didnt kill that leader given that another roach resuscitated it.Yeah Ive noticed that too about season . Episode  was an abomination but its getting better with each episode. I actually love season  and thought it was incredibly well done. For a show like this you cant get rid of the violence because its central to the show. It also seems like a LOT of conversations are being left out not incredibly important to the plot but it helps connect the dots of details so having that left out just makes me sit back and think am I understanding this right?Thanks a lot!,terraformars,d3fq30g,1,t5_2ywam
