The LXX Septuagint ancient Greek Translation of the Bible of ch.  differs markedly from the M.T. Masoretic Text  the Hebrew Bible . I t seems probable that he LXX represents on the whole the earlier text Hyatt  pp. V   . In the beginning of the kingship of YeHOYaQiM son of Josiah king of Judah there was this word to YeRMYaH Jeremiah with Deuteronomic spelling to say    gtThis verse is not in the LXX The events of chs.  took place in the fourth year of Zedekiah  cf.    which was  B.C. The verse was erroneously copied by a Hebrew scribe from  Hyatt  p. V       . Thus said YHVH to me  Make yourself halters and yokes and place them upon your neck.  . and send them to king of Edom and to king of Moab and to king of the Sons of aMON and to king of TsoR Tyre and to king of TsiYDON Sidon by messengers coming to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.  . And command them unto their lords saying  Thus said YHVH Armies Gods of Israel  Thus say to your lords  . I made the land   and the man and the beast which is upon the face of the land   by my great strength and by my outstretched arm  And I gave her to whomever was right in my eyes.  . And now I give all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar  king of Babel my slave and also the animals of the field I give to him to slave for him.  . And all the nations will slave for him and for his son and the son of his son  until the time of his land also comes  and they will slave for many nations and great kings.  gtAnd all nations shall serve him Nebuchadnezzar and his son Evilmerodach and his sons son Belshazzar All which was literally fulfilled. Adam Clarke  p. IV   gtThis verse is missing in the LXX it may have been omitted by the LXX because it was not literally fulfilled.

7614202,0,t1_d37n0q4,Satan is Hebrew for adversary but appears in Job for instance to be used as we would use the word prosecutor or inquisitor his target is man and evil in man at that not God.  Even the temptation of Jesus could be fit into that frame.  The dualism of Revelation is more Zoroastrian than Israelite in origin and the idea of God having a pretender to the throne in Satan is late and reflects Greek theology too gods warring among themselves.  In general God is transcendent.  It may be that only because Jesus is God that Satan who tempted the man may be portrayed as attacking God.  I dont see much continuity in the portrayals of Satan even in Daniel Satan is doing Gods bidding.,biblestudy,d37p173,1,t5_2rfdk
