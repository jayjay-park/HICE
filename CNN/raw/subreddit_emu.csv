1303249,0,t1_cig85l5,Well there was the guy who went into that womans apartment raped her choked her to death midrape then during the investigation the university decided to cover it up leading to a gigantic controversy. There was also that one guy who I dunno if he ever got caught that raped a woman at knifepoint in one of the parking lots.Also I fucking hate the basketball team for relatively petty reasons so using them as an example has NOT endeared you to me.I went to EMU. I saw EMU. It wasnt great. It was a school but I wish Id just gone to Washtenaw in the first place because the experience is essentially identical.,emu,cig8cye,-6,t5_2s7jp

If you dont have an application filled out he most likely wont want to talk to you yet. Take the application. Fill it out. Come back and hand it to him personally.,emu,crecjfg,1,t5_2s7jp

I got a full tuition scholarship and will be going there next year. This stuff is scaring me.,emu,d2mv9jz,2,t5_2s7jp
