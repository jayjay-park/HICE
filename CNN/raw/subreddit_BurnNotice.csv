6720989,0,t3_47o8j9,In my opinion Burn Notice had the best finale that Ive ever seen. Ive binged over  shows in the last year and nothing compares. They tied everything together  and we find out that Michaels reason for narrating the show was because he was telling Charlie about his spy life. That one detail for me was just amazthing. The whole way through watching the show Id wonder who Michael was talking to. Are you as proud of the main characters as I was? I think Maddie deserved a medal!,BurnNotice,d0eib2o,14,t5_2rusp
