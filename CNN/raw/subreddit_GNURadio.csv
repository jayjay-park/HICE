1440682,0,t3_2ahq3g,I should have been more specific also Im very new to this so if something doesnt make sense its probably because I most likely have misconceptions that I havent worked out yetWhat I would like to do is just measure RMS power centered on a single frequency e.g. Mhz with a specified bandwidth say Hz but I need to experiment to work out the right BW.I want to do this on a RPi so hopefully I can do it without FFT calculations. I also have a list of about  frequencies that I want to do this for in quick succession so I dont want to turn the dongle Rt on and off each time if possible.,GNURadio,ciwv6ru,1,t5_2s6qt

4994236,0,t3_3jaif5,The radio will be streaming with UDP so you likely dont want to just connect it to your network and open up a port in you router although that is an option. If you are looking at small bandwidths you may be okay with that setup but for larger bandwidths you will lose lots of packets. The better option would be to connect a computer directly to the radio and then connect that computer to your network. Then as somebody else suggested  use the TCP blocks in gnu radio. You will have to make sure that whatever port you choose is open on your router. Again keep the bandwidth small and it would probably be best to stream shorts instead of floats. ,GNURadio,cunzpb7,1,t5_2s6qt
