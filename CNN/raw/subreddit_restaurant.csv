But I wouldnt have been able to get the job at this high paying place without the expertise the lower paying stuff yielded me.,restaurant,cvdy1j8,1,t5_2r2g5

9880443,0,t3_5gs1qn,Apologies if this is at all condescending or unclear or anything just trying to be helpful.  Learn how to build a menu calculate the costs of your different food items price your foods in such a way that you can pay your employees and make money etc.  Its one thing to be able to run a restaurant but to actually build a functional restaurant that turns a profit is much more difficult.  Maybe you could see if you could take some classes in this because its somewhat complex or at least I find it complex but I might be an idiot.  Like your local community college might have classes in building a business running a restaurant etc.And if you figure out your namebrand identity early consider reserving those spots on the internet website address social media pages early in the process before other people do.Good luck!,restaurant,davg11j,2,t5_2r2g5

10703526,0,t1_ddivmxl,There is a place I go to here in Chicago called Publican Quality Meats PQM. I like it because the food is high quality and delicious. The space itself is fantastic. Its small long tables so youre rubbing shoulder with the person trying to eat their sandwich next to you awesome tile work and giant food cases that line the one wall of the dining area floor to ceiling windows on the other. Its also the scene. The man you are not comfortably rubbing elbows with eating next to you could be a young man in an expensive suit consultingclosing business and on the other side an artist with their beautiful partner.Which leads into the next important aspect IMO for any restaurant or experience PQM is great because its usually always busy. A business takes on a different personality when it is busy and handling customers. Employees are more excited and committed the vibe is up and its an electric atmosphere. My next thought goes along with food but more having to do with the offering available. Rather than having a ton of options and changes and what not its straight forward  sandwiches a soup a salad and thats it. Everything on the menu is unique and different. They also offer a great selection of beers and canned drinks.Lastly its a great butcher shop with great and unique quality cuts of meat and sausages...it is expensive but they make up for it with their fresh breads granola beefchickenturkeyvenison jerky spices sauces HUGE cheese section butters eggs and milk varieties.Chicagoan Disclaimer This all however is to say that we are searching not for the best butcher in Chicago but rather the best HIGH END trendy butcherdeli in Chicago. ,restaurant,ddjzmaa,1,t5_2r2g5
