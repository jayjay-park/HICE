2818420,0,t3_2sde1z,Looks like custom Weak Auras.Showing an icon for bone shield with stacks is pretty straight forward.  The Soul Reaper one is a little trickier but I think its just an icon plus a progress bar.,wowaddons,cnog4c9,2,t5_2rm5f

7532821,0,t1_d2yf49a,As long as the unit remains your target or your focus it shouldnt be hard to do with some imaginative macro and addon management e.g. macro to apply dot weak aura andor omniCC to track cooldown inverse to show when debuff NOT on target and maybe Bartender to place an invisible ability button directly over the weak aura to give it a click function.  The same can be done for your focus.  What you cant do though is apply DOTs to  mobs and simply click a button to reapply it on any one or all of them  it has to be your target or your focus.  What I do is use the nameplates and my eyes to track debuffs along with mouseover macros i.e. any nameplates with absent debuffs mean I just hover over it and click to reapply the DOT however this still relies on keybinds.,wowaddons,d2yg0o5,1,t5_2rm5f

9839892,0,t1_daq39uw,Yeah I want to get rid of the bars its kind of unflattering to my UI. Im just looking for something that gives me straight Text tracking Artifact Power or AP XY  X being Current Y being AP required to advance to next level.,wowaddons,daq5t83,1,t5_2rm5f

10861044,0,t1_de089zx,The actual code works it leaves and stays depending on how many players are in the party. It will also whisper players from my realm correctly. The issue is just with line . Im like  certain of that.,wowaddons,de08nhe,1,t5_2rm5f
