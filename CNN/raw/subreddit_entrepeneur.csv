4810672,0,t3_3g7bza,Depends on the business.I have found for retail shops portland is a great area to have paper hand outs you put in the bag after a sale. Been very effective for businesses I have worked with. BB its still grandpa middle america enough that mailers are really good. Check out like  and see if they have a list you can work with and send out a blast of mailers. Again I only really have success with that if I do it at least  times to the same people and only to bb.,entrepeneur,cu0xb7l,2,t5_2tl2i

6692010,0,t1_d0b6f3s,Thanks for the information. Ill have to read up on Shopify make sure I understand the ins and outs compare and contrast that with running her own site. That kind of stuff. I get what you mean about packaging and inventory I guess its all just a big unknown  her products typically sell well at events and the like but this is taking it to a whole new level. Good tips on pricing  she spends a lot of time making her stuff and I guess I dont have a super solid idea as to what is average for that niche. Thankfully we have access to high resolution cameras and sone people with fantastic photo editing skills so Im not too concerned on that front as I know its vital. Id considered going to Pinterest Instagram etc.  although I havent the foggiest idea how Id pick hashtags. ,entrepeneur,d0bigih,1,t5_2tl2i

Popeyes is also the same and arent open to new franchises. I am now trying Churchs Chicken.I talked with a Franchise Consultant from franchisehelp.com yesterday so well see how that goes but the above franchises did not pass their vetting they wont tell me why so Im iffy on what franchises theyll be offering me..,entrepeneur,d1614pb,1,t5_2tl2i

10061948,0,t3_5jla1d,Dang that sounds rough man. You would do better asking at rentrepreneur. This subreddit is actually the typo entrepeneur.By exit strategy do you mean his exit? Usually when talking about an exit strategy it refers to the businesss or whoever is asking for advices exit strategy. Just wanted to clarify since it sounds like you might be thinking ahead and wanting a business exit strategy. If youre wondering on how to proceed with him leaving then youll have to buy him out at an agreed upon fair market value. Other than that and some other administrativetax stuff thats about it with his end. If you can no longer operate then you may have to dissolve youre company and sell off your assets. What is he doing specifically that you cant hire someone elseothers for? If youre in that tight of a situation you can try looking for another partner with a similar skill set.,entrepeneur,dbj3gv4,2,t5_2tl2i
