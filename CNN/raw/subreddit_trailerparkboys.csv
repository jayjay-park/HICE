Damned if you do damned if you dont. There was lots of great subtle humor in this season especially the Trevor reference. Im not mad it wasnt gutwrenchingly funny like some of the older seasons. Also Im pretty sure people who marathoned this right after it came out were watching by themselves and laughter is socially facilitated youll laugh a lot more watching it with a group.

7134673,0,t1_d1of0ai,. The first season was all improv  no scripts just outlines. It slowly got scripted to the point there there are a few adlibbed lines mostly by Rob John and Jonathon. . The music in the original run was  of the tone. Where are my greasy beats and people breakdancing in the background. . Talking Heads.  They barely happen anymore. . The characters have become caricatures of themselves. Ricky used to be believably stupid now its slapstick comedy. Bubbles was calm and thoughtful he quoted Plato in the first season. Julian was only ever a dick to save the park now hes a dick because he doesnt get what he wants. . There used to be subtle jokes that wouldnt get overused to shit. They blurred a cat face in one episode. They had the rock pile walk up all talking on cell phones and hanging up at the same time. Lucy hitting on cops while stoned in the background. Now they shove your face in every joke and rub your nose in it.,trailerparkboys,d1p4tlj,20,t5_2rbaa
