I thought about using the Walmart lot but that Walmarts super busy and it was like last resort. I was also thinking the Autozone lot but I think thats on a hill as well.,boone,d6qw1hl,1,t5_2r5xo

See if you can find your way to campus because the library has an odd jobs board where you can tear off the numbers and get work. Also if you can befriend a current student there is an odd jobs student board that they can subscribe to with their appstate.edu email.,boone,deyk0cz,1,t5_2r5xo
