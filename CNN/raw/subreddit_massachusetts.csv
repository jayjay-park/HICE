Research from the United States Department of Agriculture found that . of American households were food insecure during  with . suffering from very low food security. Journalists and charity workers have reported further increased demand for emergency food aid during  and .gtThe United States produces far more food than it needs for domestic consumption  hunger within the U.S. is caused by some Americans having insufficient money to buy food for themselves or their families. Hunger is addressed by a mix of public and private food aid provision. Both types of aid have been expanding in the st century with hunger relief efforts by the government growing faster than aid provided by civil society.gtHistorically the U.S. has been a world leader in reducing hunger. While precise comparative figures are not available studies suggest that in the th century there was far less hunger in the United States than in the rest of the world. In the th and early th century western Europe began to catch up. After the outbreak of World War I however the U.S. was able to send tens of millions of tons of food to relieve severe hunger in Europe. This act was unprecedented in the worlds history and was the first of many substantial actions by the United States to relieve international hunger and povertygtgtImage from article iInteresting United States Department of Agriculture | Hunger | Food bank | Pesticide Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcijj oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecijj.

He finished his time for whatever he did and begged to be allowed to stay... and they couldnt really help him.

Even if what you say is completely true it speaks to gross negligence that lead to  deaths and as a manager he is responsible.  He and other managers had direct control over the staffing levels.  If it was understaffed it was his fault.  This also is not to say that you personally dont share blame in the deaths because by your own admission you do.  You will probably never face a criminal court  but it should haunt you knowing that you are partially responsible for the deaths of  people.,massachusetts,cka0zcd,1,t5_2qkbu

1919417,0,t3_2gm7ul,Salem is a cool town but neither Salem nor Methuen are near the city. If you want the big Boston city experience then those options are out. If youre looking for a city but dont care if it is the biggest city then Lowell and Worcester are also options.  Lowell has a commuter rail line to Boston so you can commute for work or for fun to Boston but it takes a good  minutes each way. There is a lot going on in Lowell already though. Its a booming university city so there are a lot of jobs in the area. It is also very close to NH and all the tax free shopping in Nashua. The best night life is in Boston but you will also pay the highest rent for the smallest space.  Another good question is do you have a car?  You dont want to have to deal with parking in Boston.

2138655,0,t1_claa0r0,Springfield resident and civil engineer here. Its not a good idea. Will it bring money? Yeah. Nearly enough to fix the problems it will cause or the other problems with springfield? No. The casino will be adjacent to I. I cannot currently support its traffic load and is past its design life. It needs to be rebuilt and this will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The amount of traffic on this strip cannot feasibly be managed. The entirety of I and the surrounding roadways which are terrible if youve ever driven through springfield will need to be rebuilt in the next  years. This is probably the biggest reason as to why the casino as it stands will not work in springfield. No engineer Ive met thinks the infrastructure can support not in the sense of collapse but manage this kind of project. Fox woods and mohegan sun are in the middle of nowhere. Comparative to springfield at least. Traffic management? build another highway exit. Crime and prostitution? Inexistent. Springfield has a lot of bad social problems. If you havent seen the  minutes segment dedicated to the heroin problems in Springfield google it. Where are drugspoverty the worst in Springfield? In the North and South ends. Where the casino will be. Downtown as is has enough problems with murders and other crime just from the bars alone Someone was just shot outside of Fat cats pretty recently. Mohegan sun and Foxwoods are resort style casinos. People go to vacation. This will not be the case for Springfield. People in Springfield voted for the idea because most citizens are pretty much willing to vote for anything that promises change. Springfield has been consistently going on a downhill trend and the idea of new jobs and income to many seems like a light at the end of the tunnel. I worked very briefly with the mayor of Holyoke Alex Morse when he was in the middle of his anticasino campaign. Casinos historically do not work well with inner cities and mostly for the reasons cited.That being said I dont know why nonresidents really care so much about increased crime seeing as how they wont be seeing any of it.,massachusetts,clbo53m,4,t5_2qkbu

This might not be the best system but it is the system we have and the idea is that if you drive people around for a living there has to be some way of verifying you and your vehicle and in this city set the fares. The problem with Uber is that they are going around the system and so it is not a level playing field. It is not the law of supply and demand if half the supply has to follow regulations and the other doesnt. Cab drivers are people too and it costs them a lot of money to follow the rules.

7466965,0,t1_d2obdbu,I second that opinion. The Pioneer Valley is very progressive for the most part. If you stay near AmherstNorthampton there will be plenty of economic and educational opportunities. The only problems are cost of living is a bit inflated because of the schools and youll be competing with college kids for lowend retailservice jobs but employers might appreciate someone with an open schedule and no intention of leaving the area after a few years.Heres a route map for the PVTA that will help you evaluate which towns will give you the best travel options. Amherst and Northampton are the most expensive. Springfield and Holyoke can be dangerous so if youre considering them just be careful about the neighborhood you choose.Apart from the valley Boston is livable at minimum wage if and only if you can get roommates. The Worcester area is more affordable but you have limited transportation options. The Valley definitely has the best amenities relative to cost of living out of anywhere in the state.Ive lived and worked all over the Valley so if you want more information Im more than happy to help.,massachusetts,d2qy4or,1,t5_2qkbu

9137454,0,t3_55frqc,Ive been to many places for my alcoholism but Im not sure they would be classified as rehab centers. Honestly for someone whos been involved in this stuff for a while Im not superinformed on all the different options out there.I detoxed at places like Emerson Hospital the best Spectrum Adcare Gosnold Whidden and CAB. These were all short term detox centers where you would stay for around  days. Gosnold was pretty shady  instead of helping you find aftercare bed at a tss tc halfway house etc. they really pushed everyone to go to their aftercare treatment house which was absurdly expensive. Every other detox I went to would look for beds anywhere.Ive also been to Naukeag as another poster mentioned. That was a little longer  I think I was there for  weeks or so. Very nice place.The only thing that worked for me was going to a halfway house following detox. Depending on the person and the progression of the substance abuse a few weeks usually just isnt enough time to offset or overcome the patterns that form after living an alcoholic lifestyle for long periods of time. The house I went to would let you stay for  months and Ive been sober for going on  years at this point.,massachusetts,d8a8lvk,12,t5_2qkbu

There are also very important uses for things like farrowing crates.
