3110968,0,t1_cokfe4u,any idea where to look or what to look for? I bought the adaptor a long time ago when I had this laptop that I could only run ubuntu on so at the time I thought it was an issue with linux this is in about  or so so I sort of forgot about it until recently when someone wanted to hear me play but had no way of getting to where my upright piano is so I was trying to figure out how to record it for him and I have no good quality recording gear so I thought of my keyboard and the adaptor again.,lmms,cokg8in,1,t5_2sv3k
4458943,0,t3_3bxpsm,Coming from someone who really values theming I felt that the first and last tracks were a little off. Intro sounded... swave and Thanks For Coming sounded a little too happy relative to the other tracks. To me it felt like you threw those songs in there because you wanted to provide more tracks.The  songs in the middle invoked feelings similar to the melancholic kind you get when sleep deprived and a blue morning arises. At least thats how I interpreted it. And thats no insult I genuinely enjoyed that! It was kind of like a gradual increase in goodness Take The Drugs Away being my favorite.This music might fit perfectly as bgm in very particular situations.Thanks for the download these songs were pretty nice.,lmms,cssqbfz,1,t5_2sv3k

8209201,0,t1_d53ids9,Oh I already have a fairly decent knowledge of how to use LMMS its just that my attention and motivation deficits hinder my ability to do much with that given knowledge. Something about the program as a whole that just horribly discourages me from sticking with it.Thanks for the tips though. I appreciate the help.,lmms,d53pe3y,1,t5_2sv3k
8303649,0,t1_d5f7of3,Just seen this windowless theme and its really awesome! I also think that would be great for an android port! The original UI could be used on  and more tablets with a mouse and keyboardunless it would be unusable.,lmms,d5fihtv,2,t5_2sv3k
