164286,0,t3_1vypll,I like the song.  The sound quality is poor but Im thinking that this must be a recording off of something else since the official release date of the single is  weeks off.  ,symphonicmetal,cex57so,7,t5_2sf4u
263890,0,t3_1x3gd6,I wish Tuomas endeavoured something more orchestral but I would say now isnt the time for a larger scale project like that with Floor joining Nightwish and everything. Im excited to see how the rest of the album will turn out. This is definitely on the pop side of symphonic metal and it does have its charm but I hope Tuomas has more in store for us in the rest of the album,symphonicmetal,cf8414r,3,t5_2sf4u
548183,0,t3_20dqxx,This is awesome if the rest of the album is this good itll probably be my album of the year.,symphonicmetal,cg2l28z,5,t5_2sf4u
602664,0,t3_210knf,I ended up ordering this one. Expensive but theyre my favorite band and I reaaalllly like that flag it comes with. Plus with  shirts the Earbook edition album lanyard and picks I figure you get a decent amount of stuff.,symphonicmetal,cg8rygg,2,t5_2sf4u
721098,0,t3_22f2tp,I saw them live on Saturday at the Masters of Symphonic Metal festival. They were really great and you could also buy their new album one week before the official release which of course I did. After listening to it for the first time I am really liking it so far.,symphonicmetal,cgm8q6c,1,t5_2sf4u
1036613,0,t1_chl5kw8,I might add that A War of Our Own is a much darker and more sombre album than the previous ones. The violin which usually produces some quick and high notes to lift things up has lower and slower melodies. ,symphonicmetal,chm499h,2,t5_2sf4u

2057907,0,t3_2icb6h,Im probably not the typical symphonic metal fan  Im much older than the average I suspect. I grew up listening to Black Sabbath which contains the roots to doomy gothic metal. Then heavy music went to shit in the s basically and I stuck to the classic metal stuff. Years later somehow I discovered Evanescence when the Fallen album came out. Being in North America this stuff was unheard of so I searched for similar stuff. I was also exploring other metal and still enjoy other genres but the definitive song that really got me into this stuff was Nymphetamine by Cradle of Filth  yes I realize this wouldnt qualify as symphonic metal but Liv Kristine sings it so I searched her other stuff out and ran across early Leaves Eyes leading me to other stuff like Tristania which blew me away. Inevitably I ran across Nightwish still almost unheard of in Canada Within Temptation Epica etc. To me this is what metal has matured to.,symphonicmetal,cl1el7l,4,t5_2sf4u

2602536,0,t1_cmy5trn,I think its a CharonRiver StyxBoatmaster Lantern type thing. Just going by the title being Crossing the River and having some other allusions to death in the lyrics like falling from grace and promised land. ,symphonicmetal,cmyaf9p,4,t5_2sf4u
2615402,0,t1_cmz0grt,Its weird. I like that band so much and I really want to like the new album but I just dont. Still I dont regret buying it.,symphonicmetal,cmzyz3a,2,t5_2sf4u

3134417,0,t1_comlhpb,I think hope that might be it because the name of the album references Darwin and one of the songs is about Carl Sagan. It looks like its more about science than religion.But then again Epica talks about both science and religion together so maybe thats what Nightwish wants to do...,symphonicmetal,comvohw,1,t5_2sf4u

4156946,0,t3_38amiw,I mostly buy through itunes for the instant grat of having the music right away. It also makes it easy for me to have the music everywhere. On my work machine on my phone etc. I do occasionally still buy physical CDs.,symphonicmetal,cru3qp6,1,t5_2sf4u
4966458,0,t3_3iwsfc,No ones going to judge you or kick you out based on what you wear unless youre in your bathing suits or something dayglo orange may get you some odd looks. I went to their show in Vancouver which was at a grand classy concert hall usually meant for symphony orchestras and people wore anything from metal studs to evening gowns. Based on your venue however I suspect jeans and tees would be sufficient. You might even want to wear something light so you can buy a Nightwish shirt at the merch table when you enter the venue and put it on for the rest of the concert.Some venues frown on taking in dedicated cameras will ask you to check it at coat check so keep to using your phone everyone does that so no biggy there  just dont record the entire thing even if your phone memory allows it. ,symphonicmetal,cukk6kd,4,t5_2sf4u

7196308,0,t3_4dzo43,I was a huge fan of Dark Adrenaline and Broken Crown Halo so its a little difficult to adjust to this. I think the heavier direction is cool though I expect itll grow on me. Im really looking forward to the whole album.,symphonicmetal,d1w5tkt,3,t5_2sf4u

8795855,0,t3_50lwur,For me it was mother earth by within temptation. I was a young child and I loved it so dad burned their mother earth album onto a cd for me. When I was older I started listening to similar bands most notably delain and nightwish. Nightwish quickly became a favourite. Dark passion play just came out the first song I heard was Sahara. Theyre still my favourite band nowadays. Favourite track is the greatest song on earth now.,symphonicmetal,d7554v3,5,t5_2sf4u
8828869,0,t1_d792izv,I think Stille Kom Dden from the same album would definitely classify as a great example of symphonic gothicdoom metal.,symphonicmetal,d793uyi,2,t5_2sf4u
9101291,0,t3_54smio,Hoping to make the Cleveland show.  Ive been wanting to see them headline for years.  I was pumped when they toured with Nightwish and Sabaton.  I got very upset because Delain opened  and half of their set was over by the time I got in because of how massive the line was.   I had no idea at the time who Sabaton was so I was pretty upset that I missed half of one of my favorite bands but had to sit through the entire set of a band I didnt know.  It all worked out a bit though cause I fucking love Sabaton now  but I still wish I wouldnt have missed half of Delain.  ,symphonicmetal,d85tv6r,1,t5_2sf4u
