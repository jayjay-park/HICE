10269563,0,t3_5mzwat,A big part of dirty talk is having the vocabulary for it. Maybe you should try reading some dirty things in your own time. Make a hobby of it to find stories you like.Taking something you would usually say ex. Ive been wanting to fuck you all day. and turning it into a power statement ex. Im going to take what I want from you until Im satisfied. is the edge a lady is looking for. Being honest is a big part of it you dont have to act like a sadist just be direct and absolute. ,BDSMAdvice,dc840hr,6,t5_3a545

Boundaries safe words should all be respected if something is off in play time it should be talked about. Subs have a strong voice in this power exchange.,BDSMAdvice,dfe1zy0,1,t5_3a545

11621035,0,t3_65u76b,Were you using lube? If you were use more than youd think. I like silicone lube for anal as the body doesnt absorb it like water based lubes. Though silicone lube can be incompatible with some silicone toys so be aware of that. Start with plenty of good lube and a finger. One big thing here is relaxing. You need to take your time. once hes gotten a finger in a little bit he can slowly start going further. Some people may find it easier to do with other sexual stimulation happening at the same time. If it hurts have him apply more lube.  Once thats going well you can try with a second finger or his penis but same thing applies...lots of lube and patience. No need to rush this.,BDSMAdvice,dgd973u,2,t5_3a545
11785261,0,t3_68542h,Thank you I appreciate your feed back. The problem is I have very few hard limits and I cant get him to outline where his limits are. I know he wants to try to give me what I like but I dont want to pressure him past what hes comfortable with without even knowing it. I dont have any specific fantasy that I want him to play out. Its just the mental aspect of being dominated for me. Like many of the woman Ive met in the lifestyle Im a strong willed independent selfsufficient person. I take charge when it comes to work or my recreational activities and even in past relationships but when it comes to my relationship with him its different. Im willing and wanting to submit to him not just in the bedroom but in all aspects of our relationship. I liked being a sub because it took my power away so to speak. Not only did I not Have to be in control I was actually not Allowed to me. The dynamic of giving another person complete control of me is a big part of it for me alone. The other of course is the way that person takes over the control. Ive explained all of this to him. He knows its more mental than anything for me but I feel like it puts a lot of pressure on him. He wants to give me what he thinks I need but doesnt have any experience with it himself so he doesnt know what he is or isnt comfortable with. Im worried Ill show him how far Im willing to go and it will be too far for him and in turn he will think hes not enoughif that makes sense because Just because Im Willing to go that far for him doesnt mean I necessarily have specific desireneed to.  Theres just virtually almost nothing I wouldnt do forwith him. ,BDSMAdvice,dgvwcjd,1,t5_3a545
