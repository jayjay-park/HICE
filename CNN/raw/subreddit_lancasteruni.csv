1305747,0,t3_28z8nb,This year Ive lived on campus in a townhouse and my rent has been  a week. Thats reasonable for on campus if you start looking for ensuite then the price goes up . My place has one bathroom between two and a big kitchen between twelve. Most other flats are  people sharing a kitchen and a couple of bathrooms. Im sharing a flat in town with three others next year and our rent is  a week each. Even factoring in the cost of the bus pass it works out as cheaper than this year. Most properties are just rented houses so they have three to four people sharing a bathroom and kitchen. I think youd find it quite hard to find an individual studio apartment in town and they might be quite pricy. There are actually some on campus which cost about  a week.My personal reccomendation would be to go for on campus to be honest. It might be slightly more expensive but the campus experience is worthwhile IMO. If youre on campus your accommodation will have some reps assigned for freshers week who will help you with settling in and show you around. And as you say its a lot easier to meet people living on campus than on your own in town.There are two shops on campus which are fine for occasional stuff but to do a big shop its cheaper in town. Sainsburys supermarket puts on free bus services between the uni and the store in the city centre every Wednesday so thats a good time to do a shop. You can also do your shopping online and get it delivered although theres a minimum spend so its best to club together with others.As a final aside its the Czech Republic not Czechoslovakia nowadays!,lancasteruni,cigihk4,1,t5_2swbr
