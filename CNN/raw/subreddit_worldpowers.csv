The NSF proposes to ban any country from assisting in the defence of Tuva for a period of  years. Given that Tuva has a  man army to defend itself and Russia and China can close the borders of Tuva in the event of hostilities this means that Tuva will remain essentially defenceless. Tuva does not agree to this term and in a final good faith concession agrees to accept a ban of foreign troops to defend Tuva for a period of  years as opposed to .

1202799,0,t1_ci4w3jt,Sorry I am on a work computer with a REALLY crappy internet connectiongtBut why dont you try allying with NSF I have no interest in supporting the militarism or repeated agressive interventions of the NSF or the UE. the terms of this alliance the UEformer Moscow Pactr are exploitive and heavy. It would requier us to provide material support to NSF actions and declare war on nations that we have no conflict with at the behest of the NSF. This would certainly ruin Tuva.We are a peaceful nation. We cherish the right of self determination granted by the UN charter and the right for our people to chart their own course.gtLastly they could easily block me too they already have a much bigger navy than me since i only have a few patrol boats.This is true. However were you to suddenly offer fleet basing rights to a nation hostile to the NSF this would pose absolutely no threat to him. This is not how the NSf perceives the case with Tuva.The NSF fears that the mere existence of an independant Tuva not under total military control by the NSF is a threat to them. They have denied that Tuva even exists as a nation since hours after the republic was declared. We have proposed eyt again multiple additional concessions to their demands to assure them of the totally defensive nature of any troops on Tuvan soil.They are hereTuva is really bending over backwards here. We agree to a treaty and they make more demands. This has now happened  times. Tuva does not know if they can continue to compromise as they have done so far in good faith.We really do intend to be a free and independant nation. The NSF has repeatedly stated that Tuva is hostile and attacked them. This is at best bad propaganda. Tuva has never fought except defensively when invaded.

Thats what roleplay is. Also Doky Id advise that you try not to decide certain people are just assholes.

You would need to change your vehicle perhaps multiple stages or rockets if you wanted to go up and down many times.Really its a question of physics. At certain limits you reach the point of diminishing returns because you need to spend fuel lifting more fuel.Why not research other propulsion systems? Im sure you could come up with a new method that would allow you to lift from the atmosphere and into orbit more than once with the same vehicle with a bit of work.,worldpowers,cjah594,1,t5_30yfr

1558397,0,t1_cjblyc3,The thing is for it to be effective the fermenters would need to be sealed. A large number of smaller fermenters would be required as they need to be emptied out of fertilizer when they have finished decomposing and fermenting. Many of them would also permit fermentation at different stages to take place all at once.If you want to use Lake Mead as a fermenter I can  guarantee that it will be contaminated and that you wont get any methane out of it. That would be a different system. A series of interconnected ponds where the last one would be clean water being released. I think that the input of biomass such as sawdust would make it unprofitable. Also it would be releasing all the greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere rather than capturing them to use as biofuels. So it would have no effect on deforestation.Actually now that I think of it fuel storage tanks would make a good template for size and expense.

But well have to see.As for it probably not happening it almost happened with Australia attacking Indonesia barely a week ago though Indonesia has dug himself into a pit by providing another justification and the Cook Islands attacking New Zealand around the same time which AFAIK is still going to happen. I know I know its the freaking Cook Islands but I doubt they would attack such a larger power if they werent sure theyd be backed up.

We have not ignored the communist dictatorship and we recognize how terrible the Derg was despite your claim. You say that they would rather be ruled by you for some reason instead of the Ethiopian leadership. Have you taken any polls any votes any referendums? No because this is all propaganda from you. There is no proof of your claims.You call us imperialist and proimperialist. Based on my history of being one of the only protectors of the great continent of Africa you should know this is possibly the most idiotic claim I have ever heard from another person. Where have you been for the last  years? Hiding in a cave? And what proof do you have that the Somali population would be better off as a part of Somalia than it is in Ethiopia? Ethicity does not always determine things. Quality of life is important and based on the quality of some of Somalias cities and their economy I would say that Ethiopia would clearly be a better option. Lastly it is amazing how you can bitch about SOMAS threatening to take their land and defend you taking another countrys land in the same speech.

If Im correct the riots started because a Christian beat a Muslim and then both sides became became implacable. The acts of the rioters and the deaths of many innocent Christians is indeed not something to be condoned. However by lowering yourself to that level in distress you degrade yourself. As Ive said and my Brother in Law Emperor Charles would endorse a good ruler always enforces the rule of law and respects his or her subjects. This Inquisition a tool of a more savage time is not the way to soothe relations between the two groups. It only breeds more resentment resentment that will haunt Spain in the future. The proper way forward is fair trail for rioters and heavy security presence to enforce order.    ,worldpowers,cmqh258,1,t5_30yfr

Morality is needed more so now then ever before with people having no respect for life.I am serving my population as over  are Christian and I am trying to save lives here why cant you see that.  I have tried my best to handle this issue respectfully and with the least amount of hardship for those involved however I will not allow a hateful people to live here any longer that wish to harm my subjects.This is not a Catholic inquisition but a Christian one.  All Christian denominations will be welcome in Spain.  This is not the Spanish Inquisition of days of old.

Purported overpopulation in cities is an issue but by no means a global issue it is one that independent governments need to discuss and solve on their own without needing other countries to hold their hands.  It is almost as if the idea and rhetoric of overpopulation is carefully designed to fearmonger where for the vast majority of people and countries it is simply not an issue. Its been said again and again and its disappointing to see that government officials have stopped to this level of ignorance without doing proper research.There is enough space for . billion to live in a townhouse while altogether fitting on a landmass the size of Texas which is a tiny corner of the planet.

2775116,0,t3_2rusqy, The PAU EMU TreatyFor a long time I have been opposed to the EMU. I feel as if they are an organization in which a few individual nations use others to reach their goals and try to expand their influence beyond what should be their reach. I understand that it was created to help the nations that are in EMU and Africa but Egypt the new worse Cordoba and Senegambia have never cooperated with us shown friendship to us or anything else. They stand with Europe. Not Africa. Even though we have offered them more even though we have offered them much more. I do not want to work with Egypt who has forced conversion of their people to Christianity Cordoba who has sided with Europe from the beginning or Senegambia who is clearly bundled up to its former colonizers. I dont feel that we need to make special alliances or things of that sort to accomodate these nations that dont want to make the necessary strides to help us.I do not think that the African nations not joining EMU makes us look weak more than anything. It shows them that they are the stronger alliance and that if we didnt have this piece of paper Europe could easily get an African nation over the PAU. This infuriates me. Politically economically and practically we are the better alliance to join. There has never been fighting between main members of the alliance we have far greater benefits such as the PAU bank we always defend our brothers and we are overall more loyal to each other.The fact that we need to say that they cant expand into Africa makes me uneasy.

2939188,0,t1_co275p1,ampampamp Eighth Crusade sfw gtgtThe Eighth Crusade was a crusade launched by Louis IX King of France in . The Eighth Crusade is sometimes counted as the Seventh if the Fifth and Sixth Crusades of Frederick II are counted as a single crusade. The Ninth Crusade is sometimes also counted as part of the Eighth.gtLouis was disturbed by events in Syria where the Mamluk sultan Baibars had been attacking the remnant of the Crusader states Baibars had seized the opportunity after a war pitting the cities of Venice and Genoa against each other  had exhausted the Syrian ports that the two cities controlled. By  Baibars had captured Nazareth Haifa Toron and Arsuf Hugh III of Cyprus nominal king of Jerusalem landed in Acre to defend that city while Baibars marched as far north as Armenia which was at that time under Mongol control.gtThese events led to Louis call for a new crusade in  although there was little support this time Jean de Joinville the chronicler who accompanied Louis on the Seventh Crusade refused to go. Louis was soon convinced by his brother Charles of Anjou to attack Tunis first which would give them a strong base for attacking Egypt the focus of Louis previous crusade as well as the Fifth Crusade before him both of which had been defeated there. Charles as King of Sicily also had his own interests in this area of the Mediterranean The Khalif of Tunis Muhammad I alMustansir also had connections with Christian Spain and was considered a good candidate for conversion.gtLouis landed on the African coast in July of  a very unfavourable season for landing. Much of the army became sick because of poor drinking water his Damietta born son John Sorrow died on  August and on  August  Louis himself died from a flux in the stomach one day after the arrival of Charles on August  .  His dying word was Jerusalem. Charles proclaimed Louis son Philip III the new king but because of his youth Charles became the actual leader of the crusade.gtBecause of further diseases the siege of Tunis was abandoned on  October by an agreement with the sultan. In this agreement the Christians gained free trade with Tunis and residence for monks and priests in the city was guaranteed so the crusade could be regarded as a partial success. After hearing of the death of Louis and the evacuation of the crusaders from Tunis Sultan Baibars of Egypt cancelled his plan to send Egyptian troops to fight Louis in Tunis.  Charles now allied himself with Prince Edward of England who had arrived in the meantime. When Charles called off the attack on Tunis Edward continued on to Acre the last crusader outpost in Syria. His time spent there is often called the Ninth CrusadegtgtImage iInteresting Muhammad I alMustansir | David I Strathbogie Earl of Atholl | Lancelot de SaintMaard |  Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcory oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecory.

I then did the thing Im happiest with aside from the drone development my SARS RP. I wanted the RP to be hard hitting which is probably why I dedicated a whole post to killing off a young girl. President Bachman dying to it was intended as the final twist and my only regret is that I didnt build up the character more beforehand to make it a bigger deal.     It was a while before I was able to build up any new characters and since I joined the sub Ive always seen building characters as the main priority. I slipped out of activity for a lot of December so theres a big gap in my countrys history. When I came back I built up President Nemeth named for the real name of WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler and Jacques Gabriel named for a name I plucked out of thin air who again I wish Id built up more but I was focused on learning how to military.

Secondly your assumption is that the laser would be used in atmosphere. When it would be used in atmosphere and even in space when the warheads are most vulnerable. Thirdly we already have a weapons system that uses lasers to shoot down icbm and mirvrv vehicles. So your argument is invalid. The fact is lasers do work in atmosphere and are effective anti ballistics defenses.  A simple anti matter reactor would produce enough energy to power any advanced laser systems our alien aggressors would be bringing.

3537110,0,t1_cpvf71j,gtBut it always strikes me as strange people even view the reunification of Yugoslavia as impossible. It was around for a long time.Ok buddy thats one flimsy argument.Being around for a long time is not a good reason for why a coubtry should come back. The USSR was around for a similar amount of time. The Roman Empire lasted a lot longer. Czechoslovakia lasted for a long time too. Are these coming back? No. Communism is very unpopular in Russia Italy doesnt have the power to take over the med again and the Czechs dont want to live with Slovaks.Saying the balkans can unite! is stupider than saying India and PakistanA great pair for a union!.The EU is as united as these people will get and even thats unlikely.,worldpowers,cpvgble,0,t5_30yfr

Parachuting supplies is very inaccurate and needs special systems to protect more delicate cargo items. In addition airships need much less fuel than planes.    So for goods that are massive but not time critical the airships provide a cheap and complete way of transportation. For example steady production factories need raw materials on schedule and know the need weeks in advance so an airship could transport those goods directly onto the factory site. No need for reloading the stuff from planes into trucks.,worldpowers,cs8b90l,2,t5_30yfr

They have brought about since their inception as the earlier Wass. Federation some of the most peaceful years and SubSaharan Africa and also helped stabilize struggling economies which are now beginning to flourish. As the UAR began to break up and become not a machine for peace but a mechanism for war it is only logical that they should be replaced by a much more better intentioned group of nations. The UAC did this and fairly peacefully as well. We will recognize the UACs claim to Egypt for the time being and hope peaceful means will be taken up by both sides to resolve this situation.

5361316,0,t3_3oevck,We should split it up like they did in Fallout.But seriously the US needs to be split up. People here seem to not comprehend just how powerful the US is. The only reason Russia hasnt been wiped off the map is because they have nukes. And now that nukes are gone that block is completely gone. The US has by far the most powerful military and by WP mechanics and typical player attitude that is never going to change. No new superpowers will rise because why on earth would the USA allow another nation to get more powerful than it? Just use an excuse and invade because who will stop you? Nobody so do what you want.But Nikolai I hear you say cant we just all invade and wipe out the US like we did to China earlier?Of course not. China is not nearly as powerful as the US and it has inferior technology. The USA has more jets than everyone else almost combined and a far bigger navy. It has more ACCs than everyone else combined and just getting troops to the US shore would be hard. A land invasion through Canada and Mexico is possible but still unlikely and extremely difficult. The US can block you from getting to wherever you are trying to land anyways and if you somehow do get on land you still have the US likely high on patriotism throw its entire military at you. There is no way in hell a coalition unless its every nation on earth could defeat the US. And considering it has to do some aggressive actions before the war maybe it invaded Canada and Mexico maybe Cuba and Liberia. It will have even more soldiers to call upon. I havent even mention the vast size of the USA and militias that will certainly form.By the time people can unite into the Anerican Federation or whatever the world would have grown past them and the hyperpower that is the US would be gone.,worldpowers,cvwyvvb,2,t5_30yfr

We are furious with Poland but we echo Hungary this a V matter before anything else. This was a V on V invasion and it is more than enough to warrant Polish suspension from the V. Stand down and wait until you have EU support acting on your own only escalates the matter and further shows how blatantly trigger happy Germany has become. We are inclined to leave NATO and even the EU after this. Germany is proving itself to be no better than Poland and it angers the Romanian people. We fought a damn revolution to escape the clutches of the Soviet Union and end our communist rule. We opened up to the west so we could survive the aftermath of our revolution.

Please select a naval base preferably active for our joint administration as Royal Australian Navy personnel will be present to assist with maintenance of these facilities. We will upon your selection also expand the housing facilities of the base to comfortably house the Corps of Royal Marines or a comparativelysized infantry corps should you so desire. Please keep in mind that while we are offering to expand capacity to house the entirety of the Marine Corps there is no obligation for you to keep them in residence at full capacity. This is merely an option we afford you should the need to quickly deploy the Royal Marines in Oceania or Southeast Asia become critical.  M uZaphodBrox   We politely request that Chile and New Zealand also select a naval base for the United Kingdoms use to allow the United Kingdom to refuel rearm and repair. It is our understanding that the United Kingdom cannot effectively patrol the Pitcairns without a base in New Zealand for example.  Additionally would Chile be comfortable with the Royal Australian Navy using the same base as the UK? We need a naval base in the region to compensate for our stretched logistics.

7360780,0,t3_4g629n,The people of Brazil chose to invade the USC with no cause giving Mexico a green light to invade Belize and demand the annexation of over half our nation.  If Mexico and Brazil wanted to annex us let them feel the sting of their own imperialism. We were willing to accept peace and press for the French to leave but thus far the Aztecs and their ilk have outright refused to even speak to us regarding an end to to war. We never even asked for reparations simply to make a joint statement of an end to the war and even that couldnt be accepted. This situation could have been ended by cooperation and the French are not there for no reason. If they had been willing to cooperate French forces would withdraw upon hearing of a resolution to the conflict. France does not perpetuate this escalation the Aztecs do and Brazil is guilty of the same crimes and continue to support their fascist ally.

We do not feel hurt by your insults we feel only pity. We wonder what great failure all this hot air intends to cover up. Perhaps you realize the world isnt turning against Finland after all?There is no quest to fend you off because you are not a threat in the first place. We have no secret antiSoviet agenda though this Baltic conspiracy youve invented is an amusing story. Like all Russian conspiracy theories it falls apart when one decides to apply logic to it. In this case the Russian land connection to Kaliningrad. Truth be told you may feel great hate towards us but we feel nothing but apathy towards you. That being said one good turn does deserve another so we will respond to the coherent parts of the above rant.Lets assume for a moment that as you say a rebranding is worthless. At that point it becomes clear exactly what you are. You are no Soviet Union. You are the collapsed Russian Federation a rump state of poverty and prostitution. Permanently a subject of derision and dislike. You blame Finland for keeping the same men in power yet your Emperors are two kleptocrats from the Putin Administration.Perhaps this is why the argument of doing the right thing is so foreign to you. You are a government whose language is ignorance who communicates through hate. All that youve said fully backs up this diagnosis.,worldpowers,d382z58,1,t5_30yfr

We dont think that is the case and if you still do then the USSR is also disappointing.Since we all agreed to this without being fully aware of Finnish actions were all now collectively responsible for fixing this issue that puts itself before us. The impossibility we mention is that it is impossible for us the German government to remove Finland so pressuring us to do so accomplishes nothing.

The combined voices of our hundreds of millions of citizens coupled with our economic might will allow us to have the political might and willpower necessary to ensure that our wishes are respected and understood.gtAs it is when engaging in negotiations as separate states other nations are at a marked position of superiority both economically and politically. Negotiating as a single united federation allows us to organize favourable trade agreements project our power and influence across the Indian Ocean Africa and abroad and continue to fulfill our obligations with our friends and allies.This new Egyptian regime under the late Viziers daughter and the support of the old Imperial Guard sounds remarkably similar to the one that brought about bloodshed and chaos in the skies above the Central African Empire and the former Chadian state. From our experiences attempting to negotiate with them from a position of relative weakness is rather unproductive.

8731153,0,t1_d6x020w,. Read up on the Rising Peacock Plan and here I got some great rolls and more international investment in that year than Myanmar has cumulatively received in its history. Its safe to say that Myanmars infrastructure is on par with most developed countries although dont expect it to be on GulfArab or even American levels. Think Eastern Europe or Future Chile.. Your infrastructure is way better than the average Indian infrastructure although it doesnt compare to Indias massive megacities. Sri Lanka is better developed than the mainland. . The military is extremely well trained. Myanmar lived under a military regime from independence until the mid s. Since then the militarys played a major roll in government and has actively fought rebels until the s. Now as a power between India China and Mekong it had the doctrine of quality military. This may have maxed under the last claimant as they gave away their northern territories to China they gave  provinces away for no good reason and bent over for India. Sri Lanka has poorer training because the mainland carried the military but they have the biggest naval contingent for sure Colombo. Socially advanced is an odd term. Id say their society is a bit more progressive than Thailand IRL in which globalization has pretty much made Myanmar pretty open minded especially to foreign ideals and such. However it has been a Buddhist Republic for a couple decades with a Buddhist education and the slow cultural eradication of the Rohingya and Christian minorities. By now the minorities would still exist but theyd make up an ever smaller segment of the society and would be hopefully integrated.. I was pretty good with keeping up the tech did lots of stuff with Australia to stay on top. But when I declaimed mids it seems to have stagnated. Youll need to check the next claimants post.Also bonus note. I assumed I was going to keep it until regionalization my plan was to rename the country Srianmar portmanteau of Sri Lanka and Myanmar like Tanzania is Tanganyika and Zanzibar.

While this may be an official pact it is nothing like the Peacekeepers and the requirements for such a pact. Nations within the Jerusalem Pact join for an assurance of protection should another nation attack it yet continue to expand unchecked within the pact. While we understand the Free States worries with Indonesia any aligning with the TSF would force a confrontation with the nation of Indonesia and pact members. Once again it must be stressed that the TSF has taken an expansionist policy in South East Asia albeit for the most part peaceful. Cambodia seemed to be a case of opportunism wherein the TSF promised a free government for Cambodia yet is know absorbing it. We see the same case in Laos with North Laos under control of the TSF following an intervention.

10944102,0,t3_5w92od,We have the following proposal to defend Uyghurstan  . Defeating Red Group amp Bogging down Blue GroupHere the bulk of our forces consisting of the  TSF brigadesGold and the entirety of the Uyghur forces Purple would face off against China Group Red. This will be done in the form of a controlled retreat from the border towards the shown positions. This controlled retreat would allow us to use the defenders advantage to our maximum advantage. A small Uyghur pocket would remain in the North West of the nation attempting to harass the Chinese supply lines. They will use asymmetric warfare to pin down any attempts to clear them from the mountains. The numerical superiority of Red Group over the combined forces of the TSF and Uyghurstan in neglible and this should be a winnable fight. The bulk of Sundan fighters will be sent here to help this fight.  As for Blue group Sunda and the TSFs Royal Tenasserim Armys st Cavalry Division will harass the Chinese to such a degree that we believe their advances will bog down to a very slow one. Coupled with the fact that this army group needs to travel much further than the red one we hope to divide and conquer. Dark green denotes a the current Sundan brigade performing small skirmishes from the dessert and larger raid from the mountains. Light green denotes the Royal Tenasserim Armys st Cavalry Division in cooperation with a Sundan Immedieate deployment brigade. These will perform further harassment until finally supporting the allies in the defense of Korla.  . Defeating Blue groupAt Korla we hope to have the UyghurTenasseri forces who will have defeated Red Group by this time join the much smaller SundanTenasseri contingent in Korla.  Whilst the troops in Korla engage the Chinese from the NorthEast the Indian forces Not pictured together with the Sundan reinforcements will strike from the SouthWest. This Pincer movement would cut of Chinese Forces and trap them. Mountains to the North Korla East desert South and finally reinforcements west. Further notesCooperation is a must and therefore locals with knowledge of the terrain will be hired. Furthermore integration in the form of CI systems and similar will be used to their maximum potential.  ,worldpowers,de8t1xq,1,t5_30yfr

As has been demonstrated in recent years other Western powers such as the United States have seen fit to pretend to align with Turkey when it has suited them only to turn on them at the nearest available opportunity however France and Italy have remained steadfast supporters of the Turkish regime. In light of our suspension from Nato engineered of course by countries who feel threatened by our power and democracy the French Republic and Mediterranean Republic soon as you know to be united would like to consider military cooperation and agreements with a number of parties outside of the framework of the Nato alliance with the UNESSR being chief among these. ,worldpowers,dfq74v7,1,t5_30yfr
11419383,0,t1_dfqbpqi,Whats already on it is a good guideline though a lot of it needs updated. In the mids Arabia had a civil war which ended in the ousting of the House of Saud. For a while it was unaligned until the creation of the Middle East Defense Organization which included Iraq Arabia Iran the United Emirati Federationwhich is Yemen plus a bunch and Pakistan. MEDOs largest enemies at the time of its formation were the UNESSRcommunist Turkey and India. Not long after it entered MEDO Iraq was framed for a mass shooting in Times Square and was subject to invasion by an international coalition. Unwilling to hand the west a puppet on a platter MEDO invaded Iraq as well sustaining very light losses. Simultaneous to this was was a conflict of Indian aggression against Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir in which a MEDO coalition force fought India to a standstill. MEDO demanded that the entirety of Jammu and Kashmir be ceded to Pakistan but India refused and no invasion came. The Iraq war reached its conclusion when the UNESSR dissolved due to diplomatic and internal pressures. When peace on both fronts was achieved the Middle Eastern Confederation was formed between Arabia Iran and the UEF with particularly strong allegiance to Russia and the US. A coalition invasion of terroristcontrolled Egypt occurred around this time which MEC forces participated in and a similar invasion of Sudan in cooperation with AbyssiniaEthiopia happened directly after. Around then the Gulf Treaty Alliance was formed comprised of the MEC the URSAanother huge super state in south america the Greater Maghreb Confederation South Africa and Singapore. When the MEC tried to annex Sudan however France Italy and Russia issued an ultimatum demanding the MEC dissolve lest war occur. Ive been working very long hours lately and dont really have the time to run a full claim so not wanting to drag the claims around me into ruin I left the MEC and declaimed resulting in its dissolution.

11644468,0,t3_665a6s,The PFLA The situation in Panama is indeed most concerning. Wed like to remind all members involved in this that the instability caused by the outrage of the people of the FRCA when the FRCA intelligence agency failed spectacularly for the second time in infiltrating or trying to blame the PFLA for their internal problems so in spite of Mexicos insistence that this does not concern us it does. This was compounded when we understood that Commonwealth forces were given station in Gran Colombia.The situation itself The PFLA is first disappointed by the conduct of almost every nation involved including to an extent our own conduct. The extent of the issues has had to see the PFLA mobilise last year as we feared a conflict on the verge an expensive endeavour for our own security concerns. We also would like to point out that when we made an offer to act as peacekeepers for the supposed peacekeeping forces to prevent conflict we were informed by the Commonwealth that such an action would be considered an act of war which we dispute. Seeing how tensions seem to be on the rise again weve since had our offer accepted And while we havent deployed the two infanty brigades that well use to peacekeeping the peacekeepers they shall be deployed in the near future at a publically announced time. Currently on the referendum for Panamanian independence itself we dont really know. Internal events meant that we didnt really see any of it. Wed like to ask if there were any international observers to give us their thoughts on the legitimacy of the referendum. If neutral observers say that the referendum was legitimate well be more inclined to support an independent Panama. if observers say otherwise well be more inclined towards the other argument. However at this stage we arent entirely sure. ,worldpowers,dgfwx4i,1,t5_30yfr
