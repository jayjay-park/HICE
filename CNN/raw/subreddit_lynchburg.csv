7227288,0,t3_4ef2q0,So I live about two blocks from the campus so I can shed a little light. Obviously as Im sure youve visited the campus and have seen for yourself the school is located smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood. Anything within biking distance will be a house thats been split in to apartments or shared space. The neighborhood is great. Sure some people roam the streets but who cares? Its close to Food Lion and the bus route if you need it. Perrymont is a great neighborhood as well. But Im not sure that riding your bike down Sussex will be fun. Because youre trying to stay close to campus I dont think youll have to worry about renting out something sketchy. Check with Brownstone and Lynchburg Renting and then mapquest  it. Stay on this side of Fort Ave and you should be golden.,lynchburg,d1zosuu,4,t5_2s5ir

7611053,0,t3_4jgebq,Welcome! Glad to have you here. Since you are new to the area and your wife is going to LU a warning about our expressway that catches ALL LU students by surprise. All on ramps to the US  expressway in the LU area have NO acceleration lanes. You frequently need to stop to wait for an opening to get on  otherwise the on ramp will very suddenly dump you in traffic going gt MPH faster than you. This is because the expressway was designed in a time where there were only a fraction of the number of cars using it as there is today and the ramps cant be expanded because they end in a overpass pylon. I remember a couple of years ago  I think during the first week of classes watching a LU student get surprised by the very short on ramps and ended up striking and killing a motorcyclist The rider was waiting for an opening and the student rearended him at  mph and knocked the rider under a tractor trailer.    There is a lot to do and love in Lynchburg and Im sure you both will be very happy here.,lynchburg,d37c5ee,1,t5_2s5ir
