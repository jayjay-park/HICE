Although I dont know if the most common used reagents are useful for testing nootropics. ,ReagentTesting,cypbloy,2,t5_2zl7v
8179759,0,t1_d5009o2,There are a couple of benzos in the NPS list You cant test cannabis nor synthetic cannabinoids. At least not with the most widely available reagents. As for the RCs then yes Im aware that not everything is in there. Now the list contains over  different substances source BunkPolice database Ifwhen I find data about test results on more RCs then they can be added. Its not really useful to add all the  substances that TripSit has in its factsheet if there is no data about the test results anyway.,ReagentTesting,d500p8d,2,t5_2zl7v

11458740,0,t3_60ilra,Its hard to identify something from reagents and really hard to tell from a photo like that because we dont have anything to compare the colors with. They are more useful to screen for reactions that shouldnt happen like mecke turned orange when there should have been no reaction. You can try to guess what caused that but it will only be a guess. If you got an unexpected reaction all you really know is that you have a contaminated or mislabelled substance and you should probably toss it.,ReagentTesting,dfuu9k3,1,t5_2zl7v
