329793,0,t1_cfey9cn,Umm. Is not like they announce to the public theyre hiking up the exchange rate. Imagine for a second you want to go to Europe. You want to take  euros with you. You have the money and its a long trip. How would you feel if the government said no. You cant. You can only take . So many Americans would burn this whole country down if that happened. Its your money. You should be able to do with it whatever you damn please. ,youranonnews,cfeycvp,1,t5_2wyz2

5077420,0,t1_cuxtpqw,gtYou cannot arrest an idea.Didnt he just pinch that from V for Vendetta? I knew Id seen that in some other context...actually it turns out it was Giuseppe Mazzini talking about Italian independence and unification in  gtYou may kill a few individuals but you cannot kill an idea. An idea is immortal. In the midst of tempests an idea attains the stature of a giant and like a new diamond shines a light at every repercussion. The idea becomes more and more incarnate in humanity and when you have exhausted your rage and your brutal might on individuals who are merely precursors the idea will rise up irresistibly in the majesty of the people and will bury in the ocean wave of futurity your names and even the recollection of your resistance to the agitation of the generations which God stirs to movement.Viva Verdi! lol Speaking of which heres a good article on the role of Mazzinis use of music as propagandaLa Musica del Cannone The Role of Verdi and Patriotic Music in the RisorgimentoVa Pensiero? Meh. Sad to confessand I really do feel a little  bad about thisI always VASTLY preferred Verdis music of the oppressor. lol ,youranonnews,cuy0rji,2,t5_2wyz2
7861761,0,t1_d3zanee,gt I cant believe people do this kind of stuff for a living. It seems sociopathic to manipulate people like this. Oh absolutely. It really speaks to how fucked this society is that the media endlessly promotes the idea that spies are cool when the very essence of espionage is betraying peoples trust for a living. Not to mention nine times out of ten they never know who theyre really working for anyway. As Jefferson Mack once said in Running A Ring Of Spies Spycraft And Black Operations In The Real World Of EspionagegtAlthough no one collects any statistics on this the majority of all spies think they are reporting to a different government political group or commercial enterprise than the one really reading the information they steal. In  most cases they would never have agreed to spy for the CIA KGB or whatever trapped them into spying. Without the use of the false flag very little spying would ever get done. Something to keep in mind the next time you hear somebody bragging on IRC about working for whomever.  Yeah maybe not. lolEven worse the intelligence community snows its own. Deception is everything and the psychopathic bullshit artists driving strategy have conned what they sarcastically refer to as the Boy Scouts  into believing the ends justify the means. Yay team? Hardly. As Barton Whaleythe undisputed dean and Founding Father of modern deception studiesonce said Cheating on a grand scale has a certain attraction.  In his  book Strategem Deception and Surprise in War he took the position that the most effective deception demands that all elements of ones own government and ones own society be deceived so as to assure that the enemy is seeing across the board buyin for example within ones own diplomatic circles.  Heres a little poem he used to quote O what a tangled web we weaveWhen first we practice to deceive!But when weve practiced quite a while How vastly we improve our style!Yep. lol If you ever run out of things to read theres always Whaleys Magnum Opus for the NICs Foreign Denial and Deception Committee DETECTING DECEPTION A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF COUNTERDECEPTION ACROSS TIME CULTURES AND DISCIPLINESTo say its a real eyeopener is an understatement.,youranonnews,d3zqe9u,2,t5_2wyz2
