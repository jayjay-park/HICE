114297,0,t3_1veib2,I have been playing Jedi Outcast for the last few days and loving it. Two mediocre levels and then a lightsaber. Slowly you start feeling like a boss Jedi. I loved it.I also remembered this place. The community here was awesome. I have long forgotten my password unfortunately.You could take lessons from other players and they had the lightsaber technique down to a tee. I only made the rank of Pawdawn I think. Wonderful community full of friendly and supportive people.Anyone here remember this place?,jediknight,cerg1h6,3,t5_2snhf

6088662,0,t1_cyhcanx,Im definitely excited to play Dark Forces  but none of my mods are working... I managed to fix the black screen bug that was caused by the mods but now they are not having any effect on the game at all... Do you know of any solutions to this problem? ,jediknight,cyhp9mn,1,t5_2snhf
