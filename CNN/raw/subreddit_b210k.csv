2081628,0,t3_2h4kct,Running is definitely high impact and can cause a multitude of running injuries. As long as you have proper gear proper form cross train and not run a half marathon without proper training... You should limit those injuries. Long term long distance running can cause legfootknee injuries. Make sure you take those rest days!For example of what not to do I ran a half marathon on Sunday and prior to that my longest distance run was a k. I did well until mile  when I got severe foot pain. I stopped running but walked the rest and then ran the last . miles. I am now stuck on the couch nursing stress fractures in my feet. One of the most uncomfortable things ever. Dont do what I did.,b210k,cl4f5e6,1,t5_2t1rx
