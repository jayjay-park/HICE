1137393,0,t3_275812,The first Elliott Smith song I learned was the Biggest Lie. Only a couple of chord changes and very simple fingering. Easy enough to master in a few days and highly gratifying  its such a good song.,elliottsmith,chxkffp,4,t5_2rmbn
1499910,0,t3_2bdmk9,For some reason it really peeves me that they put From a Basement on The Hill as the worst and Figure  as his best. Rating his albums like that is a daunting task it is purely a matter of opinion because each album he made had a different feel to it and his best songs tend to change depending on which album suits our changing moods.Still worth a read although when the reviewer wrote Even if Elliott Smith were alive and peaceful From a Basement on the Hill would be a frustrating mess. my first impulse was to go straight to the comments section and give him a piece of my mind.,elliottsmith,cj4ad6e,6,t5_2rmbn
1567750,0,t1_cjcp7cy,I completely agree. From a Basement on a Hill is such a depressing album to listen to for me personally. Its pretty much what he left us with excluding New Moon of course. It makes me so sad because he was going to go on to do even greater things musically. Basement on a Hill is such a unique album and differs from anything he had done previously in my opinion. ,elliottsmith,cjcshhl,1,t5_2rmbn
2325255,0,t3_2lvc7h,I dont like how the same artists always get bunched with Elliott just because they sound they same stylistically. I think the reason why I got interested in Elliotts music is because it had some kind of beautiful genuine feeling and was very unsuperficial. Like Nirvana isnt similar to Elliott but I felt the same feeling from them before I listened to Elliott. Nick Drakes okay but other than that its hard to find that amazing feeling that you get from that music.,elliottsmith,clz45r8,3,t5_2rmbn

7115717,0,t1_d1lpte0,Very helpful I wasnt exactly aware. This closes up certain options and opens up new ones. There is a word for mishead lyrics which seem to have some meaning either intended or unintended mondegreen. The New Yorker has an article on the phenomenon  They can be fascinating and lack of textual authority with regard to these lyrics gives great room for interpretation.Like one Elliott Smith mondegreen from fond farewell pitch burning on a shining sheet the generally accepted lyric and BITCH burning on a shning sheet both followed by the only maker that youd want to meet. The latter is so much more vivid but I believe the former is correct . in fact in this particular case does anyone know the authentic lyric?,elliottsmith,d1myttt,1,t5_2rmbn
7747860,0,t3_4lchti,He did it with a lot of songs its not unique to Miss Misery. I think theres only one poor quality recording of the original Kings Crossing but its completely different to what we have now. Theres a different version of A Distorted Reality is Now A Necessity To Be Free that has very different lyrics. ,elliottsmith,d3mvi5o,2,t5_2rmbn

10197046,0,t3_5lzdpm,i wonder if the alt version of Bottle Up and Explode is the one that he recorded with Mike Doughty using a stereoscopic mic or whatever I think its mentioned in Torment Saint or Ballad of Big Nothing...,elliottsmith,dbzw3u9,3,t5_2rmbn
10198150,0,t1_dc00fy6,Yea which I guess sounds similar because I hear Elliott singing always makes an  to that melody in my head. I dont listen to those tracks often though so that would explain my confusion. I prefer the album tracks and whatever complilation I found years ago called see you in heaven includes the track of his unfinished New Moon tracks.  Most of them are on New Moon but unfinished before they added backup vocals and stuff. I like it a lot.  Wouldnt know where to find it if I had to look today its been maybe  years.,elliottsmith,dc00mdy,1,t5_2rmbn
10236902,0,t3_5mc50a,Yes. This. I have to be careful when I go on Elliott Smith binges. I get stuck in my head and I could stay there for weeks with him. ,elliottsmith,dc4ernp,6,t5_2rmbn

10657549,0,t3_5s6by7,Honestly its best to watch Heaven Adores You and read Autumns book if you are looking for a biographical coverage. Another good read is Matt LeMays book about the making of XO. Beyond this I wouldnt recommend any other publication edited book or posthumous film about Elliott. They all have positives but also are full of narrative assumptions incorrect information and missing voices that hold them back from being as definitive as they try to be.,elliottsmith,ddf8ten,5,t5_2rmbn

11130958,0,t3_5ywh99,Im like  sure Bottle Up and Explode has layered synth and not an actual orchestra. Jon Brions credited with playing the vibraphone and chamberlin on the song so it makes sense. Plus the outro bends sound really mechanical plus when theyre backing the guitar solo. Coast to Coast also doesnt have any orchestra. Its just that his electric guitar is in an open C tuning and he got a ridiculously powerful tone out of it. Elliott just finds ways to make so many of his compositions sound orchestral even in his lofi days,elliottsmith,deton1t,3,t5_2rmbn
11228733,0,t1_df4rapv,Its taken from the Yo Yo a Go Go concert  the one where he screws up. They remastered it and removed the screwup.,elliottsmith,df4rfxo,1,t5_2rmbn
