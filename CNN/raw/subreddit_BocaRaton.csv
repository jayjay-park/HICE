11265981,0,t1_df8z4hf,If you are still interested in internal medicine subspecialties like GI or allergy in M Id highly recommend that you check out the internal medicine residency at Boca Raton RegionalFlorida Atlantic University. I interviewed there and they have an excellent structure in place though they dont have much in terms of fellowships yet.If you matched thatd give you a chance to spend  years here and test out the waters before you commit to building a practice here. That would be more than enough time.,BocaRaton,df8zdrh,1,t5_2sja7
