191844,0,t1_cesclup,About this yeah once you live a disturbing experience in you own personal reality you start wondering forgetting or even resting importance to the event as the established reality the one that tells us officially how the world is and how its supposed to work starts to synchronize and change your point of view of the event. Problem with this kind of glitches is that most of the time they are individual events and not shared with other people so its easy to finally dismiss the repercussions they should have. In fact you need the backup of other people who knows and feels about what are you talking about and what happened to recover the control of yourself and the importance and repercussions that event must have.  What you are describing as a mechanism to stop dangerous thoughts is actually the automatic mode we live in most of the time as it works totally based in the illusion of the established reality. And what makes you realize this kind of glitches or experiences is consciousness. In fact this is only one kind of experience among many others all related to the same core the own foundations of reality.  This probably will sound to you as completely bullshit but is all about free will and what is called in some circles like new age which is false flag by the way the human farm. Not that I like that circles or thinking on the contrary. But I have found by myself enough proof that there is at least some little truth going in that direction. When we use our consciousness we are claiming our free will. But when we act in automatic mode we are giving up our free will. This means you can be directly manipulated and controlled by the entities that keep us under this matrix.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,cf0ahfc,4,t5_2tcwa

This is not to say I will not recall a weird incident but none off the top of my head.ETA I will also say aside from my upset at my babys injury I approached this more investigatively since my main concern was finding and eliminating the source. For a while I scoured the area looking for anything that could have done it.  Quite simply there was nothing I found that was even remotely explainable. We coslept we didnt own a crib and he wasnt mobile. He was never out of range because he was too small for that. If I went to another room I picked him up and carried him with me. And at the time of this injury wed been in the living room all morning so it wasnt like anything I had on me could have done it in the stabbing.

If some version of a multiverse theory is true and given the vastness of what little we can see of the universe theres no reason to disbelieve in multiverses it opens up the possibility for an infinite array of universes with different starting conditions different laws of physics different modes of being and different possible outcomes.It could be that we live in a universe where we never get to peek behind the veil a universe in which we are destined forever to remain ignorant as to the ultimate nature of everything. Then again we might live in a universe where figuring it all out is the whole point. The anthropic principle leaves us in a huge bind why is the universe just so? Why does everything seem so perfectly calibrated for the existence of life? ... well because we wouldnt be here asking that question we wouldnt even exist if that werent the case.Out of all the possible universes we know that we live within the subset of universes in which intelligent creatures can exist. We know this because we exist. Beyond that we cant really infer or assume much about where we live. We have no way of knowing whether we live in a solvable simulation universe or an unsolvable one.

It states that among competing hypotheses the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other more complicated solutions may ultimately prove correct butin the absence of certaintythe fewer assumptions that are made the better.gtThe application of the principle often shifts the burden of proof in a discussion.  The razor states that one should proceed to simpler theories until simplicity can be traded for greater explanatory power. The simplest available theory need not be most accurate. Philosophers also point out that the exact meaning of simplest may be nuanced. gtSolomonoffs theory of inductive inference is a mathematically formalized Occams Razor       shorter computable theories have more weight when calculating the probability of the next observation using all computable theories which perfectly describe previous observations.gtgtImage i  The motions of the sun moon and other solar system planets can be calculated using a geocentric model the earth is at the center or using a heliocentric model the sun is at the center. Both work but the geocentric system requires many more assumptions than the heliocentric system which has only seven.

I cannot attempt to diagnose you but I very strongly suggest talking to a mental health professional about this.  You probably dont want to but it makes sense to be sure right?  In particular thisgtI almost accepted this thought when a random person riding a bike turned his head to me and laughed at me. Not a friendly smile but more like a haha! Youll never really find out the secrets of lifesmile.This is basically the definition of a delusion in schizophrenia especially with the religiosity.gt...someone turning his head and instantly making eyecontact with me seemed impossible.Because well... it was.gtThen it came back to me. I remembered. I knew god excisted just not as that man with the beard sitting on a cloud...  This could be mania in bipolar or an epiphany in schizophrenia.  I dont know enough to pick.gtThen i became aware everyone that was walking biking driving turned their head to me. EVERYONE out there was looking at me. It was pretty busy so there mustve been at least hundred people. This time no one was smiling everyone was dead serious. I was scared.The delusion went from grandiose to paranoid.Another thing to mentiongtIm a year old mans is the typical age of onset for males.  So there are a lot of things here that rationally point to the possibility that there is something really happening that you should get checked out.I know its a tough pill to swallow but please go see someone about this experience.  I and others here want to make sure you are okay.  Please let me know what you think and if we can help.And I forgot to add!  Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder doesnt mean that youre crazy or have multiple personalities.  Its just some symptoms that you experience and take more effort and expert care to treat and understand.  There is nothing wrong with what you have experienced and how you feel but you should be able to understand where these experiences come from and what the best way to respond to them may be.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ciq75c3,24,t5_2tcwa

1864767,0,t3_2foy2a,This called the disappearing car phenomenon. It is very common.  Ive had it happen to me but I was never able to see who was driving. It usually happens at night and all you see are the headlights on a road where there is nowhere to turn. No driveways and no roads intersecting. Then suddenly the headlights are gone. You come to a stop sign or red light and the car doesnt pull up meaning its not someone whose headlights went out. Also it happens too often to be people having headlight trouble. No one knows what it is or why it happens but some people think these are the ghosts of people who have died in car crashes reliving the events that led to their crash.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ckdwdcr,1,t5_2tcwa

I work at a university and I can tell you that teaching is a special skill people who are really good at it are hard to find.  When I was in uni we had a visiting professor from MIT teaching calculus.  He walked in the first day of class said this is a simple subjectwell cover it in two weeks.  We did.  We all understood it. He had exceptional teaching skills he could anticipate where his students would make errors and knew what was essential and what was not.He also taught me something interesting because I was considered backward in maths too that arithmetic and mathematics arent the same subject. Arithmetic is calculation mathematics is logic.  Im terrible at calculation but I have a very clear understanding of matrix algebra.Do you knit or sew?

My  entire right leg swelled up had to go to the ER and then had to use crutches for a week and was unable to drive. I now have to carry an epipen because if I am ever stung again there is a possibility that I will have a complete anaphylactic reaction. I had a red dot on the bottom of my right foot for years from the bee sting. It is now on my left foot. For years whenever anyone asked me why I carried an epipen I explained and would show them the red mark on the bottom of my right foot. Then one time while dating someone seminew the subject came up. I explained and pulled off my shoe to show him. No red mark. I thought Well shit I guess it finally faded! Later that week I was giving me myself a pedicure and the red mark is now on the bottom of my left foot. So I dont know wtf is going on but if it is any comfort I  believe you.

1984512,0,t3_2hfmb8,Am I the only one who thinks this is the bestmost interesting story Ive ever read on this sub? Anyway OP lots of people are encouraging you to tell her the story and I somewhat agree. Youve really got nothing to lose since you already said you can just stop going to that store. So if she thinks youre a weirdonutcase you dont have to see her again. HOWEVER. I have to assume this girl is rather attractive. After all you said shes the ideal person you made up in your imagination so shes probably going to be pretty. Given that shes probably used to strange men hitting on her. If you decide you want to talk to her about this youll have to be extra clear that you arent coming on to her and have no intention of doing so in the future. My advice is say to her something like hey remember when I said I recognized you? Well I figured out where from. The story is really bizarre and you probably wont believe it but can you give me half an hour of your time after work one day this week to tell you? Ill gladly buy you lunchdinner in return not as a date or anything like that just a kind of meeting. I have a girlfriend and I promise I wont do anything to make you uncomfortable and you can leave anytime you want.That should get her interest. I also recommend telling your girlfriend. Maybe she could even be present when you tell Sarah everything which would add another layer of comfort for Sarah. Be gentle and remind your girlfriend that you love her and just because this strange imaginary friend situation came up doesnt mean anything changed. Whatever you decide to do good luck and thanks for such a great story! ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,cksc1fr,10,t5_2tcwa

2058834,0,t3_2i5q2a,Listen. I am not sure whether you or anybody has EVER been able to see the future let alone if time travel or any of it is possible... BUT I have to say that I do experience waking sometimes intense DeJa Vu. Never had it from any type of dream. More like I would be somewhere sometime somehow and just KNEW that this had happened before. The feeling is usually short lasting. Some of the time afterwards I can actually remember that it had actually happened before but not becuase of some time loop but becuase it was simply something that Now about these dreams of yours. I have this Theory and of course its just something that I came up with long ago to explain some of the stuff I had read about that is basically similar to what you are describing.So here it is. Is it at all possible that you simply had a dream any dream about anything and maybe out of all the dreams that you have that you dont even remember all of them.They say that people dont remember all of the dreams they have and how could they know anywaySo you like others have dreams. But for some reason becuase of some strange way that your brain is wiredand maybe even your fathers that your perceptions instead of being processed from immediate thought that they bypass this and flow through the part of your brain that is responsible for dreaming and memory. So that you actually think that what you are experiencing at that moment was a memory from a dream first.Basically this is what Deja vu is an atthemoment experience that is also linked to a memory. Except in your case it is also linked to a dream. Now before that exact moment perhaps you never actually had a dream about what is occurring but since it is now linked together it is as if it had been there all along. Kind of like a retroactive memory. Now I know what you are saying you knew something that had happened first but there were times where you told someone so there is their proof that you did in fact know it.  I cant exactly account for everything. I can say that us what we experience is delayed by a brief moment in time. What we see and hear actually have already happened before we are aware of it simply becuase it takes a moment for our brains to process things. This is a fact and I have watched some documentaries on it. So maybe somehow your brain can process things sometimes faster than other people that are with you and by the that time you can relay it to them it seems like you already knew it becuase in a way you kind of did. Of course this would only be moments not like  minutes before.Het its not a perfect theory but to me it seems less scary than the alternative right?,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,cl1iu1h,1,t5_2tcwa

2264210,0,t1_clrijcu,Good points! I think I was a little imprecise in some of what I wrote. By very easily I really mean that there is a more likel mundane explanation rather than the seemingly extremely unlikely possibility of the laws of physics unravelling.I think the key point there is that while a lot of mundane explanations dont perfectly fit the reselling of the even I also think that the events are retold in a someway sensationalised fashion that may in itself not be reliable. Thats not to say the posters are deliberately making things up but in their confusion it could be easy to accentuate certain details and miss other clues. By false memory I dont necessarily mean an entirely fabricated memory although this is very possible especially when the event took place a long time ago or while under the influence of drugsmedicinealcoholsleepsleep deprivation. What I think is more likely and probabl very common is the general trend of an already questionable interpretation of an event being laid down as memory and slowly distorted and accentuated over time and countless recollections and rememberings. ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,clrkr3x,1,t5_2tcwa

He said the youngest would babble in her sleep from around  mos old. The kid was preverbal in her native tongue English but would wake up babbling nonsense in the middle of the night. Being a prof of cultural anthro he had some linguist friends and had her babbling analyzed. She was speaking perfect Polish. No one that the child had been around knew or spoke polish. No one in this kids life knew polish. This was when his daughter couldnt even speak English yet. The infant was screaming in terror apparently about her family being killed.

2536816,0,t3_2oqjts,It seems that in some glitches like that it patches as soon as the experimenter realizes that something is off. I experienced something like this once with a small mechanical clock that I had and which I used as an alarm clock. It was very convenient but after a few weeks  the permanent ticking pissed me off and prevented me from sleeping. I removed the battery and put away the clock on a shelf in the room and brushed it off.A few months later I was taking a nap and I was woken up by the ticking. At the time it did not seem to me unusual since I completely forgot that I had removed the battery. So I got up and I remained a few minutes about  minutes always with the ticking of the clock echoing in the room. Then I thought shit I hate this ticking I should remove the battery. And there I remembered that I had already removed the battery for several months already. As soon as that thought crossed my mind the ticking has stopped. I rushed to check on the clock and for sure there was no battery inside.It looks like the reality fits our beliefs or sometimes our very deepest wishes under certain unknown conditions. As cases or certain OP find themselves running out of fuel on a remote road and stumble upon a gas station out of nowhere.There are many cases like that. I also read a glitch where a guy  wanted to take the elevator but the two lifts available were already crowded. he wondered how to do and there a lift materialized right between the elevators. He rode the elevator and took him to his floor without pressing a button. HereOP thought the mouse was connected to his computer and the mouse worked normally.

Reality is the sun rises every morning. Theyre both true from a certain perspective but reality is usually the simpler version and what is perceived rather than the whole complex story.

2840083,0,t1_cnqvn6p,On the frequency illusion test and apologies for slightly derailing the direction we were going inThe difficulty is that it has to be a test of things people have noticed and its hard to test for noticing without tipping them off. We want a single exposure which makes an impression followed by a test of how frequent things seem. Its almost as if we need to be more manipulative about introducing it so they dont know the initial introduction of the idea is even part of the experiment. Create an event in their everyday lives. But that makes it very hard to control for other aspects.This is sounding very Derren Brown actually...Perhaps we have them all go and see a play and in the middle of the play we have an event happen involving a particular object  an apparently unintentional accident with a prop say. Then when they come and do the experiment over several sessions we have texts or video where we know this object or idea is no less prominent than any other they report on the content.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,cnqwwto,2,t5_2tcwa

So many other reasons but they are difficult to fully explain with just words.  Its hard for the living to let go of guilt but know that if you loved your cousin not saying hi to him when u saw him prob had no effect on his knowledge of this. He was having fun with his friends. Also being that he was taken in the way he was taken there is a decent chance he is lingering around his house so go to his room and talk to him tell him of the love you have and try and help him let go of his human life and experience what he has with good loving intentions it is easy for children to get lonely and trapped in that emotion in a physical body if he is still hanging out in spirit form without someone letting him know he is not lost and no one is angry with him for his mistake he could have a hard time staying positive and not haunting the people who he held close.

3461166,0,t1_cpmsml3,gtWe are a type of receiver for this energy to flow to and through and we can direct it in the ways we want which is why our thoughts create the worlds we live inI think were going to shift from seeing ourselves as bodies in the world and to whatever it is that is aware. Experiences and thoughts leave traces which inform subsequent experiences and thoughts I reckon so you do end up with a sort of selfstabilising experiential worldBasically directed thinking is equivalent to mindformatting. This is not the same as thinkingabout though which is pondering stuff. Rather this is about adopting a stperson experience equivalent to normal experience and having it set a goal for you as a result. The feedback loop then makes it impossible strictly speaking to say whether you have adjusted the world or adjusted yourself to you they are the same thing.gtp.s that Neville Goddard stuff is interesting I have thought like this for a long time!Hes got an interesting take on it. If nothing else its thoughtprovoking. And if you ponder a bit what the extreme version of it would be... what if you fully visualise and dont come back...gtp.p.s do you like scifi?Yeah much. Its great for getting the mind going on more abstract topics.

Then the event will happen and the dream will instantly pop in my head. I dont know how or why it happens but it seems to say that our brains can do more than we think. Perhaps your brain gave your conscious mind the information about the future and gave you the opportunity to change it. The movie Edge of Tomorrow in case you havent seen it is about a soldier who gains the power to redo the day. But only if he dies. The exact same things happen but he knows what will come and can change the outcome. Maybe it was something similar to that.

3644135,0,t3_323rea,The Looney Tunes thing is easily explained. For starters early cartoon often had names that reflected the music. Disney had Silly Symphonies and a lot of the Looney Tunes branded cartoons are under the name Merrie Melodies. It was a naming device that was a product of its time that seems weird in modern day so we insert our modern perspective into the equation. The term toon didnt really rise to prominence until Who Framed Roger Rabbit? in . After that it became commonplace to refer to cartoons as toons. And I think a lot of people get Looney Tunes confused with Tiny Toons which does use the toon spelling even though its supposed to be a quasispinoff of Looney Tunes. The show is actually called Tiny Toon Adventures which is probably why the spelling is changed. And each spelling represents a different type of brand which is dependent on the culture of the time period they were conceived in. Looney Tunes as a brand represents a collection of cartoon shorts created by Warner Bros. Some of these shorts dont even feature any of the characters that now call the Looney Tunes even though thats an incorrect way to refer to those characters. If you notice WB will always refer to them with terms like the Looney Tunes gang since that title does not describe the characters it describes the cartoons themselves because when those cartoons first came out that was the naming style. Think of it as outdated slang that we dont understand. We think of it as Looney Toons because we know a toon is short for cartoon but thats modern slang. Audience back in the day would know that it was a cartoon even though it was titled like it was a song. Meanwhile Tiny Toon Adventures came out in the s after the term toon became common and it helped perpetuate the use of the word toon since the characters in the show openly referred to themselves as toons. And since that show is so closely related to Looney Tunes its easy to see how so many people have retroactively applied the word toon over tune since the former makes more sense to a modern audience. To muck things up even further the movie Space Jam came out even later and made a habit of referring to the team of Looney Tunes characters as the Tune Squad. Which again to a modern audience sounds like Toon Squad but if you check the jerseys its spelled Tune Squad. And I know this isnt something that was glitched later on because I remember have Space Jam toys as a kid with the spelling Tune Squad on them. I distinctly remember this because I thought the jerseys said Time Squad and I hadnt seen the movie yet so I thought maybe there was some sort of time travel storyline and was later disappointed when I saw a clear picture of the jersey and realized it Tune Squad. So there you have it. If there is an alternate universe out there featuring the Looney Toons then I have never been a part of it at least. Which makes you a guest in my home. Welcome. Please dont mess things up while youre here please and thank you. ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,cq7npg1,4,t5_2tcwa

3839626,0,t3_34e7mp,Smells are known to bring back memories that are associated with them which explains why you remembered the nightmare once you got to the bottom of the stairs. From that point onwards you were expecting certain things to happen so that they would correlate with the events of your nightmare namely your dad standing at the stove eating bacon and your stepmum sewing and talking about a craftshow. You say yourself though that you realise that this scene is normal for the weekend and you wouldnt have thought about it twice about it if it werent for the memory of your dream. Its interesting that you believe that your stepmum spoke the exact same words as in your nightmare but this I would attribute to your expecting to remember the words that she spoke. Either that particular craftshow was something that you already knew of prior to the nightmare or it was not uncommon at the time for your stepmum to be going toproducing for craftshows in general. If you really expect a particular interaction to take place then you can believe that the interaction that does actually happen correlates with what you expected even if you couldnt predict it beforehand beyond feeling that you could. Like a false memory I suppose. Its really a testament to the power that our subconscious holds its pretty cool.Your going to the watercooler and saying good morning was something that even at the time you were consciously aware that you felt you were supposed to do sounds like you kind of did it in autopilot.

In about the middle of April I heard on the radio that BB King had died I thought they said at the hospital but it could have been a hospice.  I wrongly believed BB King wrote and sang Stand By Me one of my favorite songs so I thought Oh no the SBM guy died...  Anyway I looked up more info on BB King and found out who he really was.  I felt kind of bad I didnt know more.  I also learned that the SBM singer and composer along with someone else was a guy named Ben E. King.  So then on April th I hear that Ben E King also died and thought Weird  the guy I originally thought died now has died.  And then of course on May th I hear AGAIN that B.B. King had died in Las Vegas and I was stunned but not as stunned as I would be if I hadnt had plenty of Mandela Effect experiences already. I dont know why more people werent shocked and surprised to hear of B.B. Kings second death but am glad Im not alone.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,crh87p8,1,t5_2tcwa

4529521,0,t1_ct1fku0,I guess I can now officially say that Im in that rabbithole as well. Yes I suppose that Mandela Effect theory is related to the world manifested from our intrinsic thoughts. Essentially this world is not quite what it seems and we are able to affect it with certain types of thoughts and intentions. Thus things that we think are permanent like the past might actually be quite changeable.I thought chartreuse was reddishpinkish as well. Im not a color person but if you had asked me thats what I would have said. Chartreuse as green just seems wrong. And thats really really interesting about your mother now hating the color. If some reality shift occured it totally makes sense that her subconscious affinity for the reddish color would remain while the fact of the colors definition would change around her and us for whatever reason. Btw have you seen the film Dark City? Was just thinking about it today. In it peoples entire memories and physical lives are changed each night but one man seems to remember bits and pieces knowing something is not right.So this is where Im at with all this First The NDEQuantum Jump theories makes sense. Weve somehow slid into a parallel close universe. However the theories dont quite address why a large group of people seem to share the same Mandela Effect variances. This might be explained by assuming either  a massive disaster occurred and we all slid together into this chartreuse green reality or  we slid individually at different times but came to a common second universe.Im not sure how or why Option  would occur. Sliding at different times would create major discontinuities in our personal timelines. Unless our memories were retconned to fit the new reality.Option  doesnt quite explain why only some people seem affected. Unless only a portion of the population was killed and jumped together. OR everyone slid but only some remember.Second Reality has been fading and is being recontructed by the new generation. If more old people experience Mandela Effects than young people then this could be it.Third Some massive reality shift occured but only certain people remember it. So we didnt slide but something changed reality around us  either occult human or cosmic influence. Under this theory some people remember the old world due to some common characteristic or characteristics. Possible characterstics include selfawareness level spiritual enlightenment physiological age andor Near Death Experiences.I hope you dont feel alone in all this. Its pretty weird but Im going through it as well along with many others. Keep me posted with anything you find. ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ct1kyhp,1,t5_2tcwa

It is a very rational explanation. While you are correct that I never recorded it happening I have in fact done some tests. I have distinctly put things in one specific place and when this happen they are in a different place. Such is the case of the rolling pen and the lighter.According to some research in this not MY research but that of experts it would be far more difficult to move something with your mind when you are actually trying to do so. Most of the research on this suggests that when these things happen if really caused by some sort of telekinesis that it is more likely to happen when the person is not conscious about it. It usually happens when they are not thinking about it or trying to do anything. Its not like on TV amp movies where the actor makes funny faces and stares at something or points his hands at it and weird sounds play in the background.

5003267,0,t1_cuoru1s,Some related thoughts perhaps they might be useful Something to maybe notice when you are out and about vs at home how expanded or contracted is your attention? If you were to think of your ongoing experience as a vast imagination room would your attention be localised around your body or head or would it be open and full and at the outer reaches?Expanding your sense of presence to fill the entire space of your body and then the room and then beyond is a great way to feel alive and open and better I have found.And although it may be somewhat daunting at first it can be enormously  helpful to expand this space out when you are interacting with other people. Its counterintuitive surely youd want to protect yourself by withdrawing from them? but including other people the whole room even in your presence dissolves them within you makes them part of you and under your experiential control. It means they are not other and not a threat and you pick up full information from them.I feel a large component of social anxiety eventually arises from the issue of being disconnected from your surroundings. Other people without realising it literally share space when they interact and automatically feel each other out in a sort of direct knowing this is the true nature of empathy. To the person who has accidentally withdrawn from that situations involving other people become confusing  because they have one of their sense turned off.An additional trick related to this is to centre your attention lightly in your lower abdomen area when you are interacting with other people and even just living life generally actually. This location is where the feltsense resides that global summary of a situation. This is where people connect. It also tends to spontaneously open out your attention make you feel more spacious and here for free.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,cup2xnt,3,t5_2tcwa

5304543,0,t1_cvppiu2,One day my middle schooler and I walked into our VERY locked up apartment only to find that Christmas had come early. There were boxes and boxes of kid stuff toys books different colored organizers for kid stuff a bike and one of those kid electric motorcycles and kitchen supplies for me. It was such a wonderful experience. I have always been a single parent and NO ONE had the key to the apartment except me. The owner lived  states away and went through a management company that only had interest in collecting rent on time. Not only that but the management company would never do a breaking and entering thing in a tenants apartment. I asked around to all my neighbors if they had done it or saw someone come into my place... and of course I got a LOT of strange looks. No one knew a darn thing. Wasnt dating anyone at the time either so it simply made NO sense at all. I just chalked it up to someone looking out for me and the kid... maybe an angel or something ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,cvpptsq,2,t5_2tcwa

A few months ago I told my story on the Jim Harold Campfire podcast but to be honest I was soooooo nervous and probably sound like a rambling idiot Im a terrible storyteller verbally. I still havent brought myself to listen to it because Im afraid Ill just be cringing the entire time. But its out there if anyone wants to listen. I think its pretty much the same stories as here.Another thing that happened very oftenx a week if I had to guess before I moved out and we did the recordings and before N told me about the ghost dog is Id feel what felt like my cat crawling under my covers to snuggle up to me. But my cat would be sleeping on my pillow. The lady who did the cleansings and also told me what N saw mightve been menehune.... she was a wiccan priestess and also happened to be one of the security guards at the condos speculated it was the ghost dogs wanting to cuddle up.One of the last things that happened during my time there was when my friend was spending the night. I went into the living room to turn the AC on and was attacked grabbed from behind like when someone sneaks up on you from behind grabs your shoulders and says boo!

Its kind of like the symptoms of paranoia are all felt by people once in a while in small amounts especially in certain circumstances but when paranoia presents as a disorder it affects daily functioning for the individual experiencing it. So just remember that its still a real disorder.If you want to look at a disorder that is bogus I would say ODD is bogus but thats just my opinion a disorder for refusing to listening authority?

6282885,0,t1_cz2dvnz,You say this very likely with tongue in cheek but its not actually untrue.  I was also a secretary of sorts for about a decade in a very high security setting.  Our email addresses werent common knowledge.  Our offices were behind six different number codes and our computers were on two tiers each with their own everchanging passwords.  Everything in the office was opened in the morning and relocked up again in the evening behind combination locks.  You didnt accidentally access anything and when something screwed up it caused all manner of havoc.  In this setting that my computer would periodically choose to go entirely offline.  When I say that I mean it refused to even acknowledge the entire system right back to the central agency.  It lost trust in the system. The components in my system would fry at a higher rate than my colleagues.  We had a particularly bad spate of electronics burning upout in  when they started building a couple of new blocks of flats behind our building.  The land was purported to be old witches magic ground where the witches of old cast and sealed spirits in the bedrock.  This entire area is basically a huge lump of granite.  The started blasting away the rock to build the foundations for the buildings and it wasnt long before computers and other home electronics as well as cars were presenting all sorts of glitches and malfunctions including outright dying for no reason whatsoever.  Car alarms went off almost constantly so much so that the birds in the area copied the sounds with varying degrees of success. DI had started to suspect something when I saw a strange fluorescent green light around our computers one night when I woke up at a stupid hour and went to see what was happening in the world online.  There was just this strange smallish green light by the speakers.  I thought it was a little strange so I watched it and it just slowly faded away.  It was only a matter of some days afterward that that particular computer died.  Two laptops followed as did the clothes dryer.    A couple of months on from that time I again woke up during the wee hours to use the loo.  I went into the hallway and glanced toward the end of the hall.  There was that same greenish glow in the corner of the ceiling.  There is nothing there that would either produce or reflect such a light.  Its a dark corner.  But there it was.  I went to do my business and came back into the hallway.  The light was still there.  Gremlins.  That was my conclusion as well.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,cz3skl2,7,t5_2tcwa
6289226,0,t1_cz3skl2,gt The land was purported to be old witches magic ground where the witches of old cast and sealed spirits in the bedrockThis probably has little to do with the phenomenon you experienced. gt This entire area is basically a huge lump of granite.This however is more likely related because granite is an igneous rock with at least  quartz and up to  alkali feldspar by volumeThey blew up a huge rock that is at least  quartz.Quartz is a very special mineral. It exhibits piezoelectricity basically it generates electricity when enough physical pressure is applied. This is why quartz is used in so many everyday objects like wristwatches clocks radios computers and cellphones. Quartz crystals are also found inside test and measurement equipment such as counters signal generators and oscilloscopes.Im unsure of exactly how this would affect your computers but it makes complete logical sense that if you destroy that much of a piezoelectric material especially one so crucial to technology some electrical interference is going to occur.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,cz4iios,1,t5_2tcwa

6555394,0,t1_czxd6pu,When you think back about something youre scanning your brain as it is in its current state. People never remember things exactly as they happened people always have their own interpretations of events even if they were both there at the same time. Thoughts change over time and ARE influenced by proceeding events. People having eureka moments after they find something out about someone if often just fabricated thoughts. i.e. John cheated on Jane Oh yeah I just realised that he was looking at me with sex eyes the other night  Odds are that John was not looking at you with sex eyes. If peoples brains work like this ordinarily then traumatic events are going to invent all kinds of messed up thoughts.

7710078,0,t3_4kv64n,One time my phone said missed call I dont usually call unknown numbers back. I texted the number back saying Who is this? This number tried to reach me?. I get a response back saying What do you mean? You called me. I checked outgoing nothing I insisted that I didnt call the number irritated. The person sends me a screen print of his phone with his incoming and outgoing and it showed I did indeed call that person but I can tell you with  certainty I made no such call. I have not had missed calls from unknown numbers in a couple months. I wonder sometimes if a forcelife whatever tries to connect people for certain reasons unknown. I used to have Facebook and one time I got a random friend request from a profile of a person I didnt know. I looked at the profile took note of what the person looked like where it said they were from the name. The person was from a different state school I have never heard of or been to. I usually delete them but I sent a message saying I see you have sent me a request but I do not know you sorry crazy people out there. Well I kept the request as pending incase it was maybe some type of joke or someone I know using a fake profile and the next day it was gone. Two weeks later I get a reply to the message it was a very inappropriate one but the name was different profile was different pictures were different name was different. I said Your account is fake I remember your profile from two weeks ago you had a different name and pictures same details youre playing a fake game. The women replies What are you talking about? I didnt change anything. This went back and fourth and honestly the person sounded genuine but I know for a fact everything was different. At this point I was very confused clearly this person had to be lying but the account was older than two weeks and the timeline went back far. I just was so confused. This person though was a mess she was asking for pictures of me and sending some of herself and I was mad at this point because I couldnt believe somebody had the audacity to do this online like it was any other day. Sure I could have blocked the person and been done with it but I thought this person needed help so I said How can you do this online dont you have any selfworth? She then replies I have had intercourse with over  men. Being a person of morality I said I do not understand that but it sounds like you have been hurt badly in your life and I think you should find a church and get some good friends and despite that number you can still come to God. There was some more but  minutes later no more replies the account goes dead no longer found every message she sent gone as well errored out by Facebook. I figured the account was fully deleted which made me wonder how many people would have done what I did and actually tried to help. What if the person deleted the account and quit her habits and eventually changed for the better? I was disturbed by all of that and got rid of my Facebook months later.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,d3il1oe,1,t5_2tcwa

It was dark but I could still see some stuff in the back seat city lights in the distance and all the sensations of tongues and hands were so vivid that I awoke truly feeling like it happened.So eventually when I started dating in high school I didnt feel like a total nb when it was time to do it for real but I did note that it was a lot less squishy than I had thought.Fast forward  years later after high school Im at work and get asked out on a date by someone I used to know.  After dinner amp a movie we drive out to a cliche lookoutpoint that I didnt even know existed in my town and all of a sudden BAM Im in massive dejavu land.  The darkness the stuff in the back the extrasquishy tongue... my first kiss again after dozens of others in between.

Where have you been? she demanded. I was flabbergasted.I could not understand how she appeared suddenly on the stairs and how I could have missed her leaving the girls restroom! Whats more even if we say that I was leaning against the wall in a drunken stupor and a drug haze of confusion which I wasnt my body was certainly there even if my mind was not! How could it be then that Brenda did not see me there when she walked out of the girls room?At this point we both agreed that we needed a drink. We got a table in the bar and sat down and ordered a beer. Then we talked about what had just transpired each one relaying our own perspective of the events. You already know my story. Now listen to what Brenda had to say about what had just happenedI went into the girls room and had to wait to get into one of the two stalls. After waiting a while I went inside and did my business. Then I walked over to the bathroom mirror so I could fix my hair. However the whole girls room was crowded and I had to wait in line to get to the mirror. Girls were talking chatting about this and that doing lines of coke and adjusting their hair and makeup while I waited for my turn. So finally I finished all the things I wanted to do and walked out expecting to see you waiting for me.I was a little surprised when you were not there. Because I knew that I was in the womens room longer than you were in the mens room. But at first I figured that maybe for whatever reason you were just taking an unusually long time in there. So I waited for a few minutes before I got concerned. I asked someone coming out of the mens room if they saw a handsome guy in there with long curly brown hair. He said no theres no one like that in there. Just some uglylooking dude. Sorry  I  couldnt resist that joke.I thought that was not like you to leave the restroom and not wait for me. So I went upstairs and looked around the restaurant walking by all the tables looking for you. A waitress asked if she could help me and I said No Im just looking for my boyfriend. Then I walked out on the deck looking for you but you werent there.Finally I checked the bar to see if you were in there but you werent. Thats when I walked downstairs and when I reached the landing I saw you over against the wall by the door of the mens room. Thats when I was surprised and asked you Where have you been?

8839385,0,t1_d7a799e,I have an idea about this sort of thing. The way people respond to things online particularly on social media is more about the message that they want to send about themselves at least subconsciously. Out of  people just making up that number who express outraged offense over something like this I think maybe  person is very offended. I suspect that for the other  it has more to do with those persons wanting to show their virtue by showing offense. It signals their virtue and their belonging in a certain portion of the population who share certain ideas when they give someone else a stern lecture about their unsavory behavior or word use. Edit to add I am not stating that this is a fact. It is an idea that I have and it is also how I perceive people when they respond this way. ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,d7adagc,-1,t5_2tcwa

Now I dont often wear makeup so when I do purchase some its a special rare treat for myself i have MS and had to give up work so moneys tight. Yesterday I was due to go out for a cheese and nibbles evening at an event to raise awareness of MS. So  I planned on slapping on the works! Well bugger me if i cant find my eyeliner hairspray and eyeshadow palette. I turned my room upside down had drawers out etc until the room looked like it had been ransacked by a burglar. No sign of them. Now  my  year old daughter had moved back home a year ago and always lectured me on the importance of of privacy and to NEVER go into her room without asking first.  Ok I thought a bit arsey but hey ho. Last night I thought hey why not borrow some of hers Ill be careful and replace the items in exactly the same place and no harm done. So like a ninja in the night I creep in.  Well well well guess what I find? Yup all my sodding make up from the past year that mysteriously disappeared. I have instructed my husband to fit a lock on our bedroom door and am spending today whilst shes at work moving everything in her room onto different shelves and different drawers she has mild OCD.

I just stand there still for a handful of seconds then resume my work is typical for absence seizures which can come with hallucinations as well. Im not a doctor myself but I have been diagnosed for epilepsy some time ago and I remember the doctor asking me and my family numerous times if I had the same kind of weird behavior when I would suddenly stop what I was doing stare blankly into space and them resume like nothing happened.

Also you might not remember but were there any deaths in the neighborhood at that time? That you can find?If thats not it  and I always try to provide at least one other theory if not a few because hell who knows?  and it was indeed Uncle Dave then it may have been a phenomenon called an unintelligent haunting which is when an event in the past repeats itself in the present. Its basically the same as digital ghosting  except with real ghosts. Which ironically enough IS actually digital ghosting as well within a Matrixverse. Or in much shorter terms you were seeing a previous sight of the girls uncle washing the car in the driveway. Then eventually spacetime righted itself and the instance and all traces of it disappeared within the current timeline....Of course it couldve been a warped perception due to sunlight and eye health and a neuron misfire and the anxiety you mentioned  but thats not what this forum is really about. LOL Well sort of  but given my personal lifereality model I prefer to conjecture in stranger more metaphisical terms. PLet me know what you think!

9352372,0,t1_d8zyj15,that would actually be the easiest theory.  Stan Berenstains parents immigrated to the U.S. in the early s.  I dont recall the exact year but it was around  or so.  When they got here the immigration officer gave them the name Berenstain as it most closely resembled the phonetic spelling of their last name which was hard to understand as they didnt speak English.  He could have just as easily spelled it with an E instead of an A that day when writing it down on paper.   If the same thing happened  times he could probably spell it with an A  times and with an E  times. This was researched a few years ago by the crackpots on the internet.  The account of how the very unusual Berenstain name came into being instead of the normal spelling of Berenstein came from an old interview with the son of Jan and Stan Berenstain himself.   Their name really was pronounced Berenstein at the time but their foreign accents when telling the immigration officer their name ended in him spelling it with an A. ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,d91hb7o,2,t5_2tcwa

9509744,0,t1_d9l98mu,Although we cant link cause and effect your story sounds spookily similar to mine. The key feature is powerful bottled up emotions which coincide with unexpected results. Speaking of football I remember watching football highlights with a friend of mine where a goalkeeper for Blackburn scored in injury time to get his side a draw. I remember being quite excited about this and discussed this with my friend. A few days later I played football with the same friend as part of a team against a rival team. I dont normally play goalkeeper but I did as the normal goalie was missing. The football pitches were  a side astroturf where the goalposts are about half the size of normal ones so it was much harder to score. My team was winning and in the last few minutes we got a corner and I remembered the goalkeeper scoring on tv so I decided to go up. I was standing outside the penalty area when the ball was crossed in my direction. I realised that I didnt have much time so just swung my foot at it. Time seemed to go into slow motion and I managed to catch it with my left foot which is my weaker foot. I could see the ball drifting into the net whilst everyone else including the rival goalkeeper looked like they were frozen in time and place. It was only after the ball went in that I heard my team cheer. My friend then reminded me of the Blackburn goalkeeper who scored on tv.Maybe we can generate positive or negative emotions in our lives and the universe God or something else out there law of attraction? can pick up our energy and direct it to the desired outcome. My mum once won the lottery using a very similar strategy as she really needed the money to build our house.,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,d9la0hu,1,t5_2tcwa

9712280,0,t1_da9on1h,Thanks for all your explanation. Your story is something I would like to experience since it would be like a more realistic dream and I always try to break the dream. Ever seen Rick and Morty? Theres an episode that they try to break a simulation by overloading it. I would have tried to see how long I could go until the world buffered. Dreams also buffer. If you havent seen Inception people stare at you when they know you shouldnt be there. Lucid dreaming is something to really get into. I do it all the time. I recommend sleeping during the day when its hot after taking like vitamins or something good for lucid dreaming I think B or something like that. Its not necessary just helps if youre new. Heat and light causes hallucinations like in the desert. It makes your dreams a lot more in your face. Another trick is to set a ton of alarms. I have  alarms from  am to noon when I have to get up. Only sleeping an hour at a time forces your brain to stay conscious allowing for more control in your dreams. Look for the thing I mentioned. Question if you can see your feet. If I cant see my feet Im dreaming so I jump and gravity is too light allowing flight. Flying too high causes the dream to buffer and looking too far you see the unloaded void and can get a nose bleed. Just try it out. Get a totem something to let you know youre dreaming. Try spinning in your dream to load the world around you and give you more time to focus. I highly recommend it. Its a whole different adventure. ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,daa8xrk,1,t5_2tcwa

My best friend and bf are putting my sons into these foreign girl car seats in the back. Where the fuck did these girl car seats come from? They dont even care and just continue putting them in. I look at the dash and everything is just wrong. I say Guys this is not my car. What are you talking about yes it isNo its not!!! Why are there girl car seats? And every thing is all wrong? Babe this is your car. To which friend looks at me like Im crazy. Kay this is your car. No its notYes it isI flip the fuck out. Run inside. I look back and see that my plate is missing that says my name on it and then I really feel crazy. I felt like I was getting erased or something. I dont know I just knew it wasnt my car. So I Call  and tell them Im going crazy. My boyfriend and best friend are telling me this car is my car when I know it isnt!!!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend runs in and says I know whats wrong its ok its not your car. Realize that our car is parked in the back and it was our friends car who just happened to be over getting a tatoo from my bfs other friend. And I even looked straight at him when I ran back in the house but I was too crazy by that time it didnt click in my mind. I was more crazy just because my bf and best friend kept trying to tell me it was my car. Made me feel like I was insane. Anyway the  operator just ended up laughing at me and told me to call back if I needed them. Lol happy ending but I seriously felt like I was on Flight Plan or The Forgotten. Also was at Wal Mart with my friend. We go to the car before her mom. Open the door and theres a dog laying there. My friend says Oh wow my mom got me a puppyShe is excited. The dog just looks at us like were crazy. I think why would her mom just go out and get her a old fucking dog? Instead of a actual puppy? And when would she have had time?

Right when I was getting to the part where she realizes that her best friendsister is dead and I was getting all tearyeyed my phone rings and its my mum calling from the hospital to say that they were there with my sister and really concerned about some type of health emergency not asthma.After my mum hung up my boyfriend sat me down at my lap top and said Let your sister LIVE!I was laughing but really freaked out about it. I did let the sister live in the novel.At another point in the same book I had the sister get into a really big fight with her boyfriend and she ran off and he couldnt find it. About ten minutes after writing it I get a call my from sisters husband FREAKING OUT! They had had a big fight and she drove off and her couldnt find her.My sister bugged me after that to write up some really awesome money related situations for the sister..,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,dbkjxmy,2,t5_2tcwa

Its supposed to mean a gateway or doorway to reality or something like that.Whatever it means it is a meaning of the number  so maybe research all meanings of  . .

10206109,0,t3_5ly7ob,Not to this extreme but Ive had a few of these the big part of the trick is you are actually waking up briefly just not staying awake like you think. some of what you are recalling has probably actually happened in a sleep stupor but you return to you bed and then promptly forget and your brain goes straight to dreaming that you have continued carrying out the morning routine. Thats when things start to fall apart. Its a combination of actually trying to get up when you are too tired and sleep walking. I know this only because Ive had other people tell me about my bizarre actions in this state. its not unlikely especially if you have trouble waking up and getting going on a normal day. The worst part is it can be hard to tell on your own because sometimes it just takes a while to wake up and it seems like things are a bit off then after a while you actually notice you are conscious and not just walking around pretending to be. The point is there is a possible explanation if its at all comforting.  ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,dc0x46w,2,t5_2tcwa

The alarm wasnt set and even if it had been it would have been set for am not sometime in the middle of the night. She was still up reading when it came on full blast and scared her out of her skin. The power switch on her radio was set to the off position and the volume dial was set really low. The freakiest thing was that the song that came on suddenly was calling her name Joan. I think it was my grandfather saying hello. He passed away  years before that but had made his presence known to us for years afterwards.   ,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,dc2j34l,3,t5_2tcwa

I read his beautifully illustrated How to See Fairies and in the intro he describes his encounters with the fairy realm. You might also have some luck looking up the elemental realm or th dimension. It is all pretty much the same concept but with different names. Essentially there is a world on top of ours but we cant see it. Some very special people can see the spirits that inhabit this world or even step into the world as you did. Most other people will never see or enter the fairy realm.

10715989,0,t3_5t7ac7,To answer a few questionsI dont use drugs. I do meditate daily and practice yoga. I have done so for decades. This is not the first time I have had a powerful dream like this. I have had many others throughout my life. I also experience synesthesia where I see colors and patterns when I listen to music. I also suffer from trigeminal neuralgia which is alleviated somewhat by my meditation and yoga practice.As far as controlling the fractal snowflakes? One thing that I left out of my dream description is that I had a sensation of pressure in my head. I almost always have this during one of these types of dreams. It is focused in either the center of my forehead or in my temples sometimes both. This time it was like a pinpoint of pressure nearing pain right in the center of my forehead. When I meditate I can enter a state that makes this sensation occur. In order to zoom into the fractal snowflake lattice I simply push through with the sensation. It happens in a natural way that feels completely normal. I would compare it to hopping on a bicycle again after not riding for a few years. Kind of a mental muscle memory that has resurfaced.I have felt like a different person since that night.

I do treat the migraines like bad trips now that I know what they are so I no longer freak out. I just lay down and watch the show.After my doctors determined that migraines were the culprit I talked to family members about my experiences. Turns out my dad had sparkling migraines when he was in his s as well. I guess it runs in the family.Now that I am taking antidepressants and various drugs for pain management for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and Crohns Disease seriously I won the genetic lottery hard! I rarely have the migraines. Some combination of my drugs must have the side effect of curbing the cascades. Brains are so weird.I am interested in myofascial release for all of my disorders however.

After it ended just went to sleep.The morning after my mom woke me up for school and went on to tell me that something horrible has happened in the US that a plane had crashed into a building in New York. I then thought of the documentary I saw last night and that maybe they just rerun the show again in the morning. I answered her that yeah yeah I saw that already. It was shown last night on National Geographic. She gave me the most dumbfounded look ever and told me that it happened just that morning and that it is all over the  news.I know its not even the same building but I just thought to share it.
