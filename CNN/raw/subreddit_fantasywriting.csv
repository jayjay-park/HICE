11138462,0,t3_5z0ylu,If all cells are affected by this magic then that includes the bone marrow that produces red blood cells. If the magic would allow them to massively increase their production then it would stand to reason that it would be survivable... assuming the magic would produce the energy and cellular mass to produce the cells to begin with. As a drawback to the process you could have the regeneration highly taxing on the bodys energyfood supply beyond the normal magical requirements. Creating a couple of liters of blood for a normal human takes a long time and a lot of resources. Perhaps the best way to balance the power would be to make the subject extremely weak after the procedure andor reduce the maximum amount of blood that could be regenerated based on the bodys stockpiles.,fantasywriting,deuj7q7,1,t5_2uch5
