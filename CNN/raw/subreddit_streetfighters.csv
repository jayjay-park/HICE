5126775,0,t3_3l7jr2,In my opinion a streetfighter is a sportbike with the fairings removed and a higher steer like a straight one.And usually  cylinder jap bikes.As opposed to streetfighter you have choppers vtwins with everything that is not neccecary chopped off,streetfighters,cv3yvr3,3,t5_2ro6e

6232576,0,t3_40vjdi,I went with the trail tech  inch race light as my main Headlight but I also thought about a single rigid industries Led light bar. Id recommend either for Headlight options. Im jealous about the deal you got. ,streetfighters,cyy2qv9,2,t5_2ro6e
8179809,0,t3_40ybf7,Some time agoAfter removing all the fairings things went a little funny. Without the ram air collectors providing sufficient pressure to the carbs the bike moved about  kmh  mph tops and died at headwind. So a couple of agonising days later about two months ago I solved the problem by the kleen air mod or such I took the carbs pressurisation tube from the front end and stuffed it through a tight hole into the air box and through the air filter to the clean side. After that it has worked perfectly and moves up to kmh kW and kmh kW without the fairings in contrast to  kmh kW which was the fastest I dared to ride with them on. Its also much nicer to ride her now at higer speeds as there is no terribly designed windshield creating turbulence exactly at the height of my helmet while crouching.TodayJust tore the exhaust manifold off. Outer left pipe had cracked free from the welded washer making the Kawi sound like a huge stroke S Thankfully I got a friend to weld it back on tomorrow. Im still thinking about whether to cut the final part of the pipe after  collector off and attaching cafe racerstyle twin mufflers with a Ypipe or just to switch to the deeper sounding a bit sleeker than the original carbon fiber muff. But you know double exits ARE cool.Still waiting for my salary so I wont be ordering that crash cage anytime soon due to the rent being already over a month late. Ive been looking at something like this but from Eastern Europe and red Fiance needs her computer back for Sims  so pics will be added some other time. Im planning on going to the local track some day soon to have some cool pics snapped so you might even be in for a treat next time. No promises though. Safe riding and remember atgatt! which here at rstreetfighters means a hoodie and jeans with sneakers I suppose,streetfighters,d500xce,1,t5_2ro6e
