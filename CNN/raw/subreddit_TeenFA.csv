10041483,0,t1_dbfya84,Eh I feel it can work. I do it to add something a bit more interesting to a basic outfit otherwise. Usually my jacket and shirt will be the same level and tucking in the shirt fixes that and makes the outfit more interesting imo. ,TeenFA,dbgfjq5,2,t5_37pez
10093336,0,t1_dbm58ne,Yeah I was thinking about black wooden or maybe black in silver studs. Im not sure if Ill be able to find wooden studs where I live that I like though.,TeenFA,dbn6egd,1,t5_37pez
10137442,0,t1_dbrn2jk,Sweater looks fine but it could use some different shoes.,TeenFA,dbswvd3,1,t5_37pez
10144211,0,t1_dbth87o,first one. im usually not a fan of rugged looking watches but the allwhite look works well on this watch. just make sure you have large enough wrists to wear a mm watch because it will look ridiculous if it takes up your entire wrist.,TeenFA,dbtsm54,2,t5_37pez
10185019,0,t1_dby8tbd,These rothco bombers are pretty cheap and come in a lot of sizes. Dont own one myself so I cant speak of the quality but Ive seen it mentioned quite a lot ,TeenFA,dbyj0ym,2,t5_37pez

10829596,0,t3_5uupxf,I love mine have been wearing the slim selvedge jeans pretty regularly for three years now. In that time Ive bought and sold two pairs of APC denim which I didnt like at all. This is one of the most recent pics I have of them. Honestly theyre pretty great for what you pay,TeenFA,ddwzvuh,8,t5_37pez
10830917,0,t1_ddx09k8,Ive had my current pair of slim fit  ones for  months and I only have a bit of wear on the back middle belt loop. I would love to get some nicer jeans but these do the job too damn well,TeenFA,ddx4skl,2,t5_37pez

11155578,0,t1_devp9p1,Levis comes to mind but their quality control can be all over the place. Trying something on in store will probably be best bet for finding something that fits you in the way you want it to.,TeenFA,dewh1fl,1,t5_37pez
