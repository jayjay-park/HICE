194494,0,t3_1wbi8w,Your beagle looks like ours. A lot of the same details. Also looks like a skinnysmaller  in shoulder. Like ours they tend to looks scrawny. Ours however is muscular and compact since he almost never stops moving running or trotting.I know I have the wrong word but some beagles have ticking or spots in their paws and other light colored areas. Still all beagle just not show worthy. ,beagle,cf0ldxs,3,t5_2skm8

2575975,0,t3_2p7o2c,So sorry to hear that your beautiful Pebbles is going through such a rough time.  I had a Pebbles who eventually developed pancreatic cancer.  She was my bestest friend my soul mate and Ive missed her for the last  years.  Although Ive now got another beagle Poppy Pebbles will always be in my heart forever.  Wishing you all the very best whatever you decide is right for Pebbles.  Shell always be in your heart and you obviously made her life well worth living judging by all the times she came bouncing back.  If this is the end of your time together remember just close your eyes and Pebbles will always be there smiling back at you.My thoughts are with you both during this difficult time xx ,beagle,cmutgqo,3,t5_2skm8
2585834,0,t3_2pf62z,If the ground is too cold or too hot for you to be bare foot on for more than a quick outing minutes then its too cold or too hot. Everyones tolerance is different but imagine there little paws. Additionally beagles can be out doors in the cold but they dont have a winter coat like some breeds do. They need a blanket or jacket for warmth for long durations of time. There needs to be adequate shelter from the elements and water available throughout the day. Maybe contact Seattle beagle rescue for more info even though its on the west coast. ,beagle,cmw3u6h,1,t5_2skm8

Last summer she didnt like the water at all. She wouldnt go in on her own and would fight to get to shore if I carried her out with me. Shes been far more adventurous this year.
