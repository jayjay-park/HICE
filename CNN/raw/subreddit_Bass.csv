159174,0,t1_cewejqh,I think youre asking at the wrong time.  If I were directing the band Id be a little upset that you wanted me to make all of the horns sit and wait while we work out your part too.  He may be over reacting and not telling you what to do correctly but youre still not going about asking correctly on your end either.  Id recommend trying to see him after class or see if hell help you out durring a study hall or something.If youre trying to learn jazz youre going to need some lessons provided you want to stay in the band.  If you cant get them from your band director seek outside assistance elsewhere.  Keep with it.  My jazz training is what gets me tons of gigs ranging from jazz to hard rock to childrens music. edit In reading some of your other responses let me add make sure youre bringing this stuff to your private teacher.  You mention that he helps a lot but does he know youre struggling with this stuff in particular?  Also the fact that he views his job as conducting rather than teacher brings home the point that youre asking at the wrong time.  I still suggest trying to get with him after school or in a study hall.  My high school band director wrote me passes to get out of Biology to practice pitch exercises.  Tell him you want to identify the problem parts so you can bring them to your private teacher.  He should be willing to take the time to help you then.

196879,0,t1_cf0shvj,This basic chord structure mechanics. Some songs have a very particular riff example Sweet Emotion intro which you will have to know. As far as most songs Ill just find the root or yell at your guitarist WHAT KEY? and go from there. It helps to learn your circle of fifths and fourths and to learn the basic layout of your fretboard in standard tuning. We can usually get away with more mistakes by throwing in a slide down or throwing a bad note in a quick flourish. If youre going live and need a cheat sheet. I like to use note cards with the very specific riffs that people will notice written down in large bold letters. And then the basic chord progression for the rest of the parts. ,Bass,cf0v7hg,6,t5_2qpc3

Honestly Ive never tried the vyper but from what I see on musicians friend they look like theyre guitar amps which is a big nogo.  Guitar amps are not designed to handle the massive low frequencies that bass guitars put out thats why there are bass amps.You seem to be really into effects which is awesome.  I love effects too.  But you need a good foundation for the effects to work with.  I really suggest getting a proper bass amp so youre playing through speakers designed for a bass not computer speakers. This was my first bass amp.  Theres also a smaller cheaper version or bigger versions if you choose.  What youre getting is just simple good clean tone.  As you build your skills and save some more money then you can add the effects.  Just keep in mind  your tones not gonna sound better until you have the basics covered.,Bass,cfqcjgn,2,t5_2qpc3

I grew up about  miles from the original San Diego carvin factoryshowroom and Id go there while in HS to check stuff out guitar center didnt exist here yet if you can believe that.At that time they were definitely a bargain  way cheaper comparatively than they are today vs the big names. But back then there wasnt as much offshoring or entry level brands like there are today. My first real bass amp was a PB head with a x cab I bought used out of The Reader. It was ok to my untrained ears but it was all I could afford that was new. But the basses just never grabbed me. Fast forward to now. Ive used carvin amps in rehearsal studios they seem to be a staple here and in backlines. Theyre still just ok. But the basses continue to underwhelm me  and theyre really not a bargain anymore. I own a small carvin combo that was great at first but now has a reoccurring squealing issue that the factory cant replicate. Its been repaired once and its now doing it again.

817139,0,t3_23ht10,I currently own and play through an Orange Crush BXT which is a bass amp in that line. It is superb and I can recommend it for practice and shows. It is flexible and for a solid state it has a good sound that doesnt use any emulation. I will say that I use a Sans Amp Bass Driver DI so I usually run DI for live sound with the bass serving more as stage sound for myself and the drummer. In this respect it still performs very well and I have had no problems with it getting lost in the stage mix. Definitely a good buy it is very compact and light. Coming from someone who owns a vintage tube amp that is large and heavy I have saved my back a lot of suffering without losing a lot of sound quality. I play a good variety but it does always come back to your preference and style. This amp is flexible on its own I do suggest a Sans Amp because it makes any solid state get a good tube sound.

834350,0,t1_cgz2kxo,gt If you want to start a band in addition to whats listed above youll want a PA speaker stands and a mixer. Youll also probably want a monitor I recommend inears but if youre just starting out you could get by with floor wedges. Youll also need the cables to hook everything up.I have never been in a band that have had all this kind of stuff starting out and Ive not been in many that had it at all. Only one band Ive been in had their own PA etc. they were a covers band who only played in pubs which dont usually have an inhouse system. Every other band Ive been in have used the inhouse systems at practice spaces and venues.,Bass,cgz494y,2,t5_2qpc3
834501,0,t1_cgz494y,This is a good point.  When I was first starting out in bands we didnt have our own PA either.  A lot of venues that host bands frequently will run their own sound through the house system.  In many cases you dont even need microphones because the venue has them.  If youre going for a bare bones setup and youre targeting venues that run their own sound you probably could get away with not having a PA mixer or monitors.That said I find it so much easier to have our own.  Without it wed have to go to an equipped studio to rehearse rather than being able to practice in our drummers garage.  It also opens us up to more gigging opportunities like coffee shops outdoor spots and clubspubs that dont run their own sound.  It also gives us a lot more control over our own mix and speeds up our setup because we know exactly how the gear should be hooked up as opposed to trying to deal with a different house system at every venue.  That said though we are a cover band who plays mostly lounges weddings and corporate gigs so we frequently play venues where were expected to BYO everything.,Bass,cgz4vf6,1,t5_2qpc3

If you wantneed some more power out of your amp adding another ohm cab will give you ohms seems backwards  I know.

Too bright and youll want to pull some highs out somewhere between k and k. If you want it to cut through a busy mix some more you can add some mids anywhere between hz and k depending on what kind of sound you like. Low end I generally like to leave pretty flat but if your bass sounds thin you could add a little. Just make changes while youre hitting a string over and over and whats happening to your sound will become quite apparent. ,Bass,chgz9mu,3,t5_2qpc3

I dont know how the BK compares to be honest.I personally use my Tech VTBass Deluxe as my distortion pedal.  It gives me thee settings for each of my  live basses or  for one bass if I wanted.  I have a completely clean punchy channel a slightly driven aggressive channel and a ballsy highgain channel setup for each bass.  It also has an effects loop function.  I currently just use it to throw a noise gate on the high gain channel it stays off on the others.  Theres no blend function unfortunately.  That is one thing I would change about it.  There is a dry out if you wanted to blend at the board.  It also has an XLR direct out with speaker emulation.,Bass,chi2ka7,2,t5_2qpc3

1014334,0,t1_chjd2sq,Dude this is awesome thank you. The point of this whole excorsize is I am trying to learn this song layer by layer so I can eventually make a nice recording with me playing all the layers and signing on another layer. With a looper and some cleverness I could even perhaps arrange it as a live piece.As far as the sub thing I think you hit the nail on the head with your second post. I live way in the woods of central maine and I get little feedback for my effort so somtimes what I think I am looking for isnt always what I am looking for. I have another style of playing this song that uses bass chords. Major and minor th chords that if I span four strings I can produce a th chordwith an  octive three that sounds really jazzy. but if I compact it to straddleing three strings and move the third back into the first octive I can use my E string to easily bounce down to a fifth and keep my chord structure. Here is a much older recording of me using the octive  chords without any bouncing fifths which is silly because I am playing this on a five string. Just remember to disreguard the terrible singing voice I need to add also that you are the second person that has told me this song requires the bass to work the bouncing fifths. I tend to try to stay away from that in jazz because its what I do in most of my country fried and rockabilly stuff and it makes everything sounds very similar to my ear. not jazzyI am still in my morning routine here so I will think about this and probobly get back to you in this thread.

Its guaranteed to have the info you need  more.If you dont need lots of information then all you need to know is that even on a basic level its not the ideal configuration you could be using. Simple problems include issues with speakers being out of phase trouble with unequal wattage ratings and power handling abilities and different speaker frequency and sensitivity responses.Most people cite the myth that a  speaker provides better bass and a  will provide better mids and highs and a combination of both is the best way of achieving a full sound. This is  incorrect as most modern speaker boxes are full range.Your very best option is to run matched cabs that being  boxes of the same model from the same manufacturer. Another good rule of thumb is to have twice the watts in cab that you do in amp eg. w bass amp at  ohm  xw bass cabs each at  ohm.I will add that I used unmatched cabs for many years with no noticeable problems and it can be done. It is however not the ideal scenario and now Im educated on the matter I would never do it again.The best solution for you would be to buy another  of the same model as your other one if you like that sound.

1283957,0,t1_cidzpvw,gt lower frquencies requires the cone to move larger distances to recreate the bassThis isnt exactly correct.  The cone moves at a different speed to recreate lower frequencies which isnt the issue. Nearly all speaker cones are capable of moving at hz but smaller cones or cones with lower excursion distances dont push enough air for a hz tone to be very loud.  The problem comes when the speaker cant move enough air to recreate the frequency as loudly as a player would like.  The cones amount of excursion and the wattage of the amp determine how loudly a speaker can recreate lower frequencies.  Sending a higher wattage signal into the speaker will move the speaker further thus pushing more air and allowing the speaker to produce low frequencies loud enough for your taste.  If you are using a combo style amp or a properly matched head and cab you will be much less likely to blow a speaker when plugging a bass into a guitar amp. If you plug a bass head into a guitar cab youre probably going to have a bad time. Its also important to keep your volume knobs at reasonable positions.  If you have the gain and master volume knobs at  youre using the wrong ampcab for the volume you are trying to achieve.  TLDR  Its about sending the correct wattage into the correct speaker and using appropriate volume levels not whether its a bass going into a guitar amp.  ,Bass,cie28gl,2,t5_2qpc3

1334295,0,t3_29ag1i,You are Caesar overseeing a battle at the Colosseum. A Gaulish gladiator has just won a great fight against a pair of Persian tridentthrowers. The audience is asking you whether youre going to let the gladiator live or if youre going to release your largest tiger to finish him off. Traditionally this decision is made by either showing a confident thumbs up or a confident thumbs down. On this particular day you have decided to reward the gladiator for his epic victory but one does not become the emperor of Rome without having some flair for audience participation. You ball your dominant fist and place your thumb up firmly in the air with confidence. The gladiator relieved thinks hes been given a reprieve but SUDDENLY you rotate your wrist slightly almost to  degrees as though youre about to give a thumbs down. Everyone gasps but then you return your fist to the upright position and the crowd goes wild.Unbelievably few people know that Caesar pioneered the correct singlethump technique for slap bass guitar. Ensure your rotate your wrist and aim to strike the string start with the E as its easiest with your rigid middle thumb joint right on the end of the fretboard as though youre about to order the execution of some Christians.

1427517,0,t3_2agifh,OPIt seems youre following a similar path to mine. I was a guitarist since I was  Im  now my touring band broke up in  and I decided to go bass as a result of no real guitarist gigs available. I now love being the bass player its fun and challenging and hey... It worked when Paul McCartney switched from guitar to bass!Okay lets start with bass guitar options. Depending on what youre playing there are basses geared obviously more towards that sounds. I am a die hard jazz bass fan I think that there are very few sounds you cant get from it that you can from other basses. Please refrain from suggesting Rick and MM sounds... Im well aware just speaking in general sense. I currently own a s Fender Jazz s Rickenbacker   Guild StarFire II and most recently Ive purchased a Washburn Taurus T. If you can notice the pattern Ive got basses with two pickups and thats because everywhere like a guitar on the body has a different sound. Several pickup placements as a result can offer you a great deal of tonal capabilities.Bolton vs neckthrough which is more important to you brightness or sustain? This is something that youll have to answer through testing basses. The Washburn I recently picked up T is a  string neck through. It was only  IMO its a very underestimated bass for its value in playability.Of course in retrospect if I was to do it all over again I would have chosen a P Bass to learn all my fundamentals on. Not only is it the most recorded bass in history but when you learn on a P Bass youre putting yourself through a rigorous exercise.Okay thats a few thoughts on basses. Now how about amps?Depending on what your gigs look like there is just about a million combinations of what you can do. I always say that the best set up is to have a good wattage head  and a x cab and a x cab with a DI box ready in case theres a sub at the venue. Currently I run a matching GK Goldline  loaded with a DI in a rack case with a korg D tuner and Furman power conditioner and matching x amp x ported speaker cabinets. With this rig I can go full set up or pick and choose for each show as some times I might not need that much amp. It looks professional and sounds great. Id look into GK for an amp theyre a time tested and great success of a company. Most importantly of anything I have said here be sure to try most if not ALL of what you buy.

1544010,0,t3_2bwudq,One exercise that I still use for warming up involves playing something similar to a chromatic scale but not quite.Start on the E string and play the first fret with your index finger second fret with your middle finger third with your ring finger and fourth with your pinkie.  Then move to the A string .  Same for D and G.  When you finish with that move up a fret and come down.  G string  then D  then A then E.  Then move up a fret on the E and go back up.   on the E A D and G strings.  You can do this all the way up the neck and then back down too if you feel like it.You can also use this exercise to help with right hand precision too.

1547962,0,t3_2bx29d,Theres a lot of suggestions here about EQ and Compression which are all good advice but I want to suggest that it might be an arrangement issue.  Take a look at what the other members of the band are playing in these sections where you are slapping.  Slapping works really well in Funk music because the members of the band create spacespockets for each other to fit into.  The kick and bass link up on the one but the drummer usually leaves a little space for the pops to fit into. The guitar player does the wakkawakkawah stuff in counter rhythm to the bass and drums.  Slapping is an inherently rhythmic manner of playing the bass and when doing so you should be working to fit in with the other rhythmic elements of the music.  ,Bass,cjab6vs,3,t5_2qpc3

1558904,0,t3_2c3253,Im a bassist that plays grindcore death metal and all that stuff but when it comes to tone Im really picky about it and have a tone very different from others in the genre. My EQ is very similar to the guy in the first video A.J. Lewandowski. Bass  Mids  treble . Thats just the basic EQ settings but if your amp has any more settings or your bass has an onboard preamp try messing around with those. For the clangy type sound you may want more in the treble Im not saying turn it to  though and maybe a little bit more gain if your amp has it. So if you want a brighter sound try turning your tone knob up. You should also keep in mind that your tone isnt gonna sound the same if you borrow whatever cab the venue has. If money isnt a problem I suggest getting your own gear. Not a lot of metal guys know about all the factors that go into tone. I feel like Im going on and on now so Ill leave it at that but if you have any questions or want any more advice on tone Im your man.,Bass,cjbok8e,1,t5_2qpc3

1609231,0,t3_2cn7ux,Well unlike the frontandcenter lead guitar bass is all about subtlety. If youve been using a pick all this time itll probably be easier to use a pick with the bass but you should try messing with the finger style and see how you like it. If youve ever done some random jammingwriting with your guitar try thinking up some bass lines that will give the guitarwork its feeling. With the lead guitar its mostly about being heard being seen but the bass is all about the groove and the feeling in the music. So look for a playing style you like most  youd probably find a pick easier but in my opinion it takes away the feeling of the music. Oh and also once you get used to playing a bass guitar I wish you luck in continuing the lead guitar as well.

1680204,0,t3_2dmnpt,First off dont stress about it. That was your first time playing with other people theres going to be a learning curve. Next time you can keep in the mind the issues you had with feedback and having your amp too close to the snare. Like you said as the session went on you got more into the rhythm of things. This is probably because you were finally relaxing a bit and playing to your actual abilities. It will become easier moving forward.As long as the people you played with are understanding theyll realize youre quite new and will likely be more than willing to offer some advice and continue playing with you in the future. Getting the chance to play in a band setting is often a huge motivation and will drive you to improve faster than ever.As for improving theres a lot you can do. For songs to learn I would recommend learning the kind of music you want to play. If you dont have a teacher thats something you could consider as well. Theres some excellent learning resources on the sidebar in this subreddit I personally really like scotts bass lessons. Learn some  bar blues basics it will help you play along to a whole host of songs even if you dont know the actual basslines get familiar with the fretboard learn some scales.Youve only been playing for three months.

1766882,0,t3_2ela91,I remember trying to figure out Jazz and thinking where do I even start?! It can be overwhelming.The Lionel Hampton song has walking bass which is a combination of playing the arpeggios notes that make up each chord tones and mixing them with the corresponding scale tones and approach notes that set you up to play each chord in a manner where the strong notes chord tones root note rd th and perhaps the th note of the chords corresponding scale are played on the strong beats  and  and the weak notes called passing tonesthe nd th and th notes in a scale are played on beats  and .  This is oversimplifying but thats the basic approach to building walking bass lines.The best way to learn to do this is to start by playing the root of each passing chord then slowly practice adding the rd and th.  As you are comfortable with this practice approaching the next chord by its fifth on the beat preceding a chord change.For example if you are playing the G chord but in the next measure you have a F chord you could playbeat G beat  A beat  B beat  CThis has a nice walking sound because you are walking through the scale steps to get to the next chord and the C is the fifth of your next chord F.  Without going into a loooong lesson via text when we hear a note that is  musical steps away from our target note our ear strongly expects to hear it resolve.  This type of playing takes time to develop.  Perhaps I will make a tutorial video in the upcoming weeks.  When I do would you like me to contact you with the link?,Bass,ck1vdtp,1,t5_2qpc3

1993754,0,t3_2hk991,Your questions very broad but Ill offer you the same one page breakdown I wrote for someone in rguitar. Picture a piano. Think of the keyboard as just one really long guitar string.Hopefully you know where middle C is. Just before the group of  black keys. Then theres a group of  black keys repeat. Black keys are your sharps and flats duh.C major scale is all white keys. CDEFGABC...Scales are all about intervals.How many black keys from C to D? One Thats whole step.D to E? Whole step.E to F? No zero black keys.Thats a half step interval.Were getting a pattern of halves and whole steps now.WWHWWWHThat last H is your half step from B to the next C. Now weve gone up an octave and shit just starts over. This pattern is the major scale no matter what note you start on.Heres the only real confusing part for most peopleThe strange constant is that there is never a black key between E and F or B and C and yet the halfwhole thing remains though for every major key. Whole step just means the notes are  piano keys apart. It doesnt matter what scalekey or pattern of Ws and Hs youre using there is never a whole step between E and F or B and C. Got that mess?Chords are made of  main notes that form a triad. These notes are each  notes apart but follow their own pattern of wholehalf steps because of that goddamn black key configuration.C skip a note E skip a note G.Thats the st rd and th notes of the C major scale. Thats a C major chord and in this key its the one I chord. Hallelujah.Guess what the two ii chord is? Same pattern.D skip one F skip one AD minor. D F and A are the first third and fifth notes starting from D in the key of C.Whys it minor? Intervals. No black key between the E and the F but we have to use those notes because were in the key of C. We call that F a flat rd in this contest. Thats what makes it minor chord. Remember theres only  fucking notes in every normal chord they just repeat.So another pattern emerges. If theres only a step and a half between those first and second notes in the triad  E.g D  F or E  G  thats a minor chord.If theres a complete  whole steps  E.g F  A or G  B  thats a major chord. By complete  whole steps I mean  black key white key black key white key or any  possible notes you could have played between.Keep picturing a piano. I swear to God its the easiest way to visualize this.The major and minor chords you can make out of any major key follow this patternMajor minor minor major major minor minor diminished repeat.If we number the chords   C  B it looks like thisI ii iii IV V vi viiidimSome guitar players call those Roman Numerals  Nashville Numbers. Upper case  major. Lower case  minor.What about minor keys?Start from a different number other than the first note of your regular major scale and thats where the modes come from. Dont worry about that shit right now. Only thisStarting from the sixth th note is called the Aeolian mode. Use the same pattern of intervals you used in the major scale though. E.g Pretend its the C major scale but starting on A. Use all the same major and minor chords you would in C use all the same scale notes. A minor is C major. C major is A minor. This is called a relative minor scale. Now if were in the key of G...six  notes away from G is E and goddammit the E minor scale is G major. They are one and the same.What about weird chords with names like sus or add?Okay a Csus chord has these notes CEG normal triad and also D. Whats D but the nd note in the C major scale? Yup thats why the chord has a  in the name. Apply that common sense across the board.Whats a diminished chord?Dont fucking worry about it dont need that shit for  of music.Whats a pentatonic scale?Dont play the nd or th notes of the scale. Forget about em. Now you got  notes out of  left over. You know pentatonic. The minor pentatonic scale is the blues scale. You dont need to know shit else to play the blues.Tricks like memorizing the fret board octave shapes the CAGED system for chord voicings alternative scale patterns modes etc. will help your playing but this is all you need to know about music theory as it applies to melody.The other  is rhythm. Most of you probably know how to count to  or  right? Well youre already  there.So its fair to say that if you read and can grasp what I just wrote that you literally understand at least  of reasonably applicable music theory.You just use the information I provided to examine and analyze other patterns that fall outside the norm. These are called accidentals but theyre generally not accidents. They just dont fit with the perfect formula for western music. As far as chord progressions go there a a handful of goto formulas that make up the majority of music youve ever heard. Again there only so many chords that are gonna fit together and if you want to make music that functions and people wanna listen to youre somewhat limited to these formulas. Progressions are a series of harmonic tensions and releases. Dissonance and resolution. This is where it gets a little more complicated and opinion based but you typically want the end of the progression to resolve back to the beginning so the listener feels satisfied. Most commonly the beginning chord is a one I chord. Notes that offer a pretty indisputable tension and resolution back to one I are the   and . Look for those notes in the final chord of your progression. The five V chord meets that criteria pretty well and is not so coincidentally featured at the end of chord progressions quite frequently. If youre a Black Sabbathriff based metal bass player fuck all this and just play whatever notes sound good and heavy. Fuck scales fuck chords. Fuck rules. ,Bass,cktg4oz,7,t5_2qpc3

Dont have your bass around your knees nor have your bass level with your chest. Playing by ear Its the easiest to play by ear since you only need to worry about one note unlike a guitar which can be playing an A chord  different ways A Maj A min A Asus etc..... The guitar can play any one of those  A chords and as a bassist you only need to play the A note. The first part of playing by ear is figuring out the chord progression. Just play along with a song and play notes til something sounds right. Remember that note. Then repeat for the rest of the song. Once you know the chord progression root notes You can figure our what else is being played over the chords. Its really kind of hard to explain how to play by ear....Ive been doing it for a long time now and I can almost imagine what someone is playing just by hearing them. You just have to practice it.....I didnt know how to do it til I saw my dad do it. And he never taught me........I just tried to do it. ,Bass,cljytlo,1,t5_2qpc3

I often use it in combination with my Big Muff fuzz or my Tech  VT Bass from Sansamp although I dont usually go for the screaming effect rather more ambient and wall of noise type sounds. In combination with a delay you can get some seriously ethereal sounds that sound almost electronic. But you can definitely get a screaming effect with distortion similar to something like in Anaesthesia  Metallica. I reckon Justin Chancellor uses a wah of sorts in some parts of Tool songs like solos etc. Its an awesome pedal that I use quite a lot its surprisingly versatile.My only criticism with the Cry Baby is that it only engages when you begin to put your foot down ie. you cant have it on while your foots not on it.

2336338,0,t3_2m2rww,Song mechanics.     Listen to how songs you like are put together how do verses choruses bridge intronoutro all work together? A lot of songs are some variant of intro verse chorus verse chorus bridge lead break chorus last verse chorus chorus end. How you sequence these is up to you but there should be a beginning a middle main part of the song and resolution an end. Song function.    Are you writing an instrumental piece or will it have lyrics? If it has lyrics is it telling a story or is it more flowofemotion stuff? Instrumental pieces are difficult for me because I cant use words to flesh out my concepts. Im a storyteller by nature...      Also what do you want the song to do? Should it motivate amuse anger instruct or offend the potential listener? Knowing what you want the tune to accomplish cuts down on the meandering concept scenario.Who are you going to be writing this song for?       Not just the potential audience but who will be performing the song? Is it going to be just you or are you writing a song for a band? Keep in mind that if you are writing for a group the end result is hardly ever the same as the initial concept. Thats half the fun watching a song mutate with the input of your bandmates into a finished product.As far as initial song concepts go I usually find myself muttering some phrase overnover say space between the words using an old personal example until I find a cadence rhythm that fits the catchphrase. Then I open up the idea driving the catchphrase outlining the storyline to get it sequential.       Finally you drag your nascent ditty in to band rehearsal lay it out for the gang and watch it morph accordingly!If you dont like your initial efforts dont despair try again!

Hendrix was all over the place usually behind the beat even while playing rhythmic parts.Guitarists also often get more opportunities to play melodies which allow for relaxed or augmented time and solos which allow for freeform time. Listen to basically any blues guitar solo ever written.Also guitars often play chords with a pick. When you strum a bar chord you are hitting  different strings but the ear hears this as one beat. This alone gives them more leeway since the attack of the sound isnt as pronounced.The comment wasnt guitar players have worse time.,Bass,cm2pqtq,3,t5_2qpc3
2382589,0,t1_cm667l4,In order for it to be in a mode it needs to resolve to the modal tonic.  So if you have a IIViiV progression in C major  C  F  Dm  G and are playing an F Lydian scale you arent going to resolve to F.  The tonic is still going to be C because of the harmony.Now if you had a little F  G vamp going on both major chords and played that F lydian scale itd be different.  Youd have that signature raised th sound in there and it would resolve to F.  The notes are the same as the C major scale but the context is different.  Thats the big difference between modal music and just playing different scale positions.  Modal music has a different context it resolves differently and chords function differently than in the average major or minor key.EDIT Take Joe Satrianis tune Flying in a Blue Dream  Thats mainly in C Lydian.  Now C Lydian has the same notes as G Major but it functions entirely differently.  It resolves to C not G.  As far as function goes C Lydian is closer to C Major than to G Major because of the tonic note of C.Its kind of confusing and Im not especially good at explaining it but does that make sense?,Bass,cm672lt,1,t5_2qpc3

When something is pulling a lot of current through the PT you can get a lot of excess heat. Likewise certain types of failures on an OT can get hot enough to cause excessive heat outside the chassis. Was the heat localized to one side of the amp or the other ie near the PT or OT? What were you running for a speaker cab? Have you tried swapping the earlier preamp tubes? Transformers are usually pretty robust I havent seen a lot of failures but it certainly can happen. There are a few other things Id check before I assume OT failure but they arent things you can really check on your own without the right tools.

2510198,0,t3_2odwy7,I think it depends a lot on what people want and how much they are spending. I got my st bass a few weeks ago very cheap nd hand and the st thing I did was restring it and set it up. The setup was very straightforward for the most part I did the truss rod action and intonation but Im happy to use tools and spent little enough that if I screwed it up it wasnt the end of the world.I didnt touch the nut or mess with the frets though since you need fairly expensive specialist tools that I dont have and doubt I will get enough use out of to justify. But there are people who have no idea how to use tools the number of people I know who have called a breakdown service to change a flat tyre astounds me. And people spend hundreds or even thousands on a bass. If Id spent k on a bass I reckon another  on a setup would be worth it especially if I was someone cash rich and time poor who had never held a screwdriver. As to how they set it up I assume that unless you specifically tell them what you want they will set it up to whatever the manufacturers recommendation is or some other standard middle off the road setting.   ,Bass,cmm7yz2,2,t5_2qpc3

Use popular bass cover makers on youtube for a good idea of how to set up the camera TonyDickinsonBG does a good job of this I think.For audio capture PLEASE dont use your webcam to record audio if you can afford not to. If you have a bunch o money laying about buy yourself a DAW like Logic Pro X or ProTools and an analogdigital converter and familiarize your self with basic direct recording technique. This helps a bunch for covers because there are many people out there making really crappy quality covers their playing might be good but if the video sounds and looks bad you are going to keep people coming back for more. What I have used when I have recorded covers in the past is just the little USB inch cable that comes with the rocksmith video game and logic pro x.

2820956,0,t3_2semzt,Youre learning two instruments the first and most important one your brain! And secondarily the bass.The best way to teach your brain music is to listen to a lot of music you probably already do this. The next thing to do is sing songs that you know. Dont worry about the words just sing the melody on a neutral syllable like doo and also learn to sing the chord roots often the bass line. When you can sing the melody and chord roots to a whole bunch of songs youre really developing your musicianship. If you can sing the melody and bass line to many songs you can try learning some songs on your bass. Youll know if youre playing the song correctly or not because youll be able to hear how it goes in your head.When youre playing a song on your bass you might be able to play an entire song with your first finger on one string. But this technique is very inefficient. If you can play the next note by putting down the next finger do that. If you have to play a different string without moving your hand up and down the neck. If you have to move your hand to a different fret move to the closest one. As much as you can change fingers without moving your hand and when you must move between strings instead of between frets. Stay as relaxed as you can and take breaks.If you live near a major metropolitan area I can try to recommend a teacher. A good bass teacher may be relatively easy to find a good music teacher may not be so easy to find but its worth looking and Im happy to help.,Bass,cnoqi62,8,t5_2qpc3

I play in an original country rock band and our music can be loud compared to more acoustic type acts but our sound is more dynamic than that kind of stuff. Our lead guitar player has an  watt tubed combo but he doesnt really push it. Our singer uses a Vox AC. Ive never had to turn my amp up past half and anytime weve played an outdoor event Ive gone through the house PA. In regular bars if were just using our own PA my amp holds up just fine.

3100967,0,t1_coje9tb,Ive only done a jack once and I used a Switchcraft.  Works fine plenty robust.  Though honestly unless you really cheaped out Id expect any  jack will be pretty good.  The important part is installing it properly.    And BTW if youre looking to get better at maintaining and working on your bass in general this might be a good time to learn a bit more about setups. Let the shop do the setup and provided youre happy with it get a capo a feeler guage and a small ruler and check all the measurements as described in Fenders setup guide.  Dont change anything just take measurements and write them down.  Then you can periodically check the measurements and if things drift over time like they often do with seasonal change etc... then you can take a crack at doing your own setup.      Setups arent hard though theyre easy to do wrong and IMO its really worth learning about.  Having a nice bass is great but having a nice bass that plays exactly like you want it to is really great.  And come to think of it taking a shitty bass and setting it up so it plays like butter is pretty great too.      ,Bass,cojewst,2,t5_2qpc3

3211297,0,t3_2wwmzs,Its honestly a shot in the dark because your instrument and amp and personal playing style will still make the tone be ever so slightly different than what samples you hear.  Especially if the samples were on youtube because it ruins the sound quality in many cases.Pedal buying is seriously the bane of somebody who is extremely analytical about the products they buy.  You could spend months comparing pedals and looking up obscure comments on forums and never get anywhere tangible without actually playing them yourself.  Pick the pedal that has the tone features you need or think you need.  And just roll with it.If its for live playing nobody is going to notice slight differences between the same types of pedals.  Be it a muff fuzz or an ocdclone overdrive.  Doesnt matter.  I have run  different muff fuzzes live and nobody notices a difference.  Except maybe if one had significantly boosted mids thats about it.  I could have my vocalist swap between those  pedals and I wouldnt even be able to tell the difference.  It ended up being that I use  for band one for practicing at home and one collects dust.  Oh and the funny bit is I still look up similar pedals with a vague curiosity and temptation to buy them.,Bass,couun2t,5,t5_2qpc3

3287459,0,t1_cp2p0en,Two and three are great points. There is really no rule to tune the same as your band does nor do you need to go extended range if your bandmates go. Its not uncommon to see the guitarists play with whatever different tunings they experient with while the bassist stays in their comfortable tuning of choice. Even the guitarists dont necessarily need to be locked in. Its not like a different tuning will lock you out of playing almost all the same notes you could playing in standard.Of course it all depends on your style and how you can make it work and what your bands goal is. If you guys want big and heavy and chug a lot of open low string and whatnot then I suppose you have to drop down although I think that at some point more heavy tones just cancel each other out. ,Bass,cp2zvt5,2,t5_2qpc3

3431865,0,t3_2zhacl,I only really have two solos currently in my band one is just laying down a groove which the other instruments then return over. The other plays the main riff for a bit and then goes off into its own thing.    Something important to remember about bass solos is that even though it is a solo you are still playing bass  your main priority should always be on thumping out a groove and keeping the momentum. One way to do this is to base your solo around a riff in the song. Have you noticed how some guitar solos start out by playing the vocal melody or even return to it later but embellish it? Think of how you can mimic that relationship but between the riffs rather than the leads dig? Here are some cool examples    HIM  Gone With The Sin  Technically a synth solo but has a lot of bass characteristics and can easily be transposed to bass. This solo is VERY melodic. Theres a lot going on and perhaps it doesnt really go anywhere great but keeps the general momentum going.  MegaHerA  Welcome Back Heavy Metal  This solo is very simple and jams on the main riff of the song. What is accomplished by throwing in those fills is keeping the song moving in a forward direction while also making the whole thing more interesting.    Quiet Riot  Bang Your Head  This is essentially just the main riff. Theres nothing wrong with this either and sometimes it is all the song needs.    Blue Oyster Cult  Godzilla  Ever write an awesome bass line that just couldnt quite work in with other instruments? Then it can be used as a bass solo in this kind of context. Dont just use the old groove give the band a new groove to play around with. These solos are great as long as they dont overstay their welcome and can really help bring the song into its second half.,Bass,cpjgiuf,1,t5_2qpc3

3456033,0,t3_2zsnrm,Im just starting with theory and I never wanted to be a drummer but here are some of my reasons for picking bass originally. Looked much easier to play from a technical i.e physical not theorywise view. Overabundance of guitarists. Not that I wanted to play in a band just bedroom jamming for fun maybe small casual jams with others. My best friend at the time was a guitarist. Drumkits looked very impractical for a bedroom jammer. Loud expensive ? bulky take up a lot more space and generally look complicated to setup just right. Also drumming looked exhausting to me. That cheesy stereotype of the bassist being the intelligent quiet introspective guy. Now I see even more benefits the biggest of which and something I am just beginning to realize and hopefully take advantage of the presence of the instrument in such a wide variety of music genres. That has got to be the bassists trumpcard IMO.Just my two cents. Which ironically is worth nothing up here in Canada...,Bass,cpm7pez,4,t5_2qpc3

3630322,0,t3_31vc6u,My roommate was a classically trained musician and he needed a bassist for a band he wanted to start. He taught me enough to play bass with him and Ive built on that. Still cant read a lick of music and refuse to study theory but you cant play an instrument for any length of time and not pick up some theory  regardless of whether you realize it or not.I guess the way I explain my understanding of theory is this after youve been playing a while you notice how certain notes just dont sound right. Like... youre playing a song in Dmaj and the F you hit by mistake sounds like a big fat ass PRANG... music theory is when youre thinking of what to play next and you mentally berate yourself and dont play the F in the first place.Thats my version of music theory. Knowing where the prangs are and not going there  not necessarily when Im playing a song I know but when Im screwing around stringing random notes together. Like knowing instinctively not to play a sharp or flat generally when were playing something in C. Getting to the point of not having to think about where the prangs are.Where it gets fun is when you know where the prangs are and know when what normally would be a prang would actually complement the song because your guitarist is playing some messed up Gaug  and then proudly playing that prang.,Bass,cq6324i,2,t5_2qpc3

3905662,0,t3_355sj1,I dont think there is a such thing as cheating when it comes to learning songs by ear  the mere fact you are learning by ear means you are trying to do it by hook or by crook any little tricks you can throw in there that might help are a bonus. As someone who plays almost exclusively by ear I sometimes find covers easier to learn from because perhaps the bass in the original bands recording is a little low in places but someone playing over the top of it makes a little more sense of it for me.Also if I am learning something note for note which is very rare I usually just play things my way then tabs help fill in the little bits that are hard to hear. Or if I am learning from a CD then the tabs will help me figure out which bit of the fretboard I should be on or if I need to switch strings vs sliding updown the fretboard. This isnt piano. There is more than one way to play an A. I have been playing bass for about  years now I dont read music and I have very little in the way of theory behind me so everything I do is using my ear. I write and learn songs completely by ear and still now I will refer to tabs or videos to give me a helping hand. Unless it is something totally simplecompletely clear in the mix I dont think it is possible to learn something note for note just by ear unless you are immensely patient which I am not I expect to be able to play stuff within about  minutes of hearing it for the first time except properly hard stuff like Portait of Tracey  that was tabs all the way!!.Happy bassing.

When youre with a band listen to the other instruments  all of them not just the drums. Youll find that you can drop some of the notes because someone else is putting in those beats for you.

4069149,0,t3_374tcm,Guitarist here. It is like mentioned in some of the comments below you get different sustain a different tone and different pros and cons with a fretless compared to a fretted guitar. Main problem lies in playing chords with three or more voicings such as bar chords or open chords so for gigs that call for that sort of thing the fretless is not ideal.I think fretless is one of those things that will grow in the guitar community in the coming years but only when it comes to certain styles. Just like extended guitars are becoming more and more prevalent in metal music the fretless are being used more in experimental music. I do play a fretless but i only get to pull it out on certain occasions such as a fusion gigs and the occasional funk gig when i do pop rock jazz or anything else either the fretless is not wanted by the rest of the band or it is not suited for the situation. Also guitar dont have a tradition of being fretless from the start but bass have with the upright basses. As said i think it will get more common in the coming years but it still something rare in the guitar community. ,Bass,crk40ci,2,t5_2qpc3

4080163,0,t1_crkyxvh,Gonna go ahead and agree here.  Tone is cool and I dig the bass line itself but definitely focus on the execution and locking into it.  There is a very common and unfortunate tendency to anticipate too much.  By this I mean when youre approaching a new part or playing a little fill or anything that is a deviation from your main groove you get impatient and rush into it rather than keeping time and just letting it come to you.  Drummers have this problem all the time theyre locked into a nice groove but then it comes time to play a big fill into the next section of the song and they just cant contain themselves and speed up big time.Just get a click track or a drum track or a real drummer going along with this and play the line over and over until you feel yourself locking into the tempo with less and less effort.,Bass,crld4gj,2,t5_2qpc3

When it comes to working with beginners I usually focus first on holding the instrument then developing and strengthening the left hand follow by right hand technique and finally applying everything together slowly.Best way to go about this is to aquire a private lesson teacher that will give you that one one one and help reinforce the good playing technique which again derives from proper posture.Also for jazz I highly recommend you get a pickup personally I use a Fishman pick and it does fantastic job for the price I paid for it.

Once your eyes are closed and you can continually play it flawlessly without anticipating the next part the singing will come easy. This goes for pretty much every songpractice it until you feel like practicing it doesnt benefit you anymore.

4359489,0,t3_3ay15o,Ive always assumed a beginner bass is the bass you buy that is good enough to get you going but not so expensive you kick yourself if you decide bass isnt for you. Theres literally nothing good or bad about buying another bass for the same price. I personally have never owned an expensive bass. I dont see the point. I dont have tone envy I dont try and emulate anyone else so I never feel inclined to upgrade my basses. My Arias both sub  work just fine for me. When I get another bass it will be because it is completely different to the ones I have I have a fretless and a JB copy  next up is an  string made by Hagstrom and not because it is considered better.If you feel you are ready for a new bass I would suggest trying a few in your price range and picking the right one for you. Dont worry about what other people tell you everyone has their prejudices about certain brands I wouldnt entertain a Warwick bass because I knew a dickhead that played one  that has nothing to do with Warwick themselves I was just put off by his monumental douchiness so its best not to listen to others and just try stuff under your own steam. At the end of the day no amount of online reviews or testimonials are going to help you decide which bass you like better. You could be sure a bass is for you and it feels like shit when you pick it up. There is also a common myth that you get to a certain level of playing and all of a sudden need a new better bass. If you are good you make whatever you play sound good. For reference the clip of Dave Grohl playing a kids drum set And no amount of  basses is going make you sound good if you suck. ,Bass,csh1qb7,4,t5_2qpc3

I equate it to working out at the gym. So many people want to get huge in weeks but dont realise that it takes a long long time to achieve those results.

When soloing over songs with multiple changes thinking in terms of arpeggios rather than scales is not only more efficient but more musical too.

Check your power tube bias every  months or so to make sure the tubes are still running in a good range. The procedure is in your manual. Replacing the power tubes before they fail is a good way to keep your amp running good and avoid having to take a trip to an amp tech.If you want to get a vintage type setup on the CL run it with the master volume wide open. It wont hurt the amp any and gives the preamp a little more of an open sound IMO. Never run the amp without a cabinet connected. You should run a  or  ohm load on an SVT for optimum running conditions but the SVT OT is designed well enough that an  ohm load isnt going to kill it see comments here from Bill Hughes one of the designers and RG Keen comments on OTload matching here but isnt ideal.

There are some tricks like playing with the EQ to make the bass guitar more prominent but its impossible to separate it completely from the mix. Except when you can find them online like the example above.The problem is that it takes time and practice to train your ears and listen to one separate instrument that may not be the most dominant one in the song. While it may be helpful to check your transcriptions afterwards youre better off listening to the songs as they are without any tricks. What also may help is listening to music on better speakers because that  set of computer speakers doesnt really do it justice and playing it from a better source it might be more difficult to hear it in a kbps mp file you downloaded from the internet than when youre listening to a cd.,Bass,ct8qiak,5,t5_2qpc3

It has a set of TV Jones pickups so the tone is spot on.I own only Gibson and Fenders and its every bit as good if not better built than them.I could happily trust buying any of their guitars without playing first.,Bass,ctfm5ob,2,t5_2qpc3
4644874,0,t1_ctftrgc,That depends on how much of a musical background you have. To start with you have to be able to read the staff in your clef befittingly for bass bass clef both for pitch and rhythm. From there Id recommend musictheory.net though their lessons all make use of the treble clef. As for learning by ear you generally need a lot of experience under your belt before you can do that. It takes active listening and a decent mental pitch i.e. perfect pitch but not perfect. I usually pick out the first note of the phrase Im learning hum it and play frets chromatically until I find it. Again with experience this process becomes much easier and will take less time as youll be right on the first note more often. ,Bass,ctg1ut2,2,t5_2qpc3
4648268,0,t1_ctg6xec,Knowledge never impeded anyones progress and theres value in learning all of these things from other people. We all have musical heros and I dont think its wrong to want to sound and play like them. Yes putting your own influencence into it is important but if you want to sound like Chris Wolstenholme and dont know what his signal path is then by all means ASK. There are plenty of more experienced players here who are more than happy to help out other users than telling them to figure it out yourself. Theory was invented for a reason so that we can describe the things that are going on in a piece of music so there is nothing wrong in asking what to play and why. The internet is a tool and you would be a fool not to use it.,Bass,ctgh7bg,19,t5_2qpc3

4675748,0,t1_ctjsxmb,It took a long time to get that diagnosis. I was starting to have joint pain. It was all over my body. Felt like my bones were breaking. They medicated me but at the same time I was having appendix issues that they mistreated as Crohns disease. So after the appendix came out and all GI symptoms resolved I was left with the joint pain. They did Xrays physical exams blood work and nothing ever showed up. I was told everything from tendinitis carpel tunnel etc. eventually I saw a joint specialist that finally started treating it as fibromyalgia. The meds all along the way were giving me horrible side effects and never helping the core issue. I do t remember the exact time frame but I think the joint pain started about  months prior to diagnosis. Eventually I got sick of the pain and being sick from the meds. I started researching diet options and decided to try a natural approach figured Id start eliminating gluten dairy processed foods. After  weeks I started noticing a difference. I eventually figured it it was the gluten. I stared seeing a natural doctor and even though he confirmed my findings he didnt do anything more to help than that. So fast forward to now. I am gluten free. About  percent less pain I dont need narcotics to get out of bed. If I ever slip up and have gluten Ill be in severe pain for about  weeks. My warm up is basic. Just doing arm circles swimmer hugs etc to loosen up the arms and shoulders. For stretching Ill straighten an arm forward and pull back my fingers with my other hand to stretch out my forearms. Then Ill put my hands together like Im praying. Then cross each finger one at a time over the other hand it stretches out the fingers and wrists. Once I start playing I make sure to always keep my wrists as straight as possible. I play consistently and constantly. If I take more than a day or two off itll be more sore after playing again.

4734413,0,t3_3frd37,As everyone has said its probably a duff string especially if you bought it used and havent changed the strings yet. Id throw a new set on there and see if that solves it. If not work through logically to find where in the bass all your unwanted vibration is coming from. It could be the nut so check its cut correctly for a thicker B string it could be the tailpiece if somethings come loose there or it could be the tuning peg its attached to. Its unlikely to be the pickups or electrics if its just the B string that has issues. If you still cant figure it out take it to a repairer and get a professional opinion.

Then I wondered...what exactly are you trying to accomplish with which pedals...So mess with trying the effects loop and if that doesnt do it consider borrowing a solid state amp from a friend.

5036567,0,t1_cut39tp,I think thats a great point and one that Im also very aware of.I also write songs and I havent written anything above bpm th notes so far. So realistically speaking I dont really use that speed.I do have some th note fills in  bpm but its mostly stuff created with hammer onoffs and a max of  plucked notes.The idea of the video was more so to demonstrate possibility not mastery because I have by no means mastered it. I can get some really smooth parts sometimes when Im on fire but mostly it ends up sloppy and so I havent put it in any songs yet. Its music after all the key is for it to sound good.I have to say though how fast something can be and sound good is something you get used to I recently wrote a bass riff thats like... very masturbatory more of a guitar riff honestly but I kind of like the tone of it better on bass and to me it doesnt lose any of the feeling even when it gets so fast you cant possibly register the notes individually the over all feel of it still remains the same.editPersonally I think timing and tone are by far the most important when it comes to bass and its also where Im struggling the most. I was an incredibly lazy bassist for many years while playing in a band taking on songs that were way above what I should have but still forcing it developing speed but without precision and great timing. Im working hard to close the gap these days though weve started recording with my band and I really hate it that I just cant get it down as solidly as I want.

If I were to teach full time Id just teach high school music maybe have a few keen private students on the side.A lot of places will try get you to do ukulele or beginner guitar stuff but really at that point why not just work any other job... Personally I love bass pursuing bass technique advanced approaches getting the most out of the instrument and I also love imparting what I know to students.

For me as I was doing root note heavy punk stuff it was a mix of anxietyexcitement and throwing myself around a bit. It got better by learning to be energetic with out being tense but mostly through playing more complicated bass lines.

I love my Jazz but after a year or so Ive actually gone back to the GampL with a new found respect and understanding of its capabilities.Really the key to it is to switch everything off and set all the tone controls to zero and gradually add things back in as required. The bass and treble controls are like a Sansamp where boosting them is at the expense of the mids so use sparingly. Only use the EQ boost or active boost when either your highs or lows arent cutting through the mix.Sure its really big and heavy and the neck is thick compared to a Jazz but really its a truly killer instrument and Id never get rid of mine now.

5798233,0,t3_3uj5jq,Ive used the  watt version of that amp pretty much exactly like that.  Used it exclusively for the bass paired with a relatively low powered PA for backing a folk duotrio doing bars amp smaller pubs and as a stage monitor for the larger spaces with my louder covers band.  The rest of the band like that it can be kept out of the monitor mix keeping that a little less muddy while still able to feel its presence on stage.  It also sounds quite nice at low volumes making it an ideal practice amp.My favourite thing is the tilt design.  Really basic idea but works a treat it pushes a lot of air and projects better than youd think from its modest wattage.,Bass,cxftqrw,1,t5_2qpc3

5942270,0,t3_3wqfnj,The musical idea is nice but I felt like the song kinda lacked delvelopment as its the same two sequences alternating for the entire piece without any real change in dynamics harmony structure or general sound. Simply pur even if I personally liked the bass line and melody it got a bit boring for me after a while you have to make us know that the song is going somewhere. Add some more chords modulate play around with the dynamics add a solo add a different part to the song hell even just keeping the song the same and playing around with some effects would have made it more interesting. As much as you might find composing fun whether you like it or not youve got to do it with a listener in mind and ask yourself is somebody really going to listen to this for a full  minutes? Would I?

I found a nice walkthrough of how he gets his tone so if you want to mimic this more up to you  For a Pbass itll be less midsy but with his  scale they might be more similar. Id say you could also go for steel roundwounds .. depending on how you like your tension but they do tear up nickel frets a bit  Theyd be a bit brighter than the incubus tone but youll cut through a mix pretty well,Bass,cyn7l6b,3,t5_2qpc3

6140473,0,t3_3znbyf,Even if you think it sucks see the song out. Record it finish it move on to another one. Sit on it for a while then come back and listen to it it might actually suck or it might be good and you have a mental block or most of it could be not great but there are good parts that you can reuse elsewhere or develop more.Even if you write  full songs start revisiting them and realize that none of them are very good hey  you still wrote  songs more than most people in the world and thats pretty cool. Then just keep writing and writing and writing. If you keep at it you will most likely get better over time but if you never finish a song even a crappy one you wont ever really develop.As you write have somebody whos opinion you trust who can listen back for you. Somebody who isnt afraid to praise you when you do well and somebody who can also call something shit if it is  and dont get offended if they do! Remember that its all part of the learning process. When doing this only play for them complete or mostly complete songs  not productionwise just acoustic and vocal or something  because if you play partial bits and pieces and they dont like it it will most likely encourage you to scrap it and not complete something.Finally find somebody to cowrite with you if you can. If you have any buddies who are more experienced than you at writing that you can take a verse or a chorus to and develop the rest of the song with them. This is a really great way to build confidence and get outside perspectives you may not have.Good luck and have fun!

In music terms If you ever struggle with playing a bass line just play it right the first time. Read if you cant play.. Really strange that a musician cant see the you learn more by practical examples than theoretical ones. Yeah you can read and watch tutorials but you also need to make mistakes and potentially screw something up. It is just a better way to learn the limits. Before you step over them the limits are just arbitrary.. they dont mean that much dont tighten the string too much doesnt mean so much before your neck is bent and you actually experience the instrument being dreadful to play.It is very clear that youre a pure musician.. you dont pick apart your Ferrari for fun thats what you do with a banged up FordEdit Rule ,Bass,cyzfoup,1,t5_2qpc3

Why is that? So if I have a white bass I cant play in a black metal band? I have a friend that rocks a Thunderbird in a country band it doesnt matter because hes a great player. People dont dismiss him because of his bass and the genre he plays. When I was discussing options for my custom bass I straight up told the luthier I dont care what it looks like I want it to sound like this. I think sound is so much more important than the look of a bass. If youre that worried about colour buy a black bass its a classic colour and is versatile enough for any genre. ,Bass,czfz824,4,t5_2qpc3

Then you can use a razorblade to get under the fret and start lifting it up so you can grab it with pliers and yank it out. I filled my frets with wood filler but I should have used wood glue mixed with sawdust. Build up the filler a little bit then sand it all down flat with a soft sanding block.

This was an all new set list full of songs Id never heard before with the exception of listening to them on Youtube real quick to grab the changes and maybe half of them run through in rehearsal and a good chunk of them Id never played before so I was already a little on edge. By set three my guitar player decided to throw out the damn set entirely and just make up a new one on the spot chock full of songs Id never played or even heard before. Hed call out the key and a quick rundown of the verse changes and away wed go with me desperately trying to listen as hard as Ive ever listened for cues where the song might change it up.

Recently I took em off the fretless and put them on my other Washburn and put the roundwound set on the fretless because bored winter why not.Some people say that flats generate an uncomfortable amount of drag or friction but I love the feel of playing flatwound strings regardles of frets or no. Its... um... slippery thatll work.I buy strings from a small music store in my village rather than online. Even though I could probably get them cheaper on the Net and would have a much larger selection I like meatworld music stores especially ones that have an official greetercat like this one does and hope that my meager purchases there help them keep the lights on.      Bottom line I get whatever they happen to have on the shelf so Im not wellversed in the different brands.Another trick to try with your shiny new Pbass is a piece of mediumdense foam tucked under your strings right in front of the bridge. This will give you an oldschool thump. I played country with a Pbass for a buncha years at one point tuning it BEAD.

I enjoyed your bass lines and like your style as a Geddy Lee fan as well however what youre doing is a lot more complex than whats going on with the guitardrums.  It may have been a little over ambitious in the given context of the song.  So as a bass player I enjoyed listening to your bass lines.  But many nonbass players do not focus on the bass and are more influenced by the sound as a whole.  It may have more impact to simplify perhaps only during the chorus.

7044918,0,t3_4c1f9u,My church is more of a collection of mostly relatives that only congregate when the Lord tells us to. When we get together we dont rehearse we just wing everything. The Lord leads us in what to do. He could tell someone to request any song from Amazing Grace to something someone in the family wrote to contemporary music. Whatever is laid on our hearts is what is done. We seemingly randomly jump from one thing to another so you always have to pay attention which is not my strong suit. Pretty often Ill be praying something and we start playing!Im still kinda new to it so I just watch the guitarists and listen for key words pun intended. I have a pretty good sense of how music especially gospel works. Its easy for me to feel changes and react.

So upshot is you really should make sure and try any bass youre considering including playing it standing up with a strap.

7666554,0,t1_d3a21km,Haha thats stolen from Glenn Fricker. As far as improving picking while sitting down it honestly wears my forearm outif I want to sit down and write lines I usually end up strapping the instrument on and letting it hang off kind of to my righthand pick hand side. The best thing you can do is select appropriate seatinguse a stool or any chair that a doesnt have arm rests and b doesnt position your hips lower than your knees when youre seated. I use one of those officecomputer chairs that has the lever that engages a pneumatic lift. Theres one solid trick to making low strap heights comfortable for your fret hand get the instrument to lean forward on its axis. Hold your right arm out over the neck then rotate your wrist so your thumb moves upyou want your bass to twist that way so the fretboard ends up facing more toward the floor than your face. This will allow your wrist to line up with your forearm closer to the way it does when you strap up higher. It will sacrifice some visibility but thats good because you want to learn to not have to always be dependent on eyeballing your fretboard so you can eyeball pretty ladies in the audience instead.  Getting a bass to lean is tricky with standard body shapes especially if they have belly carves I strongly dislike belly carves. I imagine you have a standard body shape with the strap button mounted to the end of the horn. Its actually easier to get the lean with an unusual body shape like an Explorer Flying V or Thunderbird since the neckside strap button will be mounted on the back of the instrument and they usually have no belly carve or hardly anythis  makes the instrument lean automatically. You could have a tech move your strap button to the back of the horn to mimic this or do it yourself.  You can also try wearing a belt with a big buckle to force the bass to lean making sure to wrap the hem of your T shirt around it if you have a somewhat precious instrument that you dont want to scratch up. ,Bass,d3dn65j,1,t5_2qpc3

7727567,0,t1_d3kipz2,Ah I see. I took you to mean you should learn chords before you learn the concept of a scale.   Certainly practicing lots of different scales has very limited usefulness. It would be much better to just learn the concept of a scale then start learning chords. Although I might think it smart to learn the major scale before all the chord business. Considering how heavily chords build on it.  And maybe a simple pentatonic minor scale so youve got something to noodle on thatll sound good regardless.,Bass,d3kkj46,1,t5_2qpc3

8106402,0,t3_4q6f8s,I agree with many others here. Focus on learning one instrument before adding another. Acoustic bass is quite different from electric bass. Also a really good and stageworthy acoustic bass can be difficult to find and quite expensive. Lots of lower end acoustic basses that Ive played dont work on a loud stage with stage monitors. These lower end acoustic basses will resonate with the sonic vibrations of the bass amp guitar amp stage monitors etc. and feedback like crazy. My recommendation if your wanting more gear and can still afford lessons is to get a stage worthy amp x cab x cab x and a  x etc. and enough power to push through more than  watts and some effects personally Im a huge fan of the GTB boss multieffects pedal. Super glue is your friend. A couple of layers of super glue over your cut will allow you to play without opening it back up until it heals. ,Bass,d4r8dfm,1,t5_2qpc3

It is harder to fill out the mix when you dont have that bottom. They will sometimes tune their kick drums a bit higher too so they have more punch and it works but without the bass it is hard to make the mix sound anything but thin. As a sound engineer I always feel like you need it there to balance out the mix. Even if it is just some guy hitting the root.

A fender maple board jazz neck with dots wouldnt have existed until the early s. The three bolt plate was used from the mid s on but the black matching headstock and white pickguards would have been features of a s jazz.

8485331,0,t1_d61t040,One thing that recently helped me and my band with clearing up our sound was putting our amps as far away as possible from where we are standing. Should be obvious and maybe your doing that already but I have seen many bands doing the same mistake. Since we are doing it that way we are playing at much lower volume while sounding so much more energetic and dynamic. You need to hear how the instruments mix as what a listener would actually hear and not only what your amp is doing even if dat feedback feels so damn good. Im not that big of a Rush fan I like it once in a while. Always been more of a Pink Floyd King Crimson ELP guy in regards to prog. But there is so much to learn about sounds from Geddy.

8564550,0,t3_4wf0x1,Hi all!Took me way too long but I began practicing with my first band ever last week.  I have no issues with my playing but volume is a problem.I have an Acoustic B and a TC Electronics  watt head and just cant get enough volume out of it to keep up with the drummer and guitarist.  We are  practices in and I have been borrowing someones Yorkville w head that is being stored in the shared practice space were using Ive been given permission dont worry P.  The Yorkville has been great but I wont be able to use it forever and its not for sale.Questions because ohms and watts confuse me stillIs there anything I can do to get more volume out of what I have?  Ive got the volume on the head nearly maxed out as well as the volume on my Sansamp DI still not loud enough and getting a little distorted.  The cab is  ohms and my head says  ohm minimum load.  My drummer said something about rewiring the cab to make it ohms as well what would that do?If I need to upgrade to a bigger head should I absolutely not get anything more than w so it matches the wattage of the cab?  My current understanding is you can go smaller but dont go bigger or youll risk blowing something.  How great is that risk?Basically if I need a new head what watts and ohms should I shoot for to maximize my volume potential?  Do I need a wohm head to match the specs of the cab?both my band mates have experience playing shows and touring so figuring this out before too long is a must.Thanks in advance! ,Bass,d6c5bb6,1,t5_2qpc3

Im sorry but no matter how thick of a string youre going to use youre better off just tuning a  gauge string up from standard. Theres a reason why Meshuggah does this. The only reason Nollys low F is even remotely audible is because of the  scale on that part of his fanned fret bass and the fact that he has about . grand worth of compression and preamps going into a . grand Axe Fx with further modulation. Even after all this Meshuggahs live tone blows Peripherys out of the water and I think the fact that the bass and guitars are closely matched octave wise has a lot to do with that Except for when they play ObZen.

These things arent always practical for gigs though. You could try a split coil or hum cancelling jazz bass pickup. A split coil J is essentially like a P bass pickup in a single housing this nordstand for example There are some that use dummy or stacked coils like the fender noiseless pickups though I think those generally come as a set. ,Bass,d86axfi,4,t5_2qpc3

9114540,0,t3_553p1h,How are you adding chromatic notes? If you limit them to the notes in between Ms and the M you are only keeping track of five notes but have the option of playing up to nine.  e.g.         vs         You can also fit three diatonic modes into the pentatonic in a similar way but I think it is easier to focus on the half steps between  amp  and  amp  through all the octaves then connect them with whole steps. This way you only keep track of four notes per octave but play all seven. You can make it even simpler by remembering that  amp  and  amp  are a P apart so they are the same two frets one string over.  amp  and  amp  are a P apart so they are two frets higher and one string over.  e.g.           becomes          Memorizing fewer notes but keeping track of how they fit together will let you play more notes. ,Bass,d87f5dg,7,t5_2qpc3

You would have the advantage of not having played before so learning fresh opens you up to the idea before getting into any habits.Traditionally the crossover thing is usually because people like to play the hihats with their dominant hand or lead hand as there may be more complexities on it as opposed to playing the snare with the weak hand.Playing open handed with no crossover isnt all that common but plenty of drummers play this way and play well. Another thing...One of the most famous drummers of alltime is a lefty but plays on a right handed kit. That would be Ringo Starr. He was on Conan awhile back and sort of explained the difficulty when doing fills as a lefty playing a right handed kit.Edit There is another video here that is more in depth with him showing and example of it on the kit as well.,Bass,d9372vf,1,t5_2qpc3

Theyre not really flatwounds   these are both of the ground round variety.

Reddit just doesnt have the required functionality.My idea would be to add a rule and enforce a Feedback Requested tag on any thread promoting a users music. Feedback Requested promotes discussion because its a call to action and it ensures its fair to say speak your mind about the offering  which should minimise people downvoting you for offering criticism. Also posters who are simply seeking to selfpromote will think twice about hitting Submit if theres a good chance people are going to get their red pens out.Once again obviously Im not a mod but thats what Id do if I wanted to take an action and even though we do seem to be getting more selfpromotion some of which has been quite shameless recently the quantity isnt problematic enough to really require a change.,Bass,d9dobsg,2,t5_2qpc3

9709797,0,t1_da9vn9p,Make sure to sight down the neck along both edges of the fretboard. A constant bow up or down is normal and provided the truss rod isnt broken something that you can adjust. If the neck undulates up and down or you see a twist where one side drops off more than the other its probably screwed. This is a particularly big deal with a neck through because youre not going to have any reasonable options to replace the neck if its toast. Another thing to look carefully for is cracks biggest trouble spots Ive seen being the neck pocket which wont be an issue on this bass cracks at the tuner holes not necessarily an insurmountable issue but definitely something to take into account when discussing price and then right around the nut area  both directly underneath the nut and also on the back of the neck. Some headstock styles are structurally weaker than others and more prone to cracking if the bass has been dropped. While youre looking for cracks also get a good luck all along the fretboard and make sure you dont see it separating from the rest of the neck. ,Bass,da9xw89,1,t5_2qpc3

9756939,0,t3_5eub10,At the risk of sounding like an insufferable snob I think the easiest way to spot a novice bass player is by how often they bring up guitar and feel the need to compare the instruments usually complete with an inferiority complex that just makes me sad. The most important part of playing an instrument with other people imo is to play off one another and allow what youre playing to complement what theyre playing. If you want to take a more traditional approach to bass and lay in the pocket then do it. If your guitarist is playing rhythmically and you want to play something melodic over it go right ahead. If you wanna play some annoying slap shit to please the crowd knock yourself out. If you just bought a shit load of pedals and want to knock some teeth out with brutal noise rock riffs then please for the love of God do it and post videos on here. Youre a musician first and a bass player second. I dont give a fuck about what all the old dudes did before you play how you like until you find a sound that resonates with both yourself and others. I love James Jamerson and Pino Palladino I love them so much but they already exist and we have hundreds of songs by both of them. This is an art form not a popularity contest. If you want to play like Jamerson then go right ahead but if you want to push the boundaries of the instrument then dont let the conformists get you down.

9909876,0,t3_5hcvn9,Various things to consider. Total power. As people have said elsewhere the  is only W  . Now you might think that doubling the power output means double the volume but actually you need to multiply the power output by  to get twice the perceived volume  and thats assuming that the loudspeakers can handle it. So really an increase from W to W is going to have a lot less impact than you might think.  . Speaker surface area. The limiting factor in a bass rig is more likely to be the amount of air that the speakers can move not the maximum power of the amplifier. Assuming that all speakers have the same maximum excursion a x with .m of surface area will shift more air than a x with .m of surface area.  . You can do the maths until the cows come home but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

10052910,0,t1_dbhwmcg,Graph tech is what I put on my own stuff. Great choice there.Uh...k isnt a cap value. Caps are measured in Farads. Most common in guitar land aremfd  micro farad aka uf. u representing the greek symbol lowercase mu but on typical keyboards we just use a lowercase u since its far easier. mfd typically guitar tone control. mfd typically bass tone control a higher value cuts more treble since bass has less you need more cut to hear an effect. mfd low volume brightness cap aka treble bleed circuit. In case youre not familiar when you turn down your volume control youll disproportionally lose high end the low volume brightness cap fixes that and gives you a more even sweep as you turn down your volume control. There are other benefits and characteristics that I can get into but thats the general basics. Those are about the only value caps Ive ever seen in an instrument. You can sometimes find weird inbetween stuff or slightly off values but overall everything tends to be around those numbers. You dont know what the function of said cap was?

I read you dont have an audio interface. I suggest getting an analog mixer with an audio interface built in instead. I bought a yamaha mgxu on sale for  but it costs  dollars new. I noticed an immediate increase in sound quality in my recordings. Itll give you good equalization compression and effects for around the same price as an audio interface. And it adds the extra benefit of getting you used to a mixing console. And many terms and more advanced recording jargon uses a looooot of analog mixing terms.

The most likely situation is that youll lose a string so obviously spare strings are needed. Spare batteries too. nd most likely situation is a lead failure so have that covered. Next most likely issues are an input failure or a nut snapping and this is when you start getting into really long odds especially if you regularly check your bass for wear and tear in those areas.I know that the idea of taking no backup bass might make some people uncomfortable and thats totally fine but a reliable bass really shouldnt fail during the short duration its on stage unless its been badly looked after.,Bass,dc1r2lj,1,t5_2qpc3

10272589,0,t3_5n0k5u,Just think of all youre accomplishing.  Electric bass is a super easy instrument because of its role and anatomy.  If you know you want to make it your life and be a great bassist then you have to commit to it.  The more you practice the better you get and no one knows any more short cuts than the next guy.  If you went full Olympic athlete and practiced your craft  hours a day youd be among the best bass player in the world in a couple years.  I understand its hard to sacrifice that much of your life though so here are three things that could helppractice buddy find someone with whom to set time aside daily and shed.  I did this in college with a drummer and learned a whole lot about myself.  Wed play through songs with a metronome a lot.  You get to learn a lot about your tendencies going through different sections and tempos.  It also helped with motivation.find brainless exercises  I used to not believe in this but it makes sense.  Whenever you learn anything youre training either your mind your body or both.  Most things in bass use both.  However things like flexibility and strength require very little brain power.  Robert Bubby Lewis has a cool little masterclass on YouTube where he talks about how he got his hands to stretch out the way they do.  I think he basically said to basically stretch your hand a lot to get your hand to stretch more.  Fucking brilliant.  He also said that hed sit in front of the TV with his bass and put his hand into a difficult chord shape and just hold it there for as long as hed watch TV.  I think there have been studies about physical training while being distracted and while its less effective...its still super effective.  Think of a bunch more exercises you can do in front of a tv or a computer without having to think at all really.  just know that practice efficiency is borderline negligible unless all you do is dick around.  If you give genuine time to learning your craft your time will be just as valuable as anyone elses.  If one person practices  hours in their life time and one practices  hours the  person will know more and have a more conditioned body.  Whether the person is better depends on your taste and what they spent their time getting better at.  Thats why you basically have to be your own favorite bassist after a fair amount of practice.  No one else cares about exactly what you care about enough to practice it as much as you do....at least over thousands of trials.TLDR If you wanna get better at playing bass you gotta play bass.,Bass,dc8gcy0,1,t5_2qpc3

10292514,0,t1_dc9buyz,You say you have your shoulder hiked up  do you sling your bass really high?  Because if your playing position causes you to hold tension in your shoulder youre going to have a bad time  its the equivalent of holding a barbell shoulder raise for an extended time and the fact that the tension isnt symmetrical across your back will only compound the problem.  Make sure your bass is at a height that allows you to keep your shoulders more or less level without putting any effort it.Constantly assess your posture  while youre playing ask yourself if youre tensing any muscle and if you are focus on keeping it relaxed.  The only muscular effort you should be putting in should be your handsforearms as little as possible in both your fingering and fretting arms avoiding unnecessary tension and your core to keep your back straight.What with your weight training I imagine you have a load more insight into what muscle groups do what compared to most of us  just apply the same theory to your playing!,Bass,dcapnfb,1,t5_2qpc3

That said going from one Jazz to another would probably give you a minimum tone difference though the playability may be vastly different. I would imagine that the change to a Rick  or any other style of bass Pbass hollow body humbuckers ... would give you another different canvas for your effects. As others mention the blend may solve your desire for more of the instruments tone. Another possibility if you want more of your fundamental bass sound in your tone you may want to investigate preamps other than the SansAmp. Its defining your tone as you point out because thats what it does. Thats one reason its popular it can make affordable gear sound more like a popular bass tone or two. You could give Eden Phil Jones or Aguilar or someone a try. You might find that you can get the shaping abilities you want with a more transparent sound of your guitar.,Bass,dd2mi4q,2,t5_2qpc3

Theres no point in making things needlessly complicated. If youre in C major and you go to F sure you can think about all the notes in F Lydian and make sure youre staying in it. But its easier to just think about the notes in C Ionian and emphasize the F instead.Again every song is technically modal. People dont pick and choose when songs are written modally they all are whether they plan it that way or not. Louie Louie is modal and so is Surfing With The Alien. I dont know if the Kingsmen had serious discussion about writing a song in Ionian but I bet Joe Satriani did plan on writing a song in Dorian.

My instinct would be to scoop the mids but it also depends on the room youre playing in you may need some midrange to cut through.If youre not comfortable with walking bass lines you may be in for a shock with this gig.

Keep in mind though the pickups most likely wont be as good and the wood will probably be of a lower grade as well as the parts will be made of a lower grade metal that will warp over the years. Having said that some Asian builders will use the American parts and just build it there to be cheaper like Schecter. They turn out to be amazing instruments.

11336935,0,t1_dfgzn57,Caveat emptor Im by no means an advanced bass player but Im improving and have some strong opinions on how my practice should be structured. Everyone is different but I like to break my practice sessions down into distinct segments  Warmup  for me this is usually just running some scales and arpeggios to get my fingers loosened up. There are a million different ways to warm up.  Technique practice  one my fingers are warmed up Im ready to work on some physical technique stuff. Lately Ive been spending a time on playing and shifting without looking at my hands. This could be anything that youre trying to work on though from basic hand technique stringskipping muting finger independence uptempo double stops slapping picking and the list goes on and on. It all depends on what level youre at and what your goals are.  Theorymusic practice  I like to then take the time to sit down and work on whatever musical stuff Im trying to learn. Maybe Im working on walking over chord changes or trying to get modes under my fingers and learn how to apply them. Again this is dependent upon your knowledge needs and goals.  Fun  finally I like to always make time for something fun that hopefully incorporates the things Ive been learning. That could be transcribing a song just jamming around pretending Im a rock star whatever. This is where Ill take the time to very deliberately work on a lick or bass line that I want to learn. I still try to make it productive but sometimes I just noodle. Playing should be fun so its important to make time for that but to also realize that you cant spend every practice session noodling and expect to improve efficiently and effectively. Some thoughts I will say that a lot of my practice is dictated by my teacher. Its been so helpful taking real lessons and having someone guide my learning. Its hard to figure out what and how to learn when you dont know what you dont know ya know? Also these segments arent always as distinct as this post makes them sound. You should be using proper form and technique while working on theoretical and musical concepts and you should be thinking about what things mean musically while youre doing finger independence drills so everything is reinforcing what youre learning in other areas. Finally I think its totally okay to deviate from your lesson plan. Sometimes you pick up your bass and just flat out dont feel like working on something youve been learning. Thats okay. Do something else and come back to the other thing later or tomorrow. Just remember that the more time and effort you put in to the basic stuff the bigger the payoff and the higher your ceiling will be as you begin to progress. ,Bass,dfh0ssb,5,t5_2qpc3

11529055,0,t1_dg2qfdy,To me this sounds like it may be electronic rather than a physical bass. You could get this sound out of quite a few different basses and if by midrange you mean    for the bass Id look at Fender MIM Schecter Ibanez Yamaha and other brands. Consider buying used if you want to stretch your budget some. For recording youd probably be best off putting a dry signal in then adding compression impulses and effects after.I assume your church has a backline and PA. You can go straight to the board with a DI or preampDI or use their existing bass amp.gt how to not play bass like a guitar playerNot really room for a detailed answer but as a bass player you have two roles supporting the harmony and supportingdriving the rhythm. Guitar players playing bass sometimes emphasize the former resulting in no groove. Not a song youll be playing in church but this James Brown song  illustrates a rhythm section creating the groove.  ,Bass,dg2tjkl,3,t5_2qpc3

11635613,0,t1_dgew3r9,Thats one of the main reasons i bought that preamp pedal ! Straight to the board or to always have my sound when using others rig. I havent played my own amp at a gig since last summer ! One tip that you might not know and based on your comment Im assuming you also use a preampDI pedal instead of plugging it into the input of the amp you are using on stage look for a Power amp in input or an fx loop plug into the Return one.These allow you to completely bypass the preamp of the rig you are using so it is literally just your sound ! ,Bass,dgewr62,3,t5_2qpc3
11636506,0,t1_dgetjwr,Hered be my shopping list for starting out Squier Vintage Modified  Or Ibanez GSR  Fender Rumble   Basic instrument cable ft  Basic gig bag  Guitar stand  Decent basic strap  Hal Leonard bass method  Tuner app  free Metronome app  freeTotal    Youre getting a better bass a nicer practice amp and other stuff that is equivalent or better than the starter pack.  You could shave  bucks off by getting a smaller practice amp and deferring some of the extras. If someone really has the cash to only buy a starter pack then I advise them to play the actual instrument theyll be getting a lot of times these are boxed up at retail. And if the first one sucks have them open another box.Edit removed a stray word,Bass,dgf0ed3,5,t5_2qpc3

I may try that.First this is by far the most common and best! form of music communication. Second you can try but Id assume thatd go horribly. If hes truly  a by ear guy and doesnt know the names of the notes on the fretboard Id doubt hed be able to talk in terms of intervals. You can show him nashville numbers and see but Im guessing if he truly doesnt know the notes that means he hasnt bothered to learn and Im guessing he wont bother to learn numbers either. ,Bass,dgnqd9k,3,t5_2qpc3
