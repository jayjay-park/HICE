3480,0,t3_1u3xvx,I agree with everything thats been said but I also want to add that most high poverty urban schools are staffed by our most inexperienced teachers.  Teach for America was built to help staff our schools and in these programs we get recent college graduates who are earning their credentials while they teach.  Lowincome urban schools also tend to hire more teacher interns like TFA they are earning their credentials as they teach.  We all know that teaching is something you need to practice and new teachers dont have the experience to have good classroom management.  New teachers without support enter and leave the profession within two years and the cycle of new teachers going into these schools continue.  My first two years of teaching were helish but I loved my students and I wanted to make a difference.  Now that Im in the middle of my th year Im finally getting to be an effective teacher because I know my resources know how to manage my classrooms behavior and I know Im not alone.  ,teaching,ceeu155,2,t5_2qyj9

I have always had students ask inappropriate questions and I usually deflect them that way or if it really does not matter I am married with two kids and freely share this with the students if asked then I just tell them and go on with my teaching.  If you are not comfortable with a question or think the question or the answer are problematic just redirect in an obviously silly but appropriate way and you shouldnt have any more problems.....they will tire of asking eventually and move onto something else or some other gossip.,teaching,cekmnn3,3,t5_2qyj9

Most of the parents are so very grateful for making their childs kinder year fun. Cons Those lovelt songs get stuck in your head. They still have accidents... and . All those games? They have to get made...by me. You have no downtime...no days where you can assign something to read or give them work time for a project or paper. And you know what sucks the most? Often being the first person to tell andor try to convince a parent that their child isnt perfect. That theyre showing signs of autism or adhd. That theyre academically far behind their peers usually bc the parent hasnt talked to the poor child for the last five years much less anything else.

452312,0,t3_1z8lkf,gtI have had a liberal policy for these things so far having high expectations for the students.Relaxing boundaries is easy trying to rein those boundaries in is a struggle. Basically it seems as if you have given them too much freedom before they prove they can handle it. Remember you are not dealing with adults. There is a reason society restricts both their rights and responsibilities at that age.gtI know its Friday guys but stay with me.Bad move. While you think you are showing empathy they see it as an excuse for inappropriateslack behaviour. If you wish to acknowledge that it is Friday and they may be tired etc say I know it is Friday but it is still a school day. Your weekend does not start until pm. It sets boundaries and clarifies your expectations.gtI said this about a million times. Still faces were lit by cellphones and jaws were flapping. I kept calling people out telling them to be quiet put their phones away.What is the schools rule regarding phones? I find it hard to believe they are allowed to use them in class. I find it best to have a no nonsense policy. Either confiscatewrite up students.I am not going to go though the rest of your blog and critique each step so I will summarise.First the good. You seem to be a teacher that really cares and possibly more importantly with your age group one who is prepared. I really like your attitude you want to teach you want to make a difference and you want to do better.Now the bad. As mentioned above I think your intention to treat them as adults has backfired. For one very important reason they are not adults. I do like the fact you acknowledge you are the adult among them. This leads me to an incredibly important point it is clear they are unsure where their boundaries are. Think of it from a students point of view. Certain behaviours are okay but when too many students behave that way all of a sudden that is wrong. This is expressed through your surprise at the manner in which a certain student who usually isnt a problem behaved. Even good students have bad days.All that being said every teacher has lessons that simply dont work. If you can sense that for whatever reason that a lesson is going nowhere dont bang your head against a wall frustrating yourself and pissing off your students. Use it as an opportunity to build relationships. If you cant get the students talking about your lesson content at least get them talking to you. I see that youre teaching social studies no subject is better for class debates. Open the floor to views encourage students to back them up with historical evidence encourage others to debunk views with more evidence Do not make judgments on their views but do discuss why they might be factually inaccurate if that is the case. Talk a little about yourself bring your family history into the discussion encourage students to do the same.All the best.,teaching,cfrod3k,11,t5_2qyj9

I just glued flashcards I printed to construction paper and laminated them and color coded them by which word list they were.  The fourth grade group I have is super competitive and really gets into it.  My first graders like it too but they cannot remember where the cards are at all so it takes forever unless I give them very few cards.  I make them say the words when they flip the card but also let the other students help them if they dont know them.Another game I have used is chutes and ladders.  The student rolls the dice because I hate spinners then draws a card from their sight word pile and if they say it right they get to move.  If they get it wrong I tell them the word and they dont move.  I used that when I had a small group of kids from all different grade levels because it was easy to differentiate especially since I had already color coded the cards for my lists.  That one was more of a review game and motivation to learn the sight words so they could win next time.

2510885,0,t3_2nntmh,By the way I did this after meeting a sub who had been doing this for  years. She seemed so happy. And her advice changed my life. Yes I switched from permanent teaching to substitute teaching. And it saved my life. Before I tell you my story take a minute and consider that the vast majority of people who responded to OP are fulltime teachers. Theyre people who do not want to hear that some people are gaining all their benefits with such little effort. And theyll justify their own life choices with words like vocation studentteacher relationships etc. But let me show you the other perspective.During my th year of teaching I found myself on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I liked working with the kids but I had enough of the job itself. So I quit teaching full time and reenter the Occasional Teaching list thats what we call subs in Canada. So working in Canada like a few others have mentioned below I got my French teaching certification. Since then the changes to my life have been extraordinary. Let me list them. Benefits Where I work you need roughly  workdays to get full benefits. As a French teacher its very to get this. You can even take off weeks on end and easily reach this number. So fulltime work doesnt have an advantage in this regard.. Relationships with the kids I love working with kids. I always have. A few people here wrote that its impossible to establish relationships with children if youre just a sub. Ignore them because its simply not  true. My school board is way short on French teachers not even close to the quota so I get to go to some of the best schools in the city over and over again. And thats where I establish my relationships. The kids are thrilled any time that I return. . What about the bad kids? Thats the best part about just being a sub. If you ever have a bad class or go to a very bad school you dont have to ever return. I get to choose which classes I return to because I have them all documented over the last few years.. No more dealing with those  bad apples on a daily basis While I liked  of the kids that I taught when I was permanent I used to cringe at the thought of facing the  kids that I couldnt stand on a daily basis. With subbing you get to see these kids infrequently. Or not at all if theyre very bad. Its really up to me. And I love it.. Not dealing with unlikeable coworkers No more bickering no more fake smiles no more gossiping. Some teachers I worked with were literally some of the worse people I had ever met. With subbing you dont have to deal with any of that ever again. The best part of it all is that teachers practically ignore you as a sub.. No more marking lesson planning or report cards Poof. Just like that. My day ends at  pm and thats it. Bye bye. No more using entire prep times to mark. No more working until  pm  a week to finish all the work that I had to do. No more over thinking. So more stressing because planning has always been very difficult for me. You finish at  and thats it.. Extremely light work schedule Ill admit. The payrate is unusually high for substitute teachers and fulltime teachers in Canada and a few select US cities. So you really need to be in the right place to make this work. In the world of teaching its pretty much like winning the lottery. Luckily I realized that I made way more than enough to sustain myself by working only  days a week. Imagine this... days a week. And all these days end at pm.. You can take any day you want off Any day. At any time. I dont even take fullweek assignments anymore because this benefit is just too sweet to let pass.. You cant ever be exploitedIts hard to describe how desperate schools are for any type of French teacher in most Canadian provinces. Basically we have a quote to fill and were insanely short of that number for what seems to be the next  years. Once I was asked by my principal to mark and write report cards for  classes just because the other teacher had suffered an injury. I felt so frustrated. I just flatout couldnt say no since I was working there fulltime. However last year when I became a fullon substitute I did a month long job. At one point the principal asked me to write  units in  week for another injured teacher and somehow have everything marked  week later so that another teacher wouldnt have to pickup that workload when they got back. So... I just quit.  days later I was back at it at another school that I frequented in. No stress. And the kids love me there.Imagine...for a second having the freedom to just say No any time someone tries to exploit you or throw bullshit your way. This freedom is actually priceless. Its almost overwhelming especially because its so rare. . But what if you do need money?Easy. I take a  month or  week position. As a French teacher its laughably easy once youre on a specific list. Theyll take you in a heartbeat. I also sold my car which saves me thousands a year. Riding the bus is a very small sacrifice to make when you so much to gain....So I get all the benefits of working fulltime I build relationships with my students I get paid as well as fulltime teachers I get all the benefits without any of the bullshit associated with teaching. I feel like I won the lottery in life. And I feel extremely fortunate. Ill admit I do work very hard to be the best sub possible I have readied lesson plans activities movies etc for any type of situation.I understand that this is only possible in certain parts of the world. But if you find yourself in the rare position where you can get all of this by subbing do yourself a favour and ignore what some of haters here have been posting. In the world of teaching and hell employment in general you just won the lottery my friend. ,teaching,cmmb7ia,2,t5_2qyj9
2592977,0,t1_cmwz0nf,Oh please dont! If you need advice find a teacher whose opinion you trust or a GSA advisor at your school if you have one and describe a hypothetical situation and ask how for advice.

2616999,0,t3_2pu3oo,Well so what. So youre not going to cure cancer. Youre not going to solve the problem of global warming. And youre not going to cure AIDS or Ebola or a million other terrible diseases. And youre sure as hell not going to be President or a Senator or hold some other political office and bring about world peace. But you could be the teacher that sparks the interest in science for the students who do cure cancer and find a cure for AIDS and Ebola and a million other diseases and solve Global Warming. You could switch subjects the next year and teach history and spark the interest of students who do become President or a Senator or eventually do hold another political office and bring about world peace. So no youre not living up to your potential. Its true. If you didnt teach you might do one of these things. You might cure cancer. But as a teacher you can help to make ALL of these things happen. Youre multiplying your potential by a thousand and giving little pieces of it away to each student you teach. Youre sharing your enthusiasm your intelligence and your influence with a thousand students. At the end of it all you can look back at your students and see how they took their piece of your potential and used it to change the world. ,teaching,cn06i1q,14,t5_2qyj9

Nothing has changed about our positions relative to other countries since then but what we DO with our schools students teachers and unions certainly has. The purpose of commissioning that report was to discredit public education as yet another thing the government fails at and that framing has been very successful.Perhaps the best answer I can give on why its not so bad is that shouting O tempora! O mores! only scares old people. Were in a transitional period between what I and a lot of other teachers knew as teaching into a new kind of teaching.Whats your subject area how much do you love endless bookkeeping and accountability paperwork and how comfortable are you in an authoritarian environment where your students are no longer... individuals but better thought of as an aggregate mass of data? I mean you could be a math teacher who is strongly authoritarian believes that your curriculum is best dictated by people who arent you prefers secretarial paperwork to being engaged with students and has great discomfort with the idea of students needing individual correctives and extensions within your lessons. In that case teaching will be a breeze for you. If youre in a weird subject that falls between the Common Core cracks like I did believe you have a masters degree because you should be trusted to shape your own curriculum to fit the standards and are a valid assessor of your own students achievements or refuse to have a reverence for the data because these are MY FUCKING STUDENTS my kids and they have individual needs youre not letting me meet plus youve cut my pay and benefits while increasing my workload... well then you may have problems.Theyre looking for a new type of teacher now someone who can follow orders unquestioningly uncomplainingly take on a ridiculous workload for everdecreasing pay and who doesnt mind never getting tenured or having any job security.

If you can say John I asked for your attention could I see your eyes so that I know that youre listening?  will be more effective then just trying to get a class to stop talking.  The mob mentality goes away when a kid gets singled out. Dont speak unless  of students are giving you their attention. If they know that youll let the keep talking then theyll keep talking.  If even two kids are having a conversation something like There are a few people in the back corner by the window that were waiting on which calls the out but doesnt acknowledge them directly  Give them a few moments to transition from talking to not talking.  I do something like By the time I get to zero you should be silent.  ... start wrapping up your conversations... ... you should be focusing your eyes and your body up front ... ... i should have a silent room now... zeroBeing a substitute is tough job and I dont envy you.

Some respond on their own some respond to encouragement some respond to authority some respond poorly. You arent going to get everyones respect with only one approach.But do remember that sometimes students will protest ignorance in order to avoid putting forth effort.

Feel free to disagree with me.A lot of what she has said seems to be a negative description of something close to the truth. It is true that the end of course testing is what matters most because that is the grade the person will declare for the rest of their life. Sure along the way you might have some nice moments where you help a student solve a personal problem or you boost someones confidence but your students will want to do well in their exams  this will be their main goal at school because it is the purpose of school in their eyes. You are the person to help them achieve that goal and when they get there they will be grateful to you.No matter how much some students claim they dont care I promise you they do. Find the most negative antischool student in the world and watch their manner change when they succeed at something. Students pretend not to care because it saves their ego when they make mistakes. Just ignore this and help them get better.You will meet a lot of teachers who complain about the system.

5063526,0,t3_3kc0sl,Most California school districts have their own substitute policies. Most require a passing grade on the CBEST and a background checklive scan with fingerprinting. During emergencies sometimes just a secondary degree is needed. It varies. The commission on teacher credentialing gives out emergency credentials intern credentials preliminary credentials and clear credentials. She is likely better off calling the local school districts individually and asking them how she can register to be a substitute teacher. Your story sounds frustrating. The more rural you go the more in demand substitute teachers are especially with the recent local control funding which has helped districts hire many more teachers.

The students had already discussed propaganda in a historical context and were given the option of an alternative assignment. The teacher wanted the students to understand how propaganda can be wrong and lead people incorrectly. If this was made clear at the beginning of the assignment I dont see a problem with it.

A lot gets lost in translation.  Honestly the best thing for her would be a tutor that also speaks her mother tongue so they can translate the higher level thinking concepts properly or someone who is experienced in teaching ESL.  Even if you used an electronic translator to show her the translated words there would still be a lot of information lost.

7361621,0,t1_d2esgie,Can you summarize project based learning? Problem based learning?  Problem based learning is when students are taught specific content and then solve problems based on instruction of that content.  Project based learning is when students are given an end goal and have to find a way to complete it with knowledgestrategies they already possess and guidance from the teacher.What are the pros and cons of using project based learning as opposed to traditional lecture style?Pros  The students gain skills in problem solving collaboration time management and also learn how to ask questions and find answers to their questions.  The jobs my students will have dont exist yet so I have to teach them how to think and not just to regurgitate information.  Project based learning does this the first project they do is a bit of a shock to them because they are taking control of their learning.  Once they get practice their confidence grows and so does their engagement. There are also a lot of teachable moments in project based learning especially for the gifted kids.  Students are used to there being only  right answer and when there can be multiple answers and they have to decide which is the best one based off their opinion it can make some kids uncomfortable.  The students have to rely on each other and that is amazing to see.  They naturally build each other up.  Another great product of project based learning is students feel like they can make a difference in their academics school community and the world.  It also shows students that reading writing math and science can be used in real life and there is a reason to learn.  My favorite pro is that is takes very little planning! It frees me up to focus on the students vs. the content.  The students take the project and run with it.Cons  Time management is very difficult for both the students and myself.  You want the kids to get the most out of the project but you also cant spend too much time on certain parts.  As I get more experience with PBL I am not expecting my students to make each part perfect because the later parts are affected because of time running out.  Keeping kids on task is also a challenge they are usually broken up into teams and when I travel around to different groups I have to trust my students that they will use their time wisely.  Setting up expectations at the beginning is critical and if you redirect off task students a lot in the beginning by the end of the year they are better at staying on task.  Another con is that your students will create a solution that will be above your expertise and you have to help them find resources in the community to help them and that can be challenging at times.Was project based learning something you were taught about during your initial education for teaching? If so did that method influence any of your school or career choices? If not how did you get involved with project based learning?I graduated in  and was not taught about PBL in my education program.  I watched a  episode about a high school that only has their students solve real world problems for their education and the following year I had my students find a world problem to solve.  I teach rd grade and having  year olds come up with a solution for clean drinking water in Africa can be a bit challenging.  The kids learned a lot and so did I.  Every year since Ive added more and more PBL to my curriculum.What is your favorite aspect of project based learning and what aspect have you had the most difficult time with? What is the most difficult aspect for the students?My favorite aspect is seeing the students excitement.  They truly love being in charge of their learning and they are so much more engaged!  The most difficult for me is helping the kids stay on their timeline this year Ive added a chain link so the kids and I can see how much time we have left before our deadline.  The most difficult part for the kids would be researching information to help solve their problems within their project.  This might be because I teach rd grade and research is a new skill for them but Im not sure how many students K enjoy digging through sources to find the information they need.Do you have any favorite stories or experiences involving project based learning?This year I had my students use Jane Goodalls Roots and Shoots program for their project this year.  They had to follow multiple steps in order to choose their community problem.  My students found that a lot of the member in our city dont know their evacuation route out of the city if the nuclear power plant  miles away had an incident so they made it their goal to educate their community.  We made shirts this year names the campaign Evacuation Education and they brainstormed many solutions. They worked with different experts in our community and are building amazing speaking skills.  They had to raise money in order to print flyers and post cards so they held a bake sale and raised .  They also applied for a  grant and got it!  When they found out how much they had raised they literally screamed and shouted!  It was awesome seeing them celebrate all their hard work and it was all them!  You can check out our Instagram  account to see pictures of their fundraiser and project.Information on myself My name is Monica Hamilton and I have been teaching for  years. I teach rdth grade combo class this year.  I work in a small private school in Iowa and have complete autonomy over my curriculum.  We also cap our class sizes at .

8667290,0,t3_4yfle0,Classroom management has always been tricky for me so while I may not be the greatest mentor for it I have read a lot and observed other teachers who do it better than I do. Heres my advice.. Transparency and Honesty  Make sure that the kids dont just know the rules but also know WHY the rules are what they are. With cell phones for example discuss why they might be distracting and how students especially those who are still building English proficiency might miss important things if they are looking at phones and snapping the chats please dont actually say snapping the chats. I have had moderate success with making a set of classroom rules as a collaborative exercise with students. You can group them so that there are some responsibleish kids in each group or you can do it as a whole class. If the kids make the rules themselves there is way more buyin and you wont have to have the same fights over policy all the time. If you do this activity make sure its as studentled as possible but still guide them so that there arent glaring problems like the lack of a cell phone policy for example. As for honesty sometimes it can help to be upfront with your kids about you being frustrated upset or tired. I would caution against oversharing because it makes you seem fragile or too moody and can be too personal but students do have some understanding that teachers are human and they can sometimes chill out when youre upfront with them about how their behavior affects you. Of course if they dont like you they might not care and thats a thing that happens. But if you are on okay footing with them it might be useful to say You know guys I have to be honest this behavior today is not only disrupting class but its also making me feel really frustrated and disrespected. I think if one of you were up here trying to teach you wouldnt feel so good about how your students were acting. I can understand that its pretty easy to get distracted and want to chat with your neighbor but Im asking you to try not to do that today. We are scientists in this room and we have scientific inquiries ahead of us. I dont want anyone to get left behind. Something like that. Doesnt always work but its worth a shot if youre comfortable with it. Ditto for teaching while youre sick.. Routine and Predictability with followthrough  The number one learning environment and teacher rapport killer is inconsistency. If students dont know what to expect or if their expectations are routinely subverted they will get very frustrated and will misbehave endlessly. If Student A got detention for talking but Student B just got a warning kids will riot. Their ideals about fairness are super strong and they will take it as a sign of disrespect if you dont follow your own stated rules. To support this it can be useful to establish very clear classroom routines and procedures. You can even have kids practice these I would recommend it especially early in the year and even once or twice later on so they remember. Im talking about how to enter the classroom how to get into groups how to turn in homework what to do between entering the room and starting the lesson like taking out HW or writing down the activity etc.. I have a colleague who will literally march kids in and out of the room over and over until they understand how to enter the room. It seems super childish and maybe like a waste of time for something they should already know but it can really save both time and energy later. It sounds like your classroom management has been exhausting so far so doing a big push at this point while tiring now might make this more workable for the future.. Figure out your Buttons  This one is less for the kids and more for you. Figure out what drives you crazy in the classroom. What are your pet peeves? What will make you kick a kid out faster than anything else? What has you going home angry or upset? You dont necessarily have to communicate these to the students though it can be useful as per point  but its crucial for you to understand what bothers you so that you can work on reacting less and less over time. Whether its meditation to calm you mindfulness in the room to react less or setting up specific rules to avoid the triggers its good to have a strategy or five to make you feel less frustrated in the classroom.. Acknowledge your mistakes and apologize when necessary  If inconsistency kills a teachers relationship with students then ignoring mistakes and failing to apologize would be the wake and funeral. If you make a mistake apologize. Misspoke something important? Sorry. Called a kid by the wrong name? Sorry. Said youd give them  minutes but then realized you needed to cut it short? Sorry. Yelled at a kid because you were pissy and not really because that kid deserved it? Sorry. Scored a test wrong? Sorry. It is not a sign of weakness or a deferment of authority to apologize. It can feel embarrassing especially if youre not sure that the kids like or respect you but I PROMISE that apologizing and being genuine about it will earn you points not lose them.  of the angry stories Ive heard from students about teachers have been instances where the teacher either wouldnt admit a wrong or acknowledged the mistake but wouldnt take responsibility for it.Hopefully these help! I know youre already super exhausted but if youre asking for help here instead of applying at your local coffee shop then that means you can still turn this year around! You can make these classes function. You will fuck up. A lot. Probably multiple times a day. You might not even realize youve fucked up for weeks or months. You will feel stupid. A lot. You will regret things. But you will also get smarter more efficient more confident and more competent with every class you teach. And listen to these folks about working with ELL kids and doing assessments. A lot of distracted behaviors are symptoms of a lack of engagement not because kids are just trying to be the worst though some of them are. Some of these students are undoubtedly not able to access the curriculum right now and if you can strategize and scaffold and support them to the point where they can access the curriculum their engagement will skyrocket. At least thats the hope! You can do this.,teaching,d6p14pw,1,t5_2qyj9

For one college teaches skills that go beyond a classroom study skills time management social relationships independence etc.. For another that is where you will get the important content knowledge for your preferred subject or subjects. That is also where you will get training for becoming a teacher. How else do you properly learn classroom management inclusion lesson planning and everything else one needs to know in order to teach?There is a certain amount of learning on the job but college no doubt prepares you for it. The certification exams are not challenging and DO NOT prove a mastery of the subject and certainly do not provide any proof of teaching ability.

11381331,0,t1_dflmk17,I love kindergarteners EXCEPT when they start learning to lie convincingly. I think its really cool that they develope this type of intelligence at this age it takes clever wits to pass a lie but it makes me sad when I see the cute honest little ones grow into their manipulation skills...,teaching,dfm1zan,7,t5_2qyj9
11387444,0,t3_62fm6s,As a teacher of freshman at a big school Ive learned that being stern but caring in the beginning of the year is helpful. Also I always forget not to show my sarcasm too soon. Every year Im sarcastic before the end of September and I always want to kick myself for it. Cant help it its a big part of who I am. But as soon as they realize that youre not super serious all they want to do is play. Also truly make an effort to know who they are. Or have nice silly inside jokes with them either as a class or individuals or both. ,teaching,dfmqxc9,10,t5_2qyj9

The rudiments of the profession are not difficult to grasp and the qualifications are easy to acquire.  Its really not difficult at all to become a teacher.  So I guess thats a plus?  I dunno.Putting it to practice is a whole different story though.  You probably of course there are exceptions wont really get the hang of it until after at least a couple of years of experience during all of which you are holding the education of real people in your hands and have mountains of paper work to keep up with.  The first year of teaching really is hell for those reasons.  On top of that youre very likely going to be working with students who either dont realize that learning is worth it or have preconceived false notions of what they are and are not capable of.  Burnout is a very real danger in this profession.If you can handle the stress long enough to get good at it youll start to reap the rewards.  Its a REALLY fun job.  You get to connect with and help mold the minds of countless students.  You get to be a mini celebrity famous or infamous on your own little campus.  You get to spend all day engaging with material that you presumably love and if youre good your students will start to care as much as you do.Finally the better you get the more you realize that those easy rudiments you learned are just that rudiments.  In order for you to really be effective you have to continuously keep up your professional development and keep an open mind about what your classroom should look like. You never stop learning and adapting your class.  If you do you get bad.The pay is what it is.  You can carve out a good retirement from it but youre definitely not going to be the richest of your friends.Hope I helped.,teaching,dg83g00,44,t5_2qyj9

If you have a good relationship with your admin let them know and get some good references. Lifes too short to spend it like that ,teaching,dg9slq1,3,t5_2qyj9

11730443,0,t3_67cf6m,We are a project based school technically inquiry  now we have a great deal more choice in assignment making as we make few directions on resulting models and allow a ton of technology.  I am planning to start a maker closet next year where we can collect recyclable maker materials  thin cardboard to build with and leftover materials gathered from previous projects.  I have also started saving poster boards and showing kids how to cover them with paper or use the back in case they cant get a board I have already seen several of the lesser productive kids scavenge these.I started realizing how tight some of the timelines are to get materials and produce for the kids that parents might not have time to get to the store that night.  I know as a parent myself I might have to schedule an extra trip to the store a week out due to our schedule.  I hope this will help my students in a similar situation and would love ideas to make it more beneficial.,teaching,dgpocpr,2,t5_2qyj9
