149909,0,t3_1vssst,The best ones arent free but they only cost a dollar.  I did the free credit score offer for a buck and cancelled  days later so I didnt enroll in a monthly credit monitoring program. Kobo books was a good offer too. I bought a book for  cents for a couple hundred diamonds. Credit sesame was a good free one.  I also made a junk mail account for a few auto and home insurance offers.,MySingingMonsters,cevi7j0,2,t5_2x8bv

8814097,0,t3_50vpfo,I think it just means that when trying for ethereal monsters you have that much greater chances of breeding itEx if ur trying for a ghazt on plant island your chances of breeding it are  times greater than usual normally its very hard to succeed in breeding one..if I am wrong I apologize in advance ,MySingingMonsters,d77c1xk,2,t5_2x8bv
