1596362,0,t3_2ciun1,    . How do you think this season will go?I think it will be a lot harder and we may struggle. I know it was only a friendly but our normal starting defence looked shocking against Brentford. Not what us CPFC have come to expect in Pulis era. I also think the lack of new players quality could expose us. Campbell I am not convinced about at Premier League level. Hes been to quite a few clubs but never really achieved. After watching Hangeland for the last  years at Fulham had season tickets there too is slow and clumsy. He has height and experience and that is about it. I think teams know our strong defensive and catch you on the counter tactics that will be better prepared for us. As long as we avoid relegation I would take that now.    . Which  players should other fans watch out for?Bolasie  Quick skillful but needs to add goals to his Premiership career Ward  My player of . Consistent technically brilliant and always looks comfortable no matter what position he is in or who he is up against. Jedinak  The captain bosses midfield. My memory of Jedinak last season was when he pummeled Giroud in a . Like Ward he always looks comfortable on the ball. Very important to Palace.    . How will the team line up?                  Speroni  Should start until performances dictate Hennesey  Mariappa  Delaney  Dann  WardPuncheon  Jedinak  Ledley  Bolasie             Chamakh                    Campbell,crystalpalace,cjge2xa,2,t5_2tqdj

He seems like an easy target for the right wing press  and I have no doubt that they will pull him apart before the next election. Im glad that even after how Ed was attacked in the previous election that labour have chosen an even more left leaning leader now. I agree with many of his ideas. Im all for renationalisting the railways for example. I also disagree with several of his ideas such as leaving the EU. He does seem to be alienating a lot of people within his own party  though which bodes badly. The best impact he has had though by far is getting younger people interested in politics. It irks me that at every election fewer and fewer young people turn up to vote. This means that politicians hark on about pensions when the soon to retire baby boomers are the richest generation in history rather than house prices high rent  which means that the young generation has to work longer hours for less pay to pay higher rent.

10030743,0,t3_5jca7w,Campbells about right for his level at the moment I think. Hes a hard working third choice striker whos filling in decently enough with the second choice currently out. Wouldnt be surprised to see him leave in the summer at all but for now hes just fine for us. Also a dab hand in the cup which helps.,crystalpalace,dbf179j,8,t5_2tqdj
10112954,0,t3_5kq1uw,Good luck to him. Hes been a key player for us this season but I dont think this is as much of a disaster people on the BBS are making it out to be. Puncheon and Townsend arent bad wingers and I have faith Fat Sam will know how to grind out the points we need. I know Palace fans hate him but I would try to sign Ashley Young. He played as a left back under Van Gaal and I think hes a good winger. Kieran Gibbs is another good option. ,crystalpalace,dbpq6m1,3,t5_2tqdj
10113172,0,t3_5kq1uw,Ah thats bad for us...also with punch moving to wing...when hes back from suspension. Who on earth is the midfield ledley and Jmac are injured ,crystalpalace,dbpr7aa,1,t5_2tqdj
10157458,0,t3_5lg60t,That may well be one of the worst performances that Ive seen out of us in a very long time. No creativity and the Big Sam defensive style leaves a lot to be desired. Its going to be a long few months lads,crystalpalace,dbvekcg,2,t5_2tqdj

10193000,0,t3_5lynw2,I think Jedi is the big one. Bolasie going for benteke seems about right hed been a bit off his game for a while gayle hadnt really shown much and we got a good price for him. I can understand why we got rid of Jedi it was a good bid but its taken a huge leader with us. Im not too fussed who we get this window as long as they can step in and command like he used to,crystalpalace,dbzfl6z,8,t5_2tqdj

10479279,0,t1_dcvwtj1,Been doing my head in for a year or more watching him go on set pieces his free kicks are terrible and most of the time on corners they either dont beat the first man or float nicely into the goalkeepers arms who hardly have to move.Sadly Cabaye who also takes them isnt much better.,crystalpalace,dcvxnlv,3,t5_2tqdj
