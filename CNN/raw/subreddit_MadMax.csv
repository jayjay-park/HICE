If he would have elaborated more on why he gave it such a low rating then it wouldnt be so bad.When part of your job is critiquing movies then you better be prepared to write up a proper review.But one shouldnt expect too much considering its the Mirror.,MadMax,cr6ihuj,10,t5_2sw1w

4040563,0,t1_crgtyie,Ehh whatever their loss. Im not sure what youre looking for here...not sure how a fan of a film can argue against a subjective opinion. If you didnt like it thats fine obviously not every movie will appeal to everyone even the most critically acclaimed ones. Personally I like the film because it does away with a lot of the bullshit tropes and conventions that bog down modern action block busters Theres no unnecessary expository dialogue. Imagine if during one of the chase scenes Max had to ask Furiosa So who is this Immortan Joe and why is he such a crazy man!? Wellllll....His father was a warlord blah blah blah That would be madness this movie doesnt need that shit. Its a high concept movie Get the truck from A to B it doesnt need extra filler. Heavy reliance on practical effects versus CG. The CG is used sparingly but for most of the stuntwork its obvious that real cars are getting wrecked real people are swinging around on poles or hanging onto the sides of cars etc. It looks great and really adds to the tension of the action scenes. Worldbuilding. The world this film is set in feels realistic and leaves just enough unexplained that it adds to the imagination. Why do the War Boys spray paint on their face when going into battle? Why are they sick at the Citadel what are the blood transfusions for? Who are those stilt guys in the bog? What is Gas Town like? Everyone can come up with their own interpretations but explaining it would halt the momentum of the chase and just require more unnecessary exposition. The action scenes are shot in a way that you can always follow whats going on and it all has a sense of space.  Doof Warrior. I mean come on just look at him. The score. Great characters. Furiosa is the best female action hero since Ripley. I dont even care much about the debate on the feminist themes of the movie I just like seeing strong female characters because its a refreshing change. Its just a goddamn fun movie. I could go on and on and dissect all the little details I love but this is getting too tldr anyway.,MadMax,crgus58,3,t5_2sw1w
4041671,0,t1_crgyqe6,But why didnt they detatch it? And Im pretty sure they were gonna fuck up gas town not trade with them... And they went way further than gas town and back without using the fuel in the pod. I dont think this is right. ,MadMax,crgzc8u,1,t5_2sw1w

4110351,0,t1_crop2nu,Yes it really was a terrible listicle. It also focuses on the world as it exists instead of Furiosa and the wives fight against it. At least a few of the points dont make concessions for setting or plot development. Yes the wives are all extremely attractive but that fits within a feminist narrativethe patriarch chooses the attractive women to be his breeders. What do the wives do? They fight against said patriarch by escaping and fighting against him. Its almost as if the lists problems arise from the fact that the movie doesnt start at the end. If women hold equal standing with men from the very beginning then whats the conflict? Everything was perfect and nobody had any problems doesnt make for a compelling story. ,MadMax,croszu1,2,t5_2sw1w

4393243,0,t1_csge63k,Ive seen that panel too and been debating this with others here. Ive not read the comic but this particular panel seems to be the one that annoyed people the most and features most in articles criticising the comic.Really I think the problem with that panel is that it fails to get across the writers intent. If Charlize had acted it things would have been clearer. Thats not Furiosa getting angry because the wives are ungrateful. Thats her getting angry because the horror of the wives situation is stirring the guilt in her over being complicit in Joes regime and therefore also being complicit in their abuse. Shes really trying to justify their situation to herself rather than the wives. Shes confused and angry when faced with the reality of a situation shes chosen to ignore. Shes trying to dispel her own guilt and takes it out on them.People have argued that for Furiosa the fact that the wives were imprisoned should have been reason enough for her to want to help them. But the thing is the sight of imprisonment is nothing new for Furiosa. You can be sure that Max is not the only caged bloodbag dotted throughout the citadel where Furiosa has risen through the ranks and witnessed many people imprisoned against their will. So what makes the wives different? Why help them? These are the questions that the writers are referring to when they talk about the story being believable.,MadMax,cskur6v,1,t5_2sw1w

If noone in Fury Road can access satellites it presumes noone else can either. The original movie is pretty clear that societys falling apart already and then by Road Warrior its gone. Society generally has fallen apart as evidenced by the scavenging. Miller just never had the budget to say this is what the rest of the world is doing and to be honest thats not his focus.

He ends up getting it back in the end though thus explaining how he can have it in Fury Road. He also meets a few characters who are most likely some of the people he sees in his hallucinations in Fury Road particularly the child. The end of the game more or less shows his change from selfish but sane like he was in the older movies to feral like he was at the beginning of Fury Road.,MadMax,cv2j5so,2,t5_2sw1w

5220412,0,t1_cvf6fcu,Why is he getting down voted? He is right. They are chroming which is inhaling paint fumes evidence of this is when the guy is shot multiple times by the darts in the face IN THE HEART in his dying moments he struggles to get the spray paint when he does he sprays the paint in his mouth and gets right up while managing to jump off and blow up the car. Ever seen a chromer get arrested by a cop before? They are completely out of it and pretty much ignore pain. They borrow heavily upon the Norse religion and it is widely believed that berserkers would eat mushrooms or drink it when it  has been filtered through an animal via their urine before battle to help get them in a psychosis and ignore pain.  Dont down vote people if you believe they are wrong without actually providing any evidence that they are wrong especially if the person is right. ,MadMax,cvf92bk,21,t5_2sw1w

Nuxs expression was very good though haha.Fury Road has massive citadels  major well grown factions gastownbullet farm Joe a religon based on an engine and the Immortanneat imo. The details and what not also contribute a more fantasy feeling.MM had a grounded savage gang and a small tribe just wanting to survive in an oil refinery. A haunted wanderer who desperately wants gas for his car is sucked into the small civilization war. More science fiction than anything. ,MadMax,cvl70fm,1,t5_2sw1w

Remember Max was an outsider in the sequel and the last narration ends in a way that suggests its a story being told verbally. Maybe people tell stories of a mythical Road Warrior who was actually different people but their stories share similarities. Maybe people tell stories of someone who in spite of their own problems and every opportunity to leave chose instead to do the right thing. That would be a comforting thought even if youre not living in post apocalyptic Australia. ,MadMax,dfl6rlx,9,t5_2sw1w
