I actually wanted to have conversations with people at work today instead of sitting there staring at my phone until it was time to go home. Its only been one day so Im trying not to set any false high expectations but I feel good. It has been making my stomach feel weird though. ,lexapro,dd99fzn,1,t5_31mz6

Although exactly how you put it. it doesnt feel good but it does feel better.,lexapro,dg3rq97,2,t5_31mz6
