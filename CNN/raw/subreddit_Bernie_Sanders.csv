8308127,0,t3_4t9pow,Politics works when it is about bringing people together for the greater good. HRC does not get my vote. I changed my party affiliation to Green today and any democrats who want to register Green  of voters is what it takes for Jill Stein to participate in the debates can change their party affiliation here The reasons I wont vote for HRC are these She supports fracking. Trump supports COAL as a clean energy she is the superior candidate HRC destabilized the world as secretary of state and was quick to enter the US into wars. Trump supports militarizing the police supports the NRA agenda and has not denounced the KKK who are openly supporting him. HRC is the superior candidate.  HRC was on the board of Walmart and supports their agenda. This is a company like so many that underpays their workers and overpays their executives. This creates a corporate welfare system where our tax dollars support their executives outrageous salaries.  Trump has declared bankruptcy more times than I can count. HRC is the superior candidate. HRC may be terrible who knows? She says anything. Like Obama HRC is likely to make some poor decisions and some great ones. But rump is not a nice person nor is he cognizant of the world. The United States is losing respect from the world who see us as fascist gunslinging warmongers. Bernie Sanders is by far the best candidate for POTUS. Being an independent Sanders was able to work both sides of the aisle. They called him the Amendment King and his agenda has been about what was best for the people. When the DNC MSM and corporate America rigged the game to elect HRC they made Trump a serious contender. Trump brought the haters to the polls. Bernie brought the millennials and progressives. Although more people vote will vote for Libertarian Rob Johnson and Green Party Jill Stein HRC will probably still be elected. But never Trump. Love trumps hate. ,Bernie_Sanders,d5g2m6g,1,t5_3c4mx
