4862901,0,t3_3he7rv,One thing I dont like on rfrugal is how consumerist it is like Whats your best frugal purchase? The point of frugality is to not spend money to not buy things. I love my Nalgene water bottle Ive had it for years  yes but its expensive. Just use an empty plastic bottle  they are free! You already have several! Nalgene is unbreakable! If a free water bottle breaks just get another free water bottle.  is more frugal than not .,FrugalTalk,cu7i7o5,2,t5_39lh7
