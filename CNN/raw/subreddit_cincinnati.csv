405391,0,t1_cfmi3gt,Right. Thats how it works. Doesnt seem to make a whole lot of sense but thats how it is. I believe the rationale is that a weapon thats concealed is a little more serious because it can be hidden. Nobody would know you had it and for cops that can be scary. They want to make people jump through some hoops to get that ability and thats what the CCW permit is. It takes  hours class time and  hours range time to qualify. Total cost if you start without the gun is close to  My gun  My ammo  for  rounds defense ammo My holster  Class registration  Registering for the permit with the sheriffs office The open carry doesnt happen a lot but there are some people that do it. I wouldnt because. Everybody would know I have a gun.. Its generally more of a hassle because people are scared of guns so you tend to get the cops called on you and they do come to investigate. Guns make everyone nervous. . Cops will stop you and investigate on their own without being called. . If a robber were to get ballsy they would already know where your weapon is and might try to take it from you. Bad news there.Like most gun laws in todays society they restrictions are put on the responsible owners that would follow the letter of the law so thats how the hoops for CCW permits work. Someone whos looking to break the law doesnt care about having a CCW permit before putting a gun in their pants. ,cincinnati,cfms9pj,1,t5_2qt1k

533311,0,t1_cg0qaa4,Sorry if this winds up being long winded theyre obviously both similar sized river cities. Both criminally underrated with tons of interesting things to do. Lots of hidden gems people who visit either city without a plan or suggestions from residents would be disappointed because they would miss all the best stuff. Same basic problems suburbs and the city hate each other the notinmybackyard crowd loud enough to impede progress to a slow crawl city schools are pretty bad downtown closes after . Stl is very spread out even in the city which makes it look smaller than it actually is but gives neighborhoods their awesome vivid personalities. Cinci is structured more like Pittsburgh where everything is clustered around the river which is really cool because it adds to the busy city feel and crossing the river doesnt put you in East St Louis but you get past Clifton and Northside and it loses much of the urban configuration due to geography. I remember coming in on  and hitting city limits and thinking ok so where is it? cause youre still out in the woods. Stl is flat enough that the entire city is on a grid that blends pretty evenly into the inner suburbs but that also means there are very few places where you can get awesome views of the city like you can in Cinci. I do miss having light rail even if it was just barely adequate. Biking is pretty rough in Cinci unless you stay around downtown. The riverfront in Cinci is a lot nicer and Yeatmans Cove  Sawyer point is probably my favorite park in the city. Stl still has a lot of river commerce activity  so theres not much to see on the river outside of the arch grounds unless you really want to see anheuser buschs distribution infrastructure. Alton and Grafton up further north by the confluence though is crazy pretty and has the vibe of a small east coast beach town in the summer. Awesome boating there Not a bad thing just different. Theyre redoing the riverfront by the arch right now too. I miss the way parks were set up back home though forest park is somewhat unique and hard to replicate. Stls zoomuseum district is its greatest asset organizing tax money in order to help provide free admission to more free attractions than anywhere outside DC. I do love the parks here  but many dont have the feel of city parks that are extensions of that neighborhood they feel like sort of off to the side areas that are destinations rather than neighborhood amenities. Again not bad just different. There are days where Im ultra homesick and days where theres no place else Id rather be. ,cincinnati,cg0w7d9,3,t5_2qt1k

I think its called Arcadian?  Its a short bus ride as well.  Take any bus downtown and then hop on the TANK  Route  or .  Get off around th or th St and take a left onto Monmouth.  The comic book store up in Pleasant Ridge is a bit of a ride but its good.  And very worth it if youre a DC fan.   agreed on legomans restaurant recommendations.  Mecklenburg has the most legitgenuinewhatever German food in the city.  Its much better than Hofbrahaus.  Cant speak for the beer though as Im not a drinker.

I have lived in Covington for the last few years and am pretty passionate about it. Im excited about the brewery thats opening up around here soon and I truly believe Covington could grow into something really great given a little TLC. I went to UC for a few years after moving back from Columbus but couldnt really find my niche so Ive had a lot of really random jobs doing vastly different things. I currently work at a barrestaurant and love the flexibility it offers me. In my free time I can almost always be found outside biking hiking running and so on. I also love reading cookingbaking and the Reds. I went to a Cincinnati reddit meet up maybe a year ago or so and it was a really good time maybe we should get something like that going again in the future. ,cincinnati,ch0h2aw,4,t5_2qt1k

1142057,0,t1_chy32ao,I believe she was the owner which is the person they would attempt to contact.  But perhaps they only had information to try to contact the landlord and not the owner.  Even if that is the case she hired the landlord and I would expect that hiring the type of landlord that responds to police requests or notifies me in the case of police requests would be on me.So if the woman was the owner if she claimed she was not the landlord it seems a bit like trying to make excuses.  But again we dont have a ton of information and Im willing to concede that maybe she has some claim on the reward but I dont think it is an unquestionable claim.  My whole position basically stems from the attitude that I dont think rewards for information should be treated as lottery tickets but rather as incentives to get people to help the search.  Since it didnt accomplish that for this woman and all of the news and awareness raising didnt even move her to check her own property I am hesitant to say she deserves the reward as her behavior is something that doesnt particularly need incentivizing.I know if I had a vacant house next door to where a kid disappeared I would have at least sent someone to check on it and not stumbled across his body a week later and thought it was possibly a burglar.,cincinnati,chy3cd3,-1,t5_2qt1k
1151050,0,t1_chyh33g,Less public transit and very little retail development?  Do you have any data to back any of this up or is it purely anecdotal?  Same with this absurd grocery reasoning?  Do you have any data period?Are you at all aware of the state that OTR was in prior to its redevelopment?  It was the epitome of a significant disregard for important racial and socioeconomic issues.  It was also populated by convenience stores liquor stores drugs prostitution and otherwise.  To suggest that moving to the suburbs i.e. Price Hill Mt Washington BTW is somehow worse than living in the old OTR borders on the absurd.  Were going to have to agree to disagree.  In my mind any Cincinnatian who boycotts OTR is too far off the liberal reservation to have a rational debate.  Shortsightedness is failing to understand the simple costbenefit analysis and long term economic implications of an improved urban core.  Urban development is not perfect and it never will be.  Every city thats undergone this same shift has dealt with the exact same issues.

1254986,0,t1_ciasr02,From Thomas More Colleges WebsiteMonte Casino ChapelIf you drive down Turkeyfoot Road in Crestview Hills Kentucky you may notice two things. One the construction of the expansive Crestview Hills Towne Centre and two a tiny Chapel near a pond on the campus of Thomas More College.While the  year old Monte Casino Chapel may be small in stature the interior walls measuring only  feet high it more than makes up for its size in history. The Chapel achieved worldwide fame in  when Robert Ripley of Ripleys Believe It or Not proclaimed it the smallest Church in the world.It was built in  by Benedictine Father Otto Kopf and Brother Albert Soltis a Germanborn mason for the Monte Casino Monastery in the hills of South Covington. The selfsustaining acre Monastery named after its sister monastery in Italy was started in  by the Benedictine Brothers of Latrobe Pennsylvania. To support themselves the monks operated vineyards for sacramental and commercial wine production. The Chapel was built as a quiet place to retreat from the labors of the day to reflect and pray.When prohibition was established in  it banned the distribution of wine to other states leaving the monks with no means to support themselves so they returned to Pennsylvania. For the next  years the Chapel remained abandoned on the hillside in Covington until local historian Chester F. Geaslen began writing articles in the newspaper seeking its rightful owner. Over the years the abandoned Chapel was stripped of its stained glass windows door and even the steeple. Geaslen believed something had to be done to save the historical structure and return it to its proper state. In one of his newspaper articles Gleasen described the condition of the abandoned Chapel.Pillaged of all that could be carried away even the little stone steeple with its hand chiseled cross. Blackened is its stone arched interior from smoke and ash as fires have been kindled on the stone floor where the little altar once stood.In  the owner of the property was finally discovered through the citys tax records. It turns out that a local plumber Fred Riedinger had purchased the land and Chapel in  from St. Vincent Abbey in Latrobe Pennsylvania but later sold the land to a subdivision contractor. New streets and subdivisions replaced what once housed fields of grapes. In the center of all this new residential development stood a medieval stone Chapel which looked quite out of place.The Chapel however was still owned by Riedinger who decided to preserve it in memory of his mother Alma Riedinger. Immediately Riedinger was inundated with requests from organizations who wanted to give the Chapel a home. Villa Madonna College now Thomas More College was chosen as the home for the Chapel. The next steps were to figure out how to move the Chapel as well as how to pay for the move and its restoration. The Bishop of the Diocese of Covington and the Knights of Columbus agreed to underwrite the move and preservation while local builder Matth Toebben donated his services to move the historic Chapel. As word of the Chapel circulated throughout the community the items once removed from the building such as the steeple and crucifix were returned. Things were falling into place better than expected.On April   the tiny Chapel was loaded onto a flat bed truck and moved six miles along Dixie Highway to its new home in Crestview Hills Kentucky. The trip took eight hours due to the fact that the Chapel weighed over  tons and was so tall that someone needed to ride on the roof of the truck to manually lift the utility lines along the way for the Chapel to get through.Once secure in its new home on the campus of Villa MadonnaThomas More College the Chapel underwent a restoration to preserve it as close to its original form as possible. The stolen items that surfaced were returned to the tiny Chapel as well as interior restorations.On September   the Chapel at Thomas More College was dedicated giving it official recognition by the Catholic Church. Thanks to community support and several individuals who championed its cause a historical treasure was resurrected restored and prominently placed for future generations.,cincinnati,ciasugx,3,t5_2qt1k

Ive now heard back from a number of people who have had the same problem both in my neighborhood with a particular inspector and around the city. The consensus seems to be that the only way to get codes enforced is to sue the department andor particular inspector that no number of residents complaining about a violation or an inspector will get anything done. There is even a particular public advocate lawyer in town who specializes in forcing the department to do their job.What Im still digging into is the reasons why these inspectors refuse to do their jobs. Are they being bribed by the violating property owners? Do they get salary incentives for low rates of citation? Are they simply too lazy to do the paperwork?

1819385,0,t1_ck88w38,gtCivilians can buy machine guns helmets gas masks riot sticks stun guns body armor... shouldnt cops have the tools as well to protect themselves and civs.Civilians can... but they dont. When was the last time a protest turned into a firefight because civilians brought automatic weapons to the event? Basically never. The police are buying this equipment under the assumption that this is the case. This is what happens when the department is being run by fear uncertainty and doubt.  In any event the argument you just posited can be used to justify anything under the sun. The reason we dont do that is because that is what the national guard is for. They are supposed to need to be called in to help only in dire situations not exist in every city in an unmonitored capacity where they can be used whenever the police chief wants to make a drug bust. The police are not meant to put down protests with military gear as though we are in the middle of a war zone. Primarily because that is what the national guard is for and secondly because they are not trained to military standards nor are they rigorously monitored by any agency.  They can contain protests just as effectively as police forces in literally every country in Europe without the use of military equipment. gtAnd everyone is an asshole who made Ferguson into an issue about police militarization the issue was about the shooting of unarmed black people. Everyone lost sight of that and its sad.The two are not mutually exclusive both occurred simultaneously.  Its not my fault that American media can only focus on one thing at a time.  Racism is a real and current problem in America that needs to be dealt with and police militarization is another problem that needs to be dealt with. We can do both at the same time. There isnt a limit cap on the number of problems that can exist within a society. ,cincinnati,ck8f60f,2,t5_2qt1k

He said some story about how some teenagers from Kentucky came over to buy weed in Cincinnati and they passed up their usual dealer. The dealer shot them. Okay Cecil so maybe we should make weed legal so people dont have to buy it off the black market.Anyway police wanted to be able to search people for guns. But they can only do that with an arrest. So if someone was arrested for small amounts of marijuana rather than getting a ticket they could be searched. But what wasnt factored in was how much money it costs the city. From wasting scarce police resources for  hours for the arrest paperwork and trip to the revolving door of the Justice Center.  Not to mention how much it hurt a large number of black people in the city who were the selective target of enforcement a violation of their civil rights.And the fact that people busted for weed really didnt pack heat at any rate higher than the average population.

The stories ghost hunters will tell you will keep you up at night.  Were talking possessions and evil demonic attachments think Paranormal Activity. Im still on the fence about ghosts but I will give this piece of advice  go with experienced people at first. They will tell you what to look for what you are hearing and seeing and how to be safe. Otherwise you will be just walking around dark buildings freaking yourself out. There is a science behind it believe it or not so you do need a bit of formal training so to speak.  does a good job introducing the subject and arranging haunts. Its not just a business for them they are really into it. They just have to cover some menial costs renting the place a few supplies. They arent BS artists that are actors.

If you go you should check out whatever Omnimax theater is showing. Anyone who visits who I take there always finds it cool. A quick visit to the top of Carew Tower should give you great  degree views of the area. It might be cold but the views are top notch. Cincy has four other excellent museumscenters art contemp art Taft museum Freedom Center which I second the recommend on based on your notes and President Tafts birthplace. The Reds Hall of Fame is great if either of you has any affinity for baseball in general. It is also worth checking out if Music Hall is offering any tours. Youll find some hip restaurants in the corridor from Central and Vine to Liberty and Vine. Personal favorites include Abagail Street A Tavola and Senate but you really cant go wrong there. Many of these were recently visited by various celebrity chefs Alton Brown et al. Arnolds Bar is the oldest in the city dating back to the early s.

2439614,0,t1_cmd8e6j,I didnt say brown fired the gun Im not sure why finger prints would matter?  Browns blood was found in the SUV multiple witnesses saw a fight there and the officer was injured you can argue by how much but you are going to have a tough time saying there wasnt a physical fight in the SUV.  OK if you pretend Wilson didnt know the guy just stole the smokes and was solely telling him not to walk down the street I still dont exactly see how that changes much?  It isnt exactly like a cop telling someone to get out of the street is grounds for them attacking the cop.  Browns friend is ridiculous.  Go read his testimony.  Its just like not even close to supported by any physical evidence.  He is the one that claimed Wilson stood over him and emptied his clip into him at point blank range.  It is easily debunked.  Witnesses also said his friend immediately fled the scene as soon as the confrontation began and he saw nothing.  Washing his hands was pretty dumb but im not sure how that changes anything in my RABBLE RABBLE.  ,cincinnati,cmd8pqr,9,t5_2qt1k

The architecture is amazing Eden Park is right in the neighborhood youre pretty close to some good magnet schools and private schools and very close to UC and pretty close to downtown. Comparable to Oakley but much closer to the action. As far as schools Walnut Hills is definitely the best in CPS. I tested to get in and it really seemed like no big deal but I was in the th grade so who knows. I went to a catholic grade school but Im not affiliated and it was no big deal. There are a few good private schools that are pretty easy on the religion and also have high academic standards. Otherwise there are really good magnet schools but theres a process just like Walnut. SCPA is also a great school. I should mention that in East Walnut Hills you dont have to go very far before the neighborhood can get a little iffy. In Oakley you have to go a ways.

3876170,0,t3_34tlt4,Like the others have said Cincinnati isnt a high enough cost of living market to have apartment brokers or real estate brokers get involved in this stuff unless you are talking very high end homes.  Ive worked with a number of relocationapartment locator service type companies from the landlord side.  As far as I could tell the renter never got any value out of them.  They ranged from basically taking a fee usually from the renters company to spend  minutes on apartment guide or craigslist and sending on a few options to already having a contract with the management company to be compensated for sending prospects in which case they just tell the renters wherever they are already sending people is a good place to live.  This is one of those things you need to do some leg work on.  I know you said you dont have the time but either make it or go somewhere expensive that has good reviews.  Hiring someone is just going to wind up you winding up somewhere random that has more to do with which service you happen to decide on than what you need,cincinnati,cqy47re,2,t5_2qt1k

4074231,0,t3_378vaf,I did a very frugal but very nice Indian wedding. Im sure thats not what your friend is doing but a lot would carry over.We had our Sangeet night before wedding but like wedding reception at the Carnegie Center of Columbia Tusculum. It was a very nice venue and they let us bring in our own food and alcohol. I think it was only about  to rent out.  I think they have since changed their policies and you have to go with their caterer now but if not then this is a really good option especially for a smaller wedding because they have two rooms one for the wedding and the other for the reception and you get both with the rental. They do include the use of their tables but not linens or anything else.There was another cheap hall in Columbia Tusculum that we looked at  but I cant tell you too much about it other than it was a good price and not bad for a wedding but I cant remember what the food policies were.Our wedding was at the Anderson Center in Anderson  and it was also byob and byof major cost savers. They were about  if I remember correctly and it was really pretty outside on the patio and that price included table set up chairs linens and some cleanup. It was really nice. We had an Indian restaurant cater both days because my husband is of Indian descent and it was really cheap person per night. Im sure thats not what you were looking for so Ill give you info from my friends wedding they had it catered by Elis BBQ. It was wonderful Elis is the best in town IMHO and I think it came out to be  a person. They had their wedding at the Wyoming fine arts center and it was pretty nice. I think that the Carnegie would be better if they still let you bring your own food but her place was nice too.I think you could also check out the Clifton Cultural Arts Center. It was really nice for a fundraiser I went to and they do weddings and I believe they let you bring your own foodcatering. The only drawback to them is that you would need to do a fall winter or spring wedding as they do not have Air Conditioning though I have heard that was going to change so if you are having a summer wedding Id still contact them. They have a nice lawn to do the wedding ceremony too.,cincinnati,crkot5m,3,t5_2qt1k

4464137,1,t3_3c8nxg,Below is a posting from a Cincinnati police officer on what you arent seeing on the news from the th of July festivities downtown last night.So after my th of July night from hell I thought I would post the truth as to what went on last night in Downtown Cincinnati. Many news outlets although they were there will fail to report...The Truth. The truth is Im sitting in the district catching up on reports when an officer needs assistance comes out over the radio on Fountain Square. My partner and I scream down there to help out. I get down there to see glass bottles flying everywhere from a mob of out of control misguided youths. Okay that was a nice way of saying a bunch of thug idiots. They thought it would be appropriate to throw these bottles at police officers. While dodging these bottles I found one officer that was actually punched in the face by one of these assholes. Luckily he was apprehended. This was just getting started.We were trying to keep everyone under control and push everyone into one area to get them off of Fountain Square. So then is when the crowd got even further crazy they began throwing large fireworks at us. While trying to figure out if fireworks or gunshots usually you could tell but we werent taking any chances. I look down th st to see a few of my brothers and sisters trying to apprehend an individual and begin chasing him. I immediately give chase and even though Im getting a little older still catch the guy and he gets the  second taser ride. This seems easy enough right...well now weve got the whole crowd bearing down on us all with their phones out video taping...or throwing stuff at us. Later found out that this guy also punched a police officer in the faceWe get this guy in custody and its the second year in a row I have a tasing in this area on July th...guess its just not my day. So then we form into riot formation with helmets on and begin passing out the shields. Honestly this was the first time I got to partake in this. So we see ahead a scuffle begin and think its just a fight. Well not so much it was like  v. . I saw  v.  it was  black youths stomping the crap out of one unlucky male white. He didnt do anything to deserve this beating except be white. Im going to skip all the rhetoric and just say dont we all matter??? This just pissed us all off. Time to rescue or at least try to get these thugs off of him. So we were sent in with shields and arrest team to do a victim rescue. Feel bad for the guy since he nor anyone deserved a beat down like that for no reason. The next hour or so was just getting these assholes out of the area and back to where they came from. I hope every one of the people who threw a bottle fired a handgun threw fireworks at us and most importantly beat that poor guy within inches of his life get what they deserve...in this life or the next. To make matters worse it was like a perfect storm with the Reds game getting let out at the same time we were for a lack of a better phrase being attacked. I saw little kids holding their parents hands and parents looking at us like what the hell is going on? They had no clue what was going down nor should they have to expect seeing what they saw. I felt like I had to tell the truth and get the word out there from one of the men on the front line.

Im not surprised one bit Dubose tried to run from that officer that officer isnt fit to be in any position of power whatsoever.  That officer was out to make someone have a bad day and was powertripping hard.

Im not suggesting that tasering him would have been an appropriate response either  Tensing overreacted to whatever kind of threat he perceived.

Even if they did check you cant even validate if they are a sleeper or not.  Thats the problem.Not all refugees are terrorists no shit.  Most are attempting to escape war atrocities.  However if you think ISIS didnt place sleepers in with the refugees to send to each country you are blind by the media you read daily and see trend on social media.Once they infiltrate they spread like a virus.  Recruit more to their cause wait and plan a strategic attack.  Similar to what you saw in Paris.  Guerrilla warfare tactics.Downvote it all you want but there is no denying the reality of terrorism.

Bring DVDs of Flash Gordon Robocop and Total Recall to watch in your motel rooms at night.And when you reach the final stop on your tour brag about it like you just finished a godamned marathon. Demand high fives from strangers. Start chants. This is LaseRunner  and you will be the motherfucking champions!Finally start a blog chronicling your journey from start to finish reviewing each Laser Tag location based on five categories Obstacle Placement Neon Usage Laserness Mouthfeel and Historical Accuracy.Edit Gold?

Good flow highend animatronics and crazy logic like How do we know carbon dating is wrong? Because the world is only  years old. And how do we know the world is only  years old? Because the Bible says so! How do we know man and dinosaurs coexisted? Because of all the stories and drawings about dragons. Dragons  dinosaurs! The world is going to shit nowadays. See this family? The husband and wife are yelling at each other about getting divorced while the baby licks lead paint on the walls while the sons are upstairs in their room one jerking off to porn and the other playing violent video games while the teenage daughter is out having premarital sex with her boyfriend and is going to end up needing an abortion. All because they dont go to church every Sunday and they question the word of God!No joke these are all from the exhibits.

If  people get on at a busy stop and a few of them pay with quarters or cash itll take  minutes and youve suddenly got  buses bunched together.

6960928,1,t1_d15cd0t,We have not claimed to have proven Gods nonexistence. Its impossible to do so. We are also not claiming that we know for certain we are right.  We are saying the lack of evidence makes the chances so small that we place this belief on the same shelf as other fairy tales. This requires no faith.    Atheist is a commonly understood term. It is my opinion but technically my status would be agnostic. There certainly could be something out there and I dont claim to know for certain one way or another. But based on observations and evidence it seems unlikely so atheist is a much neater way of identifying that status without having to explain all that to people unfamiliar with the concepts.    Ultimately the media refers to us as an atheist organization. While a good portion of members identify as such other identities make us up.

Also curious as to whether the wires under the handrail were always in the design or if they were added later. As a point of reference in the s a trained Cincinnati Zoo keeper was awarded . million by a jury probably reduced in an undisclosed settlement to avoid appeal when her arm was chewed off by a polar bear when she got too close to or stuck her hand into the cage while feeding a grape to the bear  a clear and obvious danger and really inexcusable for a trained professional. ,cincinnati,d3rz7bz,3,t5_2qt1k

7802601,0,t1_d3rxs77,its partly how its built.  They built it in a time when there was a kind of general transition going on from indoor malls to outdoor malls and they tried to mix the two.  Most of the spaces are turned out which is great for the outdoor part of that but it makes the inside appear more vacant than it really is.  It also has the added issue of discouraging people actually going inside since there is no reason to which hurts their interior retail and arguably from past businesses their North facing retail jefferson hall calladas etc.  That whole place is screwy and setup weird.  A few years ago it was nearly fully occupied or at least in the  s if you exclude the imax which is a very special use space.  This is well above other retail mall type developments in the regional and nationally.  Yet every news article about the levee all you hear is oh the vacant levee etc which just wasnt true.  They also have been doing their own leasing for pretty much forever as far as I know and were not the easiest people to deal with.  They recently hired professional brokers to handle much of this.  I expect that to help. The actual property seems well maintained.  ,cincinnati,d3t2n4r,2,t5_2qt1k

9526366,0,t1_d9mf099,Downtown Cincinnati  OTR is on the upswing and the place to find night life. Newport KY and Covington KY are notable for night life too. Heading from Addyston east toward town you have Sayler Park then Riverside then Sedamsville then Lower Price Hill then downtown. Addyston is about  miles west of downtown. Riverside and Sedamsville are among the oldest neighborhoods in town and a shadow of their former selves. But theres still some nice  liveable places along the hillside especially if you like old  historical houses. Id stay out of LPH someday itll come back around but it aint gonna be soon. If youd rather be in the burbs or in a subdivision or near fast food etc check out Delhi. Delhi is up the hill north of Riverside amp Sayler Park. Delhi is outside the city limits a lot nicer and will be more  because of better school district... but still very affordable. It aint high rent but there are a lot of more whitecollar types than the other places. Addyston is a bit run down. They closed the school years ago I heard because of chemical levels because of Ineos it was called something different back then  Bayer maybe?. Aside from Ineos you have a few gas stations and some blue collar  service businesses roofers etc and thats about it. Addyston is also notorious for the quantity of speeding tickets they write seriously for even  or  mph over the limit. For what its worth Id look to live close... but not too close lol.

I think a lot of this came about when that couple got mugged outside the grail and the guy got shot and paralyzed for life he later died.  UC just had enough and said if no one else is going to take crime seriously we will.  Their results were impressive too.  Near campus specifically from campus to short vine became a ton safer.

Im just trying to communicate to you that you are using a fairly extreme argument. The point of contention we are having is that I do not see harvesting organs and carrying a baby as the same thing. Your argument seems to suggest that. No one is suggesting that an individuals organs have rights that would conflict with the individuals rights. Your argument is suggesting that people believe that. Do you understand how that is a straw mans argument? You are taking something that is pretty extreme and using it to misrepresent prolife views. In general the entire prolife argument resolves around a human zygote gaining the right to life after the moment of conception. I would imagine that your difference in opinion has to do more with that statement than anything else. You should take some time to understand other views on this issue.

10555915,0,t1_dd4i9dt, million a year is chump change for investing in denser living and having appropriate transportation infrastructure to make it possible especially compared to the amount thats spent on other infrastructure projects that arguably make everyones standard of living worse by encouraging sprawl.  Good public infrastructure for dense living pays for itself by encouraging more efficient and sustainable living and better quality of life.  We live in a very segregated society partially due to things like white flight and suburban sprawl.  Sprawl isnt sustainable and is incredibly inefficient.  Now the streetcar is for white people?  Is any other infrastructure politicized this way?  Maybe if we had a comprehensive light rail in this city and not just a three mile loop through downtown more people would use it than just people visiting.  Which is why the first phase was meant to connect the two largest work centers in Cincinnati.  I remember hearing how the streetcar would fail because of all you know who using it from plenty of COAST supporter Enquirer comments but now its for white people!At least its a potential start but I dont see it going anywhere the way it has been politicized like climate change.  The narrative pushed by many conservatives is not that the streetcar is bad its that investing in denser living and public transportation is evil while sprawl is hunky dory.  Cincinnati used to be a very densely lived in city and has the layout to one day be so again were lucky in that way some cities like Houston built up after sprawl will have a much harder time ever getting to denser living.,cincinnati,dd4mrhy,3,t5_2qt1k

10566946,0,t1_dd5ua1j,Thats because the Dems have almost always run a very moderate almost right leaning Democrat that local Republicans were for the most part supportive of. Luken and Cranley fit this description as did Pepper who was surprisingly upset by Mallory. After Mallorys first term the Republicans did run a candidate and a basically noname at the time candidate and he performed very well  losing to a popular incumbent liberal mayor by just  votes. What the Republicans dont want to do is help someone like Simpson defeat Cranley by stealing all of Cranleys primary votes and ultimately potentially losing to Simpson in the general. But if Cranley is moving his base far to the left to match Simpson that risk is no longer worth factoring in. It will be interesting to see if anyone jumps in. Winburn has a lot of history here and has consistently been one of the highest vote getters in council elections. Hes also very entertaining to watchlisten to. ,cincinnati,dd5vsh1,6,t5_2qt1k

If your anywhere near the same age as me you grew up in a state that was known for having a great set of school systems btw so its not CPS fault that you didnt learn anything its yours.

Sure! But Id also prefer US Bank Arena not be an absolute dump on the inside and eyesore on the out. US Bank can act like a child and blame UC all they want doesnt change how trashy that venue is or how much it would cost UC to play there.And Holy Grail can shove it too. They should redirect their anger at US Bank for maintaining a landfill on the banks instead of updating or remodeling to attract the big time events and not just UC basketball either.If the price was right and US Bank was up to even at least rd Arena standards not even close UC would be playing downtown next season.

There are of course myriad private schools all Catholic I think but those can be confusing too.  All of this can be really difficult when you are under a timing issue and have missed deadlines.  Moving to one of the suburbs with a great school district would make everything a lot easier and guarantee a good quality education although you wont really have many options at that point i.e. no manget schools.  Wyoming Mariemont and Indian Hill are examples of such suburbs.
