I ended up adjusting my mask throughout the night because it was either too tight or started leaking air at the top.

4762597,0,t3_3g2twz,I suspect most floaters are caused by dry eyes surface andor jelly within the orb itself of CPAPusing people who sleep with eyes open.  Glad you went to the dr since floaters that are new or if seeing streaks of light may be a sign of retina detachment which may lead to blindness. Funny you should ask this as I was just on the net searching about what is causing my big eye floater looks like a chip in my windshield has a small dark spot with smallshort lines attached to the center dark spot. I am suspecting dehydration so I will hydrate today including using moisturizing eye drops and see dr tomorrow if not gone by then. For me I suspect dehydration because of  things  ever since I had LASIK surgery I have noticed that if I get dehydrated my vision will become blurry  I have not been drinking enough water while traveling I have been having leaks in my nose jell pillow where air shoots up from the pillow to my eyes plus have the drying effect of all that air circulating around my face from the exhalation port  I sleep with my eyes occasionally slightly openSo I suspect my floaters are related to dry eyes.Update I went to my eye dr and was told I have a Vitreous Detachment which is a detachment of some jelly within the eye. The jelly is really made up of millions of fine fibers which gives the eye its round shape. What I am seeing is the shadow of the detached fibers falling upon my retina.My issue of dark spot and also lightdark flashes has NOTHING to do with dry eyes.Doc said that my issue will clear up in a few weeks probably wont happen again in this eye is caused by aging of the fibers  which shrink with age. I am to come back in a month to be sure healed well. And since this detachment can be associated with a Retinal Detachment I  to come back immediately if in the next few weeks the vision becomes worse especially if there is like a veil over your vision or if you are seeing a snowstorm.I recommend that you see an eye Doctor since the exam I received today was different than the one I had received a month ago when I went in for my regular annual eye exam.

4865000,0,t3_3hibf3,Most sleep studies are done in  parts. The first night youre just there for them to diagnose you with a sleep disorder. If the results from the first night show that you have a sleep disorder youre then asked to come back for a second night where youre hooked up to a cpap machine all night. The second night is called the titration study and the purpose is to figure out which mode and pressure fix your disorder. If your sleeping disorder Ilis severe as probably was the case with a previous poster then the sleep techs will come in and wake you up during the first nights study and place you on cpap. Usually this is done if you stop breathing more than  times an hour if your oxygen levels drop dangerously low or if your apneic periods are super prolonged. But typically people get the  night studies. There are sleep studies that can be done at home. You go into the sleep lab during the day to pick up the wiresmachine etc and get instructions on how to use it. Then you bring it back the next day. Home studies arent as reliable and not every insurance company covers their cost. Most would prefer you go into a lab where the results are better monitored.As far as the bad reviews go Id take it with a grain of salt. Most people do not sleep well during their in lab studies and tend to have negative experiences because of that IMO. Sleep techs usually work off of protocols. Basically they just monitor your vital signs at night and during the titration study they typically shift the cpap pressures up and down to see how your body responds so that the doctor knows how to treat you. Ive seen sleep labs inside hospitals that have the intercom blaring all night long. Ive seen sleep labs built next to railroad and subway tracks. For whatever reason they tend to be noisy so just prepare yourself for a terrible night. Most sleep labs work on the weekends so at least you can go home and back to bed. I do not recommend taking ANYTHING that is not part of your normal bedtime routine. If youre prescribed medications to take in the evening obviously take those but I wouldnt take any sleep aids including benadryl on the night of the sleep study. Most places ask that you do not consume alcoholcaffeine after noon on the night of the study. You are going in to be studied during sleep  if you change any of the variables you might end up with different results and the doctor wants your normal state of sleep. If youre not sure whether you should eatdrink something call and ask the lab. ,SleepApnea,cu7rr1t,3,t5_2qs1d

Your brain is affected in multiple ways.  For me it was depression confusion cognitive chaos poor planning and execution of tasks low frustration tolerance etc.  I was so glad I got treated!  I have had quite a few twists and turns in seeking better solutions for ailments I have rather than taking a pill.  I kept evaluating what I could do about OSA and using the CPAP for the rest of my life.  I had the CPAP for  years and found out I had a deviated septum enlongaged uvula and crowded soft palate which made my CPAP feel like it was  effective.  I was downgraded to Moderate OSA which allowed me to get an oral appliance.  Im not stopping there.  I continually research what I can do to improve on treatment for OSA.  I found a doctor who can do a sleep study online.  I am not sure how they can be  effective.  I totally agree with the moderator about not letting someone diagnose over the internet.I would definitely recommend the sleep study in a clinic.  They will be thorough and you can find out if you have OSA.  Maybe you can see a therapist to work toward the goal of getting a sleep study.  You have options when you find out what you are dealing with.  If you have OSA it is affecting way more than your sleep!Good luck!!,SleepApnea,cy8mf1u,2,t5_2qs1d

I researched the living hell out of MMA beforehand. It has a far higher success rate far less likely to relapse much less painful the common side effects are less bothersome IMO and it often comes with miscellaneous benefits such as improving your bite and potentially making you better looking especially if you have a smaller jaw to begin with. If you like firsthand accounts there are many many blogs by MMA patients saying this same thing. If you like more rigorous science the largest study to date on MMA had over  patients and a success rate of . My current hypothesis is my MMA just wasnt enough because I still have quite a floppy soft palate. Its bad enough that even postMMA I often obstruct and snore even when awake especially lying down. Still glad I did it because it was my best shot to fix my sleep in one try and it helped my bite and made me better looking.,SleepApnea,cz64zqd,1,t5_2qs1d

6345728,0,t3_42jisl,So a couple of things here.One thing to keep in mind is that if you have been diagnosed with OSA especially severe OSA its important to treat it.  I always have to remind my patients that just because you dont immediately feel the symptoms of OSA it doesnt mean that it doesnt take its toll on the heart over time.   So seeking out proper treatment for your OSA should be priority.  Did the doctors ever prescribe CPAPBIPAP? If youre not resting well youre going to have more anxiety and more problems with PTSD regardless of sleep apnea or not.  And ensuring that youre sleeping your best will go a long ways towards helping any anxiety levels you might have.  Wont magically cure it but a good nights sleep is so so important.One of the key things to keep in mind is that with OSA youre not always sitting up in bed gasping for air dramatically.  Most of the time youre snoring yourself awake or you awaken for  seconds and go right back to sleep and the cycle of apnea resumes.  So just because youre not waking up gasping for air doesnt mean your OSA isnt happening or isnt a problem.That being said there is a link between anxiety and OSA but anxiety isnt going to cause your throat muscles to relax to the point of closure.  Sure anxiety plays a factor in how well you sleep but its not going to cause OSA.  Its typically thought of as the other way around.Hope thats helpful.  If not Ill gladly take the time to clarify and help in any way I can.  Cheers! ,SleepApnea,czaxtgb,2,t5_2qs1d

6395603,0,t1_czgkn4d,gt Wow okay. The impression I got from reading online is that all of this equipment is really fussy and if I dont take care of it and set it just so it wont work for me. I guess maybe there are other people out there who are much more fastidious than us?Thats just please dont sue us language. I change the water in my humidifier about once a week and normally just top it off. I change the air filter when it looks dirty maybe once a month or so. I wash my mask weekly or when its dirty I never wash the hose. Its cheap. I just replace it every couple of months. Honestly I dont think its possible to actually clean it inside enough to make a difference. Its not fussy at all.The pressure setting is a completely different animal. You may have to work with your doc a few times to get it just right. This is critical. If its not set right for you its not going to help as much as it could. If youre not feeling good tell your doc and hell order an adjustment.,SleepApnea,czgm4gr,3,t5_2qs1d
6395909,0,t1_czgkizb,gtThanks for the perspective. Do you have issues with claustrophobia and did that come into play here? Im the type of person who cant wear jewelry or watches or rings and shit because they drive be batshit crazy being on me all the time.The only times I get claustrophobic is in large noisy crowds so I cant speak to becoming claustrophobic from the mask.  I can see how it would trigger claustrophobia though considering it does strap over your face.  If you choose to try CPAP start wearing it for short periods while awake  if you can get used to it you should be able to handle it while asleep.gt I know take one day at a time. Im trying but I my mind just races.I know its easier said than done.  Something thats helped me get to sleep when my mind is racing is to imagine Im driving a manual transmission vehicle and pushing in the clutch.  That helps me to recognize that although I cant necessarily stop my racing mind I can let the racing part of it run off and do its own thing and let the rest of me quit worrying about it racing in the first place.  Once I stop worrying about it whatever was racing eventually quiets down.gtThe other thing that has me upset about this is the doctor I saw didnt want to discuss treatment options. I felt like he wanted to get me onto CPAP asap and get me out the door. At worst I feel like hes just trying to sell me shit and at best hes not someone I feel like I can have a working relationship with. Unfortunately there are no other sleep docs in my area. The next closest is  miles away and they are scheduling in June already.Im sorry to hear that that really sucks.  Does your current practice have any other practitioners?  Do you have a regular doctor that may be able to recommend another group?  I have heard that some pulmonology practices have experience with CPAP since CPAP is used for more than just sleep apnea perhaps they would be an option.gtNot to mention dealing with the DMEs. I had to do that when my first child was borne and those people come across as seedier than used car sales people. I need to find people to work with that Ill trust but I dont even know how to go about doing that.Again if you have a doctor you trust see if they can offer any recommendations.  There are also many online CPAP suppliers  simply fax them your prescription and insurance info then order the supplies you want off the web.  I personally havent done it but Im sure plenty of people here have.gtUltimately Im not convinced this is all worth the effort. And no its not your job to convince me so please dont feel responsible for that. Not feeling like Im worth the effort is a recurring theme in my life.It may not be worth the effort in the long term but its worth trying.  If it doesnt work out you shouldnt really be worse off than before.  If it does work it can pay a lot of dividends.  Like I said before better sleep can definitely help with your anxiety and depression.  Just so you know youre definitely worth the effort its your disease telling you that youre not.gtSorry to get so negative. Im spiraling.It happens.  Try not to let it get to you too much.  Ive noticed that anxiety can be an Ouroboros constantly feeding on itself.  Recognizing when its happening is often enough to stop my spiral.,SleepApnea,czgndl9,2,t5_2qs1d

The algorithm syncs with the patient almost immediately and can continue to do so even with high leak rates.Youre right about returned machines though  Philips really dropped the ball with the  series  they were pretty noisy. I have noticed a dramatic improvement with the Dream Station too.

6725795,0,t3_47qh5h,My answer as a surgeonCompletely normal and expected from a good surgeon. Especially in complex surgeries with multiple goals and possible outcomes its important to talk to the patient about it. You seek for the surgeon with a set of expectations he may have another set and as medicine isnt an exact science the final result can be different from yours and his expectations.He has to do the best to align what you want with what he can do those kind of questions help in this. And you have to be prepared to the worst case scenario its not expected but can happen.I cant answer how youll look after but from anecdotal experience never seen anyone looking worse after surgery.And no blindness isnt a expected complication of a LeFort fracture...

7339551,0,t3_4fvtzy,gt Ahi . I think this is mildIts only mild in the context of not as bad as it could be. Its certainly enough to disturb your sleep. Also insurance will cover treatment for anything over  so youre likely to end up with some sort of help.Also AHI is an average. You could stop breathing for  minutes once an hour and be on the brink of death each time and still have a low AHI. Its not a tremendously useful measurement except maybe as an overview. Its easy to say that an AHI of  is bad but that doesnt mean an AHI of  wont cause problems.Its also possible to have breathing problems that disturb your sleep but dont qualify to be included in AHI. Some people are easily disturbed by breathing difficulty even if they dont stop breathing completely.Many people get diagnosed handed a machine and pushed out the door. Keep after your healthcare providers until you actually feel better. Also your doc should have explained the test results. Keep an eye out to make sure she is actually interested in making you feel better and not just generating revenue.gt I dont think I had any REM sleepREM sleep is important. Once you get your breathing straightened out it should come back. If not see above about complain to your doctorAlso just a heads up A normal CPAP or APAP machine wont treat Central Apneas. If you continue to have them and they cause problems you may need to be assertive with your insurance company. The machines that treat CAs are about x the cost of a regular APAP machine and the insurance companies may make you fail with the cheaper machines first.

ASV has a backup rate applies to it as a way to manage cheyne stokes respirations and if the patient isnt in need of having theyre respirations paced its incredibly disruptive to the patient.

10359509,0,t1_dciaou4,Its possible obviously Im not a surgeon so I cant say what theyd need to do for you. Your biggest road block for that though will be getting the insurance to agree. You probably wont meet medical necessity criteria the way in which they determine if they will pay for a claim or not since you have significant data from the CPAP machine indicating both compliance and effectiveness. So the insurance is going to say pass since the cheaper option is already providing you an acceptable medical outcome. I work in the healthcare field and we see this a lot. That said youre always welcome to try and I advocate getting second opinions. I pulled criteria from a few providers Nasal SurgeryAetna considers nasal surgery including nasal valve surgery polypectomy septoplasty turbinectomy experimental and investigational for the treatment of OSA because its effectiveness has not been established.Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty UPPPUvulopalatopharyngoplasty is used to treat OSA by enlarging the oropharynx it is considered medically necessary for OSA members who meet the criteria for CPAP or AutoPAP see above but who are intolerant to CPAP or AutoPAP.  The medical records must document that the member has attempted CPAP or AutoPAP before considering surgery.Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty has been found to be most reliably effective in OSA members who have adequately responded to a trial of CPAP or AutoPAP.  If CPAP or AutoPAP is unsuccessful in relieving a members symptoms this indicates that apnea is not due to obstruction.

If its  or  a lot of people get CO buildup because the mask doesnt ventilate properly at very low pressure or just feel like they cant get enough air both of which which can cause panic attacks.If he had it before its probably something else.In any case the fix is to complain to his doctor. ,SleepApnea,dcugh39,1,t5_2qs1d

11010276,0,t1_defqsfs,gt Ive never encountered the word titrationWow.  Thats really shocking.gt So its just being monitored while youre on CPAP?Exactly.  Were you diagnosed with sleep apnea using a takehome device or an overnight stay at a sleep lab?If youve been in a sleep lab before the procedure is similar.  You get wired up so they can monitor your breathing sleep posture etc.  Theres a CPAP machine there that they can control remotely.  They find the optimal air pressure to maximally relieve your sleep apnea.CPAP titration is basically the very next step after being diagnosed with sleep apnea.  Its bizarre to me that a. your doctor didnt have you do one and b. that they didnt even mention the process.  That would set off my alarm bells.So I would put it this way.  I am not a doctor this is not medical advice.  If I were in your position I would.  If cost were an issue for me find out how much a CPAP machine plus supplies will cost..  Decide whether CPAP or an oral appliance is the right place to start.  Sounds like youre leaning towards oral appliance..  Have the appropriate test to see how it works out  a CPAP titration or a sleep study with an oral appliance.  They make a temporary oral appliance onsite and use that for the test..  Go from there.gt Thank you so much for all of your input I really appreciate it! My pleasure.,SleepApnea,defzfuz,2,t5_2qs1d

11086296,0,t3_5x8tla,My husband has obstructive sleep apnea and after he got his tonsils removed which were abnormally large his sleep apnea became significantly more mild.I think it might help reduce your sleep apnea if it is playing a role in it but it probably wont make it go away completely so you would still have to use a cpap machine.,SleepApnea,deome9b,1,t5_2qs1d
11113457,0,t3_5ynk35,Same thing happened for me. Id check your minimum pressure I found mine needed to be a bit higher for me to be comfortable and also evaluate what other factors might be influencing your sleep. My checklist included Caffeinestimulant intake none after pm for me personally made a difference. Winddown period prior to bed with no electronicsphonefacebooketc. Alcohol use significantly increased the number of maskoff events. Getting adequate sleep I noticed mask off events happened more frequently when I was sleep deprived.Keep a journal and jot down things that might be affecting your sleep quality as well as events that happen with your CPAP. It will help determine what is impacting this.,SleepApnea,derp8w1,4,t5_2qs1d

It took  or  visits to get the adjustment of the fit just right but its really important to give it a chance. I tend to wake up with some dry mouth from mouth breathing when using it but I never adjusted to CPAP well at all after years of trying so if thats the price I have to pay then so be it.

11644058,0,t1_dgfnqq1,gt  Is there a benefit given that Im on an APAP?Yes the APAPs arent that intelligent. Every day is Groundhog Day. Every time it turns on the lower limit is whatever its configured to be regardless of wheter thats where it needs to be.The lower limit needs to be close to where the machine needs to get to or your sleep is going to suck. It cant raise the pressure very quickly without disturbing your sleep but if it doesnt raise it fast enough youll get apneas and arousals.The upper limit is mostly irrelevant as long as its high enough that it doesnt keep the machine from getting to where it needs to be.Once you get the lower limit set to where it actually belongs youll sleep a lot better. Also having it where it needs to be means that instead of reacting to apneas and hypopneas most of them wont even get a chance to start.,SleepApnea,dgfv8tg,2,t5_2qs1d
11725124,0,t3_676fvq,gt My husband has severe problems with mouth breathing. Its nicer if he can breathe through his nose since the nose warms and humidifies the air however its not a real problem or a personality defect. gt While he almost certainly has sleep apnea and that needs to be dealt with is this really the first step in fixing chronic mouth breathing?A CPAP machine should fix the snoring and apnea. Mouth breathing isnt a huge deal since there are a lot of fullface masks that cover the nose and mouth so it doesnt really matter which one he breathes through. For example I have allergies and its not uncommon to go to sleep breathing through my nose and wake up breathing though my mouth. It doesnt rate much more than hmm. my mouth is kind of funky and dry,SleepApnea,dgp2nau,1,t5_2qs1d
