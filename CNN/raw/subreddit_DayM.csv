2202271,0,t3_2k887i,Lol lol and lol. Its joke or what? I really cant  to believe what this is happen. Im a long time look at this mod and seen many things try to help... But I really cant to believe that you HaxMan turn back to Minecraft modding. Half year ago or more when you are gone and close project Ive tried to port this mod. Iam fixed  mistakes and how you said later I send my computer to fly in window xddd I do something like this but in the next week I again started to write a new minecraft mod. I called it the Last Days mod. At pervious time I used your source code and your models and Ive think thats will be zombie mod. After I i changed my opinion. All things that created not by me was deleted and I started creating mod from clear paper.  Now its published and still be in the alpha test. I think its done pretty awesome and you must try it  Anyways good look to you and your team! I hope now you can done this finally work ,DayM,cljrgla,3,t5_2uow6

Soon after I lost connection from my modem and had to wait several minutes before I could reconnect to my internet. The only proof would be to look at the server log and see where he said it and then when I left soon after.,DayM,co0v3pi,1,t5_2uow6
3013981,0,t1_co9p2xt,they should... accept for the th suggestion which MrCurtain answered cause your fists shouldnt be able to hit as far as lets say an axe and if youv ever played the actual DayZ game youd know that in that game the melee weapons that are heavylarge take time to swinghit someone axe takes about  seconds to hit someone in DayZ and is a  hit kill to the head so by saying that is dumb would be saying the mod this is based on is dumb as well. I think that the axes should be made to have a  hit kill to the head and a  hit kill anywhere else cause when I was fighting someone I hit them  or  times with a fire axe and they still were at two hearts in the end but i died... NaiZzRR in the future say why you think a certain way cause when u straight up say this is bad... that is very rude cause youre not explaining your reasoning.,DayM,coaebih,0,t5_2uow6

3456987,0,t3_2zt6pb,I definitely agree it is unfair for the Moderators to build impenetrable bases and I will have to bring this issue up with them. However some of your screenshots dont seem to illustrate anything unfair I dont see how a slab in a cobble wall grants an advantage to Moderators nor do I see a kneehigh fence with a mine which can be crafted by anyone mind you is an issue.I suggest next time you have any problems regarding the mod or the official servers you learn how to format a post properly.,DayM,cpmbm27,2,t5_2uow6
