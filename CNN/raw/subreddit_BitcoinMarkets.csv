Why would any sane person wait andor buy back in? Unless there is something changing on Jan  that is not already made publicly aware then there is no reason the market hasnt already reflected this information.  Beyond that  BTC is trending upwards not downwards. There is a panic buy happening rather than a panic sell.

58808,0,t1_cekni5b,This. Compare this current bubble to any other before it. Things do quiet down afterwards though it might take a while until the next bubble but in all it does consistently rise. I have made some bad calls in the past that wouldnt have happened if I had just stayed my hand a bit firmer for a couple of days when it did eventually bounce back. Come up with a reasonable long position and stick to that when things go a bit pearshaped. It sucks to miss out on profits by not selling at the top and buying back in when it turns down but you lose way more offloading your coins at the lower price and then buying again at an even higher price a few days later.Ive definitely learned that lesson if you fucked up on calling the top and it went down completely erasing your margin hold your horses and watch where it goes. A catastrophe today can be much less of a big deal in a weeks time.Even if you miss the top if youre gonna panic its better to sell near it as it goes down and go away with at least a bit of lost profit rather than lost investment. Losing some of your investment definitely sucks way more than losing some of your profit.,BitcoinMarkets,cel4jr9,4,t5_2wwh3

Again it is all going to depend on how the PBOC handle things from here.  Huobi should be everyones main concern.

200167,0,t3_1wbasz,With more colorThe Bank of Russia remarks that recently socalled virtual currency and in particular Bitcoin has gained a recent widespread proliferation in the world. Virtual currencies lack government backing and therefore its utilizers are free of legal obligation. They the currencies have a speculative character are implemented on socalled virtual exchanges and carry a high risk of default.The Bank of Russia is warning citizens and legal entities first and foremost credit institutions and noncredit financial institutions from utilization of virtual currencies for exchange of goods and services cash or foreign currency.According to Federal Statute  Regarding the Central Bank of the Russian Federation Bank of Russia the use of currency substitutes on the territory of the Russian Federation is forbidden.Due to the anonymous character of virtual currency activities undertaken by an unlimited body of users for their transactional use citizens and legal bodies could possibly unintentionally become involved in illegal activities including money laundering of criminallyobtained gains and financial terrorism.The Bank of Russia has issued a warning that the provision by Russian legal entities of services exchanging virtual currencies into rubles and foreign currencies as well as goods and services would be considered e.g. and treated as potentially questionable with respect to money laundering and financial terrorism legislation.                   .           .                  .                                   .                   .                                            .                                                . ,BitcoinMarkets,cf18ox3,2,t5_2wwh3

219012,0,t1_cf3d6ks,Youre directing the conversation back to the taxactionistheft paradigm.I am far more concerned about governments who imprison or murder their own citizens and murder people around the world due to differences of opinion than I am about what a tax rate is or is not.Youve already said people of different jurisdictions should should be able to make up their own rules.  You even suggested seasteading as a potentially practical option.And its definitely possible that you could get enough people on one seastead who believe there should be no tax at all.  Its also definitely possible that you could get enough people on one seastead who believe that there should be a  tax and everything is equally distributed.  It sounds like we both would agree that either one would be fine for whoever is on board.I guess the thing that is confusing me most about what youre saying now is that you dont believe in property ownership beyond owning your own body but you seem to think its ok that people who call themselves government claim ownership over all land on earth.  I would think that you of all people would think a small group of people claiming they own everything and being able to dictate what people can and cannot do on their land which again... is all land is flawed.  But seemingly you think that is ok from what I can tell so far?I  agree with you that smaller governments with greater connection among people are definitely best.  I  agree with you that good governance involves management and minimization of violence.I am also not asking you to defend American government practices I was merely pointing out one example of where a government uses force in a situation that has nothing to do with taxation and how according to what you appear to be saying so far that appears to be  acceptable.Violence to stop people from forming their own jurisdictions has nothing to do with taxation and I feel like youre dodging or perhaps just missing my questions in regards to that.  What if gay people want to form a jurisdiction where they can get married?  What if people want to form a jurisdiction where there is a living wage?  What if people want to form a jurisdiction where there is a  tax rate and everything is shared exactly equally?You seem to have indicated that you are ok with different ideas such as those if they take place on a seastead.  Why cant they do it on land somewhere?  Why is it ok for people with guns to use violence to stop them if they try it?  Using violence to stop people from doing that is a choice.  It is not inevitable.  The people with the guns and the people who tell the people with guns what to do can either decide to go after those people and instigate violence against them or they can decide not to.  It is a choice.  Why is the choice to use violence in that scenario acceptable?,BitcoinMarkets,cf3e347,1,t5_2wwh3

However I think this signals the imminent death of gox. This will be good and necessary in the long term however I think we will see another significant dip when gox actually dies. We could help mitigate this by some of the steps being taken for example not listing gox as a default on the chart sites. If everyone just pretended gox didnt exist from now on wed all be better off but I think people will speculate off goxrelated news and a lot of misrepresentation in the media will tank prices again.

Lets say for arguments sake its  million coins. These offline coins correspond to someones account and there are always coins in the hotwallet to provide liquidity.TxMal happens. Customers start requesting coins and Gox hands them over. Making the balance value of a customers account higher. Now all of a sudden you have  million coins in your wallet but the cumulative sum of all user account balances is millionandone coins. If this is done enough times the cumulative sum will equal  million coins.So where does Gox find million to cover all of its customers assuming  million coins are needed at coin?Any links providing more different info on TxMal would be appreciated.

So if your funds are available for lending but no one uses it for margin trading it will just be sitting there.Once someone lends your money I believe it is simple interest as the interest you are gaining is not being relended it goes straight to your wallet.EDIT You have to factor  main risks. Flash crash fucking you over and Bitfinex fucking you over. Over the span of  year what would be your interest gained if you had you money lended out for  days? Lets say for simplicity you use . so in one year you would gain . yield.What is your prediction for BitFinex closing shop and taking everyones money? Lets say  chance of that happening in the next year.And lets say theres a  chance of a flash crash where the lender cannot pay you back.So in this scenario you would have  to gain . profit but  chance to lose everything.I was tempted to just stick my cold storage coins for long term interest but decided against it.

552530,0,t1_cg304ds,Its been very clear since April of last year that Mtgox was a risky exchange to be involved with.  As I understand it there were instances before then but last year it was very very clear to this newbie to btc that people should stay clear of MTgox.  The only person I knew who actually did buy any btc from them did so because they were going to be clever and take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.  They ended up having to pay a premium to get their money out.  Everybody else made the rational decision that the only reason that mtgox was offering prices that were so wildly different than everybody else was that there were serious problems they were having to try to get around with enticing prices.

After April  if not closed the Central Bank will punish.  After the March Notice all Bitcoin website companies can open bank accounts but if they use their personal accounts they will be banned.It states something to the effect that this is to further strengthen Bitcoin risk prevention.EDIT the original report was from Phoenix Technologies and now that article has been removed  it was the top story at around pm US Central Time,BitcoinMarkets,cgd052h,1,t5_2wwh3

780245,1,t3_232en2,A few comments for today.  I remain perplexed by these rises in prices recently.  There doesnt seem to be anything that could possibly explain them other than that people who panicked are having second thoughts.  I still wont be buying until the price rises higher to demonstrate a reversal..  There are quite a few worrying signs that for the first time are highly negative for the future.  I dont worry about things like the reports out of China or what the Russians do because governments cant ban bitcoin and even if they could people in other countries still have access to bitcoins.  What worries me are two key pieces of information that dropped yesterday.  First Amazon declined to accept bitcoins and second the number of transactions has leveled off.  Another key statistic is number of wallets and that has also slowed to the point that some people are predicting significantly less growth because of it..  One of the major risks I see to bitcoin other than a technical issue like the MB transaction limit is the idea that people simply wont use it.  Bitcoin is clearly the best money system in existence.  But in todays world it doesnt matter if your product is the best it only matters if you are heavily marketed first and overly simplified.  Google now tries to answer questions in the sidebar rather than linking to pages that authors have spent months creating with indepth content for example.  Windows  got rid of the nicelooking Aero interface and replaced it with bland colors and Apple ditched nicelooking skuedomorphic designs in favor of solid icons..  Dtvs and bit audio are examples of two products that struggle in the marketplace at least bit audio is starting to look brighter now despite being obviously superior to their competitors.  They arent struggling because people dislike them its because of stupid reasons  with d TVs people think they look bad with the glasses and with highres audio they cant be bothered to listen to music with a decent pair of headphones instead of cheap earbuds..  I also talked about marketing.  Whereas PayPal has customer service representatives who call merchants to convince them to accept PayPal there are no people paid to sell the idea of bitcoins to anyone..  If bitcoins fail I will probably fall into an extremely deep depression because it would be another signal that we live in a world where most people are more interested in binge drinking on Fridays and Saturdays than they are about knowledge and discovering new things.  The signals recently of people not wanting to use bitcoins because they dont want to take the time to set up a wallet or because they dont understand them are very disconcerting.  These are real concerns that are much more important than whether China bans bitcoins or not.,BitcoinMarkets,cgsyujt,5,t5_2wwh3

844205,0,t1_ch07q1d,I agree with your first paragraph but aging is not as simple as curing cancer. Which is saying something since cancer isnt even a single disease that can simply be cured with a single treatment. In both the case of cancer and aging the cause is likely to be some complicated mixture of hundreds of things. No one drug will cure it.Curing aging wont be done with any old drug either. Itll be done with synthetic enzymes which would be tailor made to a problem only once the problem was fully understood. The technology to custommake enzymes is already here but we dont have a clue what the problems are to solve yet. Once we do we wont need a computer to run simulations anyway.gt d printers and bitcoins will result in anyone being able to do anything without the government being able to do anything about it.d printers have been around for a very long time  just not desktop ones that make little toys out of plastic. CNCs mills manufacturing facilities and even just hand tools  these things have been around for a long time. Sure the d printers make it cheap to make custom blocks for your LEGO set and we can see where the technology is going metal eventually.But Ive drawn up blueprints for various parts I needed for scientific aparatus. I sent them into a fabricator and got the parts back a week later for like... a few hundred dollars. Cheaper than most d printers. And the guy didnt ask me any questions about what the parts were for. Made out of aluminum to very high precision.So why are d printers scary exactly? Weve been living in a world where anyone can make almost anything for a long time already.gt These two technologies have made possible a world where the bad guys have far more power than the good guys.Na they just evening the playing field. Right now most of the manufacturing and economic power is in the hands of corporations. These are NOT the good guys. They are the morally indifferent guys whose main motivation is money. Bitcoins and d printers allow regular folks to be their own bank and make their own LEGO sets. IMO that actually improves the moral situation. Some people are going to use this stuff for evil but plenty of corporations do evil every day anyway. I dont see how either technology could possibly lead to some sort of evilfilled societal disaster.,BitcoinMarkets,ch08mzz,2,t5_2wwh3

We broke through the  range and popped up to ..  We are now in a positive breakout.  The price objectives are calculated by taking the width of the formation  columns and add it to the break out point.  That objective is .  The second method is to look at the last breakout which was two columns ago.  That breakout was a whopping three boxes.  That would put the objective at .Why the difference?  This happens because the price has been pretty stagnant lately.  Therefore one thought is that the price movement will be minimal.  The opposing view is that of the coiled spring.  The spring is the analogy for the width of the formation representing that the energy that has kept the price contained is finally released.  The wider the formation the more dramatic the break out.  The only way to determine which objective works this time is to wait and see.  Real technical huh?Either way the movement is backed by more volume already today than we have had for entire days the last week or so.  That gives the movement some conviction.Without some major catalyst I do not think this is the start of the next leg.

1047740,0,t3_2638e8,I understand where youre coming from. The answer I give to myself is based on two observations on very small times scales and min is such a very small time scale patterns dont become per se meaningless but they dont hold the longterm effects of the same pattern found on a higher time scale. in other words the NovemberDecember double top threw us down from an ATH. A min double probably wont have such drastic effects.The way it looks right now its actually a quadruple top on each of the  tops have  or  contacts with  . So the idea of a double top is not really given here. The way to conceptualize it is imo that the market attempts to break through resistance at  and failing to do so several times! doesnt drive it back yet into much lower price ranges. To determine if we will eventually break through  or not is Im afraid not going to be answered by simply seeing two or more tops here you will have to look at other signalsindicators.,BitcoinMarkets,chndsav,4,t5_2wwh3
1049193,0,t1_chnjfya,Reversals happen after the long poles.  If you look back at last fall we would regularly drop about half of the breakout before moving back up.  It did not happen every time.  It happened often though.  The reversal was like loading up the rocket with fuel.Download my chart that tracks from last June onwardDownload my excel file hereneeds daily updatingYou will see that for every leg upresulting in huge long polethe pole reversed about half way down from the break out before moving up again.  So using the current chart  The long pole warning is  boxes above the break out.  That is .  We keep going up and the current high is .  That is  boxes.  The reversal should be about half of that.  So we drop from the current high of  down four boxes....and we are right back at .  THAT should be the point we drop to setting up the next formation.  It could go a couple of boxes lower.  But it if goes back into the  area we retain our current formation and the count goes to which means if we break downward it would be hard.Its not an exact science but its played out pretty well.It works out the other way too.

1122702,0,t3_26ytv2,So I just did some back of the envelope work to get an idea of what a bitcoin shouldcould be worth when all M are on the market. CAVEAT  this is highly unscientific and far from accurate but its a quick and dirty way to get a ballpark baseline.tldr A very very very conservative bottom for bitcoins final value is How did I get here?  Global remittance market in   B  Global ecommerce market in   .T  Both numbers found on quick Google searchesAssume bitcoin captures  of the remit market .B  Assume bitcoin captures  of ecommerce B  BM  Now I realize this is a highly dirty number but I think it undersells potential more than oversells it. First and foremost the ecommerce number is BC only. Also pretty important is this is only counting coins that will be in use and many many coins will be saved and not available for remit or ecomm. Obviously both the remit and ecom numbers are going to continue to grow over time. Bitcoin may move beyond ecommerce to POS use as well. Hopefully bitcoin will be able to capture greater s of both remit and ecomm but I wanted to remain very conservative in my assumptions Ex if bitcoin gets  of ecomm we go to . Also there may never be the full M coins on the market due to losses and whatnot.There you have it my very very quick and dirty estimate. Thoughts?,BitcoinMarkets,chvwu80,1,t5_2wwh3

If the coins where bought in the auction to the same price like on the market there is still a high chance that we could break the trendline by just moving sideways. Simliar if they buy a little bit over the current market price. That means that there are ony  options how they can bid without these risk.  First buy much higher then the market price and build a catalyst.  Secound buy much cheaper then the market price. The market will just crash into the bidding price. They have more coins and not that risk of loosing money by failing trend. But dont they want the coins I mean really want so that they may accept to bid hihger much higher prices? No they can already buy from the miner or just wait for the secound auction if the first one failed for them. I mean this are just k btc in  days mined coins is   the same amountNext auctions should be comming soon. Which also means more coins going into the market. .....,BitcoinMarkets,ciiprxe,-8,t5_2wwh3
1325457,0,t1_ciipx1o,People submit losing bids on items all of the time. People dont only bid on things because they are sure they will win it. Thats why its an auction....You are so obsessed with this idea of thinking you are going to win or not. Its a silent private auction meaning you will have absolutely no clue if your bid is winning or not.You suggest that you would only buy coins off the market up until the price you wanted. gtYou only bid up to the level you wanted.Why in the world wouldnt you take the rest of your money and bid on the auction at that same price? Therefore doing exactly what Ive been saying all along Placing a bid and buying those off the market at prices below that price.Here we are again arguing something I didnt even want to talk about which is whether or not someone would bid. Im going to paste my argument one more time for you with the important part in bold. If you cant carry on an argument on my point then why do I want to argue with you over something Im not trying to talk about?gtIf I bid over market value it makes sense to buy as many BTC as I can below my bid price before the winner is announced regardless of if I think my bid is highest bid or not.Emphasis on the I bid over market value! You can talk to me about whether or not its worthwhile to submit a bid or not based on some false sense of knowing whether or not you will win the bid all you want. Ive never made any statement about that process. See me original reply to your post please.Im assuming the bidding party has already made their over the market bid. Do they think they are highest bidder? Do they think they arent? Do they have no idea? Doesnt matter! They are making the bid for whatever reasons they goddamn want to.What Im saying is that after they have submitted that bid they will buy coins off the market below that bid point. It only makes sense. This debate about thinking you are going to win or not is moot. The debate about whether or not they bid is moot. My entier point operates under the assumption that a bid above the market price has been submitted. Period. If you dont want to have a discussion on what Im saying then dont. Stop trying to turn this into some argument about irrelevant things.My point is and always has been throughout our discussion what a bidder would do after they have placed a bid above market value on some of or all of the coins up for auction. ,BitcoinMarkets,ciiqbl1,1,t5_2wwh3

1377038,0,t3_29vjyf,Just a quick update that doesnt warrant a separate submissionSo a couple of days ago I posted on some idiosyncrasies I noticed on Bitfinex that would essentially charge fees on entire blocks of unused swaps even if you use only a fraction. Kind of like being charged interest on your entire credit card limit even though you have a very tiny credit card balance. Even worse was that the effect reset every time you used it so it would keep happening with every swap replacement. Kinda like being charged interest on your entire credit limit every time you make a purchase. Obviously... this was pretty bad.Fortunately uRaphaelBitfinex saw the thread and looked into it. Ive since reprobed the BFX platform and am happy to report that particular idiosyncrasy has been fixed. Now interest is appropriately charged on just the swap you use whenever you close it and not the whole unused swap. The hourly flat rate for holding an unused swap still applies though so no free lunch! .Kudos once again to BFX for quickly responding and fixing such issues.Recently though about  hours ago i noticed a swapmatching engine error. New swap offers were not filling old swap demands. But new swap demands would take old swap offers. Hopefully uRaphaelBitfinex will take a look.Nonetheless good job on fixing the interest charge idiosyncrasy. I shall continue my analprobing examination of the BFX platform. EDIT Swapmatching engine error seems to be fixed now cheers to BFX for staying on top of things.,BitcoinMarkets,ciowc6a,39,t5_2wwh3

1383238,0,t1_ciplxvr,I refuse to touch LTC now. I think its been outinnovated by other coins. It offered a little bit of innovation in the early days and benefited from being the first altcoin to fork the BTC codebase but other coins have proven themselves to be vastly superior. Vertcoin is particularly interesting. Doge has a huge community and some serious infrastructure. Serious experimentation is going on in things like NXT and NEM.Frankly the LTC community just got lazy. They were all waiting for Charlie Lee to get them to accept LTC at Coinbase so they could all dump when the price and demand shot up and that never happened. Nor do I think it ever will. So what do you actually do with LTC besides speculate? As a result I think a coin like Doge is now accepted more places than LTC  which is astounding given how long the litecoin community has been around. A coin ultimately has to have some utility beyond simple speculation.I might try to mine some LTC to hedge myself but man Im not throwing money at it at this juncture.

I assume its mostly teenagers and young adults the ones willing to take this much risk. Also inexperience is probably the reason you saw about US M borrowed at BitFinex at over  interest per Day. World wide there are about  billion people and there is not a single sane soul borrowing the USD at  rate a day.For corporations to receive bitcoin and hold it would be an aberration the Citi note said. At the moment thats just been realistic. They are not making predictions for tomorrow. Thats today August . Corporations in that sense are not venture capitalists. Their business is usually about providing goods or services.If BTC was traded on a safe exchange where  like you said  informed and funded individuals could buy sell and short within ease the price would probably be much lower.I assume at Mt. Gox. someone tried out the power to create money and enjoyed it. Unfortunately when this someone understood the math behind it it was way too late and that drove Mt. Gox bankrupt. If they him had not decided to print money out of nowhere to buy bitcoins and play the price like it was a videogame Mt. Gox would probably still be here today been the largest bitcoin exchange and bitcoin prices would likely still be down there.

If the price rises you can close the position once youve reached your limit or the position will be closed for you once you dont have enough collateral to cover the position.

It is not perfect and it never catches the absolute top or bottom but it seems to be relatively reliable and my goal is consistently not losing money and turning a profit over time using a somewhat robotic strategy that doesnt require me to be that smart since Im not!.

Obviously somewhere in the world there is one largest single mine with a single owner or single ownership group.  There might be order of magnitude ten really large solely owned mining operations in the world i.e. not counting retailsold mining contract operations that already have payout commitments.  Loosely applying the Pareto Principle say there are  miners of various sizes including the very little guy buying mining contracts.   are mining  of the bitcoins.  Recursively  are mining   are mining .  are mining   are mining  and the top two are mining about .

We will definitely take them into consideration we are always trying to improve our products but we have to be very careful with large changes such as the ones you mention because inevitably some arent going to like it and there are always good actors who will get caught in the net trying to catch the bad ones. With the first example you gave the trader would have to conduct these trades at prices that dont have any other orders which means he cant move the price. As soon as they start to move the price they are going to be hitting real orders that have already been placed and thus they are just placing large orders onto the market. Nothing wrong with that. We will discuss the above points but for now we arent going to interfere with our customers trading strategies. We like our customers to know that they dont need to worry about their orders being delayed canceled broken up or reversed.  ,BitcoinMarkets,clp1m7g,5,t5_2wwh3

When we should be really building tech schools and encouraging kids to find a field that truly makes them happy not the most money.  Money is a bullshit reason to get a degree.

I query for invoices get the amount in usd request bitcoin deposit address calculate the conversion  to btc  tx fee  . for slippage then transfer btc from my wallet to theirs.  this entire process averages about s per provider.this is all automated and occurs from an orchestration job i have scheduled in our automation software.  if it fails my monitoring system triggers an alert.  at the end of the money financing tallies up all bills and validates payments.as you can see the largest flaw is validating payments.  if my provider received too much or decided to disappear after receiving my payments i have no recourse.  but we charge a premium on our service so were covered... for now.  the second this bites me in the ass im back to paypal on a monthly basis.i really wish all of my providers supported paypal subscribe then i wouldnt have to do any of this paypal subscription id is sent from paypal to provider paypal pays subscription id on a recurring basis,BitcoinMarkets,coi5n4q,2,t5_2wwh3

Their servers were messed up they are making a full list of people whos affected and getting Bitcoin back to us. This is info from the dozen or so emails Ive received over the last few weeks. I have legit been impressed with their communication. Maybe they are shady but I emailed them about the problem in a calm professional manner and have been treated back as such. I dont know how you decided to open dialog with them but if this post is any indication they werent excited in a yelling contest. You are probably on that list but you just accusing them of stealing your bitcoins is probably not making you look that great. Are they wrong for not being in contact with you absolutely. But with experience in the customer service field I bet if you email them in calm tone explaining that you are just frustrated and its a very stressful situation to be in and that any information to help ease of mind you might just get an email back. Take it or leave it but sometimes it just comes down to knowing how to talk to people and starting out with accusations doesnt always help.

3790229,0,t1_cqo9nf7,Although were not a million miles away in our viewpoints one of the reasons why I would not reasonably expect a downturn as significant as sub  is due to an argument that even you have supported which is that tomorrows price is easiest to infer from todays price.When we hit  the purchase volume was palpable it bounced like a trampoline. There are so many eyes on Bitcoin now and everybody is still very aware that the topside has already reached over . The reason why I would not expect lower prices than  is quite simply because people are expecting growth in Bitcoin and because there are no devastating technical flaws as yet and too much uncertainty to ascertain as to whether adoption will continue at a greater or less rate. We can only look at the story so far and say Bitcoin is growing and will probably keep growing but we dont know by how much The top of  is already in thats certain Despite inflation that inflation is known and there wont be any supply side surprises People are greedy and looking at the potential returns.The prices are now mostly fixed on peoples expected investment returns and given that people would expect a possibility of x returns in the next few years if we went from  back to  there would be too much buy in on that expectation to allow prices down that low for long which is why I expect the prices to stabilise.Im not completely fixed on this view of course and Im definitely open to hearing more of your arguments and anybody elses for that matter.,BitcoinMarkets,cqobe1g,7,t5_2wwh3

3841119,0,t1_cqu47qq,Everything you just said is true but also irrelevant. My entire point is that x leverage with  of your portfolio is not exactly the same thing as trading with  of your portfolio with less counterparty risk because less of your portfolio is on the exchange.

Im not interpreting your chart thats what you clearly stated.Now what you dont show is where that next price spike actually ends up because  is not even close.

So in a way the alts are a nice testbed to see how a blockchain behaves with these different values and if it turns out to be better then it makes the perfect case to change Bitcoin in a similar way.

4417407,0,t1_csn4byd,You might as well ask why would billionaires buy US treasury bonds that yield . or the public equities of mature companies.  Why dont they just start their own companies again?  The answer is that many billionaires are looking to preserve wealth not aggressively grow it.  Some of these people simply inherited a lot of money and know theyre not brilliant investors.  Others did something brilliant like starting a company  years ago that IPOed in  and netted them a ton of money and now theyre either retired or semiretired.  They dont want the work and effort of launching and promoting a new cryptocurrency they just want to preserve their existing wealth from currency depreciation market collapse etc.  Would these people put all of their money in bitcoin?  Of course not.  But they might put  in gold and  in bitcoin for diversification purposes.And final growth stage?  Lol.  Bitcoin isnt even nascent yet.  Less than a k people own even  bitcoin and less than a million people own any.  Most people in the world havent even heard of bitcoin.  Its market cap is less than  billion.  Compare that to Uber a company that is losing money every quarter with about m in revenue and m in costs that is valued at around  billion currently.  If you wanted to make a comparison bitcoin today is like the internet in .  A few geeks are really involved and obsessed about half the population has heard of it and is vaguely interested but the vast majority of people have not accepted it.  Will bitcoin explode in popularity?  Will it get adopted by billionaires?  Maybe maybe not.  But its currently been adopted by lets say  million people and that number could potentially grow by a factor of one thousand and itd still only be used by  of the world.  ,BitcoinMarkets,csnkrce,1,t5_2wwh3

Your opinion on litecoin is really no different than what many outsiders think about bitcoin.  I literally heard people say the same things about bitcoin in .

However if you were honest with yourself you would admit  of the transactions are simply garbage.  Either people sending money to themselves or running scripts to spam the network. Transnational volume measured in USD is  stagnant for  years.  So while transactions have gone up they are progressively getting smaller and lower quality.  And when bitcoins subsidy disappears and its up to transaction fees to pay the miners none of these transactions will be there to support the network.So sure hang on to that transaction chart because transaction volume USD fee volume USD active users price businesses accepting bitcoin are all going down.

5143656,0,t1_cv5nsta, We posted an announcement on our website today which Ill be sharing in this and other relevant threads. gtComments regarding the CFTCgtWe want to address the rumor circulating regarding the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC inquiries about our business operations and the potential implications of the CFTCs order regarding Coinflip Inc.gtFirst as of this posting we have not been contacted by the CFTC and have in fact proactively reached out to them. We are happy to discuss our platform and business operations with any interested regulator.gtSecond there appears to be some concern that the swap nature of our trading platform puts us within the CFTCs jurisdiction with respect to our U.S. customers. This may be true if Bitfinex were actually a swaps or derivatives trading platform. In point of fact Bitfinex is not a swaps trading platform. The swap terminology was used in the early days of Bitfinex when we didnt fully consider the implications of using that word. Bitfinex is an integrated exchange and margin trading platform with margin liquidity being sourced on a peertopeer basis. Furthermore because margin positions can also be claimed they should not be construed as another kind of nondeliverable derivative product. We have been considering a sitewide change of terminology to more closely reflect our actual product offering. Clearly the time has come for us to prioritize those refinements expect to start seeing these changes on our site very soon.gtFinally insofar as the CFTC is claiming jurisdiction over the spot trading of digital currencies it may be that all bitcoin exchanges domestic and foreign serving U.S. customers are equally affected. The exchange industry as a whole should seek further clarification from the CFTC on the regulatory implications of their bitcoin is a commodity assertion. If the CFTC is offering a comprehensive and uniform solution for bitcoin exchange regulation in the U.S. then we welcome that development and would look to comply along with the rest of the exchange industry. If however it represents yet another layer of compliance on top of existing and emerging state and federal rules and regulations then we believe that the industrys cost of doing business with U.S. customers will continue to increase stifling innovation and competition in what is still a fledgling industry. It is possible that neither of these interpretations is correct. Further clarification is required.gtIn any case our customers may rest assured that Bitfinex is being proactive in educating regulators on the nature of our platform and operations. We have cooperated with international and domestic regulators and law enforcementand we continue to do sowhere our assistance is required. We proactively continue to implement best practices to benefit our customers borrowing from various regulatory regimes around the world. Consequently we do not expect any interruption in our margin trading operations for our U.S. customers.,BitcoinMarkets,cv604hr,5,t5_2wwh3

All the news is about private blockchains and ledgers first mover advantage was lost a long time ago. gtStill by far the most secure blockchain by network effect.This is downright moronic. The network effect is the reason people will stay with fiat over Bitcoin. The Network Effect is why you can use your VisaMC everywhere but nobody anywhere accepts and holds BTCOne of my favorite things is when people make completely selfunaware arguments in favor of Bitcoin that actually contradict their own points. The Bitcoin network effect is tiny. nothing. more people have seen The Smurfs  in theaters than have used Bitcoin. It means nothing.gtMost Securethis is laughable. If its so secure why does a malleability attack cost nothing and drop nodes and cause delays? If its so secure how come the entirety of Bitcoins hashpower cant do anything to disrupt a private chain eating its lunch?Bitcoin is secure I can admit that but it isnt the only conceivable secure ledger and in fact privatized ledgersblockchains are just as if not more secure than Bitcoin. gtNeither were dialup bulletin boards but we didnt dump the internet in .Its nice that you can pretend we still live in  but in the real world its .

5526134,0,t1_cwi0a1z,The reason Im so sure is because the current market status is clear to me. There are several large whales controlling the market pumping and dumping every few months in a believable fashion which coincides with news about bitcoin development. This current pump is meant to capitalize on the preauction hype. The next pump will be a couple of months before the halving capitalizing on that hype. The only way the whales get richer the rich get richer is if everyday traders get poorer the poor get poorer. Every pump amp dump the average traders lose money buying into the hype and then feeding their cheap coins back to the whales months later.  contributing cause to price is whale action. News your measly  BTC purchase etc has no effect on the market. The whales dont want to compete they feed of the average traders who dont look at the big picture.,BitcoinMarkets,cwi0h8m,1,t5_2wwh3

If it breaks as I think it will heading down quite a bit.edit reasonsIve compared it with the past bubble and the similar patterns point toward around this timeframe  after climbing at this angle. Also look at the StochRSI and the arrow there. It looks like itll be crashing to the floor quickly if you were to imagine drawing the rest of it.Also as I type this edit its starting to break. Note how the tops round and almost begin to drip down.Expecting as low as  if it breaks quickly.  retrace and smacking trend lines.Psychologically people wont see it coming because it looks somewhat similar to previous patterns where it eventually went up and everything was okay. Extending upon that there were many buys on the way up. Assuming some are fully leveraged theyll get margin called as well. Because its vertical picking support walls arent the easiest either.

This is not a surprise this is not an unknown event the people expecting a surprise are vastly likely to turn weak hands and exit a lot of positions when their gamble does not pay off as expected.The positive expectations already have given the price upwards pressure.

If I would have kept all of the coins from the beginning and never mined at all simply put them in cold storage my btc portfolio would be six times its size right now. However I really do enjoy mining and the occasional trading on the market and make up for my losses on my  of play coins with mining and the occasional long sellrebuy to cover my play losses. If you enjoy the thrill of the chase then try it small and have fun. As a long term jobproject it will likely not be fruitful unless you are willing to hop in with a few hundred thousand dollars to move the market ala iceberg trading or market manipulation. Just remember that there are people with much larger wallets that will pimp slap you on occasion if you take that path. Trust me I have lost  of my play coins when a Chinese timezone person dumped with me and then rebought the market all the way up before my exchange even acked that my trade went through. I sat out for two weeks for the price to recover and learned a valuable lesson......Dont daytrade playtrade. ,BitcoinMarkets,cx7jdev,4,t5_2wwh3

6575587,0,t1_czzeud9,ThumbsUp is correct you have to calculate effective interest.If we take it further . is . actual if you count fees which comes to  in theory.The minimum term is  days and as far as I know the interest is paid at the end of it. You are not getting daily interest payments like on Finex. Therefore even though some of the loans return earlier we cannot simply calculate with  periods. They still pay simple interest for the second day though so that would still put us around . Not bad.If you lend out BTC for longer periods  days then the theoretical yearly effective interest decreases a little but it doesnt have the huge effect I expected. Good thing I bothered to whip out a calculator as Im also lending out some coins there so if the above is correct then Im relieved.Given I do not expect the rates to stay this high for long. Even unmentionablecoin will have to settle people are relending the coins gained through interest and an inflow of additional BTC specifically for lending purposes is also expected as shown by this thread.gtThe risk is of course that the btc have to be on the exchange which is less than good. Indeed you have exchange risk.There is also the risk of a loan defaulting. If a gamblers favorite shitcoin collapses and there is no liquidity to close him out in time then he wont be able to pay back the loan. His balance goes to  while you are not getting all of your coins back. Poloniex has a  maintenance margin requirement and the leverage offered is not too high so it shouldnt happen too often but the risk is still there.Overall if everything goes fine meaning no defaults exchange stays up BTC doesnt collapse etc and the rate stays high its not a bad place to park some excess coins but make sure you do it in moderation.,BitcoinMarkets,czzgxby,1,t5_2wwh3

As for coinjoin that  per year is again personally to me not worth setting it all up and keeping a machine online . Besides Im unsure how that is gonna scale.

Imagine the following scenario someone runs a bunch of notoriously dirty coins through coinjoin e.g. the coins known to be coming from a highprofile theft. You participate in the coinjoin.

You cant cash it out or buy it out at that exact number.For example to move the bitcoin price  negligible at current price youll need to sell BTC in Bitfinex alone. If we account for the other exchanges the figure might be in the BTC. So you can cash out around K without moving the price much.Eth on the other hand has only a couple exchanges and the figure is in the BTC. So to move the price with the same  you only need k. Yet ETH has  of the market cap of bitcoin.So if you have K of wealth in bitcoin or k of wealth in Eth the market cap is quite accurate for you.

6936196,0,t1_d12cytb,gt If I have BTC in storage and I can short BTC at x leverage Im effectively unexposed to any price volatility.And now I can tell you havent been around the block. You short btc using btc as equity and the price goes up . You get liquidated you no longer have a hedge and now you have btc where you would have had ten. Great. Youre right  your USD value is close the same as it was but price kept going up after you were liquidated so really you are down a little. But now price falls  and you have less BTC AND less USD than when you started even though the price is the same. That is the definition of volatility. Ups and downs. Tell me how youre unexposed to price volatility? There is no such thing as being unexposed when youre on margin. Any margin. Get that through your head. I was using margin on a position in VRX yesterday. I got motherfucking chewed up and that wasnt even x margin. Fucking thing fell  in a day. You think people expected that? The number of people that got margin called yesterday must have been astronomical. Thankful I got out before that happened but not before taking a large loss.  If you have this hapless of an attitude towards margin and leverage you really shouldnt be touching it...Not to mention if you want to continue hedging after youre liquidated you need to enter a new position read premium andor fees  interest if applicable theres no free lunch and also risk liquidation on that new hedge. Id rather be exposed to exchange risk than liquidation risk but thats just my opinion. If you had been using this strategy the last  months you wouldnt have any BTC left because the moves have been gt  in each direction each time and you would have been LQd many times over already.,BitcoinMarkets,d12jmjc,1,t5_2wwh3

6986196,0,t1_d1863y2,Cryptocurrencies are introducing new methods of valuing real world commodities.  For Bitcoin intrinsic value comes from the hardware infrastructure used to secure and transmit the ledger and all of the electricity needed for continued maintenance.  In the case of MaidSafeCoin the value of the currency is backed by distributed hard drive space.  Ethers intrinsic value comes from processing power on a global computer.  I believe the reason that folks are so excited about Ether is because with general computing power you can theoretically do all of the things that you can with other altcoins plus the countless more novel abilities that are yet to be invented.  However the overt complexity of Ethereums design may make other altcoin implementations better suited for the function of traditional currency exchange.

Now that we have SegWit and the storm is cooling down the markets are responding favourably. The event that made me bullish was the bounce off of higher pivot support at  during the Hearnia. That was a dark time for Bitcoin because its source code was being called into question. If  support broke it may have signalled a full trend reversal and a potential market death spiral. Since  held it created a massive triangle formation which generally translates into a continuation pattern of a much larger trend. When I zoom out on the d chart this latest move up looks very bullish to me. That said as a trader I still need to be objective and plan for all possibilities. Im bullish yet not married to my opinion and have an exit strategy in the event that Im wrong. After all trading isnt about always being right its about making .

But if you only open a position worth  youd only be using x leverage .x .x etc. So you can choose to use whatever leverage you want. The box that youre looking at there basically gives you a snapshot of the margin funding market.

This results in a very choppy market on the smaller time frames but the larger timeframes are actually staying pretty bearish h h and h.Though we cant be sure what the whales have in store for us here. But there is definately whale action going on in these levels. Earlier I saw a . contract bid flashed on quarterly futures okcoin just under ticker price. A signal for an extended and slower breakdown? A show of muscle in buying power? Its all just guessing.Right now i have been watching this flag to avoid being caught up in the small time frame chop. It looks like we have teased the downside and are now back up testing the support line. Short term stochs are bottomed so one would think it is a good time to buy.

Theres not really any way to debate that... like I said you can sping up your own SegWit node and verify that the blocks are actually .MB on your disk firsthand. You can likewise conduct a test where you send as many standard transactions as you can fit into a single block once on the regular testnet and once on segnet and you will see that you can fit roughly double the number of transactions in the segnet block.

Anyway LTC came out its halving with twice the price and a slight bull trend.

But it could be one factor.Certainly were all aware of many of these factors.And certainly Bitcoins throughput capacity is a significant fundamental which can influence peoples decision to invest.Traders might be happy with volatility in general.But I think many Bitcoin enthusiasts would be hesitant to recommend Bitcoin to their friends and colleagues right now as an investment  given the repeated failures to make any progress on the scaling debate which suggests that Bitcoin adoption and volume might not be able to increase and therefore its price might also not be able to increase much either.So a graph showing a  rise on news of possible scaling  and a  drop on news of failure to honor a scaling agreement  certainly is valid information for people who might be interested in fundamentals.Conversely I think many people would agree that the price would rise dramatically if the scaling issues were resolved.,BitcoinMarkets,d61jstj,-5,t5_2wwh3

8500327,0,t1_d642ng3,Why do you have to settle all positions on the site? Why not freeze positions that are not directly affected by the heist and reactivate them after order books fill up again? I dont see how forcing me to sell my Ethereum both in the margin position and the colleteral required to cover losses in the position to Bitfinex at a discount compared to other exchanges is a reasonable way to handle things. Since there is no order book at the moment it means you the exchange are taking on the role of buyerseller of all positions being closed aka you are directly profiting from buying my Ethereum at a discount compared to actual market price. I understand the whole think is a clusterfuck at the moment but stealing from unaffected cusotmers in none BTC pairs does not seem like the way to go. Edit uzanetackett Now that Im thinking about it instead of closing my position couldnt I just claim the position instead with fresh dollars? For obvious reasons Id much rather buy my own position at  USD then sell it to BFX for below market prices?

8900108,0,t3_51ykpe,Buttfinex just announced that they will give their tokenholders the possibility to convert their tokens to Buttfinex equity for  equity value per token. This means that butthurt token holders can be become shareholders of Buttfinex. Here is an illustration of shareholders before and after the conversion. Its basically a convertible debt at a hilariously bad equity rate.You are probably wondering why the orange piece of the cake is so small. This is because Buttfinex management values their company at  million. If buttfinex token holders convert their tokens face value  million to equity they only receive  m  mm of the company while in reality it should be close to .Lets look at Buttfinex real valuation. Kraken values themselves at  million so they are probably worth about  million rough optimistic estimate and Kraken doesnt have  million outstanding debt. So lets give Buttfinex the benefit of the doubt and say they had a valuation of  million prehack since they were market leaders. Considering the hack and the consequences on image and debt plus all the technical debt they still have no clue how the breach happened we can guesstimate their worth at  million posthack again very optimistic since they are basically bankrupt. Raising  million capital they are of course not raising any real money just converting funtokens into equity would therefore mean that the old shareholders would only hold  of Buttfinex down from  before the conversion and tokenholders would own . Because that sucks for the old shareholders they simply set their valuation to  million which means that they will hold  postconversion m  mm instead of . And all the outstanding debt money they owe to butthurt token holders magically disappears .But again no real money is being raised which means that even if Buttfinex has a valuation of  million posthack and preconversion it doesnt mean that they are worth  million after they converted their debt of  million into equity. The calculation just doesnt make sense because the tokens are not an asset unlike cash because they just resemble stolen money money that is not there there anymore. Their calculation would be technically correct if the customer funds were not stolen since the funds would then resemble a real asset it would still not be fair because  apart from the ridiculous valuation  there is no conversion discount. However Buttfinex is assuming that the tokens resemble underlying additional cash which means that conversion of their token debt into equity raises their valuation by the face value of the debt. Effectively the hack increased their worth by  million to  million. Seems like their management just doesnt care about wrong formulas and their customers dont understand the issue anyway so why not? Tokenholders now have the choice between keep shifting their tokens between each other free trading fees for Buttfinex and converting their tokens into worthless Buttfinex equity at a laughable ratio.In each case Buttfinex wins. This is good for Bitcoin!,BitcoinMarkets,d7hnys9,4,t5_2wwh3

An orphaned block does not pay out to its finder thus miners have an incentive to create blocks that are not orphaned.If a node cannot keep up then tough shit that node is obsolete and should be upgraded.  I have a pet project where I want to do blockchain validation on an   bit microprocessor.  Should we decrease the blockchain to k so I can do that?

Im brand new to btc so Im trying to absorb all I can.I live in a city of about k with a college population of about k. Because there seems to be fair potential for local market growth and virtually no competition Im guessing theres a market out there waiting to be tapped. And regulations yes must be followed all the time. Ill see how much my CPAtax guy knows about these things and go from there.To be specific at this point Im not developing the idea of purchasing btc in any large quantities hoping the market fluctuates too or fro. I would only be doing buys for whatever I expected to sell that day which I assume would become somewhat predicable as the business develops.Also Im only entertaining the idea of a straight forward street level cash exchange for btc business. After a level of trust is established with repeat customers I would imagine other avenues of transfer could be considered.And yes. would have to find an awfully friendly bank for sure.Funny the responses here range anywhere from basically youll go to jail to I tried it and left it to I know a guy whos doing good at it.

That way they allow people to own bitcoin but ensure that they cant easily send bitcoin outside of China in a massive centralized way. Of course this prevents Chinese from participating in any of the actual use cases of bitcoin or using ethereum contracts or anything like that.

9877431,0,t3_5gqrfk,Just wanted to point out how absolutely fascinating the market movement has been for the past few months. I dont think I can point to a period of time where the market chose to hug resistance for so long without feeling the need to drop down to test equivalent support. Clearly theres some massive accumulation or redistribution going on which is not at all surprising if theres a big move on the horizon.As has been my opinion for months now the refusal to drop down to test support is troubling. Theres always the possibility that the market will become exhausted at a critical moment where it attempts to plow through resistance...but the buying pressure just isnt there. The result would be a rush for the exits down to test support which might not be able to hold through such an onslaught. Buyers have been lining up to buy the dip at every available opportunity but the support areas they are buying at are predicated on an upside breakout. There isnt any real significant weight to them from a TA perspective. Im not trying to spread FUD and I do ultimately feel the next move is to the upside but Im being extremely cautious with how I approach my trades for the rest of the month. Im getting in when it looks like the market wants to move up and getting out as soon as theres signs of weakness.

Youll do even worse if your emotions get the best of you and you end up overtrading. Theres still major counterparty risk at leveraged exchanges. Beware.

10319480,0,t1_dcdrf9p,gt The amount of longs is generally equal to the amount of shorts on the chinese exchanges.On futures yes. On margin no. Futures is still going. It was margin that was shut down.And to be clear I dont even need to be right about there being a larger amount than normal of shorts for me to be correct about the implications of the margin restriction. By definition and in my experience shorts are always shorter term trades especially against a bulltrend like bitcoin has had the last year and especially margin shorts as they usually arent a hedge but are pure speculation. Not to say longs arent speculators but they also typically keep their trades open for longer periods of time when the market is trending. If you looked at the average time a short or long is kept open on the margin exchanges I guarantee you the shorts stay open for a lot less time. This means no matter what there is more churn on the shortside than the long side and with no NEW margin shorts to ALSO add to the liquidity on the sell side it should have the effect of increasing the price while the shorts disproportionately close against the longs even if nothing else is at play. But since I feel like we hit bottom at  longs have more incentive to stay open than shorts do especially since there cant be any new margin positions at the moment.,BitcoinMarkets,dcdrpt5,3,t5_2wwh3

A few quick pointersMB is the right size Luke Dash jr just submitted his scaling proposal which reduces the blocksize limit to k.Even a few months ago it was MB forever. Articles were published arguing that MB was a sort of golden ratio of bitcoin  Kyle Torpey and Aaron von Wirdum also published a lot of similar content. . Obviously this was all done for a political motivation to resist a change to the blocksize limit. The position was that core identified the MB bandaid that satoshi hardcoded as a temporary fix for DDOSing as being the Perfect Blocksize Limit. That was the settlement layer that lightning would run on offering unlimited scaleability. But Core didnt realize that people wouldnt buy this lightning model and actually want a blocksize increase. So their messaging completely shifted from segwit is a malleability fix to enable lightning and redefined segwits witness discount as a blocksize increase. Core will sell whatever they think people will latch onto and the dialog is carefully curated in rbitcoin.

10637803,0,t3_5s8g2z,If there are significantly more bids than offers then this is a likely indication that someone wishes to buy more bitcoin than those who wish to sell BTC which might result in a price increase in the near future. I would note that you cannot simply use one exchange to measure this especially if you are not using the most liquid exchange bitfinex. Order book depth is more something that you want to look at when considering which exchange you want to use especially if you plan on using leverage because if an order book is thin then you will need to bear the risk that a large order going against you will cause the price to move against you more so verses if the same sized order was placed on a deeper order book.  ,BitcoinMarkets,ddd7hrz,2,t5_2wwh3

10682380,0,t1_ddhrb0e,Segwit incentivizes spam as core defines it via the witness subsidy while offering very minimal tx throughput increases. It has more costs than benefits immediately.Furthermore this load makes any future scaling inevitable block size increases more burdensome on nodes relative to a simple blocksize increase by adding more data load per block. Its a trojan horse to block future scaling.If we ever decide that segwit was actually a bad idea after it is implemented it will be very difficult to reverse due the anyonecanspend kludge to avoid a hard fork and impact the UTXO set.Theres nothing wrong with segwit fundamentally but the segwit SF with central planning is broken. Segwit was meant to fix tx malleability and has been repackaged and resold as a scaling solution. If we want to fix transaction malleability we have flexible transactions. If we want to scale we can increase the blocksize limit. Segwit has no part of scaling and is a brutal tx malleability fix.,BitcoinMarkets,ddht1sv,15,t5_2wwh3
10685743,0,t1_ddhvgqf,I believe decentralization is a red herring in this context. Lowering resource usage for miners may slow the process down a bit but it can not stop it. Even any slowdown is going to be negligible because blocksizerelated resource usage for miners is currently capped but hardware is becoming more capable.Mining will centralize. I dont see a way around it as long as economies of scale apply and were using PoW. If decentralization is desired then proofofwork needs to be ditched. Otherwise whatever the algorithm economies of scale will rule and mining will end up in the hands of a few players.Satoshis view from what I remember reading originally was that the endgame would be an oligopoly of competing entities bearing the cost of running the network. Mining would not be directly profitable but the network would be valuable enough to miners and full nodes to justify subsidizing. I never saw any concrete measures fleshed out to make sure this scenario pans out. Core seem to not believe in it at all but also havent to my knowledge offered any reasonable solutions to keep centralization from happening.,BitcoinMarkets,ddi5jzp,0,t5_2wwh3

Of course the day before the low of the day was  but since the price hit a high we do not count that low even though it came AFTER the high.  The way this works is that if you move into another box in the direction you are going when the day starts you stop the process and mark the chartThe rise today to  gets us to a tentative reversal to a column of Xs.The break out occurs  and that breakout has the potential to mark the climb of the last breakout which was  boxes.  But that is putting the cart way way before the horse.So this could be a huge turnaround going into the final two weeks of waiting for an ETF Or it could be a consolidation.  or it could be a bounce with nothing else after it.At this stage of the formation the only thing we know is that it went fairly low AND that its closed up the range a lot.This chart would become official at  PM.ChartReferencesSome people have asked for references on how I build these charts.

Demo accounts are good for testing some strategies you are thinking about trying or for the beginning trader just to get a handle on the mechanics of placing trades but when real money is not on the line you trade entirely differently and the most important thing you will go through in your development as a trader is the emotional maturity that happens only with experience  I hate all the cliche truisms that are thrown around like take emotions out of trading and so on  you cant take emotions out of trading you can only be self aware that they are impacting you negatively at a specific time and coach yourself into a healthy thought pattern. The problem with most conventional wisdom as it comes to noob advice is you greatly expand or dilute the learning curve the more you advise them on safe things to do emotional learning and imprinting doesnt come from adding half a year of demo account trading unfortunately instead it just makes for more time usually wasted before productive learning begins. There is a reason there is a platform called ThinkorSwim close to sink or swim ie throw them in the water and put them outside of their comfort zone.gtThere are plenty of demo accounts that you can sign up for that give you fake bitcoins and you trade and get experience as if it was the real deal.This is like saying getting a blow up doll and practicing on it will help you with sex to a small degree yes you might understand the mechanics a bit better but it wont prepare you for the emotional aspect that is generated with sex with another person and not an inanimate object.

Historical market volatility in reaction to PBoC announcements was mostly weak hands selling into fear that china ban bitcoin will collapse value ala . The difference between ETF denial and previous eventbased volatility is that its a expected and b doesnt cause existential concern to the Bitcoin market. In fact many argue that an ETF approval could be worse for Bitcoin at this stage in its market development.

A quorum is needed and Clinton changed the rules to make a quorum  members bank in the s.Ive read stories that differ on the unanimous aspect.  Obviously ETFs dont just need to be unanimous but a majority hence the whole reason the SEC is more than one person.  But now its just  and you can have a tie.  I cant really find anything that says how ties are treated.  Usually the chair is the tie breaker.  In this case its the acting chair.In situations like this in the Supreme Court a tie constituted no action and the case is defers to the lower courts decision.  Its not a stretch of the imagination to say that a tie in the SEC is considered no action.  And in the case of SEC rules no action by March th means the ETF is approved by default.,BitcoinMarkets,delh9dx,9,t5_2wwh3

The former may be having a larger effect on the market for now but if a coin manages to take even one percent of the market for say online retail from PP and CC systems its going to dwarf bitcoin.

ETH is  or  supports away from going back to . so that could help as well.i think right now im  percent confident we will come to some sort of conclusion eventually and we are at a . percent chance of no hard fork after the news that was shown to the public.  short term jihan wants big bucks maybe wants to retire rich later with his  corns.  i wish this topic were as alive as the etf days but i guess everyone sold for alts ,BitcoinMarkets,dg40jho,6,t5_2wwh3
11545781,0,t1_dg4fo2u,This is the best post I have seen on here and concur with your assertions. This situation is very much similar to the MtGox banking situation and we are starting to see a premium creep up on BFX because of what is going on as far as trouble with fiat withdrawals.gtBitfinex are extremely unlikely to be being transparent on the extent of their woes but filing a court action  especially when youre a Bitcoin company with nonexistent Money Laundering controls  is very unlikely to be successful and will only serve to focus further attention on them. This is the more interesting part of WHY did they choose to file that lawsuit  I have been arguing with people that once one US bank sets the standard all will follow so it most likely means they have lost access to USD clearing markets through iFinex INC and I think this is why they are attempting to fight it. If it was just so simple to change banking ops this would have been little more than a blip but now IFinex is black marked and will likely be stunned from establishing any future USD related banking relations.Edit This was just brought to my attention that even Mark Karpeles himself even posted about this  ,BitcoinMarkets,dg4psvw,2,t5_2wwh3

Somebody should have told them the price was just a figment of their imagination! ,BitcoinMarkets,dgv2ny0,2,t5_2wwh3

11810344,0,t1_dgyqiqf,Sorry but people like you are the problem in the Bitcoin community. You think SegWit has some sort of RIGHT to be activated. You fail to realize that people are free to exercise their free will and pick which implementation they like the best. No one is BLOCKING SegWit. Many people just like Bitcoin Unlimited more.Please tell me whats blocking the  of undecided hashrate from picking SegWit? Whos blocking them? No one. They chose not to pick SegWit because they dont like it. If they liked it they would signal it.,BitcoinMarkets,dgyqrzv,11,t5_2wwh3
