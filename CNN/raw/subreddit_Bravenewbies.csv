365120,0,t1_cfi9onr,Yeah I think the general complaint about minmatar is that they have projectiles and missile ships as well as armor and shield tanking ships. Their projectiles and missiles shoot all mixes of damage types which you wont find in other races so give a lot of flexibility. Generally minmatar is the can do everything but the master of nothing line of ships. Owing to that Training them up is time consuming and theyve rarely been the optimal choice ships for specific tasks. I trained them up personally because I want a broad ability to play the different parts of eve and switch around my role easily. I think this is probably easier to do now than when I started theyve gone through several iterations of simplifying the skill requirements to make it easier to cross train racially. Generally my advise though is train the ships you think look coolest then take that ship to the fleets you want. FCS will always complain about your weird ass ship joining their fleet but FCS are always complaining. ,Bravenewbies,cfilywg,2,t5_2w7lx

437308,0,t3_1z3976,Fellow logibro here  o!The rejection can come from a couple of reasons nothing to do with your playstyle Either it is a frigate fleet going out where logi isnt that needed as you are just not fast enough in locking people up before they die or the ships are just not tanked enough that it makes a difference for logi being there. Sometimes frigate fleets love logi sometimes they dont and they prefer someone bringing DPS or tackle along shrug The other is the much more probable You just dont fit with the style of ships the fleet is going out. Normally there are two styles of fleets going out Shield tanked or armor tanked. In a shield tanked fleet everyone looks to maximize their shields their resists and whatever. As soon as the shields are gone they are basically naked and die very quickly. For this you need shield logi like the Minmatar Scythe or the Caldari Osprey edit Had Oneiros in here someone pointed out I got my logi ships mixed up. The other kind of fleet is going to be armor tanked. Similar to a shield tanked fleet but just looking to maximizing their armor resists and such. For these fleets all shields are just a tiny bit of extra buffer before the real layer of armor is hit. For this kind of fleet you need the Gallente Exeqoror or the Amarr Augoror. Bringing shield logi to an armor fleet or vice versa is useless as you wont make a difference there and are more a liability than an asset to the fleet.If you are limiting yourself to one race of ships you are going to have a bad time. A fleet needs to be well rounded to have chances of success and especially when we run doctrine fleets the ships which are going to be there except from Fast Tackle are nailed down to each module. The most popular fleets at the moment are the Pocket Rocket doctrine using Thorax Gallente with Scythe shield logi and the Furrox doctrine using Ferrox Caldari with Scythe shield logi.The next doctrines will be armor based and use Amarr ships with Amarr armor logi.Just be a bit flexible play what suits you AND what benefits the group you are flying with the most.  edit Fixed caldari logi ship name,Bravenewbies,cfq3bqi,5,t5_2w7lx

Having corpmates on comms nearby in known configurations means help is on the way.The locust fleet is what Id imagined though. DIs get experience. Newbies can fly tackle and intermediate pilots can bring cruisers and one or two more advanced pilots can fly BCs. Because NPCs are weak and because fleeting would make the missions trivial it would mean nobody has to gimp their fit.

I was there when we took our first sov station after leadership for months insisted we wouldnt be playing the sov game.  I sat around and orbited a base while doing nothing for most of it.  Leadership patted every one on the  back and acted like it was a huge deal.  Ive yet to see any kind of impact of getting that base.

745274,0,t1_cgov5j6,Part of the problem is that a number of core skills cant simply be highlevel they need to be maxed out to be viable and maxing skills out takes a long time.  What they should do is change the way core skills give their bonuses.  Instead of giving a moderate perlevel bonus give a large static bonus and then a small perlevel bonus.  For example Power Grid Management could give    per level or    per level instead of  per level.  This would let CCP keep their existing ship stats so hopefully easy to implement and preserve the longterm importance of core skills while giving newer players some leeway in their early training.  ,Bravenewbies,cgozso1,5,t5_2w7lx

807417,0,t1_cgw1w66,Most essential functions were handed over when she resigned as director which is why the backend is up again. Sadly Draleth still had some access owing to the fact that she had done a lot of good work for BRAVE IT over more than a year. The idea was that since shed resigned diplo directorship willingly and attempted to do no harm from that position there was no reason to punish her further by removing all access on the IT she also worked on. Sadly it would appear Draleths reason for quitting directorship out of the blue was less a graceful bowout and more of an attempt to force everyones hand. When that didnt give the expected outcome she lashed out to all of BRAVE indiscriminately.I want to point out that the responsability for this sorry waste of time and energy lies not only with Draleth but with everyone who all too willingly took part in the ridiculous witchunt that spontaneously generated itself once emotions got high. I talked to all parties and I reviewed their claims and there was nothing more tangible than illadvised chatlogs and speculation. In the end it was our own lust for selfdestruction that drove the situation to this conclusion.

1140297,0,t1_chxrrt6,I cant really decide if youre a troll or just misinformed but Ill answer to this.First of TESTies dont shoot nonTEST fleet members they dont scram or neut them either. I can think of maybe two current BRAVE individuals TESTies would do this to and I can assure you that youre not one of them.If someone smartbombed in the middle of the fleet it might have been a firewall ship. Ones designed to smartbomb away enemy missiles. If it wasnt tell me the name of the guy and Ill talk to him.gtI mean WTF butthurt over not being able to get a little sov? We didnt want sov. We couldve gotten sov way sooner but we just didnt feel the need to. Its a lot of hassle and we lived just fine without it for almost a year. Whoever told you that our guys did this because we desperately crave sov was grossly misinformed.gtAlso for anyone saying we NEED test? Take a look at the next fleet you go on.. take a look in Comms. bet you the fleet is  BNI  others  test.TEST has been doing a lot of work thats not very visible for line members please check the cap ops numbers next time you participate in them. Also look at the amount of fleets lead by aspiring TEST FCs like Erik Pentecost and youll quickly see that we are indeed pulling our weight for the coalition. gtI swear all test does is sit around and bitch things and then fuck over blues. And this finally convinced me that youre likely a shill. We love our BRAVE bros with very few exceptions. Our people didnt blow anyone up out of spite they blew them up for laughs and immediately reimbursed them and the majority of people on both sides was cool with that. It was a one time thing and well ensure that this wont happen again. ,Bravenewbies,chxw7an,4,t5_2w7lx

1166596,0,t1_ci0u90s,Theres a difference between getting people to learn and being elitist about it.If newbros fuck up nobody should haze them they should instead be told what they should do better next time. Telling them its okay you dont have to learn were all terrible is worse than telling them yes that was bad so heres how you could do better!If people have been playing this game for a few months or are new even they should strive to become better they should be taught to become better. Winning is fun way more fun than welping senselessly. Becoming better doesnt mean becoming elitist. Going all were bad and due to that not being willing to improve oneself is a problem that TEST had for a long time. Youll become apathetic youll become content with welping your FCs will stay bad your members will stay bad and youll just get wrecked every single time you undock.If you teach your newbros how to not lose their atron instead of just giving them one and sending them out youll breed a bunch of players that are good at the game but have fun at the same time. I want to have FCs and players that are not afraid to die but dont welp senselessly. I want to have FCs that know when to disengage and not just fuck everyone over because welping is fun. Welping from time to time is fun. Welping on a drunk op is fun. Welping stratops over and over again because youre either too bad to do otherwise or because you feel obligated to is unfun for everyone involved and ultimately not financially sustainable for both the alliance and the alliance members.,Bravenewbies,ci0v19u,5,t5_2w7lx

By leaving an ABC roid unpopped it would slowly regenerate to full size again. ABCs popped elsewhere had a chance of showing up in your system belts. Slowly over time your main mining system would get most of the ABCs.It is possible to test this by surveying all the belts in the constellation and seeing if quiet systems have more ABCs.Then again this was  years ago and the mechanic could have been changed.,Bravenewbies,cibji98,2,t5_2w7lx

A gigantic mining colony along with a trading hub is located there and the inhabitants are extremely afraid of what might happen to them should Sansha declare ownership of their solarsystem.

Brave must evolve its core and the core is tired of losing and wants to ship up.  The stain campaign is a prime example of this. yes we have noob ships for players to try it out the way we fly but only the skilled come back and fly again. we have much on field at risk and being able to depend on another pilot to make the right choices is a must.

We chased them to another gate then they warped to the FE gate and we jumped in as soon as we landed we didnt wait to casually uncloak we were self warping ourselves to the gate and jumping in and uncloaking ASAP. Cruisers are kinda slow If we had known you werent scram fit we would have just told you to get safe because they were rapid light fit which just eat frigates alive.

2190911,0,t3_2k68ja,So if engineering is your safe option that would make you just a teensy little bit way smarter than most people youll ever meet.What you do is you finish the engineering degree.. You get a diploma thats actually worth something.. You will have picked up a shit ton of knowledge that is applicable in very many different ways. Basically you bought yourself a fantastic toolkit that youll be carting around with you all through your life. Most people do not have this toolkit.. So you dont go into engineering because you dont like many aspects of it. But thats ok. Youre so far into it right now and you are actually intelligent enough to pursue it. Dont knock it. Most people never get there. Finish the degree.. Find yourself a job working with fish. Fish are never not going to be important. Do something amazing. Also because you are by then an engineer you are actually employable and you will be able to address many problems that people around you wont be because youre an engineer baby.. An engineering degree pays. If you get a job anywhere you get to say Im an engineer. Your pay scale goes through the roof. You will make considerably more money than other people. But if you miss the degree youre going to be a clod just like everybody else who doesnt have the degree and believe me for some people that difference actually matters. The people who it matters to are the people paying you.. As an engineer you will have insights into problems that many people never have on a practical level. You will be able to apply that knowledge widely as mentioned before.. Youre there anyway. Youre on the way. Finish the degree. See it as part discipline part plan part life lesson. Discipline you learned as we all do that you very often have to do stuff that you dont like doing. And most of us have that experience when not being an engineer there is a qualitative difference there. Plan you acquire the knowledge you will be able to apply it to your later life when you found something amazing to do with the engineering toolkit stuck firmly between your ears. You win already youre a motherfucking engineer. Engineers rock they do they really truly do!. Life lesson through perseverance you overcame the hard part doing something you hate. On the way to achieving meaningful knowledge and a toolkit that has a value beyond what you perceive to be there today. I have retained and expanded on knowledge just because I loved and still do to read as a kid.. Better money in your career means more options in life. It makes an amazing difference in your life.. You will be able to connect to very many more people because of your enhanced perspective and having that piece of paper makes you a valuable person to talk to. Your perspective being better will be sought after and respected.. More money means better toys means better sex. Do not underestimate the opportunity for having better sex.Youve got a lot ahead of you being an engineer. As an engineer you will have opportunities that nonengineers never get even and it bears repeating if you dont work as an actual engineer. You will be able to focus on the things you love and have the means to pursue them both intellectually and economically.Go be an engineer its a better life.,Bravenewbies,clibgyk,39,t5_2w7lx

2245508,0,t3_2kvd4y,Alright I know the VNI is a popular ratting ship and lots of people will tell you the best way to fly it but if you want to make mil ticks then you need to fly the ship taking full advantage of its bonuses and its ability to speedsig tank rats.This is the fit I use for running FHubs every day of the week. Basic procedure is  Undock and turn ON DCII Omni and SeBo  Warp to site at km  Double click directly down to get your ship moving  Lock up what ever celestial object in the anom looks to be closest to the center of the anom not a big deal if it isnt the exact center.  Launch drones and select ORBIT on yourself  Lock up rats  Select Orbit  km once you have the celestial locked up  WATCH YOUR SHIP ALIGN once you appear to be in a stable orbit and your velocity is steadily increasing turn on your mn AB. mn ABs turn you into a slug so you should never try to turn sharply or align to anything with it on. If a neut comes into system or you need to bug out of the site wait for your AB to cycle off before you align or you will be stuck waiting for a s align timer. Plus your drones will be slow to catch up to you if you are still burning at full the ms  AFTER you have achieved a stable orbit your speed is approaching  ms and you are comfortable with your sheildarmor status the rats should not have been able to burn through your shield yet but its not a big deal if they have I normally start to think about bugging out if my armor ever dips below  most of your EHP is in your hull tho so try not to freak out if you loose all your armor THEN have your drones engage the rats. It will take them a few seconds to get there but your nav computer will really help cut down on the time they spend flying between targets  Once you are comfortable you can launch a MTU if you want I prefer to just launch one after I finish the site near the center of the wrecks or just come back in a salvaging destroyer and tractor everything in manually since all the wrecks will be fairly close together anyways  Shoot hulls in this order frigs gt crusiers gt battleshipsFollow these steps and you should have no problem scooping together a pile of isk in no time! o,Bravenewbies,clp99b7,3,t5_2w7lx

2250792,0,t3_2ky4hw,Once upon a time long long before our current patch. Before the coming of Phoebe there were scary monsters who lurked in local and watched with open eyes and ears for any noise of capital ship movement. They watched and they waited and could leap across the universe in minutes to pounce on unsuspecting prey. The biggest and scariest of the monsters Pandemic Legion and Cluster Fuck Coalition loved to run around and ruin peoples days and harvest the tears of dead carriers and dreadnoughts and super carriers. Then one day CCP our highest of gods sent us a savior to combat this use of capital ships and the transportation methods they used known as Cynos and Phoebe came to us and made it so Capital ships cant go half way across the Universe using Cynos.

On top of that the k alpha you re speaking of is with emp but bombers are almost never gonna be in your range that way.

2375077,0,t1_cm53p55,sry man but now you re being plain stupid. I hope you do realise its slightly difficult to defend a fleet with only about  antibomber ships against a fuckton of bombers.Also i wasnt there so idk what happened but usually maulusses and celestises are not even closelly anchored with the main fleet. So ofc the ts aint gonna protect them. so ye derp.Im willing to learn from situations but im also capable at looking at circumstances and be like oh durr i suppose  t cant actually clear a fuckton over bombers shooting the lenght of the entire grid.Also your jack of all trades master of none bs doesnt go up. Im afraid you dont seem to have a single clue to how to fit ts. And omg im hating this for having to repeat this but apparently reminding people of what was said before we ve been over this is not appreciated. The proteus is fit as if it were a combat protues thus with lots of tank good dmg. The only difference is that instead of tracking computers it has points. The antibomber part is merely them having a bomber tab open and shooting em when they show on grid.The legion is combat fit exactly like you d fit a combat legion. No difference.The zealot is fit the way you would in normal combat. No difference.The Ani is combat fit. No difference.The only ship that has a slightly different fitting is the loki. We chose to go for a loki that is uberoverly tanked and has no guns. To a loki that is tanked enough that it wont die and does have guns.So plz look at the fits and inform yourself about how ts work and are fit.

I also put any special snowflakes like HICs recons or Ts onto watch list and then fill remaining slots with other logi. Benefit of watchlist is you can see that they are taking damage even if they dont broadcast. Otherwise watch the broadcast window  make sure to reduce clutter by turning off target broadcasts under settings  and control click the broadcasts to lock people up and rep away while listening to any calls from the logi anchor.Logi usually has their own mumble channel so dont hesitate to ask questions and like most things in EVE the best way to learn is to jump right in. ,Bravenewbies,cme4mrs,2,t5_2w7lx

With tacs we dont have to probe and when were only fighting defensive timers we can set them up on the objectives at our leisure. And compare  tengus to....  t fit kestrels that can alpha a slippery pete off field with mediocre skills and have the range to play cat and mouse with bomb warpin traps. Just imagine slippery petes dicking around in your tacs off ge station against a kestrel fleet. The tengus would have to fuck off or get farmed.

And we have provided options when needed  eg the AB Scythe has two fits the optimal fit for those with shield upgrades  and the newbro fit for those without.One of the things being worked on in this overhaul is the consistency between doctrines. For example the ugly duckling moa has three fits one of which is the standard fit with T guns. The caracal doctrine has two caracal fits HML and RLML use the one the FC asks for both with T launchers and no fit with T launchers. In this case the only changes needed if you cannot use the T launchers is to use the T meta variants.

If you feel you have been unfairly punished and been excluded from Brave Collective services please file a complaint form contact your CEO and if possible message your corp Diplomats.  Creating multiple public outcries is not conducive to discussion and only serves to clutter public channels.

In fact its fairly easy and very rewarding as long as your willing to put the time in. gtWe NEED good responsible people to step up and take up the mantle of leadership for the alliance. Positions like these attract the fair share of shitheads and fairweather types that just want the shiny title.

3419324,0,t3_2zdq3d, Focused void bombs have a m area of effect making them quite difficult to aim  particularly if PL has antibomber bubblessupport ships adding pressure. Antibomb firewalls are also a thing and manymostall ships in the PL blob have smartbombs. If you can make it work though they will ruin triages day in a hurry. Geddons get slightly more range but Abaddons tank and neut more extra high slot. Ive long advocated antitriage MJD Abaddons since a small number could shut down triage for very little cost given healthy T insurance rates for battleships. A functional fit can even be trained in less than two weeks since few skills are needed to jump in neut and jump out. It would cause chaos be hilarious and work  the loses would be worth it considering the shock it would cause.  T neut ships tend to be expensive and fragile. Heavy neut curses or something could be cool but they are probable too easy to counter. My new pet idea is a Fusebreaker Legion  cloaky nullified warp core stabilized and fit with neuts. FC scans down triage and drops the squad on the triage. Everyone immediately drops cloak and aligns out bookmarks the spot and runs neuts as they go. Once yellowred boxed by anything threatening individual pilots warp off cloak then reengage one at a time. You might lose some but I can almost guarantee the first time you try youll neut out an Archon.Remember an Archon locked into a  minute triage cycle is dead once neuted out. It cant get cap or reps while in triage and should melt under TenguEagle fire before it can refit to an effective cap rechargingboosting setup. Even if the pilot lives he or she will be scrambling to stay alive instead of you know repping the TFIs. Neuts will do exactly nothing to a blob of Aeons though capital capacitor emission modules generate gobs of cap from thin air and the more aeons the more neut resistant the blob becomes so this is about winning the fight against subcaps with light triage support not winning the war. The only answer to a super blob is a bigger super blob or a big dread blob and the dreads wont exactly walk away from the fight unscathed so I doubt thats reasonable to plan for or attempt for HERO. ,Bravenewbies,cpi10a5,5,t5_2w7lx

Look over the skill plan and tailor it to your needs skills are a constant thing in eve and its important in my opinion to balance effectiveness with fun.

3582528,0,t1_cq0moiz,It was actually several communications failures that lead to the situation and especially one misunderstanding that Arik and I shared. I was considering posting a full AAR of what went wrong in the next week or so still gathering info but Ikll give the TLDR of what I know apologies if its not  accurate!.Basically we were aware a deployment was coming at some point since before fanfest. Lychton had some sort of plans that fell apart during fanfest and there was a miscommunication that we would hold off doing anything until fozzie sov hit. When GE got its armor timer Arik and I were still under the impression that deployment was several weeks away so we organized the evac to HEDGP. I was privy to most of the correct info but between RL and my sov responsibilities failed to catch onto everything.This is when Lychton made his SoTC which was a somewhat annoying surprise to me. There was another major miscommunication that caused Lychton to assume I knew the plans ahead of time and stuff was already prepped. Then there was the notsosubtle difference between a moveevac and a deployment. I was worried about pushing the PANIC button too much since Lychton and others had been using the term deployment and my initial info was that we would still be protecting some catch systems though in retrospect PL could have still done exactly what they did regardless of how much we wanted to defend things. I know Im missing a lot of key details and Im not trying to throw anyone under the bus or avoid blame upon myself I definitely made several of the biggest fuck ups. There were lots of compounding mistakes that were made that lead to the full disaster and Im still piecing together all the details.,Bravenewbies,cq0mxun,16,t5_2w7lx

3586136,0,t3_31f6ls,RampD Agents supply datacores which is one of the two mandatory ingredients for Tech II invention the other being Tech I BPCs you might also use decryptors  Even if youre not interested in doing Invention its worth using RampD Agents to generate the datacores and sell them on the market especially if you can move them to markets closer to nullsec where they are harder to get. I would actually just stockpile them for now youll either use them later or they will be worth more when we leave lowsec for null again. Then again Ive gotten the sense that one of the eventual changes to sov null will be the installation of Agents in your own space which would be super sweet for inventors who dont want to schlep back and forth to lowsec or highsec to get their datacores. Who knows if that will actually happen or when though.Crius did change Invention a lot and from what I understand from dev blogs the changes arent finished yet.

The CNM Floaters and to a certain extent the CEOs of our Alliance sister corporations are the only people in leadership he cannot directly select. The fact that Lychton has always governed with a gentle touch he encourages line member participation and feedback and has frankly been AFK a lot recently has given people the false sense that he isnt solely in charge. Hes got the power he need merely exercise it.Besides that hes been working with these guys for a long time and has had plenty of experience with thwarting former coups. He should have seen this coming and if he really cared to stop it gotten the fuck in game and done something about it. His total lack of communication during the drama proper combined with the fact so few line members seem to really know and trust him anymore were disastrous for his leadership in this situation. ,Bravenewbies,cq4gw5h,2,t5_2w7lx

Theres a lot of people from line member to director who do not like PL and do not want any deals with PL. Lychton chose to keep that information opsec so people wouldnt panic.It was the right move.

3646255,0,t1_cq7p8b0,wait a tick.....so you are saying that what Lychton wants is more important that what Brave needs like set goals and benchmarks for the alliance and coalition to work towards? I can totally understand and agree that the situation leaves a bitter taste in everyones mouth but TESTs assumptions that this was being plotted over a length of time and in the self interest of a select few is not accurate in the least.TEST needs to realize that Brave does not revolve around Lychton and the majority of Brave leadership old and the CEOs felt that new leadership was needed.  We are talking about people that are friends with Lychton and care about him IRL making this decision.  This whole coup thing was not intended to get rid of lychton.  It was to remove him from the Alliance leadership position but still keep him in Brave and part of the process.  He is still the BNI CEO and has a strong voice in decisions.  ,Bravenewbies,cq7wfax,0,t5_2w7lx

The dudes who do this are smart enough to use throwaway accounts or come at you from other entities our comms are not secure. Will you hear trolling andor be the recipient of it in Brave? In my experience yes. If you report it though it will be dealt with to the fullest extent possible. Its particularly important that sympathetic people report it when they witness it andor speak up for the person being harassed so these incidents do not go unchecked to the point our culture actually becomes unwelcoming. Ive seen this shift back and forth in Brave and I hate to see that pendulum swing too far toward open trolling.The current ado was further complicated because certain individuals found it politically expedient to feed a woman to the wolves and that nonCagali leadership is happy to either quietly stand back and watch it happen or even join in themselves but thats another issue altogether.

3685359,0,t3_32l2z5,Last week was a difficult one for me as someone who is exTest and still very fond of people there.Sapporo DHD and the others firmly nailed their colours to the anticoup camp to the point of setting most of our leadership KOS. Thats in some ways trivial in some ways not. Ofc anyone can shoot anything in the space we live in so in game mechanics terms it meant nothing. However its a statement of intent and most likely a bridge burned.For Brave line members our first impression was that Lychton had been kinda terrible during the evacdeploymentdefend to the last breathdont form clusterfuck that marked the end of the alliances time in Catch. We now know that he was actively sabotaged and cant judge his leadership based on those events. Instead we must look with grave concern at how effective the traitors succeeded in being.In hindsight Test is in the right you backed the countercoup all along. However to those of us who were trying to keep it going we were adjusting to working with new management. New management that appeared to be needed. Even Lychton said he would be transferring power at the weekend.So it seemed to me that TEST committed to a Grr Malanek path that burned all bridges and would have seen our alliances red to each other had the countercoup not happened.Im still not comfortable with that. A  alliance is bigger than any one person even Lychton.Moving forward I think its for BRAVE to define its own values and goals. If taking sov means we have to put up fences maybe its not the open friendly accessible nature of our alliance that is at fault but rather the plan to take sov. Maybe we need layers of security so that people get scrutinised when they step up  for instance if part of the promotion process for a Junior FC was to submit a more detailed API.I do think that if there is one thing Lychton is outstanding at its protecting the alliance from outsiders. He has an incredibly tough and unnoticed job in fending off all the agents spies and enemies who want to infitrate our leadership  and he has to balance that with enough delegation happening to trusted people that shit gets done.I think Brave is now in a good place and will move forward well. I think what needs fixing is in the hands of people who know what to do and that most of these issues arent nearly as straightforward as appears in your post.,Bravenewbies,cqcct3e,10,t5_2w7lx

3903563,0,t3_3548ue,Naugs are the natural progression to mallers. Theyre just better in every way. However until you start being able to fly guardians and naugs I think mallers are a better fit. What I suggest is getting your FCs used to flying mallers and augs first and then progress into guardiansnaugs. Both fleets fly exactly the same and people can bring a maller to a naug fleet or a naug to a maller fleet if they like they integrate seamlessly. We did this a lot when I was FCing waffle mallrats. That being said I think the next natural progression to this is to a leap into not domis but prophecies and geddons. The geddon is vastly underrated and does the same job as a domi but has the added bonus of using neuts plus you have some nice projection if you fit a couple of cruise launchers on it. Unlike domis geddons punch WAY above their weight class. They can kill triage and supers effortlessly and have a decent chunk of DPS. For the less skilled pilots you can use prophecies which do the same job just not as well just make sure to tank them properly. for anyone wondering whether or not what im saying is false I used to FC waffle malller naug fleets quite a lot and theorycraft for PL. Gobby was the one who persuaded me of the benefits of using geddons and after having them integrated into PL fleets where I was FCing triage their tanking ability is more than sufficient in most cases. They also have a LOT of dps and the bonus nobody wants to get anywhere near you. You bring a  man geddon fleet you might actually be able to start using triage. Without the geddons when we were fighting you in catch us using triage would have been incredibly difficult. ,Bravenewbies,cr18np1,8,t5_2w7lx

3943269,1,t3_35lw7j,I dont claim to be an expert by ANY measure.  Ive just purchased my first JF.  But after doing a TON of research a  Billion ISK price tag will make you do that I have a few tips that have been a huge help..  Bizar Raizens Jump freighter guide is absolutely fabulous. . Not all stations are created equal.  Some have a larger dockable ranges than others.  Download and keep a copy of this document.  Itll show you exactly which stations to avoid and tell you where to place your cynos.  . Read through this guide as well. . Bouncing from a station is almost certain death.  Its better to be m outside of range than bouncing away from the station at ms.  Some guides tell you to place your cyno around .km so it doesnt bounce off a structure.  Dont do that unless you are absolutely sure there are no objects you can bounce from.  I prefer km placements on stations with large docking ranges like the Amarr station in YZLQL.. The Dotlan jump planner is just about the best tool for figuring out your route.  Itll take a little while to figure out its routing quirks but when you do its the best around.  . Before you try your first jump....before you even BUY your jump freighter spend at least a day practicing jumping on the test server.  Itll keep you from loosing your ship when you invariably bounce off your first station.YOU WILL BOUNCE OFF A STATION.  Youve been warned.      I think this covers pretty much everything.If you do things right you should follow the following sequence.  . Undock cyno ship and travel to your desired cyno spot.  . When you arrive undock your JF.  . When JF undocks press CTRLSpace to limit station drift while maintaining invulnerability.. Look around for dangers such as being in a bubble wait until session cooldown is over. ish seconds.  . If all clear at origin AND destination activate cyno.  . Jump.  . Wait for cooldown dockup immediately.  . If your Cynoship survives the minute cyno dockup.  If anyone has questions or needs to add anything please reply below and ill update.  Thanks a lot for the feedback and correcting me on my mistakes.  Edit Bizar Raizens Jump freighter guide is absolutely fabulous.  Edit Removed Heron Cyno fit since rookie ships are perfectly capable of functioning as a free cynoship.  Edit Corrected sequence added CtrlSpace fixed cyno time.  ,Bravenewbies,cr5rlji,0,t5_2w7lx

We were stationed in Germany and I planned to attend the th Anniversary ceremonies for DDay as it coincided with our  days leave after coming home from Baghdad. Unfortunately the situation in Iraq worsened and we were extended an extra  months so I missed the ceremonies.Finally in July  we left Baghdad and went home to Germany. Two buddies and I rented a car and commenced on our European road trip.  Ten days after leaving Baghdad we were on Omaha Beach.  Keep in mind we had just spent over  days as infantrymen in downtown Baghdad. In those  months we had seen dozens of acts of courage and heroism in the throes of combat.  However nothing we saw could hold a candle to what had happened  years prior on this beach or in the months that followed. As tribute I took off my shoes and socks waded ashore on Omaha Beach and hoped that I had earned it. Later that night we were in a bar in Caen and my buddy mentioned to a guy next to him in restroom that we were American soldiers fresh out of Baghdad. We didnt pay for another beer all night. People would buy us a beer or a shot or just stop by to shake our hands and to thank us.

He still majorly fucked us. Obviously if he fucks us even more no one else in the game is going to give him a shot.He stuck around and tried to patch things up so he could get in somewhere else not for some I feel bad shit or to help us out. If he was the one guy who completely screwed brave everyone in EVE would hate him. Even though we are red to different alliances most of everyone wants us in the game because we give an outlet to new players. You have to look at peoples motives when they do things like this. This is the BEST possible alternative for Lquid. He just fucking walked out with a clean face a goodbye post and basically fucking won the aftermath. You screwed yourself by allowing Anna to put him in that position when Anna was already a known fuckboy who betrayed lychton a year ago. I hate to say it but our leadership alliancewise looks fucking idiotic right now. The least you couldve done after their big Sith Lord take over was tell them to get the fuck out remove all roles and admin powers from programs and give IT powers to someone who isnt shady. Get your god damn heads out of the sand.Put all of this drama this and that to sleep. Kick these fuckers out tell everyone theyre shit and move on. Im all for being classy and nice but its a shame youre so quick to forgive someone who worked pretty hard to destroy everything that you built. Newbies want to blow shit up and he wanted to take that away from them. Its been two months and Lquid is being thanked on the reddit?
