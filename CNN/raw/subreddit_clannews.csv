2956087,0,t3_2u0w9l,Ok.Heres exactly why more points are B.S.Bigger does not trump effort.Its not hard for them to get everybody online.They break themselves down into smaller groups exactly like smaller clans.Each smaller group has a leader exactly like smaller clans.They are a mulismaller clan in a big clan wrapper.Nothing special or harder about that.Accountability for no shows are no different.All they do is turn themselves into smaller clans.That deserves more points?!No.I think managing a clan of twenty or more is exactly the same.Coordination on capping and strategy still has to go through multiple channels as lobbies can only be  max when concentrating on a single mode or double capping at the same time.Period.,clannews,co44e2c,2,t5_2veg5
2956353,0,t3_2u0w9l,TBH I think they need to take global leader boards out and stick to bracket sized leader boards. If anything have a battle royal type thing every few months and put every single clan in each respective bracket face each other then you can have a leader board in BR wins or something.      I could take a roster of  people and totally dominate a  something bracket getting  participation all day everyday of the week. There is no reason a group of  should be anywhere close to the DD points that a  person clan is getting organizing  people. Easy fix is only have leader boards separated by bracket.,clannews,co45hc7,4,t5_2veg5

3058788,0,t1_codl224,female assassinThe entire point of your very well started post is this. We need changes. I agree.Well guess what? We will NEVER have point system changes from BeachHead as long as a few more well known or bigger name etc.. keep dismissing any clan below the size of thirty as insignificant and any clan competing at  or lower as not really a clan. Thats the point you are missing. As long as the community is fractured with a few of these more well known clans saying the above saying everything is ok ....why would BeachHead make changes? So if we cant even get a simple bonus size point fixed what are the odds of getting much deeper and more complicated matchmaking and SoS multipliers put in? Probably next to nil.Dont believe me? Take last weekend for a perfect example. Some of the BeachHead people were tweeting away last weekend about the wars and practically all their attention was about PWN vs LG. Jizzing in their pants at how much fun it was and how it would be great if they could keep playing. Whats next?  A few days later...BINGO.... We now get announcements for a third day on clan wars. BeachHead has tunnel vision. They see these few isolated big wars and then think thats best for everyone. They see these guys loving the present system which guarantees them as a lock for top  with the size bonuses and right on cue BeachHead pats themselves on the back thinking everything is fine and dandy.Heres whats going on. BeachHead keeps believing the above bs and other places like these boards a few big clans YoYo...they all keep passing along these myths it reinforces to BeachHead what they are doing is just wonderful. Myths like how only big wars have strategies how only these bigclan leaders  can comprehend the game. How only big wars are fun to watch. Only big wars are hard etc....Blah...blah...blah. Do this enough....BeachHead then thinks is...Everything is fine...Again...You have to start small. Think low hanging fruit. If you cant even get the ridiculously outdated and dumb bonus size reward eliminated from this game or at least fixed to reflect real difficulty....do you REALLY think other more complex issues will be changed? And if you cant even get the clan community to agree on something as blatantly stupid as bonus size points. look at how many people argue this with me....how are you going to present a united front on deeper changes?Change doesnt just happen. Its a process.Clan Wars was fun last year. It had a ton of problems but they were easy to look over because it was the first year of trying something. This year? Its getting tougher and tougher to digest this present game because very little was done to fix the issues from last year. You can look over a first time mistake. Not fixing the mistakes the second time? Not acceptable. ,clannews,cof1h0k,0,t5_2veg5
3098792,0,t1_coj6kf9,As another EST player in PST this is how it should be I give props to those in EST wars but I cant tell my family my kids that I cant play with them or watch a movie with them on Friday Saturday and Sunday because I have to play a video game! ,clannews,coj6sm5,3,t5_2veg5

3102644,0,t1_coj9rtk,Another thing that goes into that as well is when searching for games bigger clans have a larger chance of running into other parties from there clan making one of the groups having to back out and wait to search for a game,clannews,cojl673,1,t5_2veg5
