10107739,0,t1_dbou2vd,How do you define a bad game?For me i would call RCTW bad from many different aspects like how pathing isnt really possible how difficult it is to make a coaster how difficult it is to rotate an object ... the list is long. Even things that arent in the game like how dev communication was with us how they handled the critic... I saw a clip on how they already released a mobile version for this game... it makes me feel like they made it only to make some easy bucks because of the name... This is the big picture on why I feel so strongly that this is a bad game and not just not a great one. also i had aprox h on rct I feel that the difference is huge from building aspects to the finished feeling of that game ,RCTW,dbp1spg,3,t5_330uj
