139185,0,t3_1vo6or,I make gels not chews but what I do is screw around simple science. Basically take a tray and make a bunch of small batches recording what recipe you used for each one. Use slightly different recipes and then taste them all and see what worked best. If you want it to be softer I think thats what youre saying? try using less gelatin and or more liquids. Also Ive heard that using agar agar gelatin works better for chews. Best of luck!,runmeals,ceua77c,2,t5_2u5gn
