3088623,0,t1_cmlmr1a,Two months later... Try this...    SELECT pqnumbereditionname FROM         SELECT s.pqnumbere.editionide.editionname        FROM nledition enlsent s        WHERE e.editionids.editionid      ORDER BY pqnumbereditionid DESC editionname   x    GROUP BY pqnumber  This works on two steps.  First you create a result table with all of the pqnumbers and their editionnames from highest editionid to lowest.  Then you select on that result table and group by pqnumber for which mysql will return only the first rows.  This sort of thing would only work on mysql though so dont try on Oracle or anything.Alternative reading,learnmysql,coi4u24,1,t5_307eo
