3534045,0,t1_cpv2ogm,It really depends on the specific router so I may or may not be of help but ill try. If you know your local IP address eg ... type it into your address bar like youre going to any other webpage. If not open command prompt and type ipconfig that will show you your local ipv address. Once there you should be greeted with your routers login page. If you dont know how to log into it or never have before a quick google search should help with that. Once inside look for a setting called Port Forwarding. It may or may not be under advanced settings. It should look similar but probably not exactly like this I have a few lines covered up because I dont want a picture showing every open port on my router. Once youre there just enter the ports I mentioned before. It will probably ask if they are TCP or UDP ports or in my case they have separate fields and it does matter so make sure you get those correct. Once thats all said and done save it and you should be good to go.I wish I could be more specific but every router has the settings in different places so I really cant help much in that regard. If my little guide doesnt help a quick search on your router  port forwarding should yield an easy enough guide. Let me know if it works out for you!,EmulationOnAndroid,cpv3sah,1,t5_33syo

5227035,0,t1_cvg0s3i,Yes. D As well as any other devices anyway off course reicast and ppsspp can be hit or miss. But it runs as well as it can. Playing project diva on it upscaled to native p with no frameskip no multithreading and no speedhacks! is a brilliant experience and looks much better then on PSP.DS emulation is perfect so is dosbox nes snes master system megadrive psx n as good as it gets anyway but mario  runs fullspeed again in p rendering even and plays great on the analog! gbc gba amiga msx arcade. Disregarding the fact that the dpad is a bit mushy and small all of these systems are emulated perfectly.And android games run like a charm. In fact I benchmarked this midrange device against a galaxy s in gfxbench onscreen framerates in manhattan and trex were  higher on this device then the  euro s edge. Not kidding.gamestreaming works fine too. Also you can actually configure the gamepad to be an xbox one or ps and it reloads the other driver on the fine. So for example you can set xbox  default for all your streamed steam games and ps for san andreas because then the analogs sticks work.Firmware in general is great it never ever crashes and is quite smooth. Compability with apps from play store is quite good and most games works native with the controls. Otherwise there is great mapper.OVerall I really recommend this device if you want to watch videos play heavyduty story driven android games like san andreas and tomb raider and walking dead and such and pspds games on the go. For really old arcade still emulation I again recommend the Q because of its ridiculously good dpad. D,EmulationOnAndroid,cvg1rsp,1,t5_33syo

NDS PSX ScummVM Dreamcast and everything else on PSP all working on playable speeds on minimal to no Frameskip. Of course all the older generation consoles also work perfectly. I also love the speakers since I hate using earphones when Im at home much better sound quality than anything else Ive tried S series Note series. Though IMHO Id think one of the newer Galaxy Notes would probably be better because of the bigger screen and the SPen which works awesome with Drastic my old Note  was quite the emulation device.

There was an update in recent past that fixed the absolute worst of the timing issues but the sound is still not quite right and seems to be out of time or fall out of sync. Once that happens it doesnt seem to recover the sound either.I recommend ePSXe its much more accurate and recently added a GPUx setting that basically doubles the internal resolution on the hardware renderer similar to what FPse does with their xx software mode. IMO the GPU x on ePSXe looks better though about on par with OpenGL mode but without the bugs. ePSXe doesnt have that fuzziness that the default renderer for FPse does.Theres also retroarch for a free alternative but the interface is a bit unintuitive.,EmulationOnAndroid,cx9pw6b,2,t5_33syo

6137182,0,t1_cyn7052,Yeah other than one month where Jay took over Ive been handling GotM since I came on as a mod. Its a bit of work but I enjoy it. As for the challenge last month I did not beat it last month didnt even play it last month but Shining Force was one of my favorite games as a kid played it over my uncles house a ton and later myself when I got a Sega Genesis and I have actually completed the challenge before. Ironically I did it by accident. As a kid I didnt understand all the mechanics and promoting didnt work early on so I didnt bother with it. Since I didnt know how to promote or how it worked and I just enjoyed the battles and the animations so I just stubbornly bulled through it despite numerous failures. I was obsessed with the game for quite some time played it for months eventually even beating it and playing through it again multiple times. There was simply nothing else like it at the time.The trick is to beef up your mages healers and the optional characters Domingo Anri Guntz Tao Zylo Gong etc.. Its tempting to stick to the centaur squad but despite being powerful in the early game they have a poor leveling curve and over time arent as good as other characters promoted or otherwise keeping one centaur is still good though. Ken or Arthur up for debate. Give him a thrown weapon that can attack across two squares or diagonally.Its a ridiculously hard challenge though and even when I did beat it back in the day probably only one or two of my team were still alive. I remember even uselessly beating on the boss with Anri with her staff and just using the team as expendable meat bludgeons against the boss. PIn some ways its maybe cheating as I think Domingo and a few optional characters come prepromoted but since youre not actually promoting them it doesnt count against the challenge.Edit  Actually if you search Youtube for Shining Force no promotion theres someone named gurvmlk who took on the challenge a while back. Not sure if it was actually completed or not but there seem to be a lot of videos associated.,EmulationOnAndroid,cyn8ef1,1,t5_33syo

Rather intense lag spikes  gt  on avg when entering towncastle in beginning. Turning Audio latency to low and Audio Sync off seemed to help a few times but lag persisted.     Found this result by NotTheAndroid on the PPSSPP forum So I was reading that Frame Skipping can increase FPS and thought maybe the sound issue was being caused by low FPS. Sure enough I enabled it set it to AUTO and the sound problem on the worldmap disappeared! It also fixed the sound issue on the opening video.One thing to add is that this did cause slightly less smooth movementvideo play but its still an improvement over the sluggish way it felt before. Im guessing this is more of an issue of the emulator now than anything else and can only get better over time!     I tried doing the same and it did improve somewhat audio stuttering is gone for me. Lag still happens occasionally repeatedly enteringleaving town engaging in combat about every  or so times.        So yeah I suspect its an emulator thing.,EmulationOnAndroid,d01yu8b,2,t5_33syo

8353573,0,t3_4u0afs,I got my hand on another Beboncool controller. This ones design seems to mimic the Moga Hero but its a little bigger overall. As usual I will be testing on Android only although it seems this controller can only be used as an android HID device with LG G V. .. and Samsung  GT V. ... This controller only supports Android HID and is also usable on PC but does not have Xinput so really only emulators will work unless you do some pc voodoo that I am not willing to do.ampnbspThe Beboncool B is the second controller from Beboncool that I own. I was not impressed by their Classic Controller but the B looks promising. Usual suspects are here Dpad  face buttons startselect  shoulders  analogs sticks clickable a home button and there is a nice cradle with a locking mechanism. The controller is like a mash of XB and Moga Hero its a really good size bigger than the Hero but still small enough to shove in a cargo pocket. Feels good in the hand the quality seems solid and has a nice weight to it. No creaking or snapping noises when you apply pressure. It Seems like Beboncool has their QA game on lock.ampnbspPairing the controller was easy no issues or problems here and lag was in the normal range. Using the controller for extended play was comfortable the design is very ergonomic IMHO and felt almost as good as first party console controllers.  Using this controller around the house or on the go was fun and playing games from retro to native was.. again fun. ampnbspThe analog sticks are good on this controller.  Going through a lot of other BT controllers Ive recognized a pattern. No one wants to get the sensitivity right on these controllers from the cheapest Chinese Terios T to the expensive Bitdo all the sticks have problems mostly oversensitivity. The Beboncool is no exception. The sticks themselves feel good and have a quality build nice resistance spring back to neutral as you would expect and have a nice clicking button. However similar to the Ipegas the stick is fully thrown at the halfway point so youll need to be extra accurate on games that require delicate movement of analogs. ampnbspThe ABXY buttons on the B are a big improvement over Classic.  The buttons are still convex but dont protrude as much and the softness of the membrane I guess makes long presses easier on the thums. So rolling from button to button is not taxing.  The ABXY buttons are good here not much to complain about almost perfect. The start and select button are right next to the X button so if youre not careful you could accidentally pause the game right when youre fighting Orge in Tekken and mess up your grove!!! But seriously its a small adjustment and really shouldnt be counted as a negative.  ampnbspIts always my favorite part of controllers the Dpad. I repeat myself over and over again. The Dpad is crucial when talking about classic retro games especially fighting games. This Dpad is concave like the classic Sega Genesis controller and XB Duke but not as loose. If youre used to PS or Nintendo Dpad you might not like this one. Its accurate tight and very convenient for rolling and its all one piece but still manages to feel like each direction can be pressed without fear of accidentally hitting a corner. Its different not exactly my favorite Dpad but its good and gets the job done.ampnbspHere I am with my pointer and middle fingers snuggling really close together on the shoulders and triggers.  Theres no problem with the shoulder buttons as they are easy to press and have a clear engage point with a nice resistance to them. The same can be said about the trigger although the trigger could stand to be just a little wider. Still a great set of buttons on the top of the Beboncool B. In case you missed my last review of the Beboncool classic controller let me tell you that this is a major improvement because the classic lacked  shoulder buttons essentially making it useless with psx and n. But I digress the wrong has been righted here.ampnbspSo there is a weird dial on the top of my controller that I havent really seen on a lot of other android centric controllers.  Then after reading the instructions and actually spending some time with the controller itself. Its very clear that this little dial engages a lock on the cradle mind blown. It is really that simple to impress me. So usually when Im lying in bed and I get that itch to save the princess Ill need to sit up because all the controller cradles on all the controller that I have will buckle at the mighty weight of my LG G.  This is not the case here ladies and gents. Ok so the Beboncool has a cradle fits up to . blah blah whatever. What makes it different is that dial when you turn the dial to lock the cradle it somehow magically locks the cradle in position. From  to  degrees or whatever but its locked and will not buckle even upside down!ampnbspOver all I was impressed with Beboncools B controller. It manages to completely surpass their previous controller in almost every way.  From the buttons to the shoulders cradle to the shape the B is currently the best controller that I have tried from Beboncool. All emulators recognized the inputs and most native android apps except for Asphalt really tired of your shit gameloft. I would definitely recommend this controller to a friend and I might actually buy one for a friend who love that convex style Dpad sega nerd. You can find the Beboncool B on amazon for around  USDampnbspP.S. I included photos of the instructions. Ill start doing that on my reviews and Ill update the reviews Ive already done if I still have the instructions.,EmulationOnAndroid,d5lr004,4,t5_33syo

9674637,0,t1_da50v2e,Im sure its ideal for RPG games such as Pokmon or Mother  but I was actually interested in knowing if input lag is an issue. Mainly with regard to SNES platformers. I have subsequently found an article where the guy measured android emulation against that of a GBA SP. The results found that all android emulators have about ms of input lag compared to ms GBA. This is likely the reason why I have never enjoyed using android as a means of recreating the pleasure of classic SNES platformers. ,EmulationOnAndroid,da5loir,1,t5_33syo

Games that work work well but theres also no save state support and the app doesnt support sleep so if you task switch or turn off the screen it will restart.The rest are good though. There are two versions of MAME available for Android and Id also recommend checking out aFBA as well.

My friends who play smash will notice the increase in latency just from using the wrong kind of TV.

11475574,0,t3_62pr0d,I have the Shield Tablet K. I use a .A charger and it takes . hours to charge from completely dead if I am not using it. If its in use it can be a different story. Depending on how much youre doing with it especially multitasking installing apps in the background while you use another app for example it can actually continue to drain while plugged in and in use.When emulating older consoles think d and playing less demanding games I can get  hours of battery life. For more demanding consoles anything D or poorly emulated  hours is more realistic.The really highend Shieldexclusive games tend to drain the battery very quickly. I wouldnt expect more than  hours with BL.,EmulationOnAndroid,dfwr2wp,2,t5_33syo
