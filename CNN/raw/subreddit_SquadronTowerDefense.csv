5530152,0,t1_cwielg3,Mistook Phoenix typo for bone overseer instead of fenix .  So what stacks on the merc and wraith the slow? This is new to me. Is there a list of what stacks and with what ? Good luck with seer as best vs fatty or is there  something new Im missing? For  to spend on a meridian I will spend on other things than a meridian. I usually only build them as a last resort pre wave .   disciples or  prophets are better options of spending. My dislike of earl is based on experience for waves after . I actually avoid making any earls. ,SquadronTowerDefense,cwiixoi,1,t5_37rnn

5914742,0,t3_3wb8g9,Game has assimilated without the warden. Dragon is the albeit new warden. Warden wars were tasteless fosho. But Warden was nerfed beyond its value for sure. Could probably use a  usage of former splash damage to be a viable units for considering. Sadly a veteran holds wave  better............,SquadronTowerDefense,cxuyds5,2,t5_37rnn
5931899,0,t1_cxx634d,Kullervo have  base HP. They previously had  base HP. Unfortunately the Messiah ability tool tip indicates Kullervo have all traits at level  without indicating what each trait accomplished. In particular level  Resolve gives  HP which gives Kullervo an effective HP of  previously .Ive added a note to update the tooltip to be more explicit.,SquadronTowerDefense,cxx7axg,1,t5_37rnn
6045081,0,t3_3ybabu,It is technically possible to differentiate unit stats by mode. However it would add substantial complexity and likely confuse new players on a regular basis. The far better technical approach would be publishing two completely separate maps.I dont believe that is necessary or advisable though. The balance issues you suggest are in my opinion unlikely to benefit from such a transition ignoring new issues it would introduce. I suspect the keys to resolution are longer burnin times and better communication explaining balance impacts across both modes rather than clearer divisions.,SquadronTowerDefense,cyc0mh5,2,t5_37rnn

7711886,0,t3_4huqf3,I think the cause of the split que was custom builder vs chaosrefined. I think if RCB was fixed it might be OK. The issue with advanced that I have is that its already more difficult with veteran but to add random numbers for what tiers you get each turn is a fun killer. I personally like long games that go to lvl. So playing advanced most are over by wave . If custom builder was always enabled and RCB was fixed i think advanced would be better. ,SquadronTowerDefense,d3isfib,1,t5_37rnn

8574657,0,t1_d6bcnmp,MagnetoSphere I would suggest perhaps cutting shields to Ts at least in half or more. Veterans serve their purpose well in both x and x. I wouldnt suggest making a veteran in x past wave . The  vet open in x is rather OP in a casual game. Gravilance  I am of like mind but  Overall  I like its place in the game. Nerfing damage would seriously hurt auto IMO. ,SquadronTowerDefense,d6dexy2,1,t5_37rnn

9408501,0,t3_59fyu2,Stacking debuffs is important but found summoning units for Brutalisks to kill is equally important. To that end Ive had success holding x Vet on wave  with  Theos  Mercurial  Wraith and a bunch of Dark Priests. Hades can also work well with  Messiah for energy regeneration.Im still very curious to see the minimum hold strength players can achieve in the Boss Waves Contest Mode hopefully we see that run successfully. That may provide some great tactics and combinations for minimally fighting bosses  pretty awesome.,SquadronTowerDefense,d98ldiq,3,t5_37rnn
9650590,0,t3_5bp7al,I have rarely seen this bug addressed but oftentimes when leaks make their way to the area in front of the SS and arent killed off by the surviving towers a fraction usually travel back up to the center before making their way back down to the SS. This is quite a significant gamechanging bugpathing issue since deadly leaks such as bosses may run away and delay their attack on the SS giving it extra time to be upgraded or recover and survive while its getting attacked by other leaks. Furthermore the leakers are punished greater with an extended slowed down eco duration as their refinery is on fire while any survivors can further build up their income or attack with substantially more sends for the following wave the magnitude of this bug is enhanced on waves with slow moving creeps such as wave  or  or with a marauder that makes it way through.,SquadronTowerDefense,da2mviz,1,t5_37rnn
