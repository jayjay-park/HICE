If Bandcamp wasnt down at the moment I could link you to a song I did with it on even the bass guitar.The Pharaoh is a new arrival for me but I adore it already even moreso than the Musket. The only part I really didnt like about it was the germanium diode but I think thats only because I havent found a good setting with it quite yet.I havent tried the LSTR yet but Ive seen the comparison videos on YT and I personally like the Pharaoh more.Bear in mind Im one those players that cranks the shit out of their pedals though.

I dont really use it all that often but the boss one works well enough for really spinning your sound. I would recommend getting an exp pedal for it though.

The mooer fuzzfaces are also small inexpensive alternatives.I love fuzz but some of the boutique stuff  including DBA which I like but find prices difficult to justify  has just crazy markup.

As for the Agro I use it for that extra grit when Im on the YD or the other fuzz. I cant find myself using all  of them together. After much consideration and lots of time experimenting it the other fuzz pedal has its setting to a minimum to provide that extra fuzz but more to a low end with the YD.

I only ask these questions because I thought my Line  Echo Park was broken when I first got it but I realized the dual tap feature tap lightly for tap tempo results in having to stomp much harder to activate the effect than most other pedals.

To me the appeal of that switch is I could dial in a sound I like with the switch off and play normal stuff then hit that switch to do crazy noisy squeally bits. It seems like you get the best of both worlds.Same with their delay pedal.

2037921,0,t3_2i47lc,I find that annoying too. I think part of the reason is that it makes the pedal seem more complicated which many pedal users especially those shelling out for boutique pedals are drawn to. Less cynically I think that many good pedals are dynamic and sensitive enough that the knobs tend to be interdependent with one another rather than controlling one isolated parameter. I like Zachary Vexs solution on the Fuzz Factoryit labels each knob according to the most obvious control it has over the tone but notes that each knob interacts in unpredictable ways. At the very least it makes it easier to remember favorite settings. Worst of all are pedals with unique labels that really dont mean anything. Magic? What is that? Range? LPF? Oscillator? Why cant they call it what it is so I can learn how to use it properly?,guitarpedals,ckyv5i0,1,t5_2r0bp

The guts are usually direct clones of much more expensive pedals. The problem is not with their sound which is actually quite good. Its their build quality that sucks. The enclosures are plastic and the knobs switches and jacks are very cheap and flimsy. I would never trust a Behringer pedal on a gig or important rehearsal.  That being said I think they are fine for bedroom jamming or home recording. Just dont be surprised when it breaks. They sound very good for the price but in the end you get what you pay for.,guitarpedals,cl3fsg7,1,t5_2r0bp

2091095,0,t1_cl5erkp,First of all you have no idea how much fun you are going to have with this thing.  I got one  years ago and it is by far my favorite pedal.Be sure to read the manual this thing has a ton of options.  Its very easy to use if you read the manual.Just try to get comfortable with  playrecord modes.Serial  This is your basic mode for recording seperate parts such as a versechorusbridge. Loops are played one at a time.  If loop  is playing and you press the button for loop  loop  will finish playing before loop  starts.Serial Sync  same as above but you record loop  first master loop for other loops slave loops to be synced to it.  So if loop  is bars longs then you new loops can be bars bars bars......long.  This mode is mainly used for setting a basic rhythm track then doing versechorusbridge stuff over top of it.Sync  Again loop three is recorded first and is used as master loop.  However in this mode instead of the slave loops playing one at a time they can now be played at the same time.Free  all loops play whenever no serial or sync features just do whatever you want.Personally I find myself using they Sync and SerialSync modes most often. One other recommendation is to get a good expression pedal to control the volume of your loops.,guitarpedals,cl5mh75,3,t5_2r0bp

2103769,0,t1_cl78gdk,ampampamp Keytar sfw gtA keytar is a relatively lightweight keyboard with or without a builtin synthesizer that is supported by a strap around the neck and shoulders similar to the way a guitar is supported by a strap. Keytars allow players a greater range of movement compared to conventional keyboards which are placed on stationary stands. The instrument has a musical keyboard for triggering musical notes and sounds. Controls for but not limited to pitch bends vibrato portamento and sustain are placed on the instruments neck.gtgtImage from article iInteresting List of keytars | List of keytarists | Roland AX | Moog Liberation Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwclgfx oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeleteclgfx.

2118967,0,t3_2j7c22,Preamp is a really broad categorization but essentially its anything that boosts and colors a signal.  Its really a term borrowed from recording signal chains where in you need to bring an instrument or voice to line level prior to hitting the board.  With guitar there are plenty of clean boosts that get termed as preamps but like any volume adjusting device there is potential for breakup and dirt in there.   It all depends on the level coming out of the guitar your other pedals your amp etc. I highly recommend by the way an Xotic EP Booster   Its essentially a magical tone enhancer. ,guitarpedals,cl960cf,5,t5_2r0bp

Boss makes a great little floor unit called an ME you can get new for around .

2213399,0,t3_2kaw6r,Demo more than just a guitar through it. At least try a bass if not a keyboard or electronic drums or something as well. At the very least itll show off the range the effect can give.And do things that there arent already a ton of demos of. I see you have an AC to demo. I still have not been able to find demos for an acoustic sim thats not just open chords on an electric guitar. What would an acoustic guitar through an acoustic sim sound like? Or a bass? Or an acoustic sim last in a chain? Or in the effects loop of a Synth Engine or something else wild? These would all be great things that would show what the pedal can do at its craziest instead of another distortion being used by itself to play blues rock and hard rock covers.If the pedal has something out of the ordinary show it. The Boss BF and PH to a lesser degree for example has some wild settings. But all the demos show it as a flanger. I know what a flanger sounds like. I could guess how it sounds just by nature of it being a flanger. I dont need to watch a ten minute video reestablishing that a flanger is a flanger.,guitarpedals,cll6cw1,1,t5_2r0bp
2213403,0,t1_cll5lok,No problemo!If you can get it for cheap I fully endorse the RC. Not only is it fun to jam with but its been a pretty integral part of how I write songs as a whole not just ones that I dedicate to looping. The effects you can add to the loops are great especially the modulations the expression pedal can be assigned to a ridiculous amount of parameters including MIDI for controlling other pedals! the interface is very easy to work with independent level controls for each track is great for adjusting real time loops that are way louder than everything else.......I just love it alright!But in the meantime use that Flashback to become familiar with looping. I believe it can only loop like  seconds? but thats quite enough to get the hang of looping.,guitarpedals,cll6dju,1,t5_2r0bp

I bought a TC Nova Delay and an Eventide TimeFactor in my quest for the most versatile delay I could find.  I have since bought four more delays and still want more.  They all have really big personalities and while a versatile delay pedal might capture a part of that personality it wont give you the whole experience.  It could end up leaving you wanting more youll end up selling it for a loss and youll find yourself right where you are right now only with less money in your pocket.I would get the coolest single personality delay you can afford which might be a used analog in that price range.

When I look at the circuit board I see a couple carbon resistors and the cheapest type of capacitors possible ceramic the orange and green ones two tantalum capacitors the dark orange drops and a jellybean IC known for its lessthan quiet operation and two glass diodes. Could two tiny diodes hold a unmatched vintage mojo? My electrical engineering senses tell me no but somehow reallife testing and video demos easily disprove that. Thus examples like this just blow my mind because theoretically if two circuits have the same exact value components they should have the same sound...because they are literally identical right?

If the latter then yeah go with the cheap pedals and I think your selection seems pretty good.If for recording though I would suggest trying to stock rare or hardtofind items. Any guitar player coming in to record should already have a pretty good grasp on their sound but expensive amp heads and boutique pedals or even old vintage combo amps can really shine in a recording studio. Like if a soul food was an integral part of someones sound and you had a KTR in the studio you could swap it out for the session.

Just play with it. The biggest difference would be moving your big muff after reverbsdelays which could make some interesting sounds.

3060894,0,t3_2v8086,Heres a quick test I devised to check if the noise from your pedals is actually coming from the power supply. First have your setup just like normal with all your pedals plugged into the power supply EXCEPT for one. Use a v battery  in this one. Now make sure all the other pedals are in bypass mode. Turn on the first pedal the one with the battery in it playing the guitar and listening to how much noise is being made. Then plug the adapter into the pedal while still listening intently. You should hear a noticeable increase in the hissingbuzzing if its actually coming from the power supply. Ask yourself is this noise floor ok with me personally? and rotate the battery for each of the pedals. By comparing against a known quiet supply battery you can hear for yourself how much noise exactly is being added by the power supply to each pedal. Then use your final judgement to determine which product will be most applicable.,guitarpedals,cof9blm,2,t5_2r0bp
3066429,0,t3_2v5rtv,Im in an indiealtgarage rock band and I have to say that boutique pedals really help in defining a unique sound. Boss pedals are simple and straight forward but thats it. It doesnt over the top and just has a standard sound nothing unique. It especially helps if youre fairly familiar with guitar already like you said you were. Getting pedals opens up this massive new world of possibilities. When I first played I wrote songs and it was fun. When I first started getting pedals I wrote way more songs and way better sounding songs because I had so much room to work with. Like others have said overdrive fuzz and delay are among the first pedals you should get. Tremolo is another great effect its used in All You People Are Vampires by the Arctic Monkeys and it has a lot of other applications. Overall just look up some stuff online different kinds of effects and pedals that use those effects and do a lot of research. Each piece of gear that I buy I watch at least  videos on read lots of reviews etc. before I consider getting it.,guitarpedals,coftynb,1,t5_2r0bp

They really knocked it out of the park with that one and it does everything the Dispatch Master does but a LOT better! EQD does have some great pedals Palisades Organizer etc. but if you really want to get your moneys worthand especially if youre thinking about expanding to stereo in the futurethere are loads of better pedals that will get you where you want to go quicker. Im not saying this out of a personal dislike of the sound of the Dispatch Master or anything in fact I think it sounds pretty decent! its just an extremely limited pedal that wont give you very much room to explore and find your sound with it. If youve played one before and it just hit the spot somehow I would say its a great pick but otherwise  is a lot to spend on something that does only a limited delay AND a limited reverb when there are so many other ones out there for the same or less money that will do it better. You might also like the Line  Mthese can be found at very reasonable prices used and have TONS of delays and reverbs on board that you can use at the same time in fact up to  effects at the same time and with many more tonal options. You have many flavors of analog tape delay digital delays modulated delays etc.  and tons of great reverb sounds too.

3140116,0,t1_conftt4,Actually thats a good question about adjusting the Pickle Vibes internal trimpots. Mines from  and Im pretty sure it only has one trimpot maybe newer versions have more than one. My advice is NOT to touch the internal trimpot from the original stock setting if you buy it new. I messed with mine and have always regretted it. It sounded perfect out of the box but of course I had to listen to the internet and try to make it sound better. Im sure Im within  of the original tone but literally every time I step on it I wish I had left it alone.Ive only heard YT clips of the Viscous Vibe from NAMM so it might be unfair or at least premature to judge. But what I heard just didnt do it for me. Cold digitalness might be a good way of describing it. Maybe a Tone Print could solve that.Funny about the HoF. I dont own one but Robben Ford sure makes his sound good. I dunno about you but its not uncommon for me to decide I dont like a pedal decide to sell it get lazy and forget to sell it return to it six months later and find I really like it.

3713371,1,t3_32x7nj,I can improve your tone for less than .Buy new strings and stop worrying about your tone because people make a big deal of it online. Maybe raise or lower your pickups or action look it up online and do it at home its easy. If you cant make competent music with your instrument then thats one thing worrying about vaguely described best practices online that might not even be valuable to what you do is another.As far as picks etc it kind of follows logic. Want to remove or reduce the attack of your notes? Fingerpick or use lighter picks. Want to increase it? Thicker pick and play harder. I know some things like metal picks can matter to people who want to sound like Steve Albini but thats not essential to doing that kind of thing either. It depends on the effect too but the only place Ive really seen it matter with with time effects like reverb and delay that depend a lot on your dry tone or the attack of your notes as to how theyll sound.,guitarpedals,cqfjt6p,3,t5_2r0bp

3854206,0,t3_34kqkq,I find that most modulation pedals can be emulated pretty well digitally. Dirt however is a totally different story. Dynamics play a big part in this. But for me there is nothing like having electricity going through different analog circuits and never being converted to s and s. There is just no way a digital phaser is going to sound anywhere as deep and lush as my moog phaser. But everyone has different ears. Just my  cents.,guitarpedals,cqvm5ic,15,t5_2r0bp
3855922,0,t3_34ioox,My mooer octaver is pretty sweet its tiny but very versatile with two octaves either way and any combination of the five octaves. It tracks well. Its a little glitchy sometimes but I really enjoy the way it does it its utterly beautiful. Sometimes I just turn off the dry signal altogether and listen to the algorithm noise.The other even small and cheaper pedal I have is my little tank of a tremolo from Hotone. Its tiny but the enclosure is solid and have a lovely aesthetic. The onoff LED shines through the clear knob on the top of it. It works well on both guitar and bass. Depth and the Hard switch are both adequate the speed has a good broad range and the colour knob is subtle but beautiful and very versatile. Its basically an extrabroadband bandpass boost that allows one to subtly shift the voice of your instrument. Often I turn the depth right down and just use the colour knob for specific tonal effects.,guitarpedals,cqvt75s,0,t5_2r0bp

I feel like the advantages of single pedals are largely imagined when dealing with topclass multis while the advantages of the multi less noise less setup less tapdancing are much more tangible and of benefit at a gig.  With respect to not hearing any difference the GT is a great unit and its drives are among the best on the market.

3915019,0,t1_cr26aan,gtIn terms of budget yeah I guess I was thinking about  per pedal. Lump sum I guess would maybe be like  at most?Take it from me you are better off buying a good multieffect than buying individual pedals here! Seriously at about  a pop youre not likely to find anything good but you can get a seriously capable multiFX pedal or even a rack unit if youre feeling adventurous that can get you these sounds youre after much better. A used Line  M will give you a great toolset for getting shoegazy sounds as youll have  FX you can chain together and they can be anything you want even the same effect  or  times there are actually many situations where this is useful especially with delays. The effects are really great in these and a lot of them come from some great pedals like the Verbzilla and the Echo Park a combo which I used to own which did the shoegazeambientpostrock thing in spades. Other ones you might want to consider are the Zoom MSCDR it can chain up to  effects at once but it doesnt have the expression pedal capability of the Line  or the scenes or anything. They operate pretty differently but they are great. One person Ive talked to who owns a lot of great Lexicon and Eventide rack gear really loves the MSCDR a lot as well. Im sure he would think the same if he had the M too. Multis have come a long way!Theres a lot that goes into those sounds but the three main reasons why I think those two pedals are so great for somebody starting out is that they have  very important bases covered multivoice chorusDimension D TriStereo Chorus etc....big lush choruses and flangers too that have multiple delay lines going on inside them which are one of THE key ingredients to the shoegaze soundRobin Guthrie from the Cocteau Twins was famous for this modulated delaysyou will DEFINITELY want these! And the M and the MSCDR have you more than covered here as well. This is another big ingredient in that kind of sound. These could be delays that waver in pitch a little bit vibrato a more random wow amp flutter like a tape echo or fed through a chorus or a flanger for just the delay part...whichever of these you want to use both pedals have you covered here. Theyre very inspiring to play through once you find the settings you like you can adjust the pitch depth and the rate of pitch wavering on a lot of the models in those so you can really get something that sounds the way you want it. In stereo they make everything sound huge! And theyre great for rhythmic playing too the Edge ALWAYS uses at least one modulated delay at a time whether its a Memory Man a  or a Korg SDD. big reverbsboth pedals here can get HUGE verbs. The Hall and especially the Cave setting on the M are from the Verbzilla and they really create some amazing spaces to play in I still remember when I first got my Verbzilla diming the decay time on the Cave mode and playing volume swells through that with a chorus pedaldefinitely the biggest soundcapes I had gotten with any piece of gear up until then!. Theres also a sound on the Line  thats not on the Verbzilla called Particle Verb which is really great for this kind of stuff too check this out on Soundcloud if you want to hear what I mean!. Ill admit the Zoom MSCDR may not be as strong in this area but it still has some great verbs to chose from and multitap delays that be combined with verbs as well to make a bigger sound. ,guitarpedals,cr2jpyn,-2,t5_2r0bp

4413204,0,t1_csn37e3,This makes a lot of sense to me. Im torn on even spending close to  on a delay. Put a few pedals like that on a board and you could have gotten a new amp or guitar... I honestly wouldnt ever use the exotic delay types aside from maybe noodling a little on my own. I tend to use pretty straightforward delays but have a number of guitar parts that require specific delay tempos and styles which is why I need the presets and need to be able to switch to them quickly via footswitch. Im not thrilled about the idea of having an extension pedal to be able to bank down on the Timefactor but I do have room for it on my board considering that it isnt a huge pedal. At the same time I feel like I would be wasting features a bit because I really dont need the dual delays or midi but the price is more palatable vs. the strymon and Im kinda itching to try something other than a DD although it has served me well for many many a show. ,guitarpedals,csn3pp3,2,t5_2r0bp

A variation of styles is key to a good demo in my opinion.I also dont think its necessary to spend  minutes talking about the specs of the gear when its so easy to look that stuff up myself. When I watch a video I want to hear how the gear sounds not someone reading me text from the manufacturers website.This next one may be just me but I always appreciate the reviewer giving their brief opinion near the end of the video just to give me a better idea of how it sounds in real life as opposed to over the video. If theres something negative about it dont be afraid to say it.If its a pedal its always cool to see what your favorite settings are for it and how you use them.Good luck with your channel and let us know when youve got some stuff up!,guitarpedals,csupmm2,15,t5_2r0bp

4546035,0,t1_ct3e2zz,The Afterneath is a beast of its own kind to me anyways. It is a reverberator but its also not in the sense that it does its own thing with the reverb voicings. You can get a very great sounding straight reverb out of it for sure but my favorite feature is that you can get a super wet reverb with little sporadic delays dancing around seemingly uncontrollably yet always in time with what youre playing. I think there are little wizards inside of it. Also if you crank the length and reflection up on it you get a droneish hold on either the last note or chord played in your progression or the hardest pluck in your progression. You can even have it self oscillate if you max out the length and reflection knobs. Ive had it for a few months and still find new settings to get weird with.,guitarpedals,ct3njk3,6,t5_2r0bp
4546129,0,t1_ct3npol,Yes. I ran it through only the afterneath. I ran a mustang fat strat and telecaster plus the kind w a humbucker in the bridge into a vox ACC. Running the guitars straight into the amp theres no trace of the noise so Im confident its not any of those causing it.

4547978,0,t3_3dc364,I have the analog delay but its a paperweight now. Even in the short time that it worked about two weeks it was quite noisy.

4708565,0,t3_3fez9s,I own the Supernatural and havent yet tried the Polara in person so I cant speak from experience on that one. I find the Supernatural is perfect for ambient type stuff and I love the reverbs on it....really lush and lively. In fact I got rid of my Hall of Fame pedal for it since the HOF to me always sounded dull. I know nearly everyone loves that pedal but it just did not sound as crisp and full as the Digitech it was exactly what I was looking for. The shimmer supernova etc settings all sound super gorgeous for playing ambient type stuff but I find that I actually have started to use them very little since after awhile they are easily recognizable to me as Im sure it would be to others....so I find I primarily use the plate mode and that serves as a excellent workhorse for any reverby stuff I play around with and let my delays do the shimmerymodulation stuff. I think I would have been happier if I had picked up the Polara instead since it has a bit less identifiable sounds but they both sound really amazing. I was however surprised by how big the Supernatural pedal actually is. In photos and videos it looks like a standard pedal but it is actually quite large if your board space is limited for you. ,guitarpedals,cto1wpz,3,t5_2r0bp

4884749,0,t1_cua97uy,Nice! A fellow Froosh fan!The CE and CE are both phenomenal pedals. They are very different however not much overlap between the two at all. The CE sounds much more flangerlike transparent and has the ability to get really wierdwarbly on the vibrato side. It also uses a triangle waveform which lends to its unique character a chorusing effect that creates a different vibeatmosphere from the CE or most choruses for that matter. The CE is also amazing but much more smooth sounding and underwatery. It also colors the tone quite a bit into this mushy thick sound but in a good mushy thick way that sounds very organic and warm.,guitarpedals,cua9eti,5,t5_2r0bp

5094996,0,t1_cuzr2b7,gt Hello again analogkid! You gave me some great advice on delays a while ago. First of all thanks for the write up!No problem!gt Ive been looking at pretty much all of the pedals you listed but I had not checked out the RV quite that much it definitely looks great.It really is! First reverb pedal Ive seen in a while that Ive really been impressed with. Boss basically tore the whole thing down and started from scratch. Its an entirely different beast from the RV with so many improvements. The shimmer just shocked meyou normally only hear Eventides do shimmers that sound that clear and stable that wont go out of tune and glitch out on you. They really did their homework. Pitch shifting is one of the hardest things to get right in digital FX design especially if you dont have  years experience at it and tons of algorithm development behind you like Eventide. I hope they make an RV that will expand on this and let you choose the intervalsits that good!If you havent seen these two videos yet grab a good pair of headphones and listen to these both in stereobest demos Ive seen of this pedal yet Dawsons Music RV Review BOSS RV Reverb Pedal Review by SweetwaterI have a more indepth post about it here It really goes into my thoughts about the RV vs. the Polaraoverall I dont think one is better than the other since they have strengths in different areas but I think if you learn more toward the ambient side of things the RV is the better choice and if you want more realistic verbs the Polara definitely wins there. The RV also has the expression pedal input which is a feature not commonly found on pedals in this price range and in my opinion they implemented it very well.gt And while I agree that the reverb computers are probably the best and most versatile of the bunch I really dont have the money for or immense use of reverb to justify spending that much. I was really hoping to keep it around  with a limit of . How do the ones in your good territory stack up against each other? Whats the best although I realize that may be subjective? Ive tried the HOF RV really enjoyed the modulate and polara only enjoyed the halo but Id like to try the Supernatural the other few are also unavailable at any nearby locations as far as I can tell.As far as how they stack up against each other I really think it depends on what your tastes are. Do you need realistic platesroomssprings? Long decay times? Modulation? How smooth do you like the tails to be? some are definitely rougher than others here Do you want shimmer? If you can answer those questions that would really help narrowing it down. The difference I think between the good and stellar ones as I put it is that each of the good ones can do certain combinations of those things well whereas the stellar ones can do ALL of those things well. Instead of going through my opinions on each pedal some of which are not fullyformed if I can be honest! I think it would be more helpful for me to go through those different qualities I mentioned and tell you which ones I think do it the best Realism  Lexiconbased verbs have a big advantage here. The algorithms have been around since the s and while the Digitech pedals dont give you the exact same algorithms and all the bells and whistles youd get in the rack units they are REALLY good at doing realistic spaces. The TCs are pretty good too and the RV has definitely improved in the realism department from the RV. Line  verbs are not as realistic as these but they are still very welldesigned and very musical with nice qualities. I cant speak too much to the spring verbsnever really tried them that much but I can tell you that the TCs dont model the springboing like the others do. Some people are really divided about just how much boing should be in there and there are lots of forum posts on TGP and elsewhere that go indepth about which ones do it best. Personally if you really like spring verb I really like the Boss FRV which I didnt mention so far because thats all it does  . Long decay times  I cant give a really comprehensive comparison of this but Ill at least speak to what I have used and liked here...the Cave and Hall settings on the Line  are really great Cave was the first LONGdecay reverb I ever used and I still like it  years later...the RV sounds really good so far at this much better than the RV which people used to add extra delaysverbs to because the decays were so short...the TCs can do pretty long decays too but I think they rely on their modulation more to sound less resonant as the tail goes on...Neunaber of course has very smooth long decays which sound very nice.  Modulation  without a doubt the TC Hall Of Fame can get the craziest hereyou not only have a modulation control in the main part of the reverb not sure if its preverb or inside the verbit doesnt say you also have with the Toneprint software up to  voices of chorus flange or vibrato that you can use after the reverb...thats a LOT of modulation so much that you can really get carried away with it to the point that it overwhelms the reverb. The Nova Reverb has similar modulation too just not as thick. Line  offers the Particle Verb in the M the only verb algorithm they have thats not on the Verbzilla that has modulation and it can sound very nice indeed and even go off the deep endthe Hazard submode is pretty wild. The RV is a little more understatedIve dug into this before and I really think the modulation is only applied to part of the reverb signal the tail the early reflectionsinitial echoes inside the verb are not modulated and this is partly why I like it so much. The Polara and Supernatural also use postmodulation like the Hall Of Fame but its almost on the flangey side and it changes the texture of the verb quite a bit you can clearly hear this on JustNicks demo of the Polara. You have to really like that sort of thing if you want to get the Digitechs for their modulation because theres no way to change them. Personally my favorite modulation Ive heard on the good ones so far has been from the RVit really gets the closest to my tastes with the kinds of modulated verbs I program for the Lexicon PCM. Shimmer  for me the RV is definitely the best. I dont like glitchyunstable shimmers or ones that have too much extra modulation on them Halo had a little bit too much extra modulation on there for my tastes. The RV is one of the best Ive heard in ANY pedal here almost up there with the Strymons and Eventides in sound onlyflexibilitywise of course they are much more tweakable and offer a lot more. If you want clear shimmer on a budget the RV may not just be the best option anymore it might be the only option. Not even the Neunaber Seraphim sounds as good as the RV in my opinion.I wish I knew more about all of these but those are at least my impressions of them from what Ive gathered and used so far. ,guitarpedals,cv04ywo,5,t5_2r0bp

5191961,0,t1_cvbsfrf, traditional ways to do it. Either at the front of the chain before dirt  or after dirt before everything else modulation delay verb etc.. Of course nontraditionally you could stick it anywhere. A wah placed before dirt will have a mellower more vintage sound. A wah after dirt will be overstated and more aggressive sounding. This choice literally comes down to each individuals tastes. I used to put an overdrive on each side of my wah so that I would have each option. Try it and see which way you like it best.Recently Ive been liking my wah toward the front of my chain. I use a Fuzz Face as my main fuzz and that likes to get signal straight from the guitar. My chain is usually  guitar fuzz wah volume pitchharmonywhammy dirts modulationphasechorusflange pitchoctave timedelaysreverbs clean boost ampI played in a band with a guy who had slightly less regard for tradition. Iirc his rig was something like  guitar flanger whammy delay dirts wah reverb delay ampThe sound he wanted to get worked very well within the context of the band.

5318270,0,t1_cvpl3qw,Haha it was hardly the worst thing Ive ever seen so no worries. You have got some cool toys there.I went back a while ago with guitar. I was already a decent enough player and proficient. But I knew that my lead playing was either Itll be alright on the night sort of thing or like you say minor pentatonics or bust. I did get lessons when I first started playing as a teenager but I let lessons go for a long time just playing as I wanted. Getting lessons again was the best thing I ever did. Well among other things. When I listen back to songs I recorded  something years ago to what I do now it actually amazed me that I changed that much. So much that when I listen to the old stuff I physically cant play that badly now. Not that it was terrible but you can hear some of the technique is off the lead solos are pretty uninteresting and that goddamned DiMarzio XN with the amp gain on  does not a good metal tone make!Anyway my point is only just to suggest that maybe some lessons wouldnt be a bad idea if youre stuck in the pentatonic shape. Im not trying to imply youre a hamfisted buffoon or anything more that to escape the trap of minor pentatonic and branch out into some more interesting patterns when you get a feel of the scale youre in what arpeggios or mode shapes you can do over them and where it expands your improvisational repertoire amazingly. There is a lot of theory sure. And getting your head around some of it took me some time as it was very different to a lot of what I did on piano. But its worth it.I do kinda prefer a real life teacher over just relying on Internet tools simply as I just didnt gel with the wealth of different things to do out there. A decent teacher puts you more on a pathway and will readily point out bad technique rather than a Heres everything any questions? No? Good! style you get from the Internet. Another thing that changed was my picking technique when I first started lessons was awful. I was playing with mm stubby plectrums as I found them really easy. Now Im on .mm Tortex and I have no idea how I ever played anything with those mm picks. Anyway nice video regardless ,guitarpedals,cvrgz6k,1,t5_2r0bp

5711027,0,t3_3tcgua,First of all what does this have to do with ethics? Its not like pedals are just samplers that people use to essentially lipsync guitar licks.Second whats so highandmighty about the sound of guitar that pedals somehow distract from that? Pedals are meant to complement your playing and your sound. People use them for all kinds of instruments. Drumsdrum machines keyboards synthesizers bass violin sax. If all you want from a guitar is minor pentatonic blues riffs through a tube amp then fine. But Im not sure how that invalidates using pedals for other sounds. There are other things to do with a guitar. Maybe someone turning on a ring modulator into a reverse delay will detract from their ability to sound like B.B. King or Derek Trucks. But what if you want to sound like Nick Reinhart or Andy Othling or even just sound like random electronics? You kind of have to gear your playing more toward creating unique sounds with pedals at that point. You would never be satisfied unless you fantasized over which pedals make you sound like what.,guitarpedals,cx50bhb,19,t5_2r0bp

5735620,0,t1_cx7x244,For one thing the Vox has a shit ton of effects which can be applied to the sound going into the loop and also effects which can be applied to the loop itself. It also has different modes for ending the loop. I think the RC has something like it but I bought it a few years ago changed the settings to my taste and didnt really mess with it after that.For some people the huge variety of loop effects may be enough to shift them towards the Vox especially the reverse effect. This was present in the RCXL but for some reason Boss didnt think that it would be worth putting in the RC. This probably is the biggest draw to the Vox for me but I got the RC cheap from a friend so I went with that and the ability to save loops is a godsend for me.If you want to make the Boss better for live performances you can get a passive dual momentary footswitch from some places for like . You could even make one yourself for cheap with parts from Radio ShackMaplinany hardware store.

5781542,0,t3_3uc1qp,You might luck out on finding an amp on craigslist. Ideally you would want something like a Hartke Ampeg Galien Krueger Eden Acoustic or Trace Elliot but on a budget a lower series Fender or Peavey might be more realistic. Actually Older Peaveys while just heavy as a sack of gold bricks do get this awesome punchy tone and are pretty much tanks. I would advise against Behringers because they dont really hold their own well against other amps in a band scenario from my experiences with the various ultrabass versions. As far as pedals go some recommendations would be MXR Bass Compressor and Bass Octave Deluxe It tracks really well EHX Bass Big Muff is awesome for just heavy fuzzy bass Tech  SansAmp Bass Driver is really good for tone shaping Boss GEB is a Bass EQ really is good for emphasizing the frequencies you want as well Digitech makes this suboctave synth pedal called a DOD Meatbox that sounds really gritty. When it comes to pedals since you claim to be starting out I would recommend not expanding your board too quickly. The general rule that a lot people seem to follow from my observations when it comes to pedals is Tuner gt WahsFiltersOctavePitch gt Compression gt DistortionODFuzz gt EQ Stuff gt Modulation gt DelayReverb gt Loopers. This is a common setup but again there isnt a right way to arrange pedals. Plenty of people keep their tuner at the end of their board as a type of cut off switch also some people like the way phasers or delays sound before distortion. Again these are just some of my thoughts on the subject of bass gear and general setup stuff. ,guitarpedals,cxdr70h,1,t5_2r0bp

In chromatic mode you can hit any semitone ranging from  octave below to  octave above the root note. In major and minor its pretty easy to dial in the note you want since there are only  possible pitch intervals in each scale.  In chromatic mode there are  selectable pitch intervals so it is a little more difficult but still relatively easy to dial in what you want.,guitarpedals,cxjqhmc,3,t5_2r0bp

5903580,0,t1_cxtdqho,Oh I totally am on board with people being hypocritical or failing to examine their own consumption. Its something you always have to monitor and lets be honest... a lot of the brands that have ethical standards for labor and production in necessities are things that only wealthier people can afford. Activism for people to stop buying from affordable brands is pretty whitewashed and classist because lets face it Whole Foods ethical designer clothing and greenlaborconscious electronics are things that poor people cant always afford.But with a boutique pedal company one that already has a pretty sizable barrier of cost associated with it and plenty of alternative quality and valuable choices... its a bit different. Heres what Ive read in the past and found previously   theres a lot more on this womans death and the connections to IHOPI think JHS has done a lot to remove the evidence that Josh the owner is connected because of how it hurt the business but there doesnt seem to be any evidence that they dont contribute money to them or participate with them. I know for a fact theres a page on IHOPs website that specifically referred to JHS thats been removed.Theres a ton of connections in staff between the two organizations.Madbean PCBs owner talks about it hereI mean I dont have the intent of shaming people who own JHS pedals who are just oblivious to this.

6066753,0,t3_3ymx3y,Both. The analog to digital and digital to analogue conversions will take place in your interface with the digital information being transmitted via USB firewire etc. The speed of conversion and transfer speed will affect your latency however a more noticeable latancy will be found on your computer. Audio processing especially physical modelling and spectral analysis is particularly cpu hungry. I think this will be the bottle neck of anything. You can take short cuts if you lower your sample rate or set your effects to low latency modes.

I dont need all the different modes and I would think a blues and rock player like OP and myself wants your basic amplike reverb pedal not a in pedal for folks that use a lot of different types of reverb.Thats probably great for someone doing a bunch of ambient music or something. I want a set and forget reverb pedal that sounds great to add a little space and ambience not something with a bunch of settings and adjustments.You state this like its an obvious fact that versatility is the defining desirable trait...I dont want or need a superversatile reverb pedal.

The dog hair belongs to the feet on the side.  Signal chainGuitar gtCrybaby q  pretty standard wah. Sharptone Mojo Fuzz   Fuzz face clone.  Holy hell is this amazing.  My current favorite pedal on the board.  Cleans up really well with the guitar volume knob.  EHX graphic fuzz  I have the older version.  Its pretty huge.  Large gigantic but it has a cool sound and its fun to tweak with.  Its more of a distortion than fuzz.  Its somewhat similar to a rat sound... I like it slightly scooped.  Way Huge Pork Loin  My nearly always on seceret weapon.  It mixes a boosted signal with an overdriven signal and sounds magical.  It is a very light OD think of an amp right after passing the breakup point. DigiTech whammy pedal  I am pretty boring and keep it set to one octave up.  But it can get really crazy.Boss TU.  Its a tuner.  I keep it last to kill the signal.  Effects loop gtBoss BF flanger  its a flanger.  I like it quick and fast. MXR phase   slow.  Mostly slow. EQD the depths   fav on the board.  Machine gun?  Yes.  Breathe?  Yes.  New modern vibe sounds?  Excellent.  You want  classic tones?  Probably not for you. Boss DD  its a delay delay delay.  I like crisp clean digital delay.  An analog might be in the future though.  EQD afterneath  just too damn cool.  I use it for synthy soundscapes.  Good with fuzz amazing with delay and whammy!UndecidedEHX micro qtron  I really like the idea of having a q on my board.  In practice its a difficult beast to tame.  I mostly use it for daft punk type synthy sounds.  Might play around with it in front of the amp.  Its fun with the whammy pedal set to harmonise an octave down.

6199697,0,t1_cyuacit,What I usually do is put the price a bit higher than normal but offer free shipping. Personally when I shop for a pedal I always will choose the one with free shipping over paying shipping. Something in the minds of people I think gravitate towards the thought of free shipping which is more enticing for a sale. I didnt know if its poor form to say the prices of pedals but I think it would be useful for you to see what sorts of offers one can get accepted. Hoof Voyager TM modded VP Jr Timmy V Scarlett DI i Warped Vinyl Mayflower Foxpedal Kingdom Korg Pitchblack If you look on Reverb Im pretty sure these are all well below normal prices. If you want to know how much I flipped some for I can PM you but I dont think thats in good taste to air publicly haha. Also if you need to play with taptempo dont go with the Wave. Ive got a delay with tap which saves me that but the Wave with a great reverb and tape delay sound sold me also we cant deny the sweet ass graphics. Edit That being said I find that playing a nontap tempo delay was challenging at first but pretty freeing. Instead of focusing on playing the pedal and constantly worrying about the repeats syncing up with the music you can just play. It took me a while of grasping that concept but if you play the repeats will generally sound just fine even without a tapped tempo. The El Cap I believe cuts out when you tap in a new tempo which I heard can be a source of frustration. Source Audio just came out with the Nemesis which Ive been hearing good things about! Ive got the DD which has a pretty dang good tape delay also incredibly tweakable and I had an Empress Tape Delay which was a great pedal as well. Heres a demo long one sorry that I recorded of the Wave. Sennheiser e over a Princeton Reverb on a Gibson Les Paul Jr. I added annotations got lazy towards the end of the different sounds on tap!

I just got a Wampler Ego Comp and while its a bit much for me it might actually be perfect on an acoustic to thicken things up while still blending in clean signal. The CS is good and much more affordable than the ones I mentioned but I think with compression its better to have more control than the CS gives you. Dont worry about the Boss buffertone suck thing.

Stuff like this is nearly impossible to give a sincere suggestion because its so heavily dependent on YOUR ears. I will suggest another configuration for your chain that you might think is cool though. You could try running the two reverbs after the split and have one amp with the afterneath and the other with the eterna gold.

I usually just manually shift it back to the center but I think the staytrem bridge is designed to automatically center itself which is fairly useful.

6596651,0,t3_45w72g,Its a brownface tremolo circuit thats found in some old Fender amps. It works a bit differently from normal tremolos in that it splits the signal into highlow frequencies and then pans between them.While I really like the catalinbread effects Ive played I think this pedal is a good example of the motif of many of their designs recreating iconic effects but distilling the controls to their most basic sounds.I recommend checking out David Rolos Twin Peaks Tremolo It can do everything the Pareidolia can do but with a lot more control over the waveform and signal path.

6638945,0,t3_46leib,You can always get an overdrive with a clean blend. Or throw an LS in there and have one be the clean signal. gt I like the idea about keeping the clean raw signal intactWell its a nice idea but its a good idea to have a purpose in mind too. Clean blends are typically good on things like overdrives because the nature of an overdrive usually means its changing the EQ and cutting out a lot of the lower frequencies of the signal.I used to want to do this because I heard when I was younger that part of Kurt Ballous signature sound is keeping a clean signal present when everything else is heavily distorted. I quickly found out that its not that simple and its probably more worthwhile to just understand EQ and different kinds of drives and stuff and to stop tone chasing.TLDR not changing things tonally is pretty overrated and a clean signal blend isnt what it may seem like it is for everyone. If youre just talking about overdrive then just get one with a clean blend theyre useful anyways for either a boost or for using pedals on bass or for regaining a lot of the midlow stuff thats cut from many of these.A Boss LS will help if you already have a pedal in mind that doesnt have a clean blend.,guitarpedals,d060vs8,6,t5_2r0bp

6959039,0,t3_4b0sk2,Got this in the mail today.  Havent had too much time to play with it but I dig it so far.  Its got a lot of mid boost and a significant amount of chime to it.  Ive only played my American Deluxe Strat through it so far into a DRRI with Jenson PQ speaker.I set the amp at about . with an attenuator so my neighbors dont kill me and kick the pedal on with the settings shown and its pretty damn glorious.  Cant wait to be able to let it loose when I dont have to attenuate my amp.I will say this though  I waited  weeks for this pedal after paying up front.  There is no mention of wait time on the web site.  After I paid I was told it would be a  week wait.  I was fine with that after all its one dude building these pedals.  A couple weeks into my wait he started adding the graphic to the pedal cases but said that they could still be had without the graphic at the purchasers request. I noticed this myself  he made no attempt to contact me and give me the option.  Apparently requesting one without a graphic only added to my wait for some reason.  Whatever whats a couple more weeks?   weeks go by no contact.  I ask whats up Im told it will be  more weeks.   more weeks go by no contact.  I ask whats up and Im told that if I want one with graphics I can get it faster.  Whatever  at this point I just want the damn pedal I paid for so I tell him fine just still please make it with the black Klon knobs I asked for when I initially ordered and mentioned several times in our communications since then.   more weeks pass and Im absolutely pissed.  I email the guy and tell him I want my money back and what do you know?  My pedal is done all of a sudden.Today I finally receive this pedal with the graphic I didnt want and oxblood knobs not black.This man may be able to make a great pedal but his business sense and customer service are for shit.This is just my opinion and an honest recap of my personal experience with Shane of RYRA.,guitarpedals,d15541z,5,t5_2r0bp

7083213,0,t3_4clkr5,Hey! So heres the chorus section of my bands pedalboards! If it isnt obvious with the picture we play postpunk.No I dont actually use all of that sadly! But before you ask yes we did put them all together in a chain going into three amps including my JC with its vibrato on. It got wobbly.So today our bass player came to the jam space with a Roland SH and the DC. When I picked my jaw up from the floor he told me I could use the DC so I will! It is going to replace my trusty old CE pictured here as my second chorus modulating my delays!So heres a quick review of all of them! BOSS CEThis is on our bass players board at all times always on always dope. The preamp in it overdrives in a way that is very harsh on guitar but very pleasing on bass. He uses an Epiphone EB with it and it just sounds so thick and great! In vibrato mode it sounds pretty much exactly like my JC but the chorus mode has something different maybe a bit more presence in the mix. It really is an amazing unit if you can deal with the noise and lowish headroom you can get some crazy results!BOSS CEThis has been my chorus for a looong time and it just got kicked off the board! I kept it when I got my Warped Vinyl cause hey.. two chorus pedals is fine! I mostly use it in mode II as a triangle wave vibrato by plugging nothing into the B output. Its very simple and works alright not quite VB nice but still quite nice. The chorus sound has too much dry signal in it for me I guess. My Warped Vinyl does deep and low mix tones better and I cant really get high mix tones with it.. so there it is its going on the shelf for now. Maybe our other guitar player can use it. Or we may use it on vocals right now the vocals go into the JC and the vibrato circuit but thats not feasible live.I use a Lab Series L by the way!Boss DCNew kid on the block! Its not mine sadly but I can use it as much as I want so Im totally stoked. We were jamming earlier today so I couldnt really take the time to listen to the individual presets well enough. I kept it on preset  and  for the whole set and boy this beast is lush. I use it on my delay repeats and reverb washes only and it just brings them to life. Cant wait to use it in stereo too as Ive heard great things about that!Chase Bliss Warped Vinyl mk.IIYou know what it is you know its great has amazing controls and a very nice dark tone. This is always on with the presets being used to subtly change the tone its very very wet in my sound and quite deep too. I usually ramp the mix to my guitar tone this kind of breathing effect since the pedal sounds dark its kind of a filter opening and closing. I cant pin down a favourite pedal as I have a pretty sizeable board and I like all of them but this is a contender for sure!Now for the fun times!We ran a ish Jaguar intoWarped Vinyl gt CEdry out from CE gt Roland Cubewet out gt CEdry out from CE gt w fuzzy practice ampwet out gt DCdry out from DC gt Jazz Chorus channel wet out from DC gt Jazz Chorus channel  with VibratoHoly shit.

I really like it  I was looking for something compressed and on the border of fuzz and this fits the bill but I dont often play very heavy stuff. Its fun but it may find its way off the board in favor of a POG  or something else. Time will tell.Xotic RC Booster SH On its face it is a very colorless boost with some handy EQ options that give it a ton of versatility and a second gain stage that I had no trouble dialing in. I am a fan.Foxpedal The Wave The Wave looks and sounds beautiful. The reverb doesnt go  wet so Ill likely use it for more subtle effects than my Flint. I love how it sounds. Still dialing in the delay side. The modulation can shift the pitch up to three half steps in either direction so Im still getting a handle on that. The middle Wash switch makes it oscillate but its not a harsh oscillation if that makes sense.

Well then that can be detected by a frequency spectrum analyser as harshness is typically described as a frequency range  odd harmonics. Or is it because a valve amps clean channel still does a lot of tone shaping that a solid state amp doesnt?,guitarpedals,d2afhkb,3,t5_2r0bp

7333822,0,t3_4ebghl,Tips on using Stereo effectsI have a CE and a SupaTrem . I love how they sound in stereo and want to do more but I need a stereo delay reverb and looper. Delay I was looking at the DD. I love my DD so this seems like a nice upgrade. But does anyone run two independent delays for LeftRight and how do you like it? It seems like you could get some wicked sounds out of it and if so would it make the most sense to also have an independent reverb for each side as well? Reverb This sub seems to love the Polara or RV. I am leaning towards the Polara but  are there issues regarding stereo I should be aware of for either?Looper The Ditto Stereo Looper is pretty much what I need. But the X has the loop effects. The videos look cool but does anyone have any experiences they wish to share? Do you actually use them when songwriting performing? I dont think I need something as extensive as the X. For reference I would be running ModFxs gt Dirt gt Chorus gt Trem gt Delay gt Reverb gt Looper gt Amp.Id be using the THRHD in stereo.,guitarpedals,d2bszw6,1,t5_2r0bp

Its really neat in that regard. Right now Im still trying to dial in my entire MIDI set up I didnt think Id need an Excel sheet for guitar   but it will primarily be used for sequencing the filter on the Poly Mod and delay ephemera feedback time delay time etc with the DD and H.

7727308,0,t1_d3kit7r,I do love rack gear but if I have to carry my own shit then forget it . I was thinking suggesting you get rid of it. Place the Gforce on your board or replace it depending on what you use the gforce for.Now if you want to get rack gear for gears sake then personally Id go with a separate path for wet signal. Get a cheap solidstate stereo power amp and maybe two x cabs. That would be a so called WDW rig. This requires a bit more additional gear. Sounds great but using it live will be limited since your local venue sound guy will tell you to GTFO with your fancy gear requiring more than one mic to setup.First thing Id make is a patch panel for the rack. Get a D type rack panel and Neutrik locking jacks and Power Con and whatever else youd need. Put it in the front of the rack for easy fast setup. Youd want a patch box on your board and a cable loom also.Took another look at the photo above. Why not stuff as much as possible in your rack. You already have the midi controller get a midi controlled looper and put your stompboxes in the rack. Wouldnt of much benefit since your board would be almost the same size. GC volxp pedals and tuner would have to stay at least.Anything you need or want for your rig?,guitarpedals,d3kjh0s,2,t5_2r0bp

7833232,0,t1_d3wiopq,Yeah its really something you basically dont need to think about. Having a Boss effect means you have a great buffer on your hands already. Or pretty much anything that isnt expressly true bypass. People should really get over the true bypassbuffer thing.

7862547,0,t1_d3zpy40,Yup thats my biggest gripe with a pure  cutting all the low end out.  Attempting to add it in afterward with an eq isnt the same because the pedal drops those frequencies going forward so any illusion of base added back with eq is mostly harmonics and oddball frequencies.  To get around it I ended up selling my  and paying  for a trex moller  which has a toggle for standard and base boost but what I really like it has a blend knob to mix your original dry signal in with the overdrive for really nice light driven sounds that maintain the sound of your actual amp instead of coloring it too much because at  blend half the signal is still the clean amp coming through.  For that price it also has a separate stomp for a clean boost that can be used independently of the overdrive which is perfect for me because I needed a way to boost the volume after my fuzz pedal because I like to run my muff with guitar volume  to roll back most of the harshness and needed a clean boost after it to bring the volume floor back to level without messing with my amps master volume.,guitarpedals,d3ztkzz,1,t5_2r0bp

7869686,0,t1_d406v0a,Oh right I get what you mean. Thats not really overhead though. Overhead is the space between  and your highest amplitude which you want to be small as possible so the track is as loud as possible without going over  and clipping.If you have a quieter track and then try to amplify it in mastering youll bring up the floor noise with it,guitarpedals,d40miz5,2,t5_2r0bp

Its my favorite pedal and I even posted about V on here and geeked about it on TGP. Damn thats really high. Is it noisy when daisy chained? The WET is very unique and is probably cleaner sounding. The DM has issues with clipping when fed a very hot signal. The beauty of it is it being a set and forget pedal at least for me. I hate tinkering. I mean I love it when Im bored but when Im playing I wanna focus on playing. I suppose for people who wanted a bit more flexibility they wanted tap tempo.

8613356,0,t3_4xti8j,Just got this in the mail a few days ago finally posting for all the world to see.Rowin Time Maker digital delay with taptempo.  You can find this identical pedal branded as the Donner Ultimate Delay as well.  Ive been having a blast jamming out with this thing it can handle a lot of different delay types.Pure mode which is standard digital delay mode sounds crisp and clean and just beautiful.  Although the Analog mode was a bit of a disappointment.  I love the sound of an analog delay as it decays and this doesnt really do a good job of simulating that.  Further it seems to color the tone of the guitar a lot in this mode especially if youre using dirt.Tap Tempo on it works just like its supposed to but there are a couple of short comings there too.  First theres no dottedeighth option which is probably a deal breaker for some people.  Second when the delay is disengaged the TapTempo light doesnt flash to show you the interval the delay is set to.  You can still change the delay interval with the tap tempo button when the delay is disengaged but you wont be able see a visual representation of that interval until the delay is engaged.  Kind of a minor quibble but it would have been nice.As for the rest of the delay modes its kind of hit or miss.  I liked the tape echo mode though its not going to pass for a legit tape echo or any of the recent boutique tape echo simulators like the Empress.  But it sounds good with a nice little warble to the echos.  I also really like the tremolo mode which sounds similar to the tape echo mode but with a more pronounced flutter.  The pingpong works great if youre set up in stereo which this pedal handles very well with the dual inputs on each side.The pedal itself is pretty well constructed at least on the outside.  Its not too big for a dualfootswitch pedal  a little bit shorter than a standard Boss or MXR type enclosure and about one and a half times as wide.  Its certainly not a mini pedal but its got a very reasonably sized footprint.  It is a bit finicky about powering  I tried to use it within a daisy chain at first but I think it has a pretty high amperage requirement so itll either need its own power supply or at least a AC adapter with lots of amps on tap.The pedal does also feature a looping mode and the ability to save and recall one of your delay settings but I havent really delved into those yet to see how well they work.All in all Im pretty impressed with how it performs I was able to get mine new for less than the cost of a used DD but it was a couple weeks to get in from China.Im not sure if I can get any samples up but there are a few You Tube reviews out there already so you can get an idea what it sounds like.,guitarpedals,d6i9lvq,5,t5_2r0bp

8802549,0,t3_50pndj,I got this pedal more for the novelty than anything because of all the old deathblack metal bands using it as well as a bunch of hardcore bands I like Harms Way namely  ubosxe from which even verified on this sub that they used it when I asked in a thread! using it for their sound. I was surprised by a couple of things when I plugged it in  one how loud it is and two by how good the thing sounds. Like I said I bought it for the novelty but I might actually put this as a mainstay on my board just because when not at those settings its really thick but articulate and has just enough gain to crank it without becoming a washy mess. Its closer to a fuzz pedal than it is a conventional distortion but it doesnt have the loose bottom end most fuzz pedals do  very thumpy and thick. Funnily enough you can get that Weezer Blue Album tone easy with this thing and a humbucker guitar.Of course it does that sound perfectly. Mines a Taiwanese version which is apparently less soughtafter. That combined with the fact that the LED doesnt work means I was able to get it for pretty cheap but Im not complaining about either  I love this thing.

Looked into it and it seems that most of if not all of the new pedals are Digital Signal Processor DSP based. Meaning theyre all essentially the same pedal running off of a FV chip with different graphics and different effect algorithms loaded onto the chip. A lot of pedal companies are doing this now Alexander Strymon BOSS Tc Electronic Digitech etc and its not very widely known. The only company that is actually upfront about it is Neunaber and theyre really making the most of the programmable pedal with their marketing and designs.Its not like its a bad thing really especially if it sounds good its just a little bit off putting.

The Clarksdale is very transparent and trebley which isnt what I want in a boost especially a TS style boost.The Slostortion is nice and creamy.

In my opinion its one of the best choruses on the market for its sound and versatility. Ive used the EHX polychorus which is awesome tons of small clones the TC Corona and some other boutique stuff. The EQD has been my favorite since I got it a few years ago.The absolute worst I have played are the MXR stereo chorus and this one.,guitarpedals,d7sc3lc,2,t5_2r0bp

Also it may motivate you to travel ridiculously long distances to get something.Reverb is great for the hard to find stuff and amazing for customer service and mediation but hit or miss price wise. Being able to make an offer and local pick up is great too.Guitar center is good for occasionally ridiculous deals on used stuff being able to try basically anything out for a really long time and IIRC good customer service. Local boutique and vintage shops have been good for me. Staff is either really nice and accommodating or constantly annoyed by your presence in my area. Good selection opportunity to try rare stuff occasionally good deals but often really jacked up prices. But IME if you build relationships there and pick up smaller items semifrequently theyll cut you a deal or make nice trades when they can.Pawn shops are about as good for deals as GC occasionally better but almost always terrible for selection IME.Amazon can be really cool for basic stuff brand new if you have a prime membership. ,guitarpedals,d7wg15u,4,t5_2r0bp

Reverb before delay is big for me.I havent had experience with the other OBNE pedals besides the black fountain but I think its like any other pedal especially for me its fuzz pedals. The first week or so the pedal inspires you to play and learn different things until after maybe a week of that it becomes just another pedal that you own and youre onto the next greatest thing  BUT! then the challenge is to start creating things that allow you to utilize this one trick pony pedal in a new or interesting way. Its like challenge accepted! what else can I make with the tools this pedal provides me with? And thats what I like about niche pedals like the OBNE stuff or my other favorite the zvex instant lofi junky.

9374257,0,t3_58xsrt,Well it is really a question of whether digital effects are as good as analog.  For instance A digital reverb pedal to me is the exact same thing as a plugin of course it depends on the plugin.   I think using a DAW is another experience that should be taking advantage of by any musician.  If you have a Mac you could literally plug your guitar in your computer and test out lots of effects to see what fits into your scheme.   The other side of the coin to DAWs is the amp modeling vs micing an amp in the room.  For me  playing through an amp is a lot different then playing through a DAW.   I usually leave my amp in the practice space and go home and rehearse on my own through a DAW.  ,guitarpedals,d9494yx,1,t5_2r0bp

9500402,0,t3_5axmtt,I dont think I have seen a  around here yet so I thought Id share my experience with it. Sorry for the long post but its worth a read if youre curious about the pedal or  especially if  considering buying one.Now I know that the  is supposed to be modeled after a Bell and Howell projector and all that jazz but honestly it doesnt matter to me. As Ive never played a projector amp Im treating it as a regular overdrive and all that matters to me is whether it sounds good or not.Anyway I got the  very recently about a week ago and as soon as I plugged it in my initial reaction was wtf. I watched every single demo of it out there and I knew what I was getting into it varied from demo to demo but I thought it was supposed to be a somewhat gritty maybe lofiish depending on the demo but very articulate and transparent low to medium gain overdrive.No demo prepared me to what I received and played. The pedal I was playing had A LOT more gain than I imagined it was already a bit gainy even with the Gain knob turned to minimum. The thing that jumped out to me however was the fact that I could only describe it as an ODFuzz mix which was kind of a surprise. It sounded nothing like any traditional overdrive I had ever played it was VERY dynamic but in somewhat of a bad way. Unless you played considerably hard the volume output would be very low and because of that any soft playing made it sound gated and a bit broken. Even worse certain lower notes sounded essentially ring modulated. Really reminded of a fuzz pedal but even then the dynamicsgating issue was putting me off of it a bit. It sounded great with chords high gain and hard playing though.Some days passed and I was still having an internal struggle whether to give it more time and use it as a weird ODfuzz combo or to just sell it because it wasnt for me. Until I decided to open it and faced one of the most wonderful sights I could have expected in this scenario internal trimpots.This post is already too long but to sum it up after a quick but careful testing the middle trimpot appears to be something similar to a bias control. Dialing it back from  oclock to ish completely changed the breakup characteristics and got rid of all the issues I was having. It was suddenly like a new and completely different pedal. Since its a very delicate adjustment it must have slipped the guys at Walrus which is completely understandable and Ive had similar issues with several other pedals from other companies which is why I opened it to check anyway.Now its one of the best overdrive pedals I have ever played. Very transparent unlike most other selfproclaimed transparent overdrives out there in the market with just a very minimal and pleasant midbump at higher gain settings. At minimum gain with the EQ knobs at noon its  transparent and doesnt even appear to be turned on which is something Ive never seen before with any other OD.With the trimmer adjustment the gain got lowered sounding much more like the lowmid gain Walrus describes in their literature. Its still very dynamic but not in a crippling way and can be slightly throaty and gritty if you want to although in an truly natural and pleasing way. Absolutely love it.,guitarpedals,d9k4kx8,27,t5_2r0bp

9633393,0,t3_5cywb2,The Wombtone is the result of yet another exchange on rletstradepedals. I love my Warped Vinyl so I was pretty excited when I had the opportunity to trade for this. This time around it was a little easier to figure out the controls are quite similar to the WV however it was difficult to wrap my head around what each control did to the phasing something Im still relatively new to. I had the MXR Phase  for a short period before this. I loved the effect but I hated the gainy volume build that came along with it. This thing is a while different beast. Ive found nice subtle settings already and a few crazier ones including one that sounds very similar to a tremolo effect. While the Warped Vinyl was love at first sound this Im not as sure about partly cause I went from no phaser to the Wombtone and it might just be too much for my needs. Ill play around with it and see how well it meshes with my style and my setup and make my decision on it after a few days. Any other Wombtone users?,guitarpedals,da0iidk,3,t5_2r0bp

9829947,0,t3_5g1vsa,The guys in the s and s had this mastered  We just forgot how to do it!Consider the fact that all of these very popular units were all mono instereo out Yamaha SPX Roland SRV Lexicon PCM TC Electronic  DytronicsDynoMyPianoSongbird TriStereo ChorusMany algorithms even on the groundbreaking Eventide H were mono instereo out or summedmonostereo out too so knowing how to navigate this kind of thing was crucial!The solution back thenthe template that was good enough for most players to accomplish the sounds they were going afterwas to use a twostage stereo mixer  a stereo auxiliary send on the first mix often called a DualStereo Line mixerand these are still made today by many manufacturers based on this same template from the earlytomids  . This design was perfect for dealing with mono instereo out FX because since it took one dry  signaleither your amps tone or a stereo signal coming from an analog chorus unit which was fine because there was no digital conversion thereand kept that separate parallel from the rest of the FX the only matter to deal with now was how to feed the FX. It sounds like a copout but honestly a lot of the time the simplestand often the bestsolution was to just feed one side of the previous stereo image into a mono instereo out effect and some classic sounds were created this wayMike Landaus s LA Session chorus sound was created this way by feeding one side of his TriStereo Chorus sound into an SPX set to stereo detune and the other half into another SPX set for a stereo reverb...and then all three signalschorus stereo detune and stereo reverbwere mixed back together in stereo in Mix  Mix  would have delayseither some Lexicon PCMs or PCMs. The thing that really ties it all together is the fact that the FX and the analog dry signal really are separate hereno digital processor in these rigs with few exceptions would be tasked with passing that dry signal along through the rig so that takes any weird monogtstereogtmono etc. routing problemslike youd see on pedalboardsoff the table the only thing that had to be dealt with was choosing how to feed the FX since they were all going to be stereo on the outputs anyway. Sometimes the solution was easy and sometimes it required a little more forethought for example a ms stereo delayshould the  ms side feed the reverb or the  ms side? things like that but usually a good solution was always available. Later on this was not so much of an issueRolandBoss went full stereo input on just about everything in a few years as did Eventide Lexicon etc...but even then some of the classic routings they figured out with the monoin stereo out stuff continued to be used because they just worked so well for certain things and some presets on the more powerful units still try to replicate these today  . The good news is that this can in a lot of situations be done on pedalboards just as well! And sometimes it may even be more important to configure your FX inputs amp outputs carefully there than in a rack system...for example a lot of chorus pedals will merely flip the audio phase on the outputs so if you pass that whole stereo signal out to a reverb pedal that sums to mono at the input Line  Verbzilla for example you could end up not passing that chorus signal through the reverb engine at all because the phases cancelled on the way in...you still hear the stereo chorus pass through but the reverb just doesnt have any chorus flavor on it this can be avoided however by mixing signal paths in parallel and feeding just one side of the chorus to the reverb pedalthat way you still get a stereo reverb sound mixed in AND it has the chorus flavor inside the verb too because you sent just one side not both to the reverbso nothing gets cancelled. Important note that advice is very specific to that scenario! That would be like if you were using a TC SCF gt Verbzilla setup if you were using something like a TriAvatar Chorus gt Verbzilla setup or a Boss DC gt BigSky setup you wouldnt have to worry about any of that since both of those are true stereo pedalsnot just a phaseflipper on the outputs.Before I go into any other scenarios or pedalboard solutions and there are many what pedals specifically are you trying to get to work in your setup? ,guitarpedals,daov3n2,6,t5_2r0bp

Thats exactly what I was thinking really aside from the Ravish pedal that I didnt know was therebut thats where Id put it too.gt If I where to use the Boss LS how would my configuration be?You wouldnt need it not with the DD the DD keeps your dry signal analog throughout so a mixer is unnecessary. Itd be a good companion for an Eventide Timefactor H or Source Audio Nemesis however all  of which convert your dry signal to digital when theyre on.If you did end up using the LS though it would go in the FX loop and then you would use the A or B output to a delay pedal and then return that delay pedals wet signal set  wet to one of the returns on the pedal. You would then use the AB mix mode to get your analog dry signal  the digital wet FX signal working together important to note this would only work in monoif you want to upgrade to stereo later on a different mixer will be needed there.,guitarpedals,daw4dfe,1,t5_2r0bp

10066766,0,t1_dbiwab3,My recommendation would be a specialized preamp to get your guitar into a better eq range or an inputoutput controller so you could plug in multiple guitars and switch between them. All youd really be adding is one extra cable as your guitar cable would change from going straight to rack to going guitar gt board gt rack. Another cool thing would be a couple eq pedals. Im not sure how the line  can alter eq as a footswitchable option but even putting a handful of eq pedals on the board might really give you some useful tonal options. However since youre not wanting to run extra cables maybe the thing to do is to add another expression dedicated to control gain level for drives. A lot of people have mentioned this and I really do think it would Be helpful. ,guitarpedals,dbjq0zf,1,t5_2r0bp

10272746,0,t3_5n2kfs,If you really want to go on an epic journey with a true inspiration machine get a Lexicon PCM! And then you can try all the presets I make for this I have been doing this for  years now and the library continues to grow and grow. If you buy it I will even make some custom ones for you! This thing will do things that literally no pedal can do...you want reverbs with surround imaging? Done...Concert Hall with modulation? the GOOD kind! Done...modulated multitap delays making their own reverbs feeding into the reverb engine or in parallel? Done...and control? You can control just about anything you can imagine any way you want to. Theres even an Infinite reverb where you can turn the Infinite switch off and one with just your own playing and dynamics...not to mention LOTS of spillover options within the unit itself especially for multiple delays freezeinfinite FX postmodulated reverb FX etc....and of course two amazing expansion cards you can get later on Pitch Card an DualFX card. By the way about that Concert Hall wmodulation I mentioned...You might have seen me discuss this topic before here but in case you havent there are at least  main styles modulation in reverbs and to me the most dreamyatmosphericspacey mod reverb style is definitely the one with internallymodulated delay linesbasically in same way that mod delay lines lines if its a multivoice chorus like a TriChorus in a chorus move back and forth in time and pitch the individual delays that make up the reverb itself modulate in the same fashion. Its a big enveloping oceanic heavenly sound...you can almost hear a bit of a choir sound within long tails of these kinds of reverbs. These are the kind of verbs that ambient artists like Steve Roach John Serrie Brian Eno etc. would use...and guess what? It just happens to be the rarest form of reverb you would find in pedals. Ten years ago there was not a single pedal that had this style you were just SOL with pedals or had to buy a rack unit if you wanted that! but luckily the dam finally broke with the Eventide SPACE which has several algorithms using this style Neunaber WETs Strymon BigSky the BlueSky and Flint probably have some of this too etc.Now there are two other main styles here postmodulation  this would include the TC HOF Digitech RVSupernaturalPolara etc. and its where you just apply a chorusflangerphaser after the whole reverb signal but not on the dry signal itself...its a very different sound that the internallymodulated delay lines not as majestic but can still make for some neat more obviously textured sounds its usually very obvious when this is onits pretty much effected reverb reverb tail postmodulation  this is where the Boss RV RV Alesis QuadraverbMidiverbWEDGEetc. fit in to the picture...reverb algorithms are usually broken up into the  early reflections a series of diffused multitaps usually that give you a sense of the space youre in and  the reverb tail the denser part often made with plex networkswhere every delay in a matrix feeds back into itself and all the others and multiplies ad infinitum...the RV and RV took this trick of applying a chorus to just the second part of that from some older units where it was easy to break up the individual components of the reverb and add FX wherever you wanted them first on the R and later on the SRV. While this style isnt really as majestic as the internallymodulated delay lines it does usually sound better to me than just straightup postmodulation because you dont get so much obvious effectedness no comb filteringflangey sounds on the early reflections for instancejust a nice chorus tail that blends very nicely in the overall picture. The Empress verbfrom what I can gathercan almost do all ....it certainly does the internallymodulated delay lines and postreverb tail modulation style the only thing up in the air is whether or not it can add a chorus after the whole reverb signal though Im pretty sure it can add a flanger in this way. A few things for a reverb to really inspire me it has to put me inside a space and that means a true stereo verb! surround is nice too like the Roland RSS effect or the Lexicon PCM surround imager it has to have a LOT of control over the frequency content of the verbpedals are hardly ever enough in this area... knobs? Forget it! You can have a goodsounding verb pedal w knobs the Polara sounds pretty good for what it does after all...but will you make everybody happy and really give them enough room to explore? No and no...its just not enough. There are crucial parameters you need to unlock the true potential of the verb and pedals are just starting to get around to this and even there theres room for improvement even on the big boxes. DECAY time and SIZE  oftentimes its presented as just  control but it shouldnt be! In the PCM you set the size of the space in meters and the Decay times in secondsjust think about how many sounds you are missing out on in the Polara from not having that kind of control!Now I do think there are some very inspiring reverb pedals but if I had to replace my PCM with one it would undoubtedly be the Eventide SPACEthere is just so much going on there thats similar and some things that just go beyond too BlackHole for instance is based off a structure that cannot be created in a Lexicon the diffchorustwo of them in fact!. Its like buying  reverb pedals in one. The newest updates theyve done to the firmware really turn it into an inspiration powerhouse. You have to dig and learn more than you would for other reverb pedals a lot more but nothing comes for free and youll have to do that anyway with rack units later on...so its best I think to finally make the jump to the next level. These are not reverbs crafted by amateur enthusiaststhese are reverbs crafted by industry professionals with  years of experience and the difference is huge. Try it! I know I would if something ever happened to the PCM Bottom line for me is this reverbs are still a very underdeveloped area of guitar FX. I dont care if there are  reverb pedals already  of them suck really badly and only a small handful are worthy to go toetotoe with their rack cousins. Reverb pedals are usually made by companies who dont want to make something too good in the first place so as not to compete with higherend productsbetter verb algorithms and thats a problem if youre really looking for inspirational sounds. Pedals like the SPACEwhile not delivering the full Eclipse or DSP reverb experienceare actually still preserving a very large part of what make Eventide reverbs great in a way that DigitechLexicon and TC Electronic are not.,guitarpedals,dc8gzyx,26,t5_2r0bp

10476561,0,t1_dcvhitv,Thats decent. If youre comfortable only monitoring through headphones or line out to mixermonitors of some kind then my first recommendation would be a Torpedo C.A.B. because it allows directheadphone monitoring and directusb recording through speaker cabinet IRs impulse responses  including any rd party IRs but it also includes various power amp models. So you can plug in a real preamp or preamp pedal or even a drive pedal chain and it sounds like a real amp even with just drive pedals Brett demos this later in the vid after he kicks off with a clean JC sim demo and then a run through of the features with an AMT Stonehead plugged in.  new but you can find them used for  less or so on Reverb ebay and elsewhere.Im using an AxeFX II but if I had half the budget than that the CAB  a nice tube preamp pedal like the Kingsley Jester is the first thing I might look at although I would give the DV Mark Multiamp Mono k new fullfledged modeling head  power amp  FX  directheadphone out and the BluGuitar AMP  new hybrid transistortube multichannel preamppower amp in a large pedal form factor some serious consideration too.If you want something that actually pushes the air around but can get down to bedroom conversation level then Id suggest looking at a VHT Special  Ultra combo or head if youve already got a cabinetcabinets to play through. Hand wired pointtopoint all tube amp so its easy to maintain and mod variable power amp wattage from W down to W  to  Ohm speaker FX loop and a line out which doesnt sound that great unless you run it through a decent cab sim actually and its selfbiasing  you can swap in other types of power tubes. Its designed to be a moddable alltube pedal platform and your proposed pedal chain would probably sound pretty good through it although if I got the combo I might swap out the speaker. Id probably put an EL in it too.,guitarpedals,dcvmkso,1,t5_2r0bp

I like to record a loop and have it play back on one tape head only. Then occasionally flip the toggle to bring in the second and third tape heads witch are set to different pitches. The three pitches I usually set to some sort of suspended chord. Root perfect fourth and perfect fifth.Mode  is fun as well. I like to crank the random knob and bring the length down to get bouncy random loops.Mode  is interesting to play with but I dont use it all that much.

Are you referencing preamp breakup or something else? You can achieve that on solid state with a good amp or a pedal.Theres crossover in modeling and solid state stuff but modeling is generally circuits with digital components that are meant to emulate other tube and solid state amp models. A lot of these like the newer Yamaha ones are really good. Solid state amps are just using components other than tubes.

10928812,0,t3_5vglva,I am starting a band and I have quite a dilemma in regards the tone of guitar. Guitarist prefers this what he calls crunchy sound of relatively clean distortion one that is more high and mid ends than low ends hopefully you people know what I mean. The kind you get from an distortion pedal not the kind of overdrive or fuzz pedal.I on other hand fucking adore and love Big Muff Pi and its thick filthy heavy tones. Now the issue is the guitarist doesnt really warm up to the big muff pi which frustrates me to no end. I dont know if I can even sing to the thin piss weak guitar tone he prefers it just feels so powerless and lifeless to me. I dont even know if I want to be in band that uses such guitar tone.So has anyone stacked big muff pi with an distortion pedal. Not overdrive but a distortion pedal. Is there any way to combine these two to have a kind of best of both worlds approach or even find somekind of compromise? This bothers me a lot. I just abhorr the guitarists preferred guitar tone. Cant stand it. I really feel I need the guitar to sound at least somewhat heavy filthy and thick to even get into the music at all I am supposed to sing to.Has anyone done this? Is it possible? Does anyone have any audio samples on how it might sound like? And if it isnt possible does anyone have any recommmendations on how to move foward with this?The guitarist writes really great songs I am just so bothered that his guitar tone of choice does no justice to them at all.,guitarpedals,de78as9,1,t5_2r0bp

11062383,0,t1_delneub,Funny story actually. Its an avatar traditional x open back that i traded a a cab for back in  when I lived on the other side of the state. Later moved back to moms for a bit to help with bills and sold it to a guy who knew the original owner but I kept the V and the G that were in it. Later sold the G to a friend and kept the V in a x until  where I actually bought back the exact same a cab I traded for the avatar but in a completely different state even though it was from the dudes son. A month later traded the a cab again for another avatar x that I later found out was the same one I sold making it the same one I traded the same cab for  years prior. Took the Jensens he had loaded in it out and put the same V back in it. Was looking for a second speaker to match it better and ended up buying a x off the dude I sold the G to and the G was in it. So I loaded it back in making it exactly as it had come from the factory and when I had first acquired it. I didnt really mean to do that its just how it happened. Ive since loaded it with two actual British Vs and will never let go of it again. Its probably the best cab Ive ever owned now with these speakers even better than my two port city cabs.

But like you I have recently found myself getting a bit lost. Until a few months ago I enjoyed and was satisfied with just plugging my guitar into my amp. Then I got an overdrive then a looper... Now I have an pedal board modest compared to many I see here I know and some days when I play I feel a disorienting glut of options. Ive been playing for  decades and I still sometimes expect that a purchase will reignite my passion for playing. And to be honest getting new stuff is really fun. I imagine that its different for career musicians  I just play to relax. But it can be hard to just kick back and enjoy playing when youre so busy making pedal decisions....

I always leave it on with the compression between  or  depending on the day. Very transparent. Just enough to even out my dynamics a bit. I like a little bit of breakup in my clean tone and its the perfect compliment. The boost side is a wonderful bonus.

11355269,0,t3_6221w3,The opposite of your approach is more common for some reason in my experience but I think less of a good idea. The stiff part of the velcro does not wear out or much less quickly if it does at all whereas the soft part does wear out. It makes little sense to me to put the soft part on the board which will be by far the more permanent connection of the two. You can always pull off the couple inches of velcro from your pedal if it starts losing strength but on your board youd have to basically just start over.Also the stiff part seems to stick to carpets which is super annoying. You wont run into this issue if you put the soft part on your pedal backs.In conclusion soft on pedal and hard on board is what I consider the right way to do it.,guitarpedals,dfj3kfo,4,t5_2r0bp

I always understood that as a degradation of sound not a sudden loss in volume at random but I guess I could have misunderstood. I have a few pedals that have a signal LED and I seem to lose signal around my RE which is second the last in the chain.The only other detail I can think of that Ive tested so far is also that if I leave my board and amp on let it be and come back after a while  everything still works. So as far as I can tell this only happens while Im actively using it. Any thoughts or ideas are appreciated this isnt really something I want to run into when playing live or rehearsing. edit Ive also rearranged my CS to best match the power draw of each pedal.,guitarpedals,dfmrlzc,1,t5_2r0bp

11396536,0,t3_62iwcf,I always saw downvotes as a means to regulate toxicity. If youre being rude or are saying stuff that is offensive to the community then you get downvoted. Theres a line however to be drawn between posts that dont contribute much I dont see anything wrong with empty NPD posts they usually still spark some useful comments and posts that are clearly spammy or garbage. Theres some sort of natural selection going on between the posts and the most upvoted ones float on the front page longer. Downvoting people because they post nothing more than a nice picture of their new OCD or SP Comp will not encourage anybody to join in and participate on the sub. That being said I got downvoted yesterday and called dumb and ignorant for not getting a pedal in a thread that was specifically created to flame popular pedals.

If they manage to elicit similar emotions from you with volume swells and delay pedals as other artists do with lyrics then why is that inherently disingenuous? Or even wrong?To be honest that sounds more insulting on your behalf than it does on theirs. Youre insulting thousands of their fans. Could you be projecting? I have no opinion. I am unfamiliar with their music and its entirely possible they are even purposely releasing generic post rock stuff with a smirk on their faces. But even then its up to the listener to imbue the sounds with whatever emotions and experiential attachments they might have for it.The linked article is even more insulting than anything tbh.
