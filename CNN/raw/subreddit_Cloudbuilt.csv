2046947,0,t3_2i8asf,Just pretend I didnt get hit by the striker turret and didnt totally botch that last jump was supposed to take off on the ramp to get extra heightdistance landing straight in the door but I took off early on flat ground and thats my route.,Cloudbuilt,cl00g76,3,t5_32ejz

2462138,0,t3_2npypo,To add to whats already said take a look at this   Lots of handy techniques.  That said you dont need to be good to enjoy this game. I suck but Im still having fun! ,Cloudbuilt,cmg0s0i,3,t5_32ejz
2926178,0,t3_2tnusu,We did have something like this proposed a while ago with around  energy that way you couldnt do the insane jumps that break most levels.  However I dont think the devs are going to be adding a whole new game mode considering how long theyve been supporting the game as is and the fact that theyre such a small studio.,Cloudbuilt,co0psbz,1,t5_32ejz

4347464,0,t3_3araso,fun level that part with the spikes and energy near the end is a little tricky,Cloudbuilt,csfowbq,2,t5_32ejz
4859565,0,t3_3hf9pt,Great level !I love the layout of how the paths go of in different directions and yet beautifully intertwine at the checkpoints. Also that optional faster wall run at the end is really cool and interesting D,Cloudbuilt,cu7323j,3,t5_32ejz

8196782,0,t1_d524umc,Thanks for the feedback! Im glad the commentary sounded better this time around Shady and I put a ton of work into it this time around DSymphony of the Night would have been a great donation incentive now that you bring it up though how long that would take might be an issue. Maybe we could do one of Kalifens impossible levels? Or we could have done UC if I could figure out how to unlock it |Im not good enough at any other games to submit them to a GDQ event unfortunately so at least for the foreseeable future itll be only Cloudbuilt. Why do you ask?,Cloudbuilt,d525fd4,2,t5_32ejz
8801550,0,t3_4wc8q1,So I think I may be able to make it out to AGDQ  for the run depending on the day as the venue is only a little over an hour away from me. If its not a weekend I might still be able to drive out after school so hopefully Ill be there  If youre looking for commentators I may be able to help.,Cloudbuilt,d75trs1,1,t5_32ejz
