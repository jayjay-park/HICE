6354419,0,t3_42m7sr,Hey there Im glad youre considering Centre!!  Im no expert but heres what I know. After the faculty scholarship you have access to federal financial aid which is needbased and thats just about it.  I know its rough but we all get by  Meeting with a representative of the school certainly couldnt hurt!  But youre probably not going to get anything else unless youre selected as a Brown fellow or through one of the other special programs.  There are opportunities for work study if you qualify based on need and a couple other jobs on campus RA which is a competitive selection process and the Norton Centre which pays very little but is fun nonetheless. The performing arts scholarship is great! Its not much but its not super competitive and every little bit helps.  You are required to be in an ensemble and lessons every semester but you basically get paid to do what you love and those ensembles and lessons dont have to be the same from one semester to the next.  You still pay for lessons but the scholarship pays out more than that price so its still nice. I know very little about the history department but I know a couple history majors who seem happy enough with it and of course there are standout profs in every discipline.  I just studied abroad and had a really great experience.  Centre makes it super convenient and easy to go abroad which is wonderful.  That being said not everyone has an amazing experience who you go with what your expectations were general things out of your control can all affect that and some people who want to do nonCentre programs find that process frustrating.Enjoy the rest of your senior year!,Centre,czbxe9d,3,t5_2su90
