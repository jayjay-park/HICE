3228333,0,t1_cowkv6h,Definitely drafting from a selected pool as far as I know. Probably in a selected order maybe in the order when we joined?Because nobody is allowed to have the same Pokemon on the team so if someone drafts Wailord nobody else can have Wailord on the team.If we would make the teams on our own it would be a bit complicated.. DSo you are able to play in the first season? ,redditbattleleague,cowmdlm,1,t5_374eb
