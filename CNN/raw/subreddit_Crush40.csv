5939885,0,t3_3wlwto,Rock on!Looking forward to working with the moderation team here. Im excited to make this subreddit really look and feel like a community base. I too got into the band in high school and now that Im graduated and looking forward to a United States Navy term I can say that I wouldnt quite be myself without Crush .Im an aspiring musician working on a first project with my new band. Ill dabble in art game development event management and game conventions. Whatever catches my interest even when my main interest is music.Im a huge C fan to say the least and Im looking forward to getting a steady stream of content here.,Crush40,cxy8zad,2,t5_2xdft
