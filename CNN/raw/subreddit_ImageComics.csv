1412900,0,t1_citdsdu,Thats what I was trying to convey. Superhero stories overall are basic rudimentary and bland. The genre is narrow but its extremely difficult to start and follow a character or story line for several reasons. They are all similar copycats that clutter up the original or best stories. Also the writers or artists get moved around in series with hundreds of issues so theres no stability. For example I loved Ultimate Spider Man but the artist got changed around later which ruined the series for me. ,ImageComics,citdwot,3,t5_2u0en

2258520,0,t3_2l22pd,Southern Bastards is just beautiful writing. Great story so far the latest issue managed to get me to sympathize with the seriess biggest villain thus far. Great stuff.Black Science is a really cool concept. It could go no where or it could be amazing. Def worth keeping up with.Rat Queens is just pure FUN. Caps necessary. By far the most fun Im having reading a monthly. I cant wait fore the next issue!!!Umbral is great if you like dark fantasy. Like if you liked the Dark Crystal or the Black Cauldron as a kid I totally recommend Umbral. Really cool art and the story is headed towards a pretty classic fantasy romp.Saga is pure amazing. Get the first three volumes and then either be patient like me and cry while you wait for volume four or break and read the issues. It has won Comic of the Year numerous times in numerous publications. Just read it.Lazarus is a really interesting concept. Not a must read but def interesting. Zero is pretty damn cool especially if youre into spy thrillers. If you like the Bourne movies andor basically any Robert Ludlum novels or Clancy or anyone like that definitely check out Zero. They change artist every issue which can give it a jarring but refreshing feel.Deadly Class is a lot of fun so far. It kinda has a manga feel to it while still be very western. Its about a high school for assassins and is way less corny than that sounds.Thats all I can think of for now!,ImageComics,clqvhd8,7,t5_2u0en

Just the thought of you know how you cant read and listen at the same time? Even if the reader reads words just the ambient noise while they read character words might add to the experience.If that is too much work then disregard.

9254767,0,t3_4x82wa,I just picked up the third issue today.  So far I love this series.  The art is incredible and the slowburn mystery is perfectly paced.  Going back to the art and coloring I really cant say enough about it.  That scene in the otherdimensional cathedral from issue  was amazing only to be topped by the art during Dumas interview with Grigoria in her office with serious callbacks to the s.Im also liking the puzzle Hickman is building around the glyphsmagical language.  I dont know if hell ever give us an actual Rosetta Stone for them but theres some intriguing stuff based on what we know so far.  For example both issues  and  feature the glyph of the Watcher seat on the cover currently held by Beatrix Bischoff.  Daniel Rothschild had the glyph for the Ascendant Seat which also appears to be the glyph for Mammon itself tattooed on his chest and Viktor has an untranslated glyph on his chest.  Its also not clear how much information the glyphs actually convey.  For example in issue  Viktor uses two of them one of them the Ascendant SeatMammon glyph when he turns one coin into three in that seminar.  Abby herself uses those same two glyphs in her discussion with Grigoria when theyre having sex in issue  and Abby uses them again in the morgue in issue .

10678757,0,t3_5sq21a,Image suggestionsBlack Science is a weird scifi series by the same guy who writes Low.East of West is my personal favorite Image series for now. Its an ultraviolent scifi western with politics and the main character is Death.You may like The Fix. The humor is very similar to the kind of humor in Saga but its a lot more focused on comedy so theres more of it and its funnier IMO. The Walking Dead is a good one from the writer of Outcast.Edit I also recommend Fatale for a badass supernatural noir book.NonImage suggestionsI think youd like American Vampire. Its a really dark and indepth historicfiction horror book that I highly recommend. It is from Vertigo DCs mature readers imprint but has nothing to do with superheroes.You may also enjoy a manga series called Fairy Tail. Its a very funny fantasy comedy.If you like stories about wars that actually happened I recommend World of Tanks Roll Out miniseries final issue comes out today. and World War One  really intense reallife war stories from WWI.,ImageComics,ddhflgj,3,t5_2u0en
