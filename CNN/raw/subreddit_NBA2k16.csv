8559988,0,t3_4wmt8a,You would be best using the gold playoff edition cards with juiced up stats. Some great  point shooters etc. otherwise stick with the wall westbrooks and klays. I prefer to run a post player as the matchups work well against other teams who usually run guards and wings as the gold additions.  LA demarcus etc. ,NBA2k16,d6bkq79,1,t5_3065f
