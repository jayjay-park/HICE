4794129,0,t3_3giy2o,Id like to believe that these votes are often predetermined and he is able to judge when he needs to be there or not but still..DO YOUR DAMN JOB! as my old coach used to say.Guess hes not expecting to lead by example if he wants Americans to show up and vote for him.,Marco_Rubio,ctyu7uz,1,t5_2tyov
5131323,0,t1_cv4cjp9,i was pretty sold on Rand Paul for the longest time but once i watched the first debate I saw so much strength in Rubio. After tonight I am hopelessly sold on him. Ive signed up I got bumper stickers even donated which i dont normally do this early. I love the confidence and knowledge he portrays and His stance on gay marriage is perfect. Leave it the law of the land but protect peoples right to religion. Im not religious but support religious freedom and I have a gay brother so i support equal rights. He is exactly what Ive been looking to support. ,Marco_Rubio,cv4ile7,2,t5_2tyov

6701606,0,t3_47eouz,For a man who has made closing the deal a key piece of his campaign his inability to secure a majority in so many states so far and in national polls strongly suggests he simply is incompetent when it comes to closing the deal. Perhaps his supporters should think about this claim I can do this thing I keep failing to do. Say what? ,Marco_Rubio,d0ci5qp,3,t5_2tyov

6726629,0,t3_47qa5r,As I commented on another subreddit I think its bizarre that this has only happened now after Rubios impressive debate performance. Trump isnt interested in Christie one little bit. He just wants someone to be attacking Rubio. In fact hes been rather critical of Christie in other debates. The only thing that inspired this was Christies criticism of Ruboto. Which obviously Rubio has recovered from. So its Trump not Rubio whos desparate.,Marco_Rubio,d0f3bs1,3,t5_2tyov
6727493,0,t1_d0ese6g,gt Rubio supporter Bernie but holy shit was that entertaining. Where the hell was this guy a month ago? If Bernie doesnt make the cut I may vote for Rubio in the general election because II do like Bernie and just came from a country  Brazil  with England inspired healthcare system and where college is free  yes I paid nothing to study from the kindergarden to the university. These policies are not good for the economy. ,Marco_Rubio,d0f6jle,1,t5_2tyov
6738616,0,t3_47xxjp,My whole family initially thought Trump was awesome. One night I finally lost it after his comments about liking Putin. As a Veteran who has lost multiple friends in both Iraq and Afghanistan I lost my shit. My exact words wereI swore an oath to the constitution and my friends died protecting that constitution! This man thinks that the Russian despot Putin who kills journalists is a swell guy!? Trump does not believe in the same constitution I swore to protect. I think I blacked out in anger and had to leave the room. Slowly but surely they have all switched to Rubio. They love him now. It may be out of fear.Ive used that same speech multiple times now to different levels of intensity and each time it seems to make people really check their guts.,Marco_Rubio,d0gbxho,4,t5_2tyov

6780892,0,t3_48mnyp,The inability to place second in New Hampshire has become such a nightmare. Kasich clearly is playing spoiler to Rubio but for what reasons I have no idea. Is he waiting for Rubio to call him up and say hell make him VP?,Marco_Rubio,d0kwd30,2,t5_2tyov
6783367,0,t3_48mnyp,Yes wait people. Dont cast your vote early. We need to see how things play out strategically. We dont know yet. Lets see how things change before election day in your state.That said it is probably more valuable to have Kasich lose and drop out. Yes Trump will get quite a few delegates in OH but the narrowing is likely more important. Trump will lose  of states in a v race.,Marco_Rubio,d0l6i7u,2,t5_2tyov

6952188,0,t1_d14a4lj,Hes delusional. Kasich amassed around  delegates at the expense of around  to Rubio and that was from mostly proportional contests and now its not a mostly proportional race from now on but mostly winnertakeall style contests. By narrowly giving plurality wins to Trump in the popular vote say  Trump  Cruz and  Kasich will result in  of the delegates to Trump in winnertakeall States i.e. Arizona NJ etc. and something like  percent of the delegates in virtually every other of the remaining states especially winnertakemost contests i.e. UT CA WI etc.Kasich will climb to about ish delegates at the expense of handing  to  times as many delegates to Trump which would have otherwise gone to Cruz. This strategy of his is either completely delusional Trump will reach or nearly reach  delegates in which case hell be nominated or its insidious hes looking to be the nominee through damaging bargain deals or Trumps VP. Either of these scenarios and Clinton wins. The only scenario in which the GOP holds on to enough of its factions that they beat Clinton and were Trump does not run third party is if Cruz surpasses Trump in votes and delegates. That will take Rubio supporters to flock to Cruz and Kasich to drop out. Its not impossible but the shaming of Kasich and the flocking over of Rubio supporters to Cruz needs to happen this week now. Otherwise whether its Trump or a Kasich or Ryan deal candidate the GOP will lose an exodus of followers from this or that faction and well lose to Clinton. ,Marco_Rubio,d14d2ft,1,t5_2tyov
6971905,0,t1_d16lmyv,I dont think Hillary can handle Trump. He has been underestimated from the start. The point is if you look at the way he strategizes and also how many of the lefty voter base he is raking in I am more than positive he will dominate this election and not by a little either.,Marco_Rubio,d16lpi5,1,t5_2tyov
6997268,0,t1_d18zyqe,Rubio also supports a nofly zone. Rubio also says he opposes airstrikes to overthrow Assad he believes that moderate rebel forces need to be positioned around Syria in order to overthrow him. He only wants airstrikes to destroy ISIL. If anything Rubio seems the most knowledgable about foreign policy to me. You either dont intervene at all causing internal chaos but no more radical jihadists. Or you intervene  by going with full force not withdrawing your troops in order to maintain stability after overthrowing Assad and dispose of ISIS. However I think an interventionist policy such as Rubios will be more efficient in the long term by ensuring peace and democracy in the future. Rand Paul or Cruz for example will be fine for now but it may be costlier in the future When ISIS gets stronger and so does Russias presence in the Middle East.I actually agree with Rubio.,Marco_Rubio,d19hf9s,3,t5_2tyov
9299783,0,t3_56zg5y,That is so obvious. Everybody knew that Rubio was the most electable the republican savior. The Gop rejected him because he was for amnesty and now Trump support this same position.,Marco_Rubio,d8utbir,1,t5_2tyov
