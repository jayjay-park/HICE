6619916,0,t1_czxjwqt,Thank you for your good information. Im wondering how well their speechtotext service can handle with languages other than English. I want to make skills for Japanese market and I thought I would be able to use other speechtotext service when their service is not meet our need...,Jibo,d0421gx,2,t5_32lcb
6640383,0,t3_46m6ds,With other competitors like Buddy and Pepper and now with this new addition its getting to be a crowded market very quickly.  It certainly goes to show that theres a demand here but are companies like Xibot promising more than they can deliver?,Jibo,d0668r2,1,t5_32lcb
6764125,0,t1_d06f3pw,Agreed. This thing is basically an Android tablet with a customized interface mounted on a robot body. What gave me enough trust to preorder a Jibo was the groundbreaking work in AI and speech recognition that it will feature. ,Jibo,d0izqxs,1,t5_32lcb

7532488,0,t1_d2uyh69,I agree with you.... its sad but its the true. ,Jibo,d2yenpa,1,t5_32lcb
7782638,0,t3_4lx781,Its hard to believe how long they have kept us waiting.  At this point Amazon Alexa can more or less do everything I was hoping Jibo would be able to do in terms of smart home integration at a lower cost than my Jibo preorder and they are still adding features. It will be interesting to see if Jibo can actually make it to market before the practical reasons for having it are accomplished by something else.  I still think the concept of having a more conversational robot will be cool but I worry about them losing the platform war to early movers built more around function than form.,Jibo,d3qtkkp,3,t5_32lcb
7797264,0,t1_d3se7pp,Im not going to read through all of the competitors to see what their delivery dates are but none of them are currently available.  The point that I would make again is that nearly EVERY crowd funded product I have ever purchased has missed its delivery date.  Jawbone did it with the UP by almost a year.   Navdy still hasnt shipped and they were very well funded Leap Motion did it and they are now HUGE!   As I recall it was well over a year before I got that thing and when I got it it was useless.  But now its freaking awesome.    Yes Jibo got a lot of funding.  But money doesnt write code.  People do and sometimes it takes longer than you expect.   Look we can debate this until the end of time.  I really do not care what your opinion is nor do you care what mine is.  So lets just agree to disagree and move on.   You got your refund I see no further reason for you to be interested in this product.,Jibo,d3sh06a,2,t5_32lcb
8128155,0,t1_d4t2s91,oops sorry not sure how I missed that.,Jibo,d4tof56,1,t5_32lcb
8380119,0,t1_d5okato,The big thing that differentiates Jibo from the rest of them is the way you interact with him.  If Jibo pulls off what they are promising then it will be worth it.  In my very limited development Ive been able to create abilities for Jibo home automation skills that are already better then Echo handles them.  But I am nowhere close to the level of communication that Jibo is promised to be.  This is because the base skills are still missing from the picture.  With less than  days until the backers start to get devices I would hope that we would start to hear things in the dev channel very soon.   I actually asked them about that in the channel last week.   The answer I got was soon.  The other question mark will be how well they did with the microphone array.  This is something that Amazon did a remarkable job with.  Only time will tell on that.  So should you preorder?Well if you dont care that Jibo is supposed to interact with more like a person then a functional box that you issue commands to. Then I would skip it.   Its fair to expect that the interactivity and personality aspects of home robotics wont matter to some.  But to answer your question that is what people are excited about.All that said if I were coming in to this now I would wait until someone reviews the thing.  This is the type of product that once production starts if the product is a success they should be able to pump them out fairly quickly and get caught up on orders.   The only reason a company does preorders is to gauge how much production they are going to need at launch.,Jibo,d5p2am9,1,t5_32lcb

9254703,0,t1_d8p0ybf,I tried finding any video above and beyond the math skill but couldnt find anything.  Itd be great to see how Jibo did with gestures and brainwaves but my guess is that the implementation didnt go so well since neither won.  The Pictionary skill though would be very cool...wonder what API they used to teach Jibo to recognize basic shapes.,Jibo,d8p3maw,2,t5_32lcb
11252729,0,t3_60kqwy,You beat me to it. Make sure that you post your Questions in the development forum.     ,Jibo,df7hapm,1,t5_32lcb
