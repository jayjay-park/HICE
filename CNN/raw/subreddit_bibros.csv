612447,0,t1_cg94aop,gtWAIT thats a FUCKING OPTION??gtDays before the Internet. They sure were something.I agree w both sentiments here.   I also got misled into thinking binary in regards to sexuality  which led me into the same spiraling questioning that you had expressed.  Learning that bisexuality is actually REAL and guys experience it and selfidentify as such was greatly eyeopening!  And that leads to your last sentence...The informationinternet age has provided bisexuals a forum to speak for and about themselves in their own words.  That cannot be overlooked or overstated.  It is one thing to feel isolated and confused why they dont fit neatly into the gay or straight box it is another thing to hear voices that speak to your personal truths and thoughts that no one else has ever heard besides yourself.That alone is a big reason why I think that bisexual men will be more present in the future than ever before.  Because it wont be the shock that it has been now that information can be literally at your fingertips.  I definitely think the younger generation will look at sexuality for what it is a complicated complex spectrum of preferences.  The antiquated binary thinking of straight or gay is just not applicable for a LOT of people.,bibros,cg9vy4j,2,t5_2vxlr

1094181,0,t1_chrn6o3,It could be that your perception of roles during sex is influenced by your fantasy of sex with men.  It is probably easier to fantasize being receptive during sex than other roles.  There is an allure to being wanted emotionally and I think that translates into being the receptive partner during sex more often than not.It could also be that you want an experienced partner and you see having a dominant and masculine person as that partner rather than a submissive one.  It is a turn on to think of the ideal partner as someone who knows what you want and helps you get it without you having to ask for it someone who takes charge and leads you to sexual fulfillment.  ,bibros,chsnuu5,1,t5_2vxlr
1143179,0,t3_2760t8,A lot of my life was spent looking for sex. The times in my life where I had the most sex with the most people I wasnt trying. Its frustrating and generally just a chore if you go out looking to hook up but as soon as you go out just to have a good time and enjoy yourself thats when you start hooking up.As for advice BE SAFE. You dont want to carry an STD around with you for the rest of your life. Its real. Its out there WAY more common than most people imagine. For your peace of mind and for your health just be safe.Also base your standards off what YOU find attractive not what others find attractive. If you have chemistry with someone the sex will be much better than if  someone thinks theyre hot.,bibros,chy7wdy,1,t5_2vxlr

4236688,0,t1_cs349z8,My thing is dont force it. Sex is fun. I think we tie entirely too much of our sexual preferences into our identity which increases our anxiety and emotions about the whole thing. Just do what comes naturally to you in your own time. Youre not gonna figure it all out in a day. It took me years. Enjoy the adventure and try new things but most of all keep an open mind and remember its just sex. ,bibros,cs368zo,2,t5_2vxlr
4302342,0,t1_csa1zlh,I got curious about it myself but I couldnt find a definitive answer while skimming. The relevant Canadian legislation unsurprisingly doesnt talk about the US FDA and the required standard for condom approval is listed as ISO  yet in practice it appears as if Health Canada is subservient to the US FDA for condom approval.    Before the Theyfit condom guy got banned I remember him saying something like one of the reasons the FDA gave for not approving larger condoms was that their current equipment couldnt test larger condoms but they were looking to change that. Maybe one explanation would be that Health Canada contracts out testing to the US FDA? So in effect US FDA limits become HCs defacto limits although I wouldnt rule out a more direct reason.    Obviously theres not a huge market for condoms larger than mm nominal width anyway and mmmm are particularly niche products but whatever the reason it seems rather unwise to give a strong incentive for some guys to not use condoms at all.,bibros,csaljtc,2,t5_2vxlr

6275318,0,t3_419jg8,I completely agree with your analysis. Im into fem guys I remember seeing other dudes say that if a guy likes a fem why not date a girl? Heres the thing personally I dont associate masculinityfemininity with genders per se. My attraction to fem guys stems from my attraction to feminine girls I love the gentle nature the cuteness and all of that jazz. Why do I like fem guys? because theyre guys who have a feminine nature which I am attracted to. In retrospect I would never be into a masculine like Ronda Rousey for example woman generallyinitially speaking though there have been exceptions in my past. The key thing to note here is how its a nature of someone that nature may vary. I dont see myself being with a masculine guy because that breaks the contrast that I like in a femmasc relationship. There may always be an exception though because its not black and white its not a clearcut term that everyone agrees to. Its as complex as sexuality itself. ,bibros,cz2xldt,2,t5_2vxlr
6445742,0,t1_czlzfei,Haha Im not too far from your boyfriend. Most of my family didnt show affection until after a death in the family. We lost someone and it brought us all together. We went from never saying I love you to saying it almost every other sentence. But when I got my first not boyfriend. I was crazy with paranoia. Id only been out for maybe  months before this guy came into my life. We met on Grindr of course right and we messaged about being just friends and maybe gamer bros yeah that happened. We ended up hooking up after he lost a wrestling match to me. We never went official but we did go exclusive or so I thought. I explained to him about my situation and he seemed mostly ok with it. He was from a town an hour away so I didnt have to worry too much since nobody knew him so he could pass for just a friend. He introduced me as such to his friends and family. But about  weeks in he started complaining about what we were because he felt confused when hed go out. He said he didnt know if we were dating or not so he didnt know how to respond to someone hitting on him. I wasnt remotely interested in dating him since Id only wanted a friend who I could talk about gay stuff with so I told him to do as he pleased. He griped and moaned about it and I didnt really care. He wanted a title and I didnt. But once I was getting close to his friends he used them as a coaxing tool. Ill never forget the day we went out together in public for the first time in my town. We were eating wing stop and he was texting one of his friends. He said she asked if we were dating cuz she thought it was cute. He text her that no we werent because I was ashamed to be with a guy and I didnt want anyone to think I was gay. He meant it as a joke but she took it very serious. Her gf at the time was denying their relationship to her family so his words hit too close to home. I got offended and he tried to chill the situation by repeatedly telling both of us that it was just a joke. Things got better later though. I spent most of my life in a state of self loathing so I had shit self esteem and this guy spent every day convincing me that I was a good person and all that other stuff I needed to hear. Little by little he started to win me over. I had an internal heart attach the first time he made me hold hands with him in public luckily I was trained my entire life to never show emotion men dont show emotion is what my family taught me so I managed to hide my anxiety. After a while it all came natural and I didnt mind it anymore. A small surge of panic arose when my mom mention that I was dating a guy to which I quickly corrected her that I just had friends. But I developed strong feelings for him. Alas...it wasnt meant to be. The day I finally got the nerve to tell him that id be willing to date if he still wanted it he lost all enthusiasm and told me he needed to think about it. It hurt that he didnt jump on the offer after spending so long convincing me that I needed to be in a relationship with him. Later he told me that he couldnt date me and gave me the old its not you its me line. He told me over the phone and I calmly stated that I need to hang up now because I was gonna need some time to deal. It took a long time   years but eventually I got over the romance crap and managed to keep him as a friend. I learned a lot from doing so. I spent the first year convincing myself that it was my fault. I spent the next year accepting that it was my fault. But after being around him for so long I learned that it wasnt me at all. He had a pattern that he wasnt aware of. He was in love with being in love but not in love with someone loving him. I watched him take plenty of guys to all the same places he took me. Heard him tell them all the same words he told me. And eventually watched him dump them the same way he dumped me. Nobody ever lasted more than a week after asking to go official. I finally told him about his pattern and he didnt like it. He stopped dating for a while. His old pattern still wakes up every now and then but were working on ourselves together now. Ive come a long way from who I was and I dont mind admitting that Ive been kinda dramatic with everything. Im still not completely open to having a relationship but Im finally ok to go on dates again. And Im over the closeted life for the most part. I still feel weird when my family talks about it but Im completely comfortable around friends and strangers,bibros,czm1372,1,t5_2vxlr

10261498,0,t3_5mu74v,I have never felt the need to justify  prove or explain my desires to anyone.     I know that comes across as too cool but I dont mean it that way.  What I mean is if I was sitting there with a friend of mine and said man I really love Cinnamon Toast Crunch and they tried telling me that I do not in fact love Cinnamon Toast Crunch but that I was simply in denial and that if I was just honest with myself Id admit that I really love Honey Nut Cheerios Id just sit there and look at them like what the fuck are you talking about?  I just told you what I like.  Fuck you you narcissistic shithead.  I know it might be hard for you to believe being the standard by which the rest of the universe is measured and everything but just because youre all about and only about the Honey Nut Cheerios doesnt mean everyone else is.  Are you fucking retarded?   NO ONE truly knows whats going on in your head and in your heart.  For them to think they know better than you do is the height of arrogance.  Assuming theyre being serious that is.     It is sort of a human thing for friends to give each other shit about their love lives regardless of sex gender orientation or whatever.  Adam and Steve sitting in a tree KISSING . . . etc.  Now if thats whats happening then people need to unbunch their panties and learn how to handle a joke or some harmless ball busting.

11028792,0,t1_dec3cli,You are my exact opposite. I have a strong desire to be in a relationship with a guy and also fool around with the too.

11063709,0,t3_5xy5r5,Dont worry about defining your sexual orientation. Thats my advice.I remember being in a situation very similar to yours when I was in high school my Catholic high school was unfortunately all boys. Ultimately it didnt matter whether I was gay with occasional straight crushes bisexual or straight with a huge crush on one very specific boy.  Because whatever sexual orientation I had defining it wouldnt change it.Also this forum can not say what your sexual orientation is. No one can define you but you. And youre under no obligation to define yourself.One day you will find the right girlfriend or boyfriend for you. Finding a girlfriend wont make those gay crushes of the past go away. Finding a boyfriend wont make those straight crushes of the past go away. That doesnt mean your gay straight bi or something else.Worry about being happy. And then worry about being in love with someone who loves you back  whomever that may be. Ask yourself this if you are straight but find the one guy in all the world that you can fall in love with anyway and he loves you back is it a problem that you call yourself straight?  If youre gay and you find the one girl in all the world that you can fall madly in love with is it a problem that you call yourself gay?TLDR It doesnt matter what you call yourself. Just worry about making yourself happy.,bibros,dem1y7g,15,t5_2vxlr
