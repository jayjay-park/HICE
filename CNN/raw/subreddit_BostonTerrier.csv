Also everyone jokes that she makes the worst guard dog because she will happily walk away with a stranger very happy that she has a new friend because she loves everyone.

Your time with Augustus will be filled with so much love and so many memories by the end you will take care of him again the way you did when he was a puppy and you will pamper and love him the best you can.

6237120,0,t1_cyyhwax,I got her for  from a farm where their neighbors lab went aroamin and found their Boston girl in heat. The litter was nine pups all of which survived. Given that Labs are both the most popular dog in America and seem to be determined to spread their genes far and wide I suspect Boston Labs are probably not that common but still more common than some mixes.
