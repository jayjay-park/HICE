581858,0,t1_cg6e1hq,Some individuals see the whole planet and the beauty of nature. As a species we see it as resources to be strip mined mountains to be removed for their coal etc. If we as a species saw what you see we would not act as we do.Further we dont really know what other animals see. What is a sperm whale thinking about with a  pound brain? What is a dolphin seeing when she helps out a human diver? What was this leopard seal thinking when she kept trying to give penguins to this photographer?Compare the leopard seals thoughts to those of the photographer who let this go on for a whole series of needlessly killed penguins.Most importantly though is it really necessary to see the entirety of the planet in all of its glory to feel suffering as your habitat is destroyed and your species is killed off or starves?If other species can feel and suffer then how exactly is it that we are only a catastrophe to ourselves?,misanthropy,cg6etsk,10,t5_2qtl0

5494748,0,t1_cwdsz7k,We need laws to govern people not control them. We need laws for when people decide to wrong someone to protect the person who was wronged not to deter bad behavior. Evil people will always do evil things. But its not authority that prevents that. If it were wed have no crime.In any case religion is only authoritarian if you accept fallacious conclusions. Yet many people dont and theyre still moral people. Our laws might have come from religion but where did they come from before religion? They came from us. Thus religion is both unnecessary at best and harmful at worst. Look at how many people have died in the name of Christianity. In the name of a fucking imaginary friend. Look at how many times religion has tried to thwart science. Imagine how advanced wed be without all that. It arose because initially we used it to explain the world but then it was used to govern others. This included things like slavery which I think we can all agree is immoral. The real truth is that religion prevents nothing because in the hands of the good it will be used for good and in the hands of the evil it will be used for evil. Basically it amounts to good people do good things and bad people do bad things. Thus religion itself effectively does nothing. Those good people can do good things without it and the bad can do bad things without it.Back when I was delusional and had a purpose and was hopeful and shit this is what I studied. Religion. Ive been an atheist for ages and was while I studied it but it mystified me. And yet all of them are echoes of the cultures from which they came. They all echo the things that culture already believed. It was simply used to justify actions which again can be achieved by other means.,misanthropy,cwe086p,5,t5_2qtl0

The belief that animals have less value than humans because of their lack of higher intelligence has led to extinction causing changes to this planet. I like them better than humans because they arent even really capable of the higher intelligence that has led humans to wreak havoc on this once beautiful planet. Beavers and chimps for example two species I use as examples because of beavers being able to manipulate and change their environments to suit their needs and chimps because of their aggressive behavior towards animals and themselves in their environments arent anywhere near as bad as humans because the destruction that they cause pales in comparison to what humans do. The activities that they perform that are considered selfish and destructive are on small scale levels. I find it pathetic that animals with lower but not nonexistent levels of intelligence than humans have been able to survive for millions of years in their evolutionary time on this planet while living harmoniously with the natural world whereas humans havent.

About   of people fall in the middle area making them moderates however people lean left and right on different aspects. Liberal is not an actual group of people it is just a word used to describe which half you are closer to in general and neither is conservative. And then of course you are forgetting the other axis of the political compass authoritarian vs libertarian authoritarian being the person who thinks the government should make more rules the libertarian being the one who thinks that people should govern themselves and there is no reason for the government or any other group of people to interfere with their agency. So really the regressive left would only take up at most half of the liberals. I myself am a libertarian liberal which is why I did not wish to be lumped in with the regressives in your blanket statement about liberals. Dont forget the other half of the political compass man. Also I apologize for being politically correct pun intended but I really cant stand the SJWs...especially since they are actively trying to control every group that has any power to censor people.

9074032,0,t1_d82imin,gtYeah youre right having a boss isnt being a slave its being a wage slave. You are literally compelled under the threat of starvation to sell your labour to someone else or to appropriate the surplus labour of others in order to enrich yourself. Everyone needs to work. A society cannot exist without labor. You need to work to eat. There is nothing unfair nor unjust about this fact. gtCapitalists dont do what they do out of the good of their hearts they do it for the express purpose of making money. Profit is the sole motive of the capitalist mode of production.  Yes profit is indeed an great motivator. Abilities are not distributed evenly and human excellence is only achieved if there is an reward for having the abilities and work ethics of achieving that excellence.  Lets take for example an communist system where there is state who dictates what you do and how much you make. And lets say in this system there is a restaurant.  Would the people try to make the most excellent food en have the most excellent atmosphere for the customers in this restaurant if they get payed either way whether they try hard or not?  Excellence is the product of working hard and literally trying to excel.  If there are restaurants that treat their customers well and try to make great food then and on the opposite side of the road there is an restaurant where they make shitty food and the place looks like a dump in a free capitalistic society one of the restaurants would flourish and the other one would perish. And in a free society that restaurant does not have an unfair advantage. If you think you can do better you open up a restaurant and try to treat people better for less money and the people will come to you. Intellect and abilities in general are not distributed evenly so not everyone will be able to do so. Some people are not capable of being more then a waiter. But even these people who are waiters will have much better standards of living in a free market society. These waiters are also not slaves. They simply have their worth assessed by the free market. The work they engage in is voluntarily accepted. And their standards of living will be much better then in a socialist or communist system. ,misanthropy,d82jv60,2,t5_2qtl0

9980556,0,t1_db8advp,Railtons argument is contingent on a number of assumptions such as the business about idealized selves. Philosophers can and have constructed other moral theories based on different assumptions. In the absence of some sort of proof of correctness of one of these theories which Railton freely admits is not viable these theories provide an existence proof of multiple welljustified and equally plausible moral frameworks.There are several other issues with Railtons argument. The concept of idealized selves sounds reasonable if one doesnt poke too hard at it but whats the mathematical function for an idealized self? For any nontrivial issue there are potentially many conceivable idealizations many of which are not compatible with each other. Railton talks about what someone would want himself to seek if he knew what he were doing but doesnt explore this deeply enough to recognize that it doesnt resolve anything even with perfect knowledge there are still arbitrary valuebased decisions to be made such as how much weight to give to shortterm vs. longterm outcomes. Essentially the idealized self is a kind of moral oracle presumed to be able to answer the tough questions that Railtons argument cant actually answer. The practical effect of this is that even when it comes to an individuals own interests theres often no objective choice that can be made only subjective ones based on competing values.A much worse version of this same problem occurs at the level of his social point of view and social rationality. If anything the social point of view demonstrates the opposite of Railtons position which is that in any given society there are subsets and supersets of that society with conflicting moral positions many of which are rationally selfconsistent internally and no clear way  other than politics which is at least partially arbitrary  to reach consensus.gt Why do you think its emotional? I just searched the PDF of the paper I mentioned and the word emotion showed up  times.By that argument Shakespeares play are also not emotional. When Railton discusses specific examples he uses emotionladen words such as homesickness distasteful etc. This is because emotions are closely tied to subjective values  we tend to get more sad about the death of a close relative than a distant stranger for example.  If you take emotion out of the picture the question of morality becomes effectively moot.gt Is science not grounded in assumptions?Yes but it is not grounded in assumptions about values and other subjective perspectives. It is the nature of the assumptions that leads to moral positions being inherently subjective.The comparison to science doesnt hold up in many other ways too. If we look at competing scientific models  e.g. Newtonian mechanics vs. special relativity  we see different assumptions in each case and we find that there are ways to test the consequences of those assumptions. This allows us to make wellsupported claims about the correctness of the respective theories.We also find in science that sometimes the answer is that there is no answer  for example quantum theories give us such answers about certain questions. Instead of claiming that theres an idealized but inaccessible way to determine the position and momentum of a particle when its not being observed or to deterministically predict the location of a future particle interaction the theory tells us that such answers fundamentally dont exist. Of course there are caveats to this and future information might change our theories but thats what we see today. Current theory strongly posits that there is no oracle that can answer such questions even in principle in part because the questions dont actually make sense.The situation with morality is quite similar we certainly havent found any moral oracles and there are strong reasons to believe that they cant exist and that the reason for this is that the questions that such an oracle would be expected to answer dont make sense. E.g. amongst a set of competing alternatives each with a large set of pros and cons attached which is the best or right one? Its like asking where a particle is it doesnt make sense even in principle.,misanthropy,db8htlh,3,t5_2qtl0

No need to get too deep no need to get too close just put out feelers should I want to get that close to that person all the while grumbling at the idiots who seems to have a million friends and everybody likes them....Then I got married and found out why because other people and me function differently.  I only am friends with people I truly trust and even I cannot trust them most people are friends with people because they are RESOURCES.  So its all a political game.  My wife used to have lots of friends  most of them were fucking idiots and totally judgementall toward me in the beginning because I was not this shining socialite....like some Hollywood movie star I was real.The thing was when I was single I did not need ANYBODY!  Car battery died  Id walk to the parts shop and buy a new one and put it in myself.  Just got surgery  Id walk home from the hospital or get a cab if I really needed it.   It was nice to not feel the need to be nice to someone just because I need something form them.  I could be genuinely nice to them from the bottom of my heart  only to get stabbed in the back in return.So now I hate all people.  All the while I saw certain folks as friends near friends or acquaintances they just saw me as a resource like a stack of papers to be handed out or a basket of treats while I cared not what they offered me for I could take care of that myself.  And I was a LOT happier then.So now I grit my teeth and bear it for the sake of family all the while secretly watching for or cursing the next transgression to befall my situation.,misanthropy,dckb2i9,3,t5_2qtl0
