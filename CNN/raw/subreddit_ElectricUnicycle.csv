5443672,0,t1_ctwwx4c,Amazing got it with only  days delay. Definitely legit just bug them with messages if they dont hurry.Their support  does not work for shit! Upon receiving my tracking  it wasnt working. Called their shipping company they said the same I was about to call paypal and reverse it all. I think I actually started a dispute. I got my tracking it was the same code now it showed it was being shipped. Guess they just needed a day more or so to get it updates since I am a ton of hours away.But definately will buy from them especially after breaking mine. I was the street surfer with it. I went super fast. Had it for a month fell over  times learned tons of tricks within first  weeks. I met some others who said I have no clue how you managed to damage yours the mother board seems to be what took impact and Ive fallen a couple of times.I was reckless I loved it its amazing. Its like having a never ending orgasm to me. Maybe not exactly the same way but in terms of fulfillment and happiness. Thats what it brought to me. I met people with nine bots and they didnt seem the same. I am really social and I met tons of people because I roamed freely. Tons of contacts to buy I met a partner of Tri Star Productions amp Tri Star Products The movie production studio that shows the white Pegasus horse before it starts. He was directing this music video from some band called The Black Violin or some shit. I said hmm let me sway my way through here. I talked to the security they loved the ninebot and I talked to them about other things.And assistant came in and she loved it she said dude you have to come and show everyone dont worry come up you seem cool too.Everyone was friendly besides loving the ninebot they liked my ideas etc.. I told them I was thinking about becoming an official distributor. I met people and had right mind set for this. This machine became my addiction my lifestyle up until it broke and I was down.I met people in marketing people who are big sellers for real estate computer programmers and designers for marketing companies. So many and they gave me their business cards and Im like shit I know I need one every business seeking guy should. I have a lot more to offer as services than potentially ninebots. Ive met families before and during  of July. I made friends with these families cooked with them had beers its crazy. Really its crazy how much opportanties this machine plus my personality has brought. Have talked to so many girls and just to make it seem less geeky I would act like Im not acknowledging Im on it Im pretty confident without it but with this its a conversation starter.Thats basically it this machine is a fucking conversation starter. I love how everyone gets the wack  wheel side board crap but ninebot is nothing compared. I never got bored. Woke up  AM took shower ate loaded my bag with my computer got well dressed put on my shades and did around  miles a day.I was top one within  weeks on the Weekly Ninebot leader boards.    Miles I think it was in less than a week. !!! Number one and few days before my ninebot broke I seen this asian dude come online with his and was beating me. But for someone who only had  days to learn  weeks to feel like he can dominate it fall and do tricks and went where ever life took him instead of going to work or what ever.I did good. No one can take that away from me and I know Ill get another one soon. I know Ill be thankful when I am older for getting my self this at a young age at a time where not many have. And did it with a passion and met great people lots women good food and amazing experiences.Money should be spent on experiences.. This ninebot is not just a material object and its not a car. Its a never ending joy.,ElectricUnicycle,cw7hcdd,1,t5_334xq

11160409,0,t3_5z5hqo,I can only speak off my limited experience but the three Gotways Ive been around are tough bastards.  Me and my buddy take them up easy for a bicycle mountain bike trails.  And that means lots of drops and rough treatment.  Never had a single issue with them at all except my handle on my MCM.  And its more because its not integrated that it broke after lots of rough treatment.  It was not its fault for breaking with the hits it took.This leads me to my second point.  Whatever you get you WILL want an extending luggage style handle to be able to walk it around inside stores etc.  Integrated is far better wont break like mine did but as a modification like I got for my MCM works too.But it is all but mandatory to have that extending handle.  After I broke mine Totally my fault I didnt even want to use it until I got a new handle.  These things are heavy even the less large ones.  You are not going to want to carry it for long.As for the people who say you are going to scratch it up dont buy an expensive one first.   Screw that.  Buy the one you want now.  Scratches dont mean anything and become almost a badge of pride.  Sort of like how a dirty Jeep means you actually use it for more than carrying groceries.  You are going to scratch it.  Its going to happen.  Eventually you will learn to turn really sharp by rotating on a pedal touching the ground.  Even not falling off you will scratch up the pedals.The Gotways Ive been around have taken a hell of a beating going up and down offroad trails.  The minor drops you have from learning are nothing compared to that you wont break it unless you do something REALLY unluckystupid.And good luck!  Once you get the basics down look on facebook for local groups that have rides to join.  Lots of fun to ride in a small or large groups.,ElectricUnicycle,dex0qs8,2,t5_334xq
