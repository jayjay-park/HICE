3430996,0,t3_2vo2da,Hopefully this wont be considered offtopic. Im interested in an app that would assist in field checks of proper bike parking code enforcement. Having a good code is one thing but having it properly enforced is another. Lousy or missing bike parking can mean the theft of a bike or other bad experience that convinces someone that bike commuting isnt practical. When they give up thats the ball game  I did two field checks  amp  of new construction from the previous year in a city in the south sound. Results were abysmal despite the city having decent requirements for bike parking. Might this be more common than anyone imagines? The only way to know is to check but it would be great to have the data collected in a consistent fashion e.g. address photo GPS coords other relevant info. The results could be compiled in a database and a GIS web map created to allow convenient browsing of the data gathered. Some colorcoding andor scoring could help illustrate how well jurisdictions are doing in enforcing their code. Then comes analysis of where the failure in in the development process e.g. we need to train planning staff on bike parking requirements we need our Building Inspector checklist to be updated etc.Im not envisioning this as being a general purpose app like Find It Fix It but for specific field survey projects to ensure quality control. I do not know anything about software engineering so Im hoping this is all realistic. Thx.,hackthecommute,cpjcy8l,1,t5_36kzs
