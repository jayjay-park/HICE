22744,0,t1_cefzmm8,Ive thought over this quite a bit. Most religions are based on the same principles which are usually something like Be a pretty decent guy in this life and you will be rewarded whether it be with a serene afterlife or an improved reincarnation. We also have to take into account that the art of religion mainly centers around storytelling. Stories change as they are told which is only natural. The person who heard the story of the first religion altered it a bit to suit their tastes and that trend inevitably continued. People want to hear new and better stories so the story gets spiced up even more. Thats why religions become outdated or irrelevant. Christianity will probably come to a point where it is considered an archaic religion. More to the point if religion were true hopefully the god or gods in charge would be merciful enough to realize that humans following them or not for some of our sake kept to the basic principles of good ethics with the progression of time.,INTP,ceh0tub,1,t5_2qhvl

267829,0,t3_1x69sb,I see no reason to be against integrating technology into the human body regardless of the purpose to an extent anyway. If the intent is forced augmentation via government laws or to add weaponry to a individuals body then my answer would be no. If the purpose is for personal enhancement or for medical treatments then I have heard no convincing argument against doing such a thing. The biotechnology field is very likely to advance further as time progresses bringing with it progressions in genetic engineering that could be used to alter the genetic code in certain individuals in order to treat diseasesdisorders that are due to a clear genetic origin and biomedical engineering may even advance far enough to be used in scenarios such as replacing the innerworkings of the eye with new fully functional prosthetics to enable the blind to see. Such technologies and practices are likely still decades away but I would still love to see these things coming to fruition while I am still alive.I think I was ranting a little. To address your question of Would you want to be a cyborg? I would have to say that it is highly dependent on how effective the technology actually is at the time.

523948,0,t3_2035so,I have had the exact same difficulty with most MBTI tests. I usually get a result of INTP because I have a very small preference for P over J. However these tests are limited because they can only output a full type and do not fully account for independantly developed functions.It may help if you take a function test to see how your functions rate independantly. Examples can be found here and hereI tend to follow the basic INTP function order but I also have a relatively highly developed Ne which is the reason for my boarderline PJ results. Similarly you may find yourself with a relatively developed INTJorder function to explain the lack of a strong preference between P and J.,INTP,cfztu7z,2,t5_2qhvl
524073,0,t1_cfztcy9,More of a mindstatedimension and metaphorically but mostly yes. The problem is that most people talk about identity as if it were a single fixed location in that mindstatedimension whereas really theres enough variation even during a single day for an identity to wander around all over the place although still pretty close to that location. However the entire volume that it wanders around in even over the course of an entire life can still be considered the same identity the same person. You dont generally consider someone to be a different actual person because they grew up or took up a new sport or got a new favorite band or changed careers.Based on that Im wanting to say that theres a certain flexibility in identity. If a newly spawned copy of someone has a mindstate thats still within the boundaries of that flexibility they could probably be considered as part of an identitygroup and that should be taken into account when considering matters of identity which were previously easily resolvable due to the extreme distances between instances in mindspace.    Heres an interesting potential legal example to think about for instance A person commits a murder is caught and due to the laws in the relevant jurisdiction is put to death for the crime. It is then discovered that the murderer teleportcloned themselves immediately after the murder and the other of the two of them is still at large.Should the other version of themselves also be apprehended charged and convicted if one has already paid for the crime? What if the splitting into two versions happened immediately before the murder? What if there was no concrete evidence as to whether it had happened before or after and the remaining copy of the person wasnt telling or was sticking to a version of the story they believed would get them released?Heres a stickier version What if instances could be remerged with the single resulting instance remembering both histories? If a person split themselves with one version committing a crime and the other not and then remerged voluntarily would the resulting person be guilty? What if the merge was involuntary? Still guilty? What if the person claimed it was involuntary but there was no proof either way?What if remerge occurred automatically on the death of either of the two instances and the guilty instance killed themselves before they were caught? What if they were caught and put to death for the crime? Would the resulting involuntarily merged instance still be guilty?If so what if two instances of a person split years ago went on to live completely separate lives without ever seeing each other and then one of them committed the crime and subsequently died soon after?Legally then are two instances of a person considered the same legal identity? Does it depend on how similar they are to each other? Likewise is a merged person legally the same identity as both the previous instances or only if they merged voluntarily?,INTP,cfzucme,1,t5_2qhvl

561434,0,t3_20doxq,I recently went through almost exactly the same thing. Throughout my life Ive cried very rarely mostly just when freshly injured dumped or dealing with animals in pain up until I found out my dad has earlyonset alzheimers and he was forced to retire early. It took a year or so before the emotion built up enough to make me cry during which his mental condition declined quite a bit. Hes lost the ability to do most basic tasks unsupervised and sometimes he seems like a completely different person with a lot of aggression and anger built up inside. Crying about it for the first time felt like such a release and the clarity afterward helped me deal with a lot of emotion I had been repressing.Now crying for me is a little like a sex drive except theres no pleasure involved. Its just a physical thing that needs to happen to keep my brain chemicals in the right place. A few times a month usually not long after spending time with my parents I notice myself hiding from the outside world and getting really emotional about TV shows which tells me I have a bunch more grief knotted up inside so I need to cry. I cant always start crying but when I can the floodgates open and I sob into a pillow for  minutes. After I settle down and clean myself up I feel refreshed and relaxed and able to focus on other things. Its like waking up from a trance....actually its a lot like a sex drive.

595456,0,t3_20ydkc,Im more interested in political theory and philosophy than current events.  Sociopolitical matters are more complicated than what little consideration people give them before proclaiming a worldview.  It seems to me that ideologies tend to be inherited or mere extensions of ones personality and so many people put so much emotional stock in their beliefs that wellreasoned and openminded political discussion is a rarity.  It follows that I have some disdain for politics and dont really have much faith in democracy or any other political system since ultimately someone has to be in charge and there are very few who I would trust to be both moral and rational in their actions.  This doesnt necessarily lead to anarchy in any of its forms even though my disposition is to like the idea of anarchism or some form of libertarianism.  Technocracy and meritocracy are ideas that sound good to me if they seemed feasible and incorruptible which I cant fathom.  I can sympathize with all sorts of positions even extremely controversial ones.  I can simultaneously hold seemingly opposing views weighing the pros and cons in my head and doing research when I feel up to it.  But knowledge about politics branches off so much into philosophy history economics sociology psychology etc. that it will take a while before I know enough to be able to say what I believe is best and by then well all have been killed off by robots.,INTP,cg7ygzq,8,t5_2qhvl
597895,0,t1_cg85frw,I didnt say that libertarianism implied psychopathy. I said that psychopaths most of whom are aligned with something closely related to libertarianism are wrecking the place. Because in my view capitalism and the angloamerican empire as its champion is by far the worst offender at least since WWI. Im sure you dont agree and will take offence somehow but I feel being straightforward about what I believe is more important than being diplomatic.I am well aware of at least some of the arguments for libertarianism. I dont agree with them. The principle of personal freedom is attractive by itself but it should not be the only measure of whats good. Corporations are exploiting the world to the point of collapse. This might be contributing to a net gain in personal freedom but its not ecologically sustainable and its destroying culture. Capitalism is harvesting human sources of meaning for consumerist goals.Youre quick to judge me as uninformed and ignorant and yet lecture me that INTPs generally take pride in the fact that they can objectively play with an idea that they personally reject.

727604,0,t3_22dxuk,I finished building an amazing guitar. Lots of forum reading research and the like. Warmoth maple neck Duncan pickups reranch metal flake paint and for some reason I think I used nitrocellulose lacquer for the clear coat Im not sure on this now but iirc older guitars used this and the thought was as the coat ages it sounded better. The best part about the guitar is the set up. Superb intonation and the string height is perfect. It can easily ruin you from playing other guitars it plays so effortlessly.  Spent a lot of time measuring the string height adjusting the saddles truss rod and even filed the nut myself. Its provably worth little to nothing in value but the way it plays and sounds just impresses me. What did I think when it was finished?  Thats tough. When it was at the first stage of finished v. first time I could play it I was pretty happy but overly critical of the design choices I made. It was reworked more than a few times. Even changed out magnets in a pickup a few times tried my hand at wax potting the cover and all. When it got to where it is now where it will stay I was happy with all the things I had learned from other and from experience as well as the guitar itself.  Overall it felt rewarding. Like I could and did do something at a very high level. Not the hardest thing in the world but I learned every detail of something I knew nothing about before.

Right now at least in America most young people are sitting on college degrees lots and lots of debt and a minimumwage job or unemployed.  The market is not generating new labor due to heavy restrictions and regulations and the jobs that are available are largely taken by the older generations who are always more experienced.  This problem is worsening as more legislature is passed to keep younger competition out of the market and theres no end in sight.  What worked before is going to destroy your chances of success today and I dont know if theres any way to explain this to your parents.  You will need to figure that one out yourself Ive explained to my ISFJ mother already the condition of the market today she seems to understand.My advice if you havent already is to develop a marketable skill and look forward to freelancing especially if you can do this online so you can stay mobile.  Keep out of debt its hard enough without it.  Avoid the liberal arts like plague or develop them with free resources such as books or websites the market is not going to pay you for what you know anymore all that matters now is what you can do and how well youre doing it.  This knowledge is primarily gained through experience not study.

I just wanted to see if I could be myself be happy be normal feel settled and not trapped in the same space as another person. And I cant tell you how amazing and gratifying it was to find out that I totally could! Buuut then I wanted to break up and that was extremely difficult to navigate. Thankfully Im good at contingency planning and Im not one to dwell on the past or regret actions that were motivated by months of consideration so moving out and moving on was as easy as moving in. But my exboyfriend was very hurt by the whole situation and now months later I still feel horrible about the pain Im responsible for.Ultimately the joy joy! of realizing I was capable of cohabitation and partnership and happiness in a small space with another person outweighed the guilt of causing him pain and the trouble of moving out and the frustration of getting back out there all that stuff.

1336373,0,t1_cijwcg3,I think most people expect MBTI to act as a tool for categorizing people then they get upset when people dont fit those categories or act in ways that dont fit what their type says.

For example If I know that as an INTP Ill have trouble talking my ideas out Ill make sure to write them out beforehand. If I know public functions exhaust me as an Introvert I wont go partying the night before a meeting Ill make sure to get my energizing alone time. If I know that Im an Extroverted Thinking Judger Ill know to keep in mind other peoples feelings and to tone down the aggressiveness a bit. By becoming aware of those weak areas we can work to strengthen them.Of course there will be people who will use it to justify their poor choices and lack of discipline and MBTI does make it easy to do that with their claim that type is unchangeable.

1412500,0,t3_2a7nvj,Hi PuzFrom an MBTI perspective an ISFP would have dominant Introverted Feeling Fi a.k.a subjective ethics as opposed to an INTPs dominant Introverted Thinking subjective logic. In arguments an Fi user will likely have very little patience detaching themselves from the subject being argued may have a hard time not taking things personally and will very much likely not consider inquiring about the dictionary definition of the words presented in arguments since these are Ti traits  the very bottom unconscious function for IFPs meaning its the cognitive process they value least See this video for Fi vs Ti and overcoming communication barriers  So first step may be to communicate that when you speak in argument mode any tones that come off as aggressive are not intended to be personal or an attack on her integrity.  You may however be able to communicate an argument to her through objective logic a.k.a. Extraverted Thinking Te as it is a conscious function of hers  meaning they may be able to comprehend inarguably concrete facts. However it may be a stretch since it is still an inferior function for an IFP meaning it may be underdeveloped or have very little value to use it. It may also be an uncomfortable cognitive function for a Tidom user esp for an INTP but we do have the ability to use it. Also for arguments in general the person needs to be open to listening to an argument. Otherwise theres no actual grounds for an argument since the opposing party is not in a willing position to accept or reject an argument.Hope that helps.,INTP,citc3yn,1,t5_2qhvl

What I mean is that while we can establish that people have attitudes regarding ethics than not the same as saying that such attitudes can be shown to have validity. Sure in an evolutionary sense we have developed ethical attitudes but thats not the same as moral truths.gt Any significant correlation in those feelings is statistically enough to show that morality does indeed exist as a shared concept.I disagree.

If GG is who gamers are I dont think Im one of them.Seriously you cant even mention GG by name on Twitter without five or six folks chasing after you looking for a fight. The whole movement started when a female indie gamedevs exboyfriend decided to air his dirty laundry with her on the internet as far as I can tell in an attempt to turn chan on her as a form of revenge. Anita Sarkeesian has received death threats over her feminist criticisms of games and the female winner of the  Games Journalism Prize was harassed out of games journalism entirely by people acting in GGs name. And all this is only the tip of the iceberg.Whatever GG claims to be it looks to me like a platform for the harassment of women and their supporters in the games industry with the goal of silencing feminists and driving them out of the industry altogether where possible.

1964743,0,t3_2h5vuo,Okay so a lot of people tend to put themselves into boxes. MBTI is based off of some of Carl Jungs work. I highly recommend checking out Psychological Types by him. Skip the first  pages if you have to but theyre important too.Anyway we all have all of the functions. INTPs primarily use Introverted Thinking and their secondary function is Extraverted Intuition. INTPs favor these functions and tend to become one sided. You dont want to become one sided. At the very least I dont recommend it. According to Jung a major part of the individuation process psychological growth is integrating all of the functions into life.INTPs seem to abhor the thought of feeling based judgement but its crucial. When Feeling goes into the unconscious it comes under the influence of the shadow and unresolved complexes. This is particularly bad because one of the things the Feeling function does is add a value and tone emotional color to a particular idea or block of information. This value intensity determines what information is going to break the thresh hold of consciousness. For instance when one is angry it is easier to bring up memories that have a negativeangry feeling tone. One loses objectivity if one does not keep constant track of their Feelings.There is no solution without feeling Ive come to believe. Its simply a byproduct of our monkey origins. The Human Experience TM is stranger and fuller than I had originally ever imagined.I have a video on youtube where I talk about this. Message me if you want the link.

Theyre bizare as fuck and often with content that would probably traumatize me for the rest of my life if I actually experienced it for real.Ive also had multiple dreams of waking up so I basically dream that I wake up realize Im not awake and then dream waking up again.

It has no compounds that are physically addictive and you cant even become mentally addicted because you build up a tolerance incredibly quickly. Cant help you with your family or source of course but I think those are both hurdles you could overcome. You can always get somebody you trust to watch you and be your sitter or guide. They would be there to calm you down in the case of a bad trip or to stop you from doing anything rashdangerous.After this post and talking to some friends Ive decided to get some as soon as possible and just go for it. Probably around Thanksgiving. One of my friends has said hed guide me but in the spirit of being reckless I might forgo that altogether and just drop some at a party. If I knew how to find parties that is.Last winter I took a low dose of psilocybin and it was fine. I really enjoyed myself and had reduced anxiety in the following few weeks. But I cant really say there was anything groundbreaking. That could have been due to the low dose however. At one point I did feel myself almost have terrible anxiety in retrospect if it had gone further I probably would have had a bad trip. However I was able to visualize the anxiety as a physical object in my torso and wrap my breath around it. On the exhale I dragged the anxiety with it.

Whereas some kind of extrovert might simply react with mild offense in the situation you described and it would have been quickly smoothed over in the moment you held it in so as not to make anyone feel uncomfortable and then you probably stewed about it for a while and then you probably came off as bitter about the whole evening and your gf was mad because she enjoyed the evening and you were essentially saying in her mind the whole evening was bad because you were offended.  So she got mad because you were basically harshing her mellow or whatever. . You werent actually told your emotion was wrong here.  You were told your interpretation of the things that were said was wrong.  We and maybe not you or your gf either obviously cant know whether you or your gf is factually correct here but its at most one of you.

I cannot possibly stress that enough.. get.the.fuck.out.  Cant pay your student loan debt?  Fuck them too.  You said yourself you are poor you have no moral obgligation to pay multinationals out of your food money.  Eventually you will pay it off but for now fuck them.  Look at the way you write you dont realize it but the same thing that causes your depression your introspection.. also gives you a great gift and a selfaware intelligent person that is thriving is a gift to humanity.  That will be you.  There is some metaphor about rising from a fiery pit with a purified heart.  You are going through it you will come out of it and some day you will say to someone what I am saying to you.Seriously drop out of school.  My own articulated reason at the time was I dont awnt to be a code monkey.  You dont want to work for the man.  Fuck the man.  Some random webdev shop is not The Man.  The work might not be the most interesting but its better than funelling cash and debt into something making you miserable.  You might even like it when you realize how much value you are contributing.The most important thing you need to do is get your shit completely straight.Are you  Drinking?  Smoking weed?  Doing any other regular drugs?  Getting exercise?Basic shit.  Find one bad habit you have and quit it.  Make one new good habit.  gt My entire life is not working out. Everything I am comprised of simply is not working in my favor. I am so scared. My options are far and few.As an INTP I hope you can appreciate it when I say.. you are looking the whole problem wrong.  Your options are few and far between?  You are .  If  is the new   is the new .  You are barely notakid. You could right now walk out your house put out your thumb and wander.  Does that sound more appealing than making k a year writing javascript?  Then fucking go do that wander around for a couple years.. do whatever the hell you want.You are beholden to someone elses notions about you and you have to let it go.  You have to rise up and become selfactualized.  You have to gently if possible violently if necessary grab your metaphorical balls and find your own path.As a side note computer science is by far and away the best education you can get to make a good living not working for a corporation.  Like I said I dropped out of college at .  I worked random jobs depressed as all fuck line cook warehouse shelf stocking studied poker when it was blowing up there was a golden era like  where poker was really popular and people were really bad at it i did that for a living for years and eventually.. without planning stated writing code again.  Sometimes I like it more than others but I dont work for a corporation and cant really imaginet he situation where I would.  I built other peoples projects for a while and eventually started a software company.  I feel blessed.  I also feel I am blessed because I followed my heart ie my intuition at every turn.  Learn to trust your intuition.  I am not trying to make this post about me I just want to stress that I am taking  minutes to write thsi post because I could have written the OP myself  years ago Ill be  in a couple weeks.  Except I did drop out of college and I took shitty jobs and did whatever but I trusted my iNtuition I valued my own beliefs over anything and thats what eventually pulled me out of a nearly decade long slump.Im strong now and people once again begin to look up to me the way they did when I was your age the way that drove me insane but this time I am truly humble and I dont struggle as much with the egobattle.This is what I want you to doIf you take drugs of any sort not prescribed by a doctor for one month I want you to stop.  You can do whatever you want after but for once month live the life an an ascetic. Eat vegan with minimal bread No caffeinenicotinethcalcoholetc Meditate every day for at least  minutes sit in lotus breathe through your nose and fix your attention on the air moving in and out of your nostrils when your mind slips away to some thought just ignore the thought and gently come back to the nostrilsI promise no matter what.. you will be fine.  But if you pull your shit together and figure  out the difference between what you believe and what the world believes you will be fine a whole helluva lot faster.  ,INTP,cmquft3,12,t5_2qhvl

Most recently I blew off a few hundred bucks buying shit for my new puppy. Ive had her  months now and I dont feel quite the same urge to spoil her now. I think my spending habits depend on my moods. I rarely buy clothes. When I was in school my mom would take me out twice a year to replace my old clothes that stuff was important to her. When I graduated she stopped doing that for me and I just care enough to spend bucket loads of money on a new wardrobe every year.

2551829,0,t3_2oxgso,I found an INTJ and it seems to be going swimmingly. I can be very reserved with expressing my feelings verbally. I show my feelings through physical affection and doing things for my SO and he seems to be very similar. It can take me a few months before I fully warm up to the person enough to feel comfortable doing that. Id like to clarify here that theres a huge difference for me between physical relations and physical affection. Weve only ever discussed our feelings towards each other once and that was when I was having a miserable day shark week mood swings and he could sense I needed to hear it. Any other time wouldve resulted in a I know you egg. Why would you hang around with me otherwise?.What type of guys have you been dating for it to not work out? Im extremely introverted so I need to date an introvert too. My boyfriend and I can sit in the same room playing on our own computers in our own little worlds for hours and that counts as spending time together  and we enjoy it. Are you dating guys who might have a strong F preference? Maybe you would be better suited to someone with a strong T preference. It helps dating someone who can you say honest things to without the risk of them taking offence to it because youve hurt their feelings over something that makes no sense to a T to be upset over.TLDR  I manage my relationships fine by knowing myself and what I need out of a relationship. It took many bad relationships and failed attempts at dating to realise this though. Good luck with finding someone! ,INTP,cmrnt8j,6,t5_2qhvl

I had no identity there and no  reason to stay I wasnt part of anything. Though I suppose the way the moderators treated me by saying that its odd for someone that young to be complaining about the fundamental concepts making the foundation of a community helped increase my self esteem a little.Then I went on some game servers and again after some time I had no reason to stay so I simply left.

People who try to eliminate emotion from the equation usually resort to arbitrary goals like survival of the species not realizing that theres still no purely logical reason for it. When people talk about making decisions based on emotion they really mean making a shortsighted decision. Theres nothing wrong with making a decision based on emotion. For example if Im choosing between A and B and I ask myself which choice will make me happier? most would consider this a logical way to make a decision but it is still at its core based around emotion happier. The key is that you use logic in your decision making process to analyze the outcome of each choice and choose the best one. ,INTP,cnf56gz,1,t5_2qhvl

You will always have people that try to circumvent the system but as it is now I can sell a gun to a felon and just say I didnt know he was a felon and Im basically off the hook.

Pepper spray gernadesflashbangs are perfect for self defense and could give you the advantage in a defensive situation. Like say if you had  people breaking into your house. You know the layout but they dont. So you could hide quietly toss one out then deal with the threat while they are stunned. But on the other hand you couldnt throw a nonlethal grenade into a crowd and kill a bunch of people.As for the full auto vs semi I would say we are fine were we are. Fully automatic rifles are banned semi automatic are not It doesnt matter if you have a mm handgun or a mm semi AR. The fire rate reload time and stopping power are the same. The rifle mainly offers more stability and recoil reduction that allow for more consistent shooting. You dont need consistent shooting to walk into a croud and start blasting but you do need it to get the drop on someone breaking into your house. The thing that gets me about gun control is how many people think that criminals will follow laws. The fucking definition of a criminal is that they are someone who breaks laws. I dont care where you are in the world there is some way to get a gun illegally.

2905391,0,t1_cny823j,You can map parties onto this as big blobs that cover large swaths of ideological spectrum. Drawing lines like I did just shows you center mass of those blobs at the ends. The default horizontal setting of the progressiveconservative axis splits the ideological field into what Jefferson would call the two natural constitutions of men. You can find a basic LR duality in just about any political system because the same basic fault lines have tended to appear between people throughout history. Rome is a fun example.  You bring up a good point that issue positions vary by time place external pressures etc. That is exactly why the chart operates on values not concrete positions. I can more about what brings you to where you are rather then an exact opinion. I tend to favor gun rights from a liberal perspective in that its personal prerogative. A conservative will defend it because it is an established right. Two pretty individualist peple up at the top might fall on either side of the leftright split but be pretty united that the government can go stick its nose somewhere else about it. And to your last point the farther down the chart one goes the more govt. they want but where they move along other value lines with it it explains why they want govt. involvement. ,INTP,cnyckij,1,t5_2qhvl

They dont use Ti and even their dom function isnt Te its Ni. INFPs come rd in average IQ with a Te as their LAST function. That pretty much destroys this argument in my book.So the top  average IQs are TiNe NiTe and FiNe.There isnt much correlation to be made there. I wont go in depth as to MBTI and IQ relationships because you can easily find some online but just keep in mind INFPs are rd highest average and you could be the type with the lowest average IQ and still be a damn genius. And indeed you can be an INTP and be stupid or average too.I believe there is a hard distinction INTPs dont even have Fi while INFPs are Fi doms. INFPs dont even have Ti while INTPs have it as dom. We both connect on the INXP and the Ne though I can definitely goof around and talk deep theory with an INFP for hours and hours but the INFP will bring a different perspective to the table because hisher Ne is tainted by the Fi while mine is tainted by the Ti.So the Ne which use is to expand and create ideas will be used differently Ill thouroughly analyze each idea my Ne blurts out the INFP will review each idea according to his values.Its pretty hard to explain if you can summarize yourself I might be able to help you figure your type out I think the two types are easy to mistype yourself as but they do have big differences.,INTP,co9hyn6,2,t5_2qhvl

It actually started because my INTP power to take absolutely no offense in selfcriticism shut down a bully within a week and was widely perceived as attractive confidence rather than abnormal objectivity. AnywayLove is...strange. I think you can only effectively describe and pinpoint it in hindsight the bias is far too strong when you are under its influence. Forget all popularized notions of the heart you feel no change there. In my experience the biggest definite characteristic seems to be a desire to put them above yourself from simple things like giving them your coat despite being cold yourself to big things like a will to experience personal harm to ensure their safety. Basically it fucks with the selfpreservation instinct at any cost. It baffles me how we got this far with a trait to make us willingly harm ourselves but were here and it must be working somehow. Their happiness is extremely important to you.Another big indication is finding yourself thinking about that person and wanting to see them far more than is normal. I would say reasonable but it would start to seem very reasonable to you in the situation to obsess a bit so normal should suffice. The point is you think about them more than is average for you and being around them is abnormally good.

Emotional landmines are a term alot of people use to compare offending a random value they hold to stepping on a hidden land mine and the emotional explosion youll get from it. As I said its usually a delayed reaction.

3542567,0,t3_30sk3v,All in all I think I have a significant advantage over a lot of INTPs people because my adult life has literally been dedicated both academically and professionally to being a less awkward person.I can pinpoint the moment I stopped being awkward when I realized I knew what I was talking about and someone wanted to hire me because I knew what I was talking about. I had studied professionalrhetorical writing and wanted to teach college writing. For one I moved into the realm of expert in my field. The confidence that comes from this is extraordinary. You know all that emotional or dumb petty crap people used to come to you or someone else about you couldnt help? Well now people come to me to solve problems and get advice. And then they will do it. They trust your brain and your expertise usually. This is a tangible way I as an INTP gets something I think a lot of us think we deserve respect. My motivation to get my dream job made me buck up. I hate that that is such a cliche but when I first got that call to interview I knew I wasnt going to let some awkwardness stop it from happening. Also knowing that to keep that job I had to be a clear and adaptable speaker in order to teach effectively. Furthermore students had to like me. This was also motivation but it was also simply a logical calculation I need to learn to be funny and engaging in order to keep my students listening and participating. If they are doing that they are getting something out of the class and writing good reviews. So in short dedication motivation experience and respect led me to being less awkward both socially and professionally. Many of you might be reading this looking at the word motivation as if it is some other language but motivation isnt an INTP problem its a cultural problem. What happens when you tell a whole generation of people they can do anything they want while simultaneously also warning them of the pitfalls of particular fieldscareers? You get a bunch of people who have no clue what they want to do and are so mortified at the thought of commitment andor making the wrong decision that they just choose to never make one.

Sociopathy is a lot more nuanced than you seem to want to make it out to be and comparisons like yours tend to have accuracy issues. Try hitting up google scholar for some more information on the topic but realize that selfdiagnosis in this matter is an extremely foolish endeavor. It takes people people better educated than yourself on the matter to diagnose such a thing let alone fully understand it.You also need to understand that mental illness is not as cut and dry as These are the symptoms this is the problem. A lot of mental disorders like but not in any way limited to sociopathy exist in a spectrum of symptoms and behavioral disorders.If you really believe that you have symptoms that might point to sociopathy I recommend you speak to a qualified psychologist. Dont tell them your suspicions dont seed their mind with your ad hoc diagnosis. Just go in and speak to them and let them use their experience and education to help you better understand yourself.If youre diagnosed from there there are no doubt a wealth of resources in most developed nations that will help you manage your symptoms.

3705868,0,t1_cqekgde,Im not the person youre replying to but wanted to give my opinion on the matter.gtDo you think that having men pop out babies is progress?There are many biological males who are in relationships and possibly are only able to have relationships with people who are not biological females. Some of them may want to have children with their partners as is the right of every malefemale couple but do not have the freedom to do so because it is not a biological or technological possibility.Progress is an ambiguous term but I think people basically seem to use in order to reflect a general movement towards a greater realisation of their values. If you value freedom in the sense of letting people do what they want or at least giving them more options it makes sense to consider the possibility of having men pop out babies to be progress. If you dont value freedom or at least if you oppose that particular freedom for some reason I suppose you wouldnt consider it to be progress by that definition.gtDo you think that by not having kids yourself and ending your genetic line is somehow progressive?To use the same definition of progress again and to assume that a movement towards greater individual freedom is considered progress then allowing people the freedom to choose not to have children is progressive.The individual act of not having children is not inherently progressive but allowing people the freedom of choice to perform that act would appear to be progressive.,INTP,cqeozvo,8,t5_2qhvl

Chances are that if you dont fit in the system its probably due to a personality disorder or that you fluctuate along the fifth personality trait enough to the point where one type doesnt completely describe you.But the study I linked reveals that MBTI does correlate with  of the Big  traits. Granted that theres a missing th and that MBTI is dichotomies or rather function order than a gradient like big  means that therell be some differences between people of the same type.This is a well known flaw in the system. And yes naturally we shouldnt rely on it for studies on personality which is why we dont. We use it as a social mechanism for talking about personality. Unless youd like to provide another system? Big  is more accurate but its a lot harder to push it into popular conversation. It also removes a lot of the cliques that happen which make it stick more. Its why literally everyone talks about what Harry Potter house they are in or what TV show character suits them best. Its because its a clear divider and gives plenty of talking points.Which I personally think is necessary for anything to stick in the publics eye. MBTI does this fabulously despite not having a complete picture of personality.So we can account for some fluctuations sure. But that doesnt mean that as a general whole its a solid system at least for communication about personality.gtAgreed for a  type system I think it does a very good job to be honest.Yup. I think personally Id boost it up to  types to include the fifth Big  trait. But that might cause problems in terms of getting it to stick socially.Either way any sort of MBTI has no basis in reality its a stupid system and we shouldnt talk as if it were fact is pretty off.

3846418,0,t1_cquq4yq,gtthanks to natural selection within the human race in various geographic areas we get a range of phenotypic expressiongtGreat you agree with me race is real! What I dont understand is why you say that but then say race doesnt exist when saying the above is mutually exclusive with that.No I do not agree with you that race is real. Phenotypic variation as a result of natural selection doesnt equate to discrete qualities through with we can taxonomically classify subspecies. Shall we talk about hair color eye color height etc again...? You are failing to recognize that natural selection leads simply to variation not necessarily different species or subspecies and that variation for its sake alone is not enough to create new taxonomic classifications. So no what Ive said about phenotype particularly continuous variation is not mutually exclusive with saying race is not real. Rather everything Ive said is mutually inclusive.gtBecause I dont and most of those who acknowledge that race actually exists dont stop thereMy point was why dont we create race distinctions based on other phenotypic continuous variation? Why is skin color such a strong defining factor in the equation when its a continuous nondiscrete trait?gtYou are contradicting yourself again! They are discrete classifications!I never said they were discrete classifications so no I wasnt contradicting myself. Tell me how they are discrete? Tell me how you can have discrete classifications on something that exhibits continuous variation?gtThey didnt fail racist eugenicists and then ideological reaction to it interfered when entirely reasonable science could have done in the area.They did fail but youre right eugenics didnt help.gtBy even your own logic and what you admitted above and cant possibly be true and absurd.No! Youre failing to understand the difference between discrete and continuous variation.gtbiological fact caused by natural selection regarding race.Science disagrees. As I said its a social concept.gtIt hasnt failed it just that any enquiry into the issue has been branded as racist since the holocaust for irrational political reasons. Our attempts at classifying race have gone back in the very least this is being incredibly conservative  years. Race classifications based in scientific validation were being attempted before we had any modern understanding of natural selection and evolution  its no wonder we have them so stuck in our head. Even the initial experts in taxonomy noted that their race classifications werent discrete which goes against the definition of taxonomic groups. First again understanding that race is historically a synonym for subspecies there are no taxonomically discrete races aka subspecies within Homo spaiens.I can see how this discussion may be confusing especially when we grow up with these preconceived ideas of race as I said to you in another conversation thread its difficult to challenge our preconceptions but you need to take a closer look at the things I say.So first Ill ask you how would you define human races or subspecies? Black caucasian asian hispanic? Are there more? Less? What are the defining characteristics between these races? Skin color? Body and or facial features? Are these skin colors andor bodyfacial features discrete or unique to these races as youve defined them? Do not other people in other races as youve defined them have any of the same features or coloration? You brought up sickle cell anemia in African populations  do other races not have the capability to have sickle cell anemia? You brought up lactose intolerance in Asian populations  do other races not have the capability to be lactose intolerant? Why do you not define certain people into races by more than the particular skin colors and characteristics that we stereotype with race  so why not make race distinctions also based on hair color eye color height face shape and body shape  all other phenotypic and genetic variation? Why dont those make the cut as races seriously I want you to think about why you wouldnt consider those and other forms of phenotypic variation as different races? Ill tell you why at the risk of sounding like a broken record  these are not taxonomically discrete distinctions unique to certain races.There is more phenotypic variation within races than there is between races you were talking about taking the average of skin colors in different geographic localities  that shouldnt be necessary to identify discrete taxonomic classification. There are also no distinct genetic boundaries that could be assigned to race. Its not your fault that you didnt know this but you are rejecting my statements when they are anthropological fact. Anthropologists widely agree there is no biological scientific race distinction amongst Homo sapiens. You arent going to like this metaphor. What would you say if someone denied global warming? Or if someone said vaccines cause autism? Would you tell them that despite their suspension of belief scientists widely agree about the scientific validity or invalidity of the topic? Im saying the same to you. You are akin to those who refute global warming. I figure thats going to make you angry but Im not saying it to call you anything negative merely to show you from an outside perspective how your preconceptions and personal ideation is incorrect in the face of scientific consensus.I have few sources I can direct you to as a lot of this is learned in various classes in university but I do have a handful of book sources including a textbook if you want some sort of bibliography  I dont know that youll be able to find any or many of these book sources online. I would suggest looking into it by maybe emailing a professor at a local university or looking into some books at a local library but since youve come to your own conclusion in your own mind you arent likely to look much into it right? Im being kind of facetious with that but I also think that point is important  I would suggest the use of the wonderful resource of other people around you rather than depending on mostly yourself to have the correct answers.Edit This last part in the parentheses relies a lot on my understanding of you from our other comment chain. I should have left that out because it relies on my assumption that you are getting your own bases for race justification from yourself which isnt necessarily true. I dont apologize for my analogy to other issues like global warming and vaccinations though again those arent meant to call you out as stupid or anything negative  simply an analogy as I do think those are a good way to try to reframe your understanding of our conversation but I do apologize for that last part in parenthesis. I had assumed that if you were looking very hard into this at other sources you would better understand what Im trying to tell you about race but I think Im assuming too much with that.,INTP,cquq539,1,t5_2qhvl

Nope.I do strongly believe that there isnt a grand scheme or design to life or reality we all experience it for a brief moment and then are gone the foot prints we leave will one day be lost in the sands of time be they social impacts concepts genetic legacies or ideas.

3895065,0,t1_cr05nd7,I believe the origins are around coming up with relevant information.  When you are talking about something you know better than the audience it is quite easy to assume all the information you have is useful.  When you are talking about something you know equally or less then it becomes difficult to pick those morsels of relevant information.  Basically I am trying to filter information to be relevant this is easy when your audience knows nothing hard when youre not sure.  Doing this onspot can be difficult and I end up not being able to get a clear path.  Even once a path is chosen it is filled with gaps of is this relevant or not.. This can be difficult with audiences that know things since you arent sure how much detail to go into do i start at square  or  or do i start at  and skip  ..continued permutations..Of course there is also the confidence issues that come with talking about something we arent sure we know all the answers to especially concepts that havent been correctly folded into our world matrix yet.I find with the right conditions I can speak quite well with little preparedness.

The unfortunate thing is faith based beliefs are not predicated upon reason and logic but rather on rationale grounded in emotions and feelings so attempting to appeal using the former will often fall flat.  Things like evidence and facts are irrelevant if they just have faith.  Many religions are constructed to ward off the very thing we are trying to appeal with there are safeguards to shut down thinking processes if it disagrees or contradicts itself.Having once been deeply entrenched in a fundamental belief I can understand why someone believes and thinks how they do it was only possible because I was indoctrinated from birth into the faith but once I began thinking for myself and only accepting what makes sense to me there is no way I could ever deceive myself into believing anything not grounded in reality or at least within the realm of plausibility.

3962450,0,t3_35tlfv,Go on meetup.com if you live in a city theres a good chance there will be a reasonable selection on there and you can find people who are meeting up specifically to share a common interest or check out something that seems interesting. Since everyone is new at some point and the point is to meet and possibly make new friends it shouldnt be too weird to not know anyone there yet and if you dont enjoy it you dont have to go back. Another idea is to spend some time volunteering somewhere. Animal shelter might be a good one if you like animals. Itll get you out of the house interacting with some people and generally feel cool to be giving back positively to the world in some form. And a final one might be to join a group therapy group. I had to do group therapy once and at first I thought it would be terrible but it turned out to be a really positive experience.

Best thing I found to break out is to get on a schedule wake up at the same time and start a morning routine that involves going outside.  I think a lot of depression comes from just being indoors all day going from one room to the next of all artificial closequarter scenery... just boxes decorated differently. The outside is where humans are made to be and walking is what humans are made to do  start with that in the morning and a decent breakfast and it sets the tone of accomplishment for the rest of the day.You can surely make a budget although it may not be as challenging as differential equations  the key is to start give it a shot make an imperfect budget... you could even make a budget by just making a trend of where all of your money goes currently.  You could build a budget from the last  months of all of your financial activity...Dave Ramsey might be a decent place to start  he has a decent budget system for the people trying to make sense of their finances.

Luckily they were found and freed.Oh but that didnt receive even close to the same amount attention as a hate crime in a religious ceremony now did it. Perhaps Im just desensitized to it.

I hate feeling rushed or pressured. So I was kinda glad yet also annoyed when he pushed me a little by asking multiple times in the same day if Id decided eventually prompting me to blurt out Yes! which had been my feeling all along.

This sounds funny but I teach young children and I started doing this for myself First label your emotion. You might be dissapointed frustrated maybe you feel some kind of loss... then let yourself feel it. Its ok to feel the way you do. Emotions are not logical. Next what is an appropriate action to help you release process this emotion? This can be anything really. For children they can choose to do something quiet by themselves talk to a friend or punch a pillow lol. But we as adults have more complicated options. Me? I listen to something fast and run!

4393682,0,t1_cskjqt2,Yeah I never much liked the utilitarian model either By and large feeling like I know the essence of what you mean I like your theory as well as any other! I do feel like there are elements that are incomplete though... Potential is a very loaded word. What exactly do you mean by it? Potential actions? If so how do you measure one act against another including very different acts as well as enumerating and valuing variations of a single act? For instance the potential to dye ones hair orange to build a shed in their backyard to legally enter a polyamorous relationship... Are we attempting to maximize all possible actions counting each of these as equal at least on the first count?Or perhaps the value of each of these actions would depend on the expected consequence of potential following... so would dying ones hair have a neutral value it neither limits nor expands whereas entering into relationships would necessarily have value because a relationship can evolve in any number of ways? ...And then if so this would certainly not depend on the quality of a relationship right? After all a whole host of relationshipspecific actions are opened up by entering into that kind of commitment. Also variations  torturing someone beating them up killing them  do these count separately or are categories of actions counted as a whole? You mentioned paths contracting into eventual destruction  in this model I can only suppose you mean the destruction of possible actions e.g. due to mass genocide or death? But creative varied progressive creative technological means of control and exploitation could still allow for much nuance and potential even if it is not what we would traditionally regard as moral.gtLawlessness would discourage large scale advanced team work as the entities that were previously concerned with the edges of technological advancement are now once again concerned with basic security.But that would not be a problem right? What is there to value advanced team work in the service of technology versus advanced teamwork in the service of power profit etc.? In a world without laws I would propose that security is anything but basic. Lawlessness would open up all sorts of potential for interpersonal acts  forming alliances bargaining and extorting others betraying and blackmailing threats and leadership and change... There is a lot of room for action in a chaotic world compared to the relatively more limited range of crimes and hierarchies available to us in current society.I feel like value judgments are being smuggled in where the invention of robots is somehow being more valued than other potential acts such as murder torture kidnapping rape incest  if we are maximizing the potential for other actions with no other criteria then wouldnt chaos be preferred? Or is novelty a key piece of this? Though of course that could rapidly devolve as well. And when it comes to actions opening up paths of development or action can you define a path for me? For instance with Game of Thrones  without spoiling anything you cant have gotten this far on the internet without knowing that deaths are a frequent occurrence. Many times though even though they are mourned they take what seems like a clear path of development and throw it into the winds again leaving much more potential for the story to go in many different ways. Would this be the kind of expansion of potential you speak of? I think this theory is interesting but likely needs more work on what limiting and expanding means... It seems like maybe by potential you mean something like progress? But then the idea of what makes progress versus regress invites another set of value judgments...That said good on you for putting a theory out there! It is far easier to try and poke holes in something than to build it and I cant help but compulsively try to poke holes. And this is a casual internet discussion not a formal dissertation on the theory  I find myself feeling like this is the kind of theory that requires a reasonable person reading it because then theyll know what you mean and the appropriate value judgments and contexts will be evoked  critique seems to me just to be the most unreasonable and foul sort determined to misunderstand. In an Ethics class I passionately proposed a contractarian model of ethics to my philosophy instructor feeling quite like Id solved ethics... and basically got my ass handed back to me in the same manner.

Over  hours into the project now and its only now nearing Alpha state. Game creation is not something talented individuals will readily help you with and expect zero compensation.The only hope you will have is picking up extreme amateurs and if you lack project management skills andor fundinfg it will more than likely never be completed.If you are interested in doing it the hard way and therefore the proper way start learning to code.

4733018,0,t3_3fqm1p,I have smoked weed every day for the last year. This is not how weed is meant to be used. It allows all the bad things about weed to compile and outweigh the good. Im currently on day  of not smoking. The goal is to go the whole moth of august without smoking at all and I think Ill make it just fine. If smoked like I did it can become addictive. I am going through some withdrawal but not enough that I would bring it up to somebody who is trying to kick a real drug. Im  for weed. Im just a dumb ass and took a good thing to far. So the good. If you take it every once and a while couple times a week maybe  you are going to have a blast and eat the house out. Laughter will come easy and creativity does get a boost. I have been messing around with my guitar for years but over the last year I have broken more personal barriers and become more fluid in my playing  then the last  years combined. It will put you in t ouch with your emotions in a way you have never known. Many of the over analytical problems you see posted here will no longer concern you. I feel like it really balanced me out as a emotional human being. Sex is amazing high assuming the other person is high too. Its a great emotional and creative tool. Its also really relaxing.  The bad.  If you smoke it every day your thoughts will slow down. Eventually you will find yourself grabbing for data in your mind you know is there but it will not come. You will go deep into your own mind and if your like me stick around in there for a few months. Soon you realize that your not going out and doing things anymore. It used to be that weed made hiking so cool but now your happy just to smoke a bowl and chill at home and that the things you used to love doing high have gone and now your just high. Days get really short. You start to wonder how people wake up and do more than  three things a day. In the end though I think weed used properly and not like my dumb ass is an amazing thing. I have tried mushrooms once and that is the closest I have ever come to a religious experience. On the path to self actualization its what I would describe as a peek experience. I would have to write twice a much to even begin to convey the impact it had on my life and that was just from one experience. I would say it solidified the emergence of my emotional self. Other than that I have  taken Adderall to crank out massive loads of work. I used to take it study study study and then once I had it smoke up to play in what the idea in a different head space. Weed allows your mind to w o under and make great connections however the intense focus of Adderall provides a very linear though process. Be safe do your homework on it and make sure someone is there you trust in a safe environment for your  first time with any drug. And make sure you know what your smoking. Sativa is a lighter green the will really bring out the creativity. Indica is darker green and your going to find yourself sitting on a couch unable to move really really relaked. The difference is in the THC and CBD distribution. Hope this helps and have fun.,INTP,ctr50nn,2,t5_2qhvl

4739386,0,t1_ctrwy69,Yes Im an INTP.Its not fair but its trueI am very very picky when it comes to people. And I dont think Ive ever truly trusted anyone to be honest...Im always prepared for the worsecase scenario. I just learned through life experiences that displays of emotion vulnerability and weakness. Not saying its right but Im just hardwired that way. There was a saying I heard at one point about how a strong man is one who is able to cry. I agree with that sentiment.But Im a loyal person hell if I was a dog Id be a goddamn German shepherd. When I decide Im attracted to someone which RARELY happens and the feelings are reciprocated and there is potential then Im allin. I view relationships as an opportunity for personal growth and I expect the same from my partner. Cheating is out of the question. And so is flirting. Not that I know how to flirt anyway. Its costly for me to be emotionally invested in someone and I invest cautiously yet in concentrated quantities. So yes if betrayed Ill feel deeply wounded and quite shaken because Ill start to question my own competence in terms of my intuition and judgment. ,INTP,ctrxzhd,1,t5_2qhvl
4743049,0,t3_3edr8x,Hah! Its too bad virtually all therapists are incapable ofselfreflection and introspection so they cant even conceive of amind capable of it isnt it? Making their advice totally useless toyou.Those same deficient minds came up with CBT cognitive behaviortherapy which boils down to think positive and brute force yourthoughts into a happy state. I fucking hate that which is why Iadvocate COMs  convincing objective metrics.You feel you cant trust people? Readily solved! Create a COM oftrustworthiness what makes a person trustworthy ... to you. And thenset out to objectively measure how trustworthy they are. If theyarent keep distant from them. If you can trust them to fuck thingsup then drop kick them into a black hole.I do happen to have a COM of trustworthiness its KVC.KnowledgeValueCommitment. The Knowledge you have oftheircore values and thus your mutual core value compatibility byvaluating each of their core values by all of yours. The value THEYplace on you and your projects because if they dont value you anddont value anything youre doing theyre going to be indifferent toyou. And finally the commitment they have to yourself or projects youapprove of.If someone wants to have a relationship with you but the KVC is poorthen thats easily fixed ... use the COM as a guide for what things towork on and fix. But beware that once you actually KNOW their corevalues fully have full Knowledge then deep incompatibility is justterminal and even moderate incompatibility is terminal for arelationship.A relationship prospect should have a mutual CVC of one or fewer sand several s even a single  something you feel abstractlymurderous about is fatal and s are going to be annoying. These aremeasures on a standard  point scale where  is jubilation and  ismurderous and measured over the other persons entire  core valueset.It also helps to reliably personality type people. You should knowthat I have seen at least two narcissists on the INTP forum at leastone crowing about how INTP he is. So maybe you should move on to apersonality theory that isnt totally fucking broken and that actuallyacknowledges psychopath as a personality type to stay the fuck awayfrom.In my personality theory you should stay away from everyone who isntpersonality types   or  you are  for romantic prospects andprobably only accept type  for business prospects. Type  is definedby corruption so if you want someone wholl cut corners and takebribes or become a corporate whore theyre your woman. Type  willgrate on your nerves being so far from yours.

When I got back they were about to start the animation I decided to take on three shots I started animating one of the shots and then my perfectionism kicked in and I spent  days finishing the shot I only finished it today which was when the film was supposed to be out so weve had to push the release back a day my shot was the last in by a long way.Edit tldr We were making a film and the one shot I was animating was the last in and I made the release get delayed.Edit  Wrong link,INTP,cujp3rr,1,t5_2qhvl

They show what youre curious and thinking about.

Unless its a matter of survival I doubt many INTPs will be compelled to reconsider everything they do and have done laid out on the table...but I think its a great way for us to work and understand patterns in our creations and finish things.

5139974,0,t1_cv5ivsg,It is because of the burden of the environment that you grew up in. There are external social pressures that you had to deal with different from all others. Some had an easier time due to proper role model guidance. Unfortunately it is something the majority of humanity doesnt receive. And so we are lost. Some turn to drugs some turn to sex some turn to any sort of validation that they can get. But us the INTP we understand there is more value then the superficial. There is an emptiness. that probably wont ever be filled and it is something we cannot ever know unless we travel the lifelong path to understand all things. This I believe is called wisdom.  Do not be tied to labels do not be tied to categories. Only understand that everything changes always. when you are going thought hard times times of self doubt times of self destruction and hopelessness believe that this will eventually change. All things change. It is the nature of the atom to decay change. Emotions are like passing storms. Frightful when seen on the horizon unbearable when caught up in them but let the peace permeate when they pass. Find the joy in the reinvigoration that you have survived.

By simply changing your vocabulary from I dont like Arab people to I dont like Arab customs you have just made yourself not racist. Furthermore you are actually focusing on the thing you dont like. Arab people arent the problem here. You even said yourself you have Arab friends. I understand your frustration. Multiculturalism is never implemented correctly so you get sections of society that are completely separate from eachother coexisting and never integrating. This causes an us and them mentality which then fuels the experiences you are having. As a comment said below this is simple tribal evolution. I dont know why so little effort is put into solving this as sometimes it as simple as enforcing language learning of the immigrants.I challenge you to stop blaming the immigrants and start blaming the system that has not integrated them well.

5285221,0,t3_3nddsz,I didnt lose my virginity until I was  and in college. I was in college but none of the girls I slept with or dated went to the same school as me. MySpace was popular then and Facebook was just starting to pick up so I used both of those sites to meet girls throughout college as I was still either too shy or just not very good at meeting girls in person. Had my first real girlfriend my senior year of college. Dated for almost a year. Met her on MySpace. She wasnt in school. She was basically an unemployed high school dropout who was a bit crazy. But she was attractive. After we broke up I didnt date anybody else for probably about a year and half but I would still sleep with her once every few months.Then I somehow woundup reconnecting with a girl who went to high school with me for only one year only Freshman year then she transferred to another school over Facebook  and we started dating and got pretty serious pretty quickly. That relationship got serious quickly but also ended fairly quickly as well  it lasted in total about  months. After her and I broke up I was in my mids had gained some weight and generally wasnt very happy with my love lifesex life. The general cause of dismay was that there were always girls I knew through school work social circle whatever who I liked or had crushes on who I knew also liked me but I always blew it with those girls. And all of the girls I dated were just girls I met online MySpace Facebook and at this point  also a bit on OKCupid. But I never actually liked most of the girls online. And was disappointed in myself for not being able to meet girls in person or take things further with girls who I already knew in person.So at that point I started to study game pick up theory etc and really try to learn about women how to meet women how to seduce women etc. I did that for about  years and had a lot of fun met a lot of women had my first one night stand ever  then had a dozen more of them dated a few girls off and on had a few hardcore flings etc. And coming out of that I wound up getting into a serious relationship with girl I met one night. A beautiful girl who was still in college she was in a sorority and was a double major and really active in her church and a lot of different things we fell in love hard and she really taught me how to be in a relationship and what it means to have someone else in your life as a companion. After a year things soured and we broke up. It was a pretty emotional breakup. I was back in grad school at the time and a few months later I met a gorgeous girl at school who I started to have a crush on  we wound up hooking up. Things moved fast and we moved in together travelled the world together. It was a beautiful experience. But after about a year we broke up.Then there was a girl who I was working with who was also going to grad school who I had a crush on even when I was dating my ex I had a crush on this girl  but I didnt act on it then! but her and I wound up hooking up... and weve been together for  years now. Its still going well. All that to say in summaryI lost my virginity at  later than pretty much all of my friends and still really didnt have a lot of success with women until my mids but eventually I mustve figured something out because for the past  years Ive been in  serious relationships with  beautiful and amazing women who have all loved me deeply been real companions to me and added to my life in tremendous ways. I can honestly say I still love all  of them and see all  of them as really being people who added tremendous value to my life and helped me become who I am today. ,INTP,cvn8ysx,2,t5_2qhvl

When I was younger I wasnt ready for a relationship because I had other things going on in my life and being in a relationship would have been greatly impractical.  The girl was attractive but very shy and liked me a lot.  I was physically attractive but I didnt feel any gut feeling similar to what you said you currently arent feeling.  On paper the relationship would have been great but I didnt go through with it because I just wasnt feeling it I didnt know if I really even liked her.  And I also wasnt ready for a relationship.  Looking back I wish I went for it because she liked me for  years and I didnt even really give her a chance.  Now she is in a relationship with someone else and I am happy for her and have no regrets on the situation but I still wonder how it would have gone if I went for it.  I think if I would have spent more time with her I would have developed feelings for her.  I think that because she approached me about it I had a resistance to the relationship because she was trying to influence my emotions towards her.

Ive noticed Im nowhere near as bold as some of my friends but that could also be because Im not instantly attracted to any hot girl and rather get to be friends with them instead. Even in my first relationship I as the guy didnt make the first move and I didnt believe I was attracted to her until after she confessed to me lol high school days. Now that I read what Booty wrote I seemed to have gained a deeper understanding of my feelings and why Im still single. And yea I seem to only get along well with females who have a similar personality to me  and as an INTP that greatly diminishes the amount of potential partners already.

Thats all there was to it. Anyone who does well at trivia could have gone through my grade school trajectory with similar marks. Im thinking about it now and I honestly cant remember being challenged by anything up until my midteens.I wasnt formally penalized for not giving a shit about the hard work everyone thought I had to do  but there were always comments on the report card about being an exceptionally bright student but one that could use more discipline. I hate math too. But I hate math like I hate sudoku puzzles. Unless I see a desirable outcome in solving it any math problem is just a frustrating and timewasting puzzle on a piece of paper. And I had to solve thousands of math problems in school for the sole purpose of getting that extra grade point. Math guys and gals I know. I know. It can be useful. Im just not into math.I got along with everyone but I wasnt popular in the traditional sense which is being popular for the sake of being popular. I had interests and that allowed me to interact with kids in sports music science languages politics. I dont think I bonded with any of them  but approaching them for something no problem. They either respected me or were intimidated ... maybe by my academic success. And thats some comedy right? Ironic almost.

I didnt use much paid software anyways besides World of Warcraft which ran fine using Wine in Linux.  Over time I found more and more Windows programs that could not be run reliably using wine so I got a new computer with Windows  installed in .  I still dual booted it with Linux anyways because there were a couple of programs that only ran in Linux including the MP player I was using at the time.Nowadays I mainly use Windows but I still dual boot with Linux.  One of the features of Linux that I wish Windows would adopt would be to streamline the installation and upgrades of programs using a package manager.  My Android phone upgrades all of its apps automatically but Windows would always nag for you to download an update for its programs and often you have to manually uninstall that program and reinstall it just to get an update whereas Linux as well as Android and Macs can update your apps in the background.,INTP,cyhwkrp,1,t5_2qhvl

6138084,0,t3_3zisdf,Ive been going to concerts since I was  years old Im  and have been going to raves Electric Daisy Carnival almost every year and a handful of others since . Festivals and concerts are amazing and something I like to do at least  times a year. Clubs are not fun at all to me at all. The most grating thing to me is the music. I LOVE loud music to a fault but if I didnt choose the music of I have to hear people constantly trying to talk over it it ruins the music for me. Bars are not fun because people are tryhards and it makes me uncomfortable. Also the price of drinks is stupid high but I pregame if I absolutely have to go. Concerts are used for me to expel a lot of emotional buildup and release a shitcrazy amount of energy. I prefer to go to concerts alone unless the person Im going with enjoys the musicband as much as I do. Going with someone who doest like the music just makes the experience forced and awkward. Festivals are one of the best things to exist on this earth imo. ,INTP,cync3f1,2,t5_2qhvl

6169615,0,t1_cyqoy6r,EDIT  Holy shit....I KNEW I WASNT INSANE!What is your problem? I think you have become confused somewhere along the line. This is the chain of events so far and you are completely out of the loop.  Ill break it down into a timeline  So the guy I originally respond to says this  gtI hate it when Im watching a TV show and someone enters the house asks WHATCHA WATCHIN? and then proceeds to have a loud conversation nearby. If you want to have conversations in the living room put the TV somewhere else.  So its established that the guy Im responding to is complaining about people trying to talk to him when hes in a common family area which everyone who he lives with has equal rights and freedom to be in there. Not to mention the strange notion that the living room is purely intended for families to sit together and watch TV in complete silence. Obviously this is not a logical approach to a common problem for INTPs. I offer a solution   gtIf you want to be left alone dont expect privacy in a common area. Ive seen a few people complaining about it in this thread and surely the most logical thing to do would be to find a place where you can actually be by yourself.I live with  other people and we are friends but if I wanted to be alone Id just stay in my room. Id have no right to be annoyed if they were in a shared room with me because we have equal rights to that space.    Quite obviously still just talking about being in a house. Then you decide to respond to me which is when I first realise that youre under the impression that Im talking about public areas when I said common areas. There is a difference which is completely contextual. The context was in the first  posts that you avoided reading. Extract from your first post   gtA common area doesnt really mean that INTPs are all just freeforalls for pests and kooks who like to rudely break strangers bubbles sit next to them gab to them incessantly and to basically interfere with their style of enjoyment of the public setting.  The first mention of being in a public setting. I assumed you just wanted to expand the debate a little more which I was open to. I enjoy a healthy debate if it leads somewhere and the person Im debating with actually has insight or awareness of what were talking about. So I agreed with you and decided to expand slightly   gt If its a public setting then of course Id expect other people to respect my personal space. Those rules dont really apply in a house though. Although we expect certain rules to be adhered to because they seem rational not everyone sees it that way. Most people would assume that if youre in a common area then you accept the fact that everyone has a right to within reason behave how they like in that area.  Perfectly reasonable. I agree with you on your counterpoint about public settings even though you are the only person to bring up a public setting in the conversation. Then you respond again without reading what Ive written. Youre trying to argue with someone who is agreeing with you and you have no basis of fact and barely any opinion   gtNow youre changing the context on me. We were talking about public settings and in public all people still have a right to say No! to company they dont want.  We were only talking about public settings because you brought it up completely unprompted. Please read back to the posts because its quite clear that nobody was talking about public settings before you chimed in. Weirdly enough you then decide to agree with me   gtINTPs may have to get along with others in their home because of family or roommates that are louder and more mental than them. Sure. Yet this is why INTPs thrive better living alone because having a quiet private space recuperates the introvert.  What the actual fuck man. Are you trying to misinterpret what Im saying or did you just realise at this point that you fucked up but youre too far in to actually get out? All I can really do is try and agree with you again hoping that this time youd understand what I was saying   gtSure you have a right to say No but thats up to them whether they adhere or not. Remember youre making a request not a demand.  Completely reasonable approach to privacy in public areas. Its balanced because I am agreeing that you have the right to say No to people who want to chat to you in public but they dont have to do what you say. The majority of people would leave you alone if you asked them to but some people get spurred on by rejection and it only makes them more curious about you.  Your last response was the tipping point for me. Ad hominem attacks are generally the last move of a person who knows they dont have a leg to stand on. You cant dispute any of my points because they are the same as yours youre just taking a little longer to realise it so in the meantime you spout some rhetorical bullshit that actually has very little to do with the topic and more about invoking negative perception towards my responses.  Let me break your last response down   gtYour determination to natter about nothing and hang on my every word before misinterpreting everything completely is obvious.  If you read back even just at this one post I wont make you read the others youll realise that you are the one who has been misinterpreting things. Each of my responses has had substance to it I think youre just seeing it as nattering about nothing because its actually nothing to you you dont have the ability to understand.  gtDo you really need to be that Im going to pester some INTPs and invalidate their thinking troll? Boring!Thats not what actually happened though. Your thinking was flawed in its early stages because you decided to start talking about privacy in public settings which was not relevant to anything in my response to the poster I responded to. Im not talking about OP Im talking about who I responded to. Youre just mad because you cant work out whats actually happening so you decide to just throw insults instead. Nice and reasonable of you.  gtINTPs dont need to crawl into the woods just to accomodate stalking weirdos such as yourself.Hyperbolic statement coupled with personal attack. Youre giving in to several logical fallacies that arise due to cognitive dissonance. At this point I was  sure that youre not INTP. INTPs have much better debating skills than this. I never said anything to that extent its just that you are so incredibly fucking dumb that by this point you actually still think were talking about public places. When I said the most logical thing to do would be to find a place where you can actually be by yourself I didnt mean Go to the woods because its the most logical place to go. What the fuck man everyone has a bedroom. Once again if you had payed any attention youd have realised that I was still talking about being inside.  gtSure we cant legislate respect but thankfully there really is police  Yes there are police. We have them in England as well. Im glad they dont enforce your legislative respect because respect is something that has to be earned and it cant be accurately measured because its a feeling. How would you even enforce that?  gtat least where I live... maybe you live somewhere in a hovel not sure.  I think the best response would be one of your own  gt However as INTPs experience life after a few decades you really cant avoid the conclusion that people really dont understand what youre saying and not because INTPs failed to cross the eyes and dot the tees not because INTPs deserve to be shat on for not communicating effectively as if the world has evolved beyond the need for adequate listening skills and attention span but simply because most people have terminally low IQs that prevent any higher level conversation. gtLol.,INTP,cyqx6hc,2,t5_2qhvl

6369833,0,t3_42r5p9,It is actually impossible to think about things if you mean that word in the sense of an object since thoughts can only be about the concept which the conscious mind is apprehending at any given moment and so to say that one is thinking about an object is to say that the object which one is perceiving has caused the perceiver to form a concept which logically corresponds with that object this concept formation usually is what is meant by thought. By these means a rational being can be conceptually aware of its own cognitive processes and at the same time be aware of those rules of thought which are necessarily by nature being applied to itself. This can only be done by a being in whom conscious states of awareness exist and who can therefore reflect on itself by means of its own rationality which in itself implies those axiomatic principles of thought that are presupposed in its essential concept of thought.Thought is therefore irreducible and necessary in its nature as it is that which makes truth possible. ,INTP,czdohu5,1,t5_2qhvl

6453275,0,t3_43p5ya,OK this post kinda hits home since I probably sound a lot like your boyfriend in reality and my wife is a lot like you especially the remarks about being in his own head.It sounds like hes not a complete bum and is at least somewhat motivated to pursue a career in computer science.  Do you know of anyone in your network who needs someone with his skills?  Maybe help connect that person with him.Maybe look on Meetup for local groups related to some of his hobbies that really interest him and get him to go so hell make some new friends..  you can go with him of course.You definitely need to get him to pursue some new interests but if he doesnt bulge at least you should try to take some genuine interest in some of his existing interests.  If youve already done that then try to tell me in an indirect way if possible that youve taken interest in his hobbies and he should at least be open minded enough to explore some of yours too.As for not taking negative feedback well I can kinda relate as Ive been numbed to negative feedback having grown up in an abusive household and having dealt with bosses with very short tempers.  As a result I tend to respond much better to positive feedback than negative feedback.  I know in some situations theres no substitute for negative feedback but try using positive feedback to guide the relationship as much as possible.One thing Id like to add about negative feedback..  although Im not sure if your boyfriend is this way but I tend to feel very resistant to any demands that are made onto me from someone who is in a very angry or otherwise negative emotional state.  Like if you screwed up something at work and your boss starts yelling at you then makes one final raging shout I DONT WANT TO SEE YOU IN THE OFFICE TOMORROW and slams the door I usually will resist it with my entire ego.  If your bf is that way too then try to get into a habit of making suggestions or demands when you and he are both in a fairly calm and stable emotional state.Btw you said hes smart and lazy?  You might want to take a look at this And try to speak his language as much as possible in the relationship going forward and hell probably listen and follow your suggestions or demands more ,INTP,czmt6px,1,t5_2qhvl

6500882,0,t1_czqrndf,Maybe Im an actual alien but I dont need to be dependent on someone else to grow. I care deeply for the people I care for and in probably the same way you would protect your loved one Id protect my friends. Beyond that it seems idiotic and sad that someone would think of themselves as not whole without another person. Plus the same people that feel like their partner fills them to make them together a full person are the same people who up and abandon their friends when they find a partner. You say that getting a partner makes you less selfish but Id say it often makes you selfish in a different way. Instead of caring for your friends or family you spend all your time and energy on your partner. You barely talk to your friends you dont talk about the same stuff anymore the emotional bond is all but gone you basically already have everything you had from your friends replaced. Sad thing is you were looking to replace those friends all along. Every time you went on a date or complained about being single you were in the back of your mind trying to replace  your friends. In essance you may think you are so much kinder and so much less selfish but thats because you spread out that meanness and selfishness around at all of your previous friends. Beyond that I dont believe that partnering up with someone is the only way to grow. So I dont think anyone should have to pick the popular option just because its the only way you and everyone you know got what they wanted and became who they are today. also since Im detail orientated and just like picking on details too much people who constantly need to be forgiven I remove from my life people who need forgiveness are asking for you to accept that they realized what they did wrong and want to grow and they want you involved in that growth. When you remove them from your life you are basically saying you dont want to be involved in their life.thats what love is its not being able to stand being mad at them Family and friends two groups of people almost anyone can say that about. Ya people fight sometimes but they either end up forgiving eachother and realizing how stupid it was or they break up because they either never were friends to begin with or plainly grew apart and growing apart doesnt mean one of them is bad. All growing apart means is that their interests and values ended up going to separate places but they both can have good interests and values. Really as I write out my response to you I realize how much you make it seem like you just plainly dont actually care for anyone else but your partner and that is just mean. You may think your nice and not selfish but others will see you that way if your only value in other people is based off of how much they are worth to your partners happiness. ,INTP,czrqnpa,2,t5_2qhvl

I think its terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans. Open to student loan forgiveness programs. Wants to audit the Federal Reserve  Hes genuinely against TPP Wants to allow states to legalize marijuana Marijuana is such a big thing. I think medical should happen  right? Dont we agree? I think so. And then I really believe we should leave it up to the states. Doesnt have any special interests groups funding him unlike the other candidates.

Likes universal healthcare is open to replacing Americas broken system with something better.

Acknowledgement that political correctness is obnoxious. Desire to put America first in trade deals instead of pure Wall Street globalism that exploits third world workers abroad and destroys domestic jobs. Realist based foreign policy. e.g. deal with Putin if it is in our national interest to do so even if he isnt a nice guy. National pride. The man loves his country and thinks it is the best.

They are valued not by what they do not by what they say not by the money they make or the tasks they accomplish but only by who they are.

7120232,0,t3_4d1k2e,Former evangelical Protestant soon to be Orthodox Christian here.I was raised as a Presbyterian but not since I was a kid did I doubt the truth of my Christian faith for lack of evidence. When my doubts did come during and after college they came from what I could only perceive as manifold internal contradictions and absurdities within my beliefs. I tried to answer or solve these but could find little in the teaching of my church that helped even the Bible which was supposed to hold all the answers became to me a source of doubt and further confusion so I started turning to it less and less. Eventually I admitted that God didnt make any sense that I couldnt rationally justify believing in much less trusting him and that his word had contradictions in it.Yet I made this admission to Goddespite all this I still deeply trusted him to somehow deliver me from this unclarity. This helped me see that my faith went beyond what I could rationally justify and make sense of to myself which at the time was practically nil. This in turn led to the deeper realization which on some level Id been aware of for long that reality is much more than what we can prove explain reason about and fit into a system. My doubts arose because I was trying to do this to Christianity to reduce it to a system of beliefs expecting it to fit within my own rationalistic understanding of things.This gave me new hope but did not answer any of my questions I began striving to do so on my own rather than accepting the answers I was being given but with limited success and a constant sense of the subjectivity and arbitrariness of it all limited my trust in my conclusions. How could my beliefs refer to anything beyond my own understanding if I was essentially constructing them by myself? Im now in the process of joining Eastern Orthodoxy which provides not objectivity but what I am content is the right subjectivity for Christianity. It is not merely a system or a set of beliefs but a life lived not on my own but together.To address the common question in this thread I havent questioned the existence of God in my adult life because Ive never found a reason to do so but I have questioned nearly everything coming after the existence of God. The question and doubt everything until it is proved from evidence method of rationalism is very useful and valid in some areas but not I think universally applicable.

Its really close to what I would say my personal philosophy is but the belief that Reason alone can control Desire seems weird.  I suppose Cynic doesnt fit well in the formal sense either since I am not an ascetic nor do I hold that Nature is something to act in accordance with but I remembered Diogenes rejection of Platonism and social custom and it resonated with my need for honest logic and emotion.,INTP,d21chn2,1,t5_2qhvl
7244381,0,t3_4emn41,I suppose Im technically a professional musician because people pay me and my band fairly well to play in venues around my medium sized city on a  gig a month basis. We play originals and interesting cover selections  Ive been playing some form of music most of my life piano at age  guitar  so far. I would love nothing more than to fully dedicate myself to the craft of guitar because its truly the only thing I have EVER been able to achieve the so called laser focus we are supposed to be able to do. But its really tough making a living playing music and Ive already fucked up plenty financially in my s WRT figuring out a career path so I work a  hr week and do the band as my side project  passion I hate that word for some reason. Age  now.I love music  guitar and to me it allows me to fully express my INTP tendencies in the only way I know how. Yeah spewing random useless knowledge is impressive as a kid preinternetsmartphone but now its pretty worthless. Anyway I love all kinds of music and find there is value and something to learn in almost every genre so I take little tidbits from various styles genres artists and smash them all together into my own crazy ass style. My foundation is probably funky bluesy rock but I pull techniques riffs licks chord progressions etc. from jazz reggae metal classical country psychedelic alternative indie lap steel slide punk hip hop electronic shoegaze bluegrass Balkan Brassgypsy jazz Congolese Soukous ska afrobeat middle eastern folk ETC ETC ETC you get the picture. My brain picks out little things it likes in all this different music I listen to and incorporates it. So I end up using certain styles very unexpectedly in songs but still fitting the vibe. I love it because it represents something I will never be finished with or bored with there is literally an infinite number of possibilities for creating music. I do a ton of improv and almost always improv my guitar solos so no song is ever the same twice. I also find I can quite easily recall most any melody Ive heard and figure it out by ear fairly quickly which comes in handy. Fun to throw goofy shit into the middle of solos as Easter Eggs for anyone who is listening. For example Green Acres lick played in minor key Purple Haze main riff or some random video game music riff.Cool because my fellow bandmates are all from different musical backgrounds too so we end up jamming and writing some pretty cool stuff its all rock n roll but with various twists. Im no theory genius but I know probably more than most rock musicians. People treat it like its some incomprehensible language or scoff that its totally unnecessary. Not gonna be elitist about it but it DEFINITELY helps you improve dramatically once you understand some basics. Its not rocket science to learn the major and minor scales. Its not a matter of actively thinking while youre playing OK I NEED TO HIT THE MINOR th HERE AT THIS BEAT RIGHT NOW unless you are playing some very technical jazz no thanks but rather theory acts as a subconscious foundation I can expand on when I improvise. I laugh when I hear a version of duuuuude theory just gets in the way of your creativity just gotta FEEL IT MANNNNN ..... oddly enough feeling it sure sounds a lot like Pentatonic Minor.

7269303,0,t1_d24fa0y,I think I understand where youre coming from. For me the problem is that my sexual desire is tied up with a feeling of shame that was instilled in me for being attracted to the physical form of a woman. I dont know that theres much you can do about it in the moment.For me its tied up with a relatively low selfesteem that causes me to be paralyzed in the face of the potential judgement of someone that Im physically attracted to. Im so concerned about what their opinion of me will be that I end up doing nothing and failing anyway.I dont know if you can turn it into a strength but you could potentially turn it into a motivator. Imagine the kind of person you want to be with and then find out what type of person you would have to be in order to be attractive to them. Keep in mind that your intuition of the type of person they would be attracted to might be wrong so you should look for empirical sources of the attributes that women are attracted to generally.After youve identified the aspects in which you are lacking create a plan to improve yourself and become that person. Keep in mind that becoming this person wont obligate them to be attracted to you but it might improve your chances. This plan will probably involve stepping out of your comfort zone but youve got to keep your end goal in mind and power through it.Even if you dont end up fulfilling your desires hopefully the process will turn you into a more actualized version of yourself. There are problems with this idea because it could lead to the objectification of the target of your affection. It could also lead to you not being true to yourself and becoming someone that youre not comfortable being. You have to stay true to yourself but you can utilize you hunger in order to become the best version of yourself that you can be which increases the potential of having the target of your desires desire you in return.I base this advice on nothing other than my own rambling experience.

7591276,0,t3_4j59ku,ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspFirst off if its not clear your school will probably still be made up of a mix of types its just that the people who got there are now much more clearly as prepared in much of the things that you probably used to rely on as differentiating you from your previous peers. Your intelligence no longer makes you feel as special. But this is a good thing because it gives you the opportunity to develop other aspects of your character as long as you can get over the adjustment and it will give you more opportunities to learn much more quickly. You will need to ask for help from people who seem to know more than you and you may even realize that this is actually more optimal than trying to figure stuff out on your own although you may encounter people who rub your face in it thats a different characterbuilding opportunity fortunately thats not as common a problem as you might think.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspThe problem with type profiles is that they appear to describe a person at a single moment in time but if you read more on the model profiles are actually built from an analysis of cognitive functions not static behavior sets. People grow and change what the type model attempts to capture is the process of that growth and how it manifests over time. Dont let the profile define you especially not according to a single static snapshot let the function theory give you insights into how to smooth over your rough spots.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspSecond be clear about why youre there. You dont need to have concrete plans but you need to know what drives you beyond that old bc Im smart bc Im good at things. Youre there to learn and seeing it that way opens you up to new experiences and ways of thinking. If youre not there to learn or you cant get over yourself save the money and take a year or few off to get a job or volunteer to get more perspective without sinking a ton of money or go to community college for cheaper generalrequirement credits and an environment that may feel more like your previous one. If you cant think of leaving but cant fully bring yourself to ask for help then pick an easier program.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspBut try asking for help first not to regain your old self but to learn to be a better self whether thats through academics finding a purpose or way to make yourself useful like asking around for research assistant jobs that also may put you closer to a faculty mentor or making new friends friends that may give you even more intellectual stimulation than friends before.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspAs for smaller things youll want to develop  methods to unwind relax clear your head while remembering that these methods are as needed because it can be tempting to overdo them and youll have much less time than before. Ideally these methods clear your head within an hour or less and can be done easily even on short breaks. Recognize when you are particularly stressed and going into anxious selfdoubting or analysis paralysis those are the times you want to go to your methods. One good option would be deliberately slower walking while controlling your breathing possibly without music so you can also focus on your immediate surroundings instead of getting stuck in your head. Meditation is more advanced but comes more easily if you get into a habit of deliberate walking and breathing the state of mind is similar so you at least know if youre meditating effectively.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspFor studies you probably built up bad habits or lack of them. Youll almost definitely want to ask your counselor for what options are available to learn some skills or more efficient ones. If its something that requires memorization try Anki flash cards method if its having a lot of material to sift through learn to skim and scan more have the TOC or outline handy and surveying your material instead of digging in linearly not all information is relevant to your classes. Learn to balance notetaking with paying attention for confusing spots and implications that are worth writing and asking questions about. Ask for outlines and ask if you can voice record classes. Look up answers online and more importantly see how the answers work. Work to your assigned work pass those classes not to the breadth and depth of the content you are assigned and if you have time and youve cleared your head then indulge yourself. Aim for Bs so you dont end up spending too much time overshooting As nobody gives you stars for  and youve got workschoolliferest balance to consider be satisfied with Cs if your school is really tough it probably has a reputation for it and the only thing that matters when youre done is that degree and what other things you did while in school like friends you make the respect of colleagues earned by doing as much work as they do or faculty youve helped enough to know your name.ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspIf you still want to go back to your old self go back home. Bask in your old successes surround yourself with tokens from your past glories but thats also a quick way to get stuck and really have reasons to kick yourself. Much more practical go to community college its actually a decent transitional environment and will probably save money and as long as you go early enough that it wont feel too lame once youre ready for the faster pace of upperlevel classwork at collegeuni.,INTP,d3539lp,2,t5_2qhvl

I dropped out of high school because I didnt give a rats ass at the time. I ended up getting frustrated with offlimits opportunities got the GED got an AAS with stellar grades then transferred to a toptier uni which I graduated from with a decent GPA in my s.College is a different experience as people here say youre given much more freedom but it also requires a lot more responsibility. I dont know your whole story but as someone here mentioned you should look at what university you might want to go to check the schoolwide general ed courses and start taking some classes at com college. That way you can see if college is right for you knock out some credits if so and maybe get a little smarter if not. I will say that the university experience was not at all fun for me though I did enjoy com college. Someones comment on here also struck a chord with me personallyare any of those that college will open doors you want to walk through? You really need to love what you study.

How that translates to actual production depends on your industry but Ive seen guides here and there for project management benchmarks milestones and allocation of hoursresources.It also helps to constantly prototype and get feedback on any confusing bits or to see what actually gets used in your prototype from testers so that you avoid feature creep. If you want to add more bits you could always release an update or even redesign the whole thing after learning even more from the response to an initial full release.You could also pay attention to how quickly you lose interest in a project and simply build to that time limit. Do just enough work to properly execute and test some idea in that time limit according to your skills and release and reflect on the feedback you get.

7701321,0,t1_d3hcet3,Hey even though I have those difficulties Im still trying my best to pass math classes rather than take the alternative options Im allowed to take! I have a theory for why Im so INTP for an ESFJ and that is an examination of the functions of ESFJ and INTP. ESFJ is primary FeTi axis with a secondary SiNe axis just like INTP. The difference is that ESFJ emphasizes the Fe side very strongly and the Si side mild to moderately.The reason I mention this is as a kid I was very much an INTP. I also used to be way ahead of my peers in math and reading. Then high school came and I started to get sick with schizophrenia and my abilities in math and reading started to decay to the point that I have to reread everything to comprehend it and I struggle with basic algebra.Impairments in working memory and various executive functions are what causes such decay and I also have a curiosity in neuroscience to know exactly why those impairments take place in the first place. I know that in all psychotic disorders there is a degree of cognitive impairment and part of me wonders if such impairment is what makes the difficulty separating reality from imagination possible.Either way research into it I found a neat page explaining how working memory affects math skills. Sadly the referenced studies are locked behind paywalls. Which is a pet peeve of mine. Certainly though I can attest to the difficulty with temporary storage of numbers and poor recall of facts as well as recall speed.My theory is that Ive spent the last ten years in some form of stressed state and it forced me to use my inferior and tertiary to the point that it  became over habit my primary and secondary. Anyhow now that Im off topic. I sometimes am on the lookout for situations that could be explained by mathematics music is an obvious one. One thing I was pondering a bit ago was if someone could survey the population on various issues and then use mathematics to figure out which appeals to make that would give the highest probability of success based on who you alienate and who you gain support by mentioning different issues. I wonder if that is done already.,INTP,d3hl7mb,2,t5_2qhvl

Not exactly what Iwould call an accurate survey let alone anything I would be satisfiedwith.The  character archetypes of INTP are a good place to begin forpeople who arent selfaware what character archetype they are andactively trying to change them because they think their characterarchetype is insufficiently awesome.

The archetypes on theright hand side possess gravitas.The second row is capable of handling intensely positive situations.The last row is capable of handling intensely negative situations.The row in between them is capable of handling both intensely positiveand intensely negative situations.  The first row is capable ofhandling nothing and largely muddles along living in their own head.The underlying principles that unify these character archetypes intoone single personality type are topological and spatial. has topology        has metrics eg aesthetics makes connections  shortens distance makes and breaks connections  sorts things that work together breaks connections   lengthens distanceExamples Lawrence of Arabia  preSurak Vulcans savages with nukes Sherlock Holmes David Blaine Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in   Alexandria Worm Paksenarrion  Gird Strongarmand if you dont like these examples I have three dozen more withvarying levels of power.So you can figure out your character archetype analytically byfiguring out what kinds of situations youre comfortable with andproductive in.

ESFP will like to buy others gifts to show how much they have ISFJ will be more passive aggressive in their showoffsometimes they dont feel as if they are showing off.

Try playing tennis or we you play and try observing yourself while doing it. It makes it almost impossible to do well while youre observing yourself it makes you very rigid with no flow. It seems like youre very worried about how you appear to other people and youre constantly checking yourself to see what type of person youre projecting wimp hothead spaz child etc.As long as youre trying to manipulate other peoples perception of you being a chameleon very selfconscious projecting certain traits on purpose etc. then youre gonna have a hard time since youre basically lying to them. Youre cherry picking your responses based on how you want to present yourself then when somebody steps on your toes they are threatening your image that youve carefully crafted you simply have too much to think about and you cant do that well while selfobserving since that takes up too much conscious effort. Its like youre trying to play tennis while being completely selfconscious of all of your actions and then getting frustrated because you cant play right. When your opponent throws some trash talk your way it threatens the image youre consciously projecting and it messes you up because youre forced into a situation where you dont have complete control over the image youre projecting then you start to think that you projected a wimp or emotional child or what have you. Then it seems like you wonder how could I have projected a better image of myself in this situation? Because I dont want to look like a pussy. Id say that your problem is much deeper than what it appears and its root is a habit of constantly selfobserving in order to project specific images to certain people with no regard to how true or untrue you really feel in the moment manipulation. ,INTP,d4ixgkp,3,t5_2qhvl

If you live your life entirely in your head and rely on the soothing fallacy that your life has not yet begun you are going to find yourself in the exact same place years from now. What are your goals? Do you have a specific career in mind? If not make finding that out your goal. Do you want to get fit? Do you want to start a band? Be the best Hearthstone player? Write a play? Write some of this stuff down every single day. You need to remind yourself that life is a series of days just like this one not just some abstract future thing. I guarantee if you spend some time writing every single day you will bring to the surface many of these previously unarticulated desires. I think a sense of urgency is overrated. Many people hinge their selfesteem on the Japanesesalaryman ideal of constant puttering and being seen doing something. They schedule every hour of their lives or feel that they are wasted.

8537186,0,t3_4wnt0o,So I have a few thoughts about all of the above.  Firstly for me if something has a  chance answer it is uninteresting and I dont care to ponder it.  Id rather dive into something that has no answer and explore the possibilities.  These situations are where INTP insights thrive because we dont discard any information or possibilities and we look at the big picture.I think about these kinds of deep thoughts all the time.  My biggest inference that I simply cannot get past or override is that SOMETHING created me.  I am more than a physical conglomeration of cells that just happened to get melded together this way.  Not that it would be unlikely for that to happen.  In fact if space is infinite and physical conditions are random then if something is possible at all then it is guaranteed to exist somewhere.  What Im talking about is that I feel like I am more than that.  And if Im right about it then I must have necessarily been purposefully created as something other than my physical body.If we talk about the definition of God involving omniscience omnipotence omnipresence etc then couldnt you say that He knows the future?  He would have perfect knowledge to be able to perfectly predict any outcome.  In that case is it possible for us to live our lives incorrectly?  Are we at fault for any actions we take?  I like to take it a step farther and think that no matter what we do if we view our lives on Earth as a... social experiment?... then even Hitler was just playing the game and in the long run hes no better or worse than any of the rest of us.I say do what makes you happy.  If there is an afterlife dont worry about it because we probably are here for a good reason so we should just let it be played out.  If there isnt an afterlife then you may as well try to be happy.  I think happiness is attainable for everyone we just have to look in the right places to find it.,INTP,d68pr22,2,t5_2qhvl

No human being is that humane...David in Prometheus is a psychopath and a massive fucking douchebag. He is insecure arrogant egotistical a traitor and a poisoner.Data in Star Trek TNG is INTP but a loser.Dragon in Worm Serial Novel is an ENF Slave who follows the rules only because shes constrained by them and otherwise tries to corrupt them as shes out for herself.And of course Defiant in Worm Serial Novel is an RWA asshole of epic proportions.Bender in Futurama is a narcissist douchebag.Robot Superman is what? A psychopath or narcissist though I barely know the character and am not looking him up.So yeah ... you were incorrectly generalizing. A lot of INTP characters are made into robots because it gives them a form of immortality without going the Vulcan katra route. In other words its a way to give them a superior form of soul.However a lot of total fucking assholes are made into robots. Like the psychotic leader of the Replicants in Blade Runner. And Dragon was made into an AI in order to force her to obey rules by installing mental shackles on her and to force her to fight for humanity because Slaves never ever fight for anything but their own skins. And they never under ANY circumstances fight something more powerful than themselves. They just curl into themselves to be invisible or beg to be spared. Making her an immortal AI was a way to fix that. She is of course killed in the novel as a way to prove she ISNT an INTP because she ISNT immortal. She just believed she was invulnerable like Superman does.So yeah unless you sympathize with psychopaths you dont actually sympathize with all robots or even most robots only with robots ... which happen to be INTP.,INTP,d6c57et,2,t5_2qhvl

Also if you go heavy on either the lips or the eyes then you should go light on the other i.e. less work. Kill two or three birds with one stone. Another thing is that if you wear the right colours for you this also brings out the best undertones in your skin and diminishes the need for makeup you can be literally glowing without wearing a thing. If you do your makeup and dress in a classy way people also will be nicer to you and like you better and it will be easier to work with them and get things done.I do the makeup and dressing well thing not because I particularly care its a burden I am happy with myself and like myself howeveras I am but people perceive you as more professional and give you more respect. I just want less friction in the world so I can get more things done and it isnt worth doing things unless you are going to be effective at them.

8622934,0,t3_4xxl4w,Ill avoid jungian functions but as far as INTP learning its basically a set of patterns I think. When I learn something I understand the pattern and logic of what it is and then how it fits logically into my theory of everything Ie. my theory or mental pattern about the world existence the field in question the subject etc. In this way and maybe some people would disagree I think anything I learn could be broken down into threeish tiersType . Something that is NEITHER interesting as a patternsystem itself OR as it relates to my big huge theories of life. An example what you had for breakfast yesterday.Type . Something that is an interesting pattern in and of itself but doesnt substantially contribute to my highest theories amp systematic understandings. Ex for me algebra. type . Something both extremely interesting as a pattern itself and also changes or influences big systematic understandings. Ex. Again for me the ethics of rhetoric a book that systematically analyzed modern language and made me think differently about its connotations. Type  is the goldmine.

In this way I would liken humanity to mice in a lab with god as the scientist. Some will suffer intentionally and nothing will be done to ease the pain of their atrocious lives others will have mediocre lives where nothing truly significant happens and the lucky few will have fantastic lives but very few have any sort of control over this.

I spent most of my time as a kid being this chameleon doing everything in his power to fit in but is always rejected... bullied til my late teenage years. No one I would really call a brother since theyre all tearing me down. I did have a group way back in college but I was never really into them. I considered them as my friends but I still have my guards up. I never really let them in me.Even as I started working I never really knew how it felt to have genuine friends. I kept at a fairly great distance to people. For years I have sported this facade that I can do everything on my own without the need of this socalled friends. Until I got depressed. I spent a whole year questioning my existence... what is my purpose? Why do I keep on seeing people happy with a group when here I was struggling to understand how they manage to get by? Eventually for no apparent reason I have decided to give it another shot... This time Im gonna do things right. So I looked for another jobmy current job. And this is where I met him. Him and I were in a group of  people. At first I didnt see him as a brother until I get to spend more time with him. I really wanted to be that close to him.

8852159,0,t1_d7bho5y,Hmmmm.  OK.  I doubt youre an INTP.  Since INTPs think they are awesome and that everyone else is insane except maybe ENTPs but Ive never met one in real life....OK having looked at some of your comment history I can say that youre definitely a Judging type in the MBTI sense.  You have that negative view of reality that Judging types are defined by compared to the OMG the UNIVERSE IS AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL!!! of the Perceiving type.  Though obviously Introverts are depressives so this makes things a bit interesting... We hate life NOW but think the future will be so much better its just that the waiting can be heartbreaking... Im going to say youre either INTJ or INFJ.  FJ is very similar in a mirrorimage sort of way to TP so it can be easy to confuse the two if youre not looking specifically at the four dimensions themselves.So Ill break it downIntroverts are the more geeky research focused types who are about exploring and understanding life especially what is good and healthy in it.  Extraverts are the more performance based types who focus on expressing themselves and creatingdoing stuff in life.  Introverts primarily seek comfort and clarity while Extraverts primarily seek fame fortune or at least a sense of having ones creative efforts be appreciated in some important way by others.Sensing types are focused on figuring out what others want to get while iNtuiting types are focused on helping others do funmeaningful things.  Feeling types want to keep their group together and strong and so they focus on following the rules and staying within the boundaries. Thinking types want to help their group find more effective and efficient ways of doing things and so are experimentalexploratory in the scientificengineering sense and are leaders in innovation ideological or material.Judging types are as I said worried about life in general and at least slightly dread the future which is where the is this good or bad? judgement comes in and where the focus on planning so as to avoid negative outcomes shows up.  While Perceiving types are again viewing the future and reality as a whole as awesome and look forward to discovering whatever shows up in life even if it originally seems to be a lemon because they know that every lemon has a silver lining or something wacky like that. ,INTP,d7bwk5k,0,t5_2qhvl

Even if theyve never had a gay sexual experience they still know what they want.Well gay peoples big thing was about saying that they were mentally healthy they were good it was society that was the problem the disorder was collective rather than individual and not to label them as ill or give them any medical treatment or fix them. Trans people on the other hand say the opposite they want medical treatment to fix them they think that there is something that is a disorder to be fixed in them but they dont ask society to adjust social norms of gender roles.

Theres a certain usefulness to the stereotype PJ but its broadness is pretty damaging to understanding too. I could be wrong too but as far as I knowINTPs are actually dominant JUDGERS. Its just internalized judgment Ti. Always making value judgments whats true and whats false. The order and structure is inside the mind and therefore not readily apparent unless were lecturing someone or crushing them in a discussion. Its the INTPs strength to have a highly structured inner world. As long as its about logical systems. This is why INTPs can certainly be anal about nuances and details of intellectual matters and semanticsgrammar snobs.We prefer to PERCEIVE that outside world that we mercilessly judge in an abstract exploratory divergent way sucking in intellectualized information but not acting on it. This is Ne. Even if its secondary it is what a lot of people more often see of INTPs spaced out crazy leaps of thought scattered thinking open endedness. Its easier to see and seemingly contradictory to the ruthless hidden order of Ti thus INTP and ENTP is seen more of a mysterious mad genius than the tothepoint getshitdone Te dominants.The sensorial PERCEPTION Si is also more internalized passive and delayed a matter of reflection and memory rather than the inthemoment active externallyfocused Se. Tends to lead to a certain desire for consistencyritual in terms of sensing things.Our biggest weakness Fe is also a JUDGING function. We feel compelled to relate to the outer world of subjective human values in some way but suck at making such judgements. Dont know where we belong what our worth to humanityother people really is what their worth is to us what other people feel is valuable what we should do unsure how we feel about things attachment issues bad at expressing feelings etc... so we tend to push all that under the rug and pretend it doesnt exist.Therefore the apparently disorganized and unfocused stereotype P comes from a combination of all the functions. Were basically too busy organizing our brains that organizing the outside world or actually doing things is not really a priority... except for the crushing ennui and information addiction. ESFJs having the same functions but reversed are probably not that prone to stereotypical J order either Dominant Fe wants social order  shared values harmony which secondary Si tendency to ritualize combines into a sort of peerpressured I am tidy because I am expected to be  have always been taught to be which would be quite different from a dominant TeSi J who is compelled to create structure in the outer world out of their own nature.,INTP,d85aaxu,2,t5_2qhvl

9395809,0,t1_d96qsip,Have you done a genetic test on your relative? Is it early onset or late onset? Does your relative have the APOE eee genes?Is the diagnosis Alzheimers or a different type of dementia? People tend to use Alzheimers rather liberally.There are several hypotheses why Alzheimers occurs and how amyloid  protein gets into the cytosol region in the cell. One is that amyloid  is secreted to the extracellular region and can bind to other binding proteins or receptors such as the alphanicotinic receptor and these receptors can uptake extracellular amyloid and gets into the cell. Nicotinamide or niacinamide could disrupt this cycle and also preserves mitrochondrial integrity and induces its autophagy function.  Nicotinamide or niacinamide is a form of vitamin B.Easier reading Although in the last link I disagree with the last website in its suggestion of sustainedrelease niacinamide. One should NEVER take timereleased niacinamide as it can negatively effect the liver. Anecdotal information seems to say many people report the therapeutic dosage around mg although that dosage may vary but is also contraindicated in individuals with hepatitis or a weakened liver function.There are also other treatments as well such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been mainly utilized by people with TBI traumatic brain injury and also by professional athletes who want to recover quickly after a game. Many studies of hyperbaric oxygen therapy HBOT has reversed many conditions of neurological dysfunction and decline in addition to many diabetic conditions. Pressurized oxygen gets into the brain and revives dormant neurons stimulating them to multiply and make new connections. In the UK hyperbaric oxygen therapy used to be covered by NHS but I think recently they repealed it. You can also buy your own portable HBOT chamber bypassing hospital fees.

The extroverted functions are spatial  breadth focused they cant go as deep into a path as an introverted function. Introverted functions tend towards temporal  depth.

9606744,0,t3_5cj89q,Im  too. Im going to be honest this just seems kind of petty.Ive had discussions with other INTPs about the Small Talk Hell before and I understand it small talk and conversations full of possibly deceptive but socially acceptable polite formalities are boring and annoying... if you let them be that way.Wanna talk about something that matters? Start talking about something that matters to you and see if theyll join in on the conversation. If you wont it seems a little entitled of you to be so bothered when others begin a dialogue with you about shit that doesnt matter to you. Especially if they ASK ABOUT you personally. Whyd you get the tattoo? Like standing in front of mirrors? Why do you do any external action choose any style speak any way leave the damn house? Why should other people even notice and ask about these things? How dare they take an interest in you? Those dirty peasants! Ask me about what matters instead!Can you not see how that sounds?Anyway Im pretty convinced that this particular INTP trait that is routine circlejerk here is just being upset that not everyone is as interested in your shit as you are. It would be nice to talk about what matters all day long so I do. I have myself and my mind for conversations that matter and if someone comes along and they want to join in thats fantastic! If someone comes along who does not want to join in because my current internal conversation does not matter to them well thats cool... easy fix! Just talk to them and discover what matters to them then talk to them about that! But how does that begin? Small Talk Hell.Or if you are really that unhappy with how other people try to communicate with and share themselves with you because it isnt quite up to your standards try staying inside your house instead. No one asked you to come out and participate with the rest of us and who are we to stop you from leaving if you dont enjoy it? The door is always open man.

Chinese astrology is also pretty interesting and describes people pretty well in my experience but Ive learned the basics. Theres also numerology thats based on your birth date or name I like the site Seventh life path. The site owner will write you a full personality reading for free based on nothing but your name and birth date and again pretty accurate.

Even if we could get rid of money it would be a huge step backward because its required to make complex trades where you cant simply trade one similar thing for another.  Barter system only works in the most basic of trades.  Hard work  good morality is not the same as good morality  more money.  It is possible to work hard and thus be considered a good person without having money.  Also many people with money are considered immoral or greedy even if they arent regardless of hard work.

9701184,0,t1_da8ut0j,I cant put that into words. Ill try tho. Its well. Idk its one theory in my brain is all. Your mbti system I have it too. Like why are you telling me what perceiving is? Is it not easy to infer that I would already know based on everything Ive written about?I just like to add my personal voice to all my learnings. And I took a different route than you. Im actually not even saying your different from me now. Im saying the situation that we are in is not the same. Socializing is complex. Too people conversing are not in the same situation together. Instead they take roles and follow consistency. If you act shy one day you are expected to seem shy later. My gf has that issue she was able to relate heavily. Neither of these systems mbti or Jung are guaranteed or even likely to have truth in any specific amount. I think your loose and stuff and pretty critical thinking. I used to be more of a debater. I also am loose too but I didnt post loose stuff and your judging me as only being how my post was. Do you realize my post is not my common state of mind? Its merely me fucked up on drugs and having epiphanies. Psychedelics. So its kind of absurd that you would simplify it as being istp cuz psychedelics clearly can change the way our personality is during the experience. Also Im in the defending position here while you are the one making claims and judgements about me. So my behavior is changing and your judging further based on experiences that YOU actually control. Like confirmation bias kinda except reverse maybe. Intuition is about finding similarities while judging functions TF are meant to differentiate and kind of solidify perceptions into judgements. Intuition is meant to be like associative thinking. Connecting. Ideas. Epiphanies. Sensing is detail and fact oriented. Your assuming Im this because I posted something from rnootropics where they get picky with my words. So the context here is even different. Then you assume Im autistic but then how come Im socially adaptable? And also I said Im lonely I think its not as bad as I think. I have tons of people who want my time and I never even have time for them. Which is why Im lonely too. But people tend to use me for my intuitive ideas all the time and your assuming Im not like this. I gave cool ideas to my INTP artist friend to paint. And we made new forms of paper. Im deeply into innovation and creativity. And I suck at school based stuff but I am already so deep into neuroscience so I cant go back. I need to make artificial intelligence. And maybe other stuff too. I dont necessarily have actual set goals in reality. And Im not even in school for neuroscience yet. Im stuck at community college doing poorly because Im distracted by neuroscience obsession. Not just that I mean Im not really saying it how it is. Im distracted by everything. But I use neuroscience as my defense because I honestly have no control over my behaviors much anymore. I just want to learn and live. I also want to try experiments with music where hundreds of individuals get together to do one part of the song. Maybe even mbti types could be factored in. That would be fascinating to see how that plays out. ,INTP,da8vmdy,3,t5_2qhvl

9739585,0,t3_5emc93, Ha the exact opposite. I usually gauge the validity of a crush based on how long the thoughts last  Sort of seeing as how I try to make myself seem not like a looser as possible to avoid negative attention I have developed a sort of sense of how to do things non awkwardly such as ask out girls. The one time I did it I got shot down but my spirit wasnt crushed or anything  I listened to music for a few hours blocked out the world and then recouped my losses and faced the world the next day. Truly it isnt as bad as it sounds when you get shot down as long as you realistically think the other person has some sort of inclination to date you id say its safe to make a move.  No and yes. Because of the aforementioned social vetting I do my personality is a bit different around people in general. Only people close to me  ENFP best friend another ENTPrick  often see the rest of my personality the more goofy stuff the much more dickish side and the much more analytical side.

Who the fuck says that?!Did you ever see the Stargate episode where its explained the goauld Anubis is HALFascended? Neither fully in the plane of mind nor fully in the universe of matter? Thats you. Anubis is a psychopath.Youre stuck in a stupid backwoods diner on the highway between San Fran and Pasadena. And saying look at that road! look at the bitumen its so interesting. the road structure of gravel and asphalt so fascinating. the cars going in both directions demarcated by the yellow line it all makes sense.Youre at the bottom of a launch rocket while astronauts are passing you by to board for liftoff. And YOU are admiring the launch pad and launch systems.Youre the guy admiring the open stargate and the horizon effect that covers the wormhole while someone is yelling at you to get the fuck out of the way because theres a train full of passengers who want to go through to see the galaxy!There is a whole UNIVERSE of mind and mental effects. The entire field of emotions is a tiny language within that universe. That universe contains many other languages so that consciousness is reduced to a mere triviality. And what are you talking about? About the volume of ink needed to shape the letters a vs o.You can only make consciousness seem great and significant and important and critical by comparing it to something even more worthless and stupid and banal matter. Only it doesnt work on me nor on anyone truly intelligent. Everything you say is still blatantly stupid and pointless and insignificant and meaningless and insipid.Thats why you surround yourself with idiots and retards and insane people. To make yourself feel better by being superior to them. The same reason why Santa hangs around children. Because hes lame and incapable of going hardcore like Jesus.gt What Im compelled to communicate and what I think are two different things. Im perfectly willing to discuss concepts if I dont suspect the individual Im discussing it with is trying to lampoon my thought process via what they gathered from a few hundred words. I do not desire nor require a full dissertation of my ideas given this format. I only systematize what is required for my goals the rest remains nebulous. I will admit my tendency to negatively react to your explicit systematization of ideas that I have not systematized in a coherent manner. My initial reaction is that its a semantics game meant to undermine actual discussion of the phenomenon however if it does not take place how can a true discussion actually be had.Your initial reaction is a consequence of your emotional limitations. Limitations which cripple your intellect.And I couldnt give a shit about discussing the phenomenon. I am BEYOND phenomenon. I dont talk about phenomenon anymore than most people talk about fucking toilets or sewage systems.You want to get lost in the sewage and the shit because your mind IS shit. This isnt a fucking game. This is dead fucking serious. YOU are the one thats playing fucking games admiring your fucking bitumen and your fucking neurons and your fucking SHIT.Compared to that dissertation or casual off the cuff remarks means nothing. I have done both and been equally happy with both. Sane people however are not happy with SHIT.Your intellectual limitations are directly caused by your inability to handle hard work and inability to handle problems. Thats why your mind is full of fluff that you spin into intricate detail like lacework and then show off as if it mattered. Youre into fucking embroidery.I build intellectual starships that launch themselves to other intellectual worlds. Youre a fucking medieval noblewoman doing crochet and lace embroidery. Nothing you say has meaning and nothing you say MATTERS. Its all this phenomenon that phenomenon that coincidence between these two phenomenon. Who gives a shit?! Its shallow ass easy observations and the slightest wind will tear them to shreds. Only Im not a wind Im a transdimensional vortex to a different universe where the physical laws youre familiar with no longer apply.You are a ghost in the intellectual world not a true intellectual. You dont care about ideas unless theyre easy to understand and work with. Whereas I know all of your ideas and my own and I just scorn yours as inferior. As trumped up fluff with no substance but lots of pretense..gt You couldnt possibly know that I havent encountered a singularity. If youre clinging to your concepts then youre a mindless bigot.Oops I meant singleton. And since I listed a half dozen different forms of paying attention ALL OF which you should have been familiar with youre wrong and I DO know.Consciousness is not something that would make Spock say Captain its like nothing weve seen before!gt Cause the answers to these questions are implicit consequences of the observer and answered within the context of Julian Jaynes Bicameralism?

Thats all you do minor tweaks and auto detail. Heres my industrial steel mill using the newly invented process. And heres my auto detail shop isnt it nice?.gt The context of this thread was a general discussion on the nature of consciousness and free will. I merely threw in a potential biological consequence of consciousness. You just dont find neurological information interesting so you completely threw it out and claimed it merely existed to appease the viewer. Culture is a derivative of biological structure it matters.ltscoffgt How stupid and retarded!Once the avalanche has started it is too late for the pebbles to vote. And why is that? Because avalanches are emergent phenomena. Their properties cant be derived from the properties of pebbles or snow or sand.The properties of life cant be derived from those of chemicals. The properties of chemicals cant be derived from physics not in practice. Algebra theorems cant be derived from arithmetic properties or geometric properties.You like a blinkered fucking drafthorse see only the derivations you care about rather than the gulf of underivability. Because the intractability makes you uncomfortable and queasy.The fact that its impossible to derive . of mental phenomena from neurology or neurochemistry makes you stick around the insignificant . that can be derived. Because you are a fucking coward lacking vision. You are a shaking little girl quaking in her little jammies.Youre the little boy who thinks swimming is what you do when you can stand on the sand at the beach. And I am Jacques Cousteau plumbing new depths of the ocean in his own selfcreated submarine. And then you say to Jacques Cousteau youre just not interested in beach sand thats why you look down on me. But no I look down on you because youre an intellectual child who will never ever grow up. Like Peter Pan.The neurological information you find so INTERESTING and RELEVANT is tricycle wheels. Fit only for little children who cant ever grow up because theyre retarded or dont want to because theyre emotionally castrated so can never dive into the REAL ocean. Or use a REAL bicycle.gt He didnt have to do any of that. Maybe neurology aided in the derivation of the concept?ltlooking at an idiotgt Im the one who read the book and you didnt. And Im TELLING YOU it added nothing. It helped derive nothing. Not least because there is no derivation possible between brain matter and the mind. The mapping is intractable. And even if it werent intractable for ONE individual its a completely different mapping for each individual so trying to focus on or untangle it is the work of fucking idiots.Biologists do biology they dont get stuck on fucking chemistry the way you do. They dont say well maybe chemistry is useful for deriving biology. Not least because they would be looked down on and scoffed at as utterly fucking retarded.gt Youre projecting your values onto the author. Granted what youre saying does make sense and if he wanted to change peoples understanding he would have connected it to neurology in some manner. Most people are incapable of playing with concepts they cant relate to.Which would be why I told his story from your types point of view despite having evidence that it isnt his.

Life is not the deliberate result of someone or something engineering a system for the purpose of propagation and selfpreservation.

But youve gotta see it from the other perspective too. Selfrighteous moralistic virtue signalers are annoying Im sorry but its true. You may not be like that but many vegetarians are. And Im not insecure about it I am confident I can deal with their arguments. Im confident theres nothing immoral about eating meat.

Most INPTs do very well after jumping to a new job because they learn quickly and bring in new ideas  approaches.  Once they become a necessity in the team their performance actually goes down because being a necessity  usually means able to perform some task predictably and repeatedly  exactly the sort of thing that fails to play to INTP strengths.  INTPs are at their best when they are on the borderline of failing because they are doing something new and challenging within a field they are good at.Best thing that ever happened to me was I got fired from two jobs in under a year.  I didnt let it upset me because I knew Id thrown my best efforts at them and am not incompetent or stupid they just needed somebody with a different skillset or more experience which was also pretty easy to explain in interviews when looking for another job.Ended up with a  pay raise each time I found a new one which took about  weeks each time and then got another  bump when my temp job converted to direct hire.  Ive been in that job  years and its a good job but the only thing keeping me there is I cant find one that pays better and to boot lets me work from home  I havent seen my coworkers for many months just do online chat.

10741156,0,t1_ddnencx,Yeah tea is a great use of stems. Seems like youve got the right idea with vaping I really think that its superior. Uses less great highs easier on the lungs and youre not getting any chemicals from lighters in your lungs. Like I said the ash from vape bowls is more of a crispy  brown than a burnt black so you can use that leftover for peanut butter sandwiches but since you seem to be in a place where it isnt a problem cookies brownies and shit like that works as well.For breathing I think that it does vary. For a vape I have a PAX  so I dont have to put anything in my mouth per say but its the same regardless. I treat it like I am sucking through a straw except like  slower. I use about half of a normal breath to suck in vapor but to make sure that it gets down into my lungs I pull the vape away from me and use the other half of my breath to suck the vapor down with air if that makes sense. That method has never failed me for any type of smoking whether it be vapes bowls pipes bongs etc. Taking breaths in between has helped me as well since like you said it keeps oxygen coming in and helps reduce coughing. Since youre in California and are married assuming you can now buy recreationally sounds like youve got it all going on in that respect. And yeah pain seems to be greatly reduced for me as well. I have a really shitty back despite being a strapping young buck so smoking has helped relieve multiple back throw outs for me. Its a neat substance.

10756307,0,t3_5tuaqd,Currently a NEET. I finished sixth form in  and have done pretty much nothing since then. I suffer from severe social anxiety which has stopped me from getting a job. I spend a small amount of time each day doing chores so my family dont kick me out and then the rest is free time. I honestly cant say Ive achieved anything in the last year and a half. I mainly play video games read books and go on long walks while listening to music. I did start learning to crochet recently which is fun. But most of the stuff I want to do needs money which I cant get until my anxietys more manageable. Its more of a neutral experience than a positive or negative one. Lots of time drifts by without me noticing. Theres a great song by The Flaming Lips called Up Above the Daily Hum that describes it perfectly. I do feel like Ive discovered a kind of limbo. By far the best part is that Im no longer forced to be around people. I see a friend once a month or less which suits me fine.A couple of times a month Ill have a day where I feel like absolute scum for leeching off my parents and having nothing to contribute to society. Its generally very intense but asides from those days Im content. I do want a job though. I recently had six sessions of CBT where I tried to get help for my anxiety but I was so anxious I literally couldnt speak in any of them. When I can bring mself to Ill make a doctors appointment and try to get medication. Hopefully thatll help enough to allow me to get a job and then eventually Ill go to uni.That turned into a wall oops.Tldr anxiety made me a NEET lots of empty time occasionally feel immense guilt for being like this but generally content.,INTP,ddpfkut,1,t5_2qhvl

So too most people consider doing nothing to NOT be a form of doing. Much like rockets arent a form of void and the Earth isnt a form of empty space and Mount Everest isnt a kind of hole.I observed the perpetrator rape and murder the victim your honor.So you admit you didnt do anything?No your honor I observed. Observation is doing something.I see unfortunately this court has another interpretation following common sense. Criminal negligence is a crime for which the penalty is quite severe..Watching is not doing anything. Seeing isnt doing anything. DECIDING isnt doing anything. Planning isnt doing anything. THINKING isnt doing anything.But learning yes learning IS doing something. Its a metacapability the capability of acquiring capabilities. And all capabilities thieving stealing murdering punching massaging cocksucking are DOING something.Does Socionics help you to learn? Does it help you to learn peoples languages? No it does not! All it does is tell you these other languages EXIST. It doesnt do FUCK ALL to tell you whats in them or even to define them. archetypes provides you the fundamental underlying concepts of all those languages. AS A START. Because  archetypes IS a language. It has a REGULAR GRAMMAR. There are WORDS in  archetypes and each of those words is related to other words by regular grammar.Lets take the word Worf Son of Mogh. It corresponds  with the word in core value space honor. As in I am Worf son of Mogh I care about and my life is HONO HONO HONOR! And this word is related to OTHER words like Jethro Gibbs and Marquis from Worm Serial Novel. And it COMBINES WITH other words such as JeanLuc Picard in a REGULAR FASHION!Socionics doesnt have any grammar. There are no rules between words just rules for the creation of words from individual letters. And then you end up with a word and you say isnt it shiny? and get on everyones nerves like a toddler telling his parents about cat ... repeatedly cat cat cat CAT cat!. And then you utter degenerate sentences like He is INTPA as if they mean anything. As if car were a sentence. As if Worf son of Mogh were a sentence! When theyre ONE FUCKING WORD.He is INTPA is no more a sentence in any language than A is A. A sentence is Worf son of Mogh is utterly pathetic compared to Marquis you need to level up you spineless bastard. Which at least is A ltlt B.And all your stupid ass socionics this type has healthy relationships to that type is just rhyming in poetry. automobile rhymes with snowmobile. Its syntax not grammar..Socionics is NEITHER a tool for doing anything NOR a language you can speak in. Im not even sure  archetypes is a language but I know its at least a tool. And after contemplating it now no it isnt a language. Ive constructed languages around  archetypes but  archetypes isnt a language despite being a thousand times more complex than fucking socionics.gtgtTime Lordgtgt what archetype is that? im guessing High NiDid you never find it the least bit suspicious that youre speaking in letters like a fucking toddler?I do not speak in letters. I am a grownup  year old! Not a fucking infant like you! I manage to do arithmetic!gt everything can be based off of those cognitive functions the only limit is your Ne.everything can be based off of superstrings thats why we use them in biology!DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORD EMERGENCE FUCKING MEANS YOU RETARDED FUCKING MORON?!gtgtWho the fuck uses socionics? Nobody. Who the fuck uses Character Alignment? Everybody.gtgt Bandwagon fallacy? come on man step it up.Fallacy fallacy? People who get hung up on fallacies are retarded morons who cant think. They get hung up on the procedures of thinking rather than the fucking result. Like small children who have to do long division by hand. Or long multiplication.

Though I am beginning to make more of a conscious effort to deal with these thoughts and feelings as they come instead of trying to immediately suppress them down to a dull nag or trying to reason them away.

10970627,0,t1_deat6c9,Its a good argument alright but its not entirely about eternity vs finity. It has to do with the nature of perfection.Theres two stances on perfection. The first stance is that in order to be perfect you have to be able to deal with imperfections. The second more pure stance is that nothing perfect can be corrupted with knowledge of imperfection.And these stances arent from theology by the way theyre from computer science and software construction. So applying them to God its pretty obvious the first isnt the case and the second must be.God has no understanding of Evil since the whole concept is beyond a perfect entity. As even small children whove watched The Last Unicorn know.As for God being omnibenevolent while letting Evil happen in Creation. You would be surprised how much Evil truly omnibenevolent human beings sanction tolerate and APPROVE OF.So one doesnt even need to appeal to nonunderstanding of Evil. Nonjudgment of and charitability towards Evil people works just fine.There are multiple forms of perfection and some forms allow for omnibenevolence AND runaway Evil.

I view giving an advice as a mental game in which I can put myself in someone elses shoes and see the world from a different perspective.On the other hand if the advice they seek only has one logical answer Id give that one and be quite blunt about it.

Also History and English essays tend to require a lot of investigation skills such as analysis careful thinking and creativity.By the same token Philosophy and Foreign Languages train the soft skills needed to work and find your way into academia but it has a slight difference emphasis. Philosophy trains your logical thinking skills which are great if you are studying STEM fields. The reading Ive been doing in an intro to Philosophy class is a lot less than what I would do in a History or English class. Id say  pages in a Philosophy class is the norm which is not crazy.According to this sourceHistory and English amp Literature Degree holders earn one of the biggest median salaries for humanities degrees. Both degrees are less abstract than Philosophy. Regardless of this any degree can be employable as long as you have the skills that are required to succeed in the real world e.g programming foreign languages internships letter of recommendations and... grades  which matter more in graduate school.

Watch where your judgement comes fromwhere it goes. Anger is such an unproductive emotion and thats frustrating within itself. Id recommend meditation but if youre like me and have trouble sticking to a routine journaling might be a good alternative. I find writing has the ability to clear my mind and reset my mood at least temporarily. Also it helps to actively appreciate the people you like in your life  takes your mind off of people who frustrate you who youre unlikely to change tbh and is a good start to fostering a positive perspective on life.But if your issues are more serious than they seem here ie wanting to harm yourself or someone elsefeeling completely and utterly out of control opposed to frustratedthese feelings negatively impacting your ability to live life seeking help would be a good next step to take. ,INTP,df7bk61,5,t5_2qhvl

11258458,0,t3_60mnil,I do not believe this is true generally although their are edge cases where the ntj has an advantage. First memory is tied to emotional response. An NTJ may get an emotional charge out of finding the next piece of information that moves the puzzle along while a NTP might be taking in all available information and finding use for the information is not their immediate concern so there is no emotional weight to the information because the act of acquiring it is separate from its utility. But the NTP has an advantage memorizing information without obvious immediate utility precisely because they are not trying to find its utility and learn it at the same time.Second memory is a skill and if an NTJ finds a use for that skill he can quickly develop it through practice.

The pop media craze made it sound like there are habitable planets everywhere yet we cant be sure of any of that without further study.Some factors to consider. Is the planet within the goldilocks zone where it would be possible for there to be liquid water on the surface?. Does the planet have the right chemical composition to allow life to form?. Does the planet have an atmosphere thick enough to protect from ultraviolet radiation yet thin enough not to cause a runaway greenhouse effect like Venus?. Was the planet adequately shielded from the star to prevent the atmosphere from getting stripped away like Mars?. Was the planet too close to its host star meaning it gets hit regularly with extreme flares? This is an important issue when discussing planets around red dwarf stars M Dwarfs as the goldilocks zone is much closer to those stars than our own and those stars tend to send out violent flares.Many of these questions we can not adequately answer yet. We are mostly limited to answering  with a few instances of being able to answer  via spectral analysis. Even then were just guessing.

That said life is a little more complex than dont think about the past or the future keep your mind in the present.Depression is the total loss of confidence in yourself. There are a lot more factors involved than just a preoccupation with the negatives of the past. No confidence no selfesteem no hope no energy no joy no faith in ones own ability just barely existing and having a fundamental fear that it will never change in the future. That was depression for me.Im not a naturally anxious person. I do know it can be forward looking but it can also look back even inward. What if it is just undirected anxiety in the present? Anxiety is the fear you wont be able to stop a negative thing happening to you whatever that thing might be. That doesnt necessarily mean you are stuck on future doom scenarios.I know you are trying to help but to truly help you need more flesh to your theoretical bones.,INTP,dfnedyd,1,t5_2qhvl

A retainer should be able to become substantial too if he takes a good retainer as his model.Today however there are no models of good retainers. In light of this it would be good to make a model and to learn from that. To do this one should look at many people and choose from each person his best point only. For example one person for politeness one for bravery one for the proper way of speaking one for correct conduct and one for steadiness of mind. Thus will the model be made.

But you gotta admit transitioning kinda sucks in a lot of ways even if it helps you finally feel like you belong in your body which must be an amazing feeling after not having it for so long. Hormones arent that big a deal and plenty of cis women have to be on them anyway but top surgery is a real bitch and SRS is incredibly invasive surgery with farfromperfect results.  Often folks who dont figure out theyre trans until adulthood have to deal with dysphoria long after transitioning  if youre  with a barrel chest and large hands and bone structure that clearly came from XY and testosterone during puberty and you want a female body you are likely going to experience dysphoria even after hormones and SRS.

Thus OP is likely an INTP at least selfassessed. On average INTPs are near the top or at least the top half of intelligence scales McCaulley amp Kainz  McCaulley amp Natter  Myers in Myers amp McCaulley . OP claims to explain why any fact is false. This is not a trivial feat and requires a postgraduate understanding of beliefs knowledge justification probabilities bayesian epistemology rhetoric and critical thinking Were talking about the kind of thought exercises that puzzled the great Alan Turing .  OP is either A a person possessing mental deficiencies that lead to delusion or B possessing the intelligence capable of finding fault with any fact an epistemological device. Average intelligence can be defined in terms of the average knowledge and understanding of facts. In the US this bar is regrettably lowTherefore my belief that OP is above average in intelligence is a justified belief with support based on probabilities So my conclusion based on evidence is that OP is above average in intelligence.Now your initial proposal is Tell me a fact and Ill explain why its false. OP can be one of the following. Averageintelligence or below deluded into thinking they can debunk any fact.. Aboveaverage intelligence capable of masterslevel epistemological devices.If you choose option  you will have shown that my fact is incorrect and thus all of your refutations of facts are mere delusions and this thread is pointless.If you choose option  you will admit that there are indeed facts that you cannot refute.,INTP,dg5za3h,54,t5_2qhvl

I have known a few awesome people people that were full of good values and dreams and then I have seen life kinda get to them and then they become somewhat more shallow.I try not to judge too harshly I understand life got to them they did what everyone else does and they did what they felt they needed to do to play the games they were involved in and to get the things they wanted.,INTP,dgp9hqh,1,t5_2qhvl

Personally i would only use these tactics if im forced too like a dire situation where I know my solution right and some influential retard   oppose me and the only way to save the group os tp adapt new tactics or as counterattack agaisnt other princes seeking to gain more power and cause conflict  within a group.,INTP,dgrsoe2,1,t5_2qhvl

11767813,0,t3_67kwu1,Hey ENTPs are lazy and whatever but I make plans all of the time I have the next  years of my life all figured out in my head. The difference between ENTPs and the other types is that ENTPs are always looking for shortcuts and detours. ,INTP,dgtwul5,1,t5_2qhvl
11769437,0,t1_dgu3an1,I used the vague pronouns for a reason. Creating those cultural land mines is an example of forcing your will on another. They are forcing their will on you in that case. Live and let live. ,INTP,dgu3hp8,2,t5_2qhvl
11772194,0,t3_67y2re,I view it as something that should never be taken as the holy grail of personality definition but should recognized as a fair approximation and analysis of the general types of people that exist. Nothing is absolute but it does an okay job of categorizing individuals according to their methods of observation and response to stimuli. Stereotypes exist for a reason right?,INTP,dgues89,1,t5_2qhvl

11801952,0,t3_68asgo,Over the years Ive taken it maybe half a dozen times the last time being about a year and a half ago. The first couple of times I took it I got INTJ but as I got into my later twenties I started getting INTP instead. Its never been a very strong J or P which is why I identify fairly well with both personality types. Ultimately though I identify more with the more abstract internally focused and occasionally aimless INTP brain.,INTP,dgxsj1f,1,t5_2qhvl

11809634,0,t1_dgyk3is,Your honesty is nothing short of astonishing thank you a lot for your insight! From now on I will be much more careful with INTPs and their feelings.I guess we both have to help each other out of the holes we dug.Same is true about ENTPs and our outgoing nature. Yes I might be the loudest guy in the party arguing with everyone about everything but back at home I will be writing down all the reasons I shouldnt kill myself and struggling to find a single one. This girl has became the first one. Thank you a lot again!,INTP,dgynvnq,1,t5_2qhvl
