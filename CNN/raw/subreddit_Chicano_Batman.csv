10997184,0,t3_5x01z3,I just ordered the Black Lipstick  vinyl yesterday and I have the new signed Freedom is Free album coming in the mail. I also have the  ItotianiStoned Soul Picnic single vinyl that Im super lucky to have gotten my hands on  .,Chicano_Batman,deehwk5,1,t5_3jaga
11074713,0,t3_5y3as6,Wow...they changed that. When it was listed for sale it was Autographed Freedom Is Free Opaque Orange Vinyl. But now in the cart theyve added autographed booklet as an item. Still cool but this is SUPER MISLEADING. An autographed folded poster isnt nearly as cool as an autographed limited edition LP. But the LP itself is still limited...and apparently almost sold out...and the songs are great!,Chicano_Batman,denb4iu,2,t5_3jaga
