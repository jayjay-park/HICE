10504309,0,t1_dcxmkm5,Im most definitely biased here but we wouldnt be interested in excluding women even if we could. We are intentionally inclusive because it makes for a better community. That being said it is important for the women to not drown out the men. So if you ever experience a woman trying to invalidate your experiences a man please report it to us. If you think a woman doesnt understand nuances unique to men educate her. Most of the women are here as allies and as students seeking to understand mens issues better. Were stronger as a team here ya know?,MensGlib,dcyrwst,2,t5_3b3ve
