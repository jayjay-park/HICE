740898,0,t1_cgohgnz,Thats pretty much how I fall on it also. I understand the draft restrictions in a way but also recognize that if you open up the money for internationals you would have to extend the same to draft eligible players. The bigger issue I have is that practical economic theory tells us that this will only make things worse when it comes to the dealings in Latin America and alike. The old system allowed for open purchase of players free from hiding how much it cost. If you wanted to blow  million on a guy you could. Nobody thought anything of it. Now though? This will fester the use of agents. The most direct comparison I can think of is how AAU coaches are now acting as secondary agents funneling their players to certain universities in exchange for payoffs or perks. This already goes on but its only going to be amplified.Seligs logic was to allow fairness in the market but in the same year the Rangers spent  million out of country the Dodgers spent . It speaks to your point about teams making the choice. Im not sitting here saying all teams are financially equal. It comes down to front office philosophy and scouting however. Im not a big fan of the commissioners office telling teams how they can or cant use their money on non MLB controlled assets. ,TexasRangers,cgohtzf,2,t5_2rrdy

Everything would have to go perfectly for them to be very good next year and often as you said it just doesnt. Theyll likely have some injury problems next year as well. Pitching is their main problem right now and even if we pick up a middle of the rotation SP we still need to find decent  SPs too. We could probably stand to get a couple more pieces in the pen too seeing as they will be maxed out this year.

1711169,0,t3_2e0h02,Questiongt Hey Thad Im a Rangers fan at T.C. Williams. What do you think about Odors development at the big league level? Do you take him or Profar at B next season? Answergt Great to hear. Good luck the rest of the way at TC Williams. Odor and Profar are both extremely talented. In addition with Sardinas and Elvis we have what we believe to be  of the better middle infielders in the game. I think that there will be a lot of competition in spring training next year.Questiongt What qualities do you look for when looking to acquire a player whether it be through a trade or draft or free agent signing? Do you only look into their baseball skills or does PR image and other non baseball qualities play apart in the decision? Answergt We look for high end talent good work ethics and great qualities as a teammate. Questiongt Thank you for doing this! Growing up Ive watched the Rangers almost every night and followed every move hoping to be able to tell my friends about that World Series championship my team had after some really rough times in the past. I wanna say thank you for helping keep that dream alive and I think most of us understand the injuries this year arent a GM issue. My question for you is this how do the Rangers feel about the way Michael Young and Ian Kinsler were handled in the public eye? Those two were incredibly passionate for the Rangers and it looked like they loved this city and team but it felt very unceremonious when both of them were traded away. Some people observe loyalty as quality in a franchise over winning. How do you balance the wins and keeping the leaders of the clubhouse around? Thank you for your time and go Rangers! Keep Mr. CHOO CHOO healthy if you can and wish all of DL favorites a perfect recovery!Answergt I think that you have identified one of our biggest challenges. We have always aspired to have as many impact players year to year but never aspired to have the same players. That being said we have learned from every move that we have made and especially those two. Questiongt What charity would you chose when setting up a fantasy team on  What charities are you involved with?Answergt I am an impartial participant. We are trying to redirect as much money as possible to worthy causes. We have  preferred nonprofits featured on the site all are tremendous causes. Thank you for participating.Questiongt Are you going to avoid trading with Theo Epstein and the Chicago Cubs in the near future?Answergt As a function of the Cubs rebuilding and us going for it we have made a number of trades with them that were short term decisions for us. We hope to continue to develop our own and see them succeed for the Rangers. That being said we are extremely creative and will continue to explore all means to give us a better chance to bring a championship to the Dallas  Ft Worth metroplexQuestiongt What do you believe is the Rangers single biggest organisational weakness and how would you ideally address it? Answergt You can never have enough pitching. We will continue to scout draft sign and develop as many talented pitchers as possible. Questiongt Whats the best life advice you can give someone?Answergt Identify your passion and never ever stop pursuing it. The reward when you get to live your passion is immeasurable.Questiongt Is Dallas a baseball town? Answergt Without a doubt. The stadium is electric especially when we are doing well.Questiongt Ive been a Rangers fan since  when I got into baseball. I bought an MLB video game and that is what got me into baseball. What got you into baseball and what tips can you give to someone trying to get involved in a professional sports organization? Thanks for doing this!Answergt My father gave me a genetic gift of love of the game. He took me to games from the age of  all the way until I went to college. He never stopped educating me about the beauty of baseball. I owe my passion to him. I am living out this dream career for the both of us.Questiongt With the rangers season lost due mainly to injuries and lack of starting pitching how do you approach the off season as a GM? Do you trade for sign big name starters or do you trust the farm and hope to call up MLB ready pitchers?Answergt Our mantra as we approach this off season is to get back to out scouting teams rather than relying on out spending teams. We will make smart targeted free agent acquisitions but i would expect us to be more active on the trade and development fronts.Questiongt Have you ever eaten a Boomstick? If so did you finish it?Answergt Our health insurance doesnt cover complications due to boomstick consumption so i havent risked it yet.Questiongt How did you get your foot in the door at your first baseball job? How did you work your way up to assistant GM? Any tips for someone with similar aspirations?Answergt I had two terrific contacts Josh Byrnes and Paul DePodesta. I was tireless in my pursuits. And i tried to develop my communication and analytical skills as best that i could to be an asset to a front office.Questiongt In your opinion good pitching beats good hitting or vice versa? Answergt I do think that good pitching tends to beat good hitting. That being said in  we were one pitch away from proving that good hitting can beat good pitching. Its about creating a competitive advantage.Questiongt Thank you so much for doing this AMA. I have been a Rangers fan my entire life Im up in Yankees territory watching every game through mlb.tv and this front office has definitely earned my trust even through the craziness of this season. I have a couple of Rangers specific questions if you dont mind. Since opening the concourse behind home plate the jet stream seems effectively dead. Does the front office believe that Globe Life Park is pitcher neutral now? With the restrictions regulations and penalties now in place will the Rangers focus less on Latin America than they have in the past several years? To the not so casual observer it seems that the Rangers have focused less on speed and baserunners and more on fly ball hitters. When putting together a team do you try to stack a certain skillset balance or just put together the best pieces you can that year? Finally would you mind giving some insight on anything that the general public doesnt normally hear about what Ron Washington brings to the club? Things like what you mentioned between him and Josh Hamilton today are really insightful.Answergt Great observation. The ballpark has played neutral this year. Probably should let it play out another year or two before drawing conclusions but the drop in power is noteworthy. We will always explore every means of scouting great up and coming talent. Regardless the rules and restrictions we believe in our scouts and will always pursue their recommendations. Wash has always wanted a team capable of winning in a variety of ways so we have tried to be as balanced as possible. Wash is the best morale manager that i have ever seen. His ability to make every player feel as if he is going to be the player of the game is so genuine and pays dividends each and every night.Questiongt Do you have significantly more information than the public sabermetricly speaking? Ive heard things like you guys having ball off the bat speed advanced complex metrics etc. What advice do you have for me as my dream is to work in a major league front office? Im currently going to school for mechanical engineering but I love baseball so much Id take any spot immediately and still graduate of courseAnswergt We do have ball off the bat velocity but i think that is becoming mainstream as well. Other than scouting reports i would assume most sabermetric innovations coexist between front offices and the public domain. Stay true to your passion. I went pre Med and got an English Major so know that all educational foundations can lend themselves to success in baseball.Questiongt When yall try to convince pitchers to come to Texas is the heat a big issue for a lot of them? Ive always heard that Cliff Lee didnt want to pitch in our heat and I feel like weve had some trouble landing some of the guys we wanted because of it.Answergt When we started in our current roles in  pitchers were reluctant to come to play here mostly because it was a hitters park and the heat. Once we started winning and ever since pitchers have aggressively pursued us. Turns out playing for a winner is an amazing aphrodisiac. Questiongt Thad thanks for doing this AMA. Big Rangers fan since before I can even remember going to games at Arlington Stadium!  Questions Since youve been at the Rangers what do you believe is the nd best trade the FO has made? Texiera deals gotta be . Id say one of the brightest spots in this season has been watching Rougned Odor and see him develop defensive instincts pop behind the plate and an overall solid chemistry with this team. Im curious how much of this was expected versus how much was a pleasant surprise?Answergt A few trades jump to mind. Never really have ranked them. Mench and Cordero for Carlos Lee and Nelson Cruz. Frankie Francisco for Mike Napoli. And Edinson Volquez for Josh Hamilton. Every time that i saw Rougned play in the minors I walked away thinking that he was the best baseball player not always the best prospect on the field. He is going to have a very bright future.Questiongt How did you get a job in baseball? Also what classes should I take in high schoolcollege to help me get a job in baseball?Answergt I wouldnt tell you to take specific classes. I would encourage you to develop your analytical communication and Spanish language skills.Character limit reached continued in comment below.,TexasRangers,cjuus9k,7,t5_2rrdy

If what he said is true and he left because he cheated on his wife I think it makes him look like a hypocrite. He blasted Yu Darvish just weeks ago for what he thought was quitting on the team and then he goes off and quits.I understand that a marriage is different than an injury but I dont think it was chickenshit that he caused a bunch of trouble for Yu and then he quits because of his actions.

2524006,0,t1_cmnt9iq,There has been a lot of research on player aging dating all the way back to Bill James in the s.  Its generally but not universally agreed upon that the peak age for a baseball player is .  A little older for hitters and a little younger for pitchers.  It seems that hitters with certain skill sets decline slower than average Speed is a big one and drawing walks is probably next.  Luckily Choo has both of those traits.  Having power also helps and while Choo isnt really a power hitter he probably does have better than average power.For him I think its all going to come down to health.  Statistically Choo and Rusty Greer are actually pretty similar.  We know what happened to Greer.  On the other hand Bobby Abreu is also pretty similar to Choo.  We know that he stayed healthy and aged pretty well into his s.    ,TexasRangers,cmo0wl6,2,t5_2rrdy

3093216,0,t1_coiiqd3,Moncada has already made it clear he wants to sign as soon as possible and for a kid who has no income at the moment and probably little in the way of savings I wanna say even the best Cuban players get paid something stupid like mo I doubt he has the luxury of waiting around to see how much he can drive up the bidding. Plus I just dont see Rangers ownership being okay with signing Moncada. The  penalty has to be paid in one lump sum to the MLB so if the Rangers hypothetically sign Moncada for MM then ownership has to come up with MM to fork over as soon as the signing is official. Add to that how much JD had to fight ownership to convince them to pursue Darvish and invest in him I dont see JD being able to make his case to ownership this time around with more financial commitments on the books and tighter payroll compared to the  offseason. Oh yeah and the Rangers do have Profar and Odor as ablebodied B who are cheaper and known quantities already.

Alas Beltre will bring the most. Elvis isnt going anywhere due to his contact. Holland is a keep and a veteran presents. So are Prince and Choo but I guess to me they still feel new to me. Overall I think you are right we Will likely be settlers come trade deadline. Unless we are close to contention or unless some of our young talent just seems primed and ready to go.

4789341,0,t1_cty6mjp,Hollands personality has always annoyed me.  I think hes kind of a dope.  And if they had a crystal ball way back when yeah it would have been smart to trade him.  He has given this team very little the past two seasons.  Very very little.  I also think youre right to be skeptical about Holland going forward.  His age probably isnt a problem but missing two years...we dont know whats going to happen with him.But as far as talent goes we disagree.  The kid can pitch or at least he used to be able to.  At age  his  was really nice.  Derailed by illness in .  In  he was brilliant.  Lost seasons in  and .

5385707,0,t3_3osgu2,Elvis Andrus is my favorite baseball player.  First jersey I ever bought.  Every year I keep thinking it will be the one that he makes the leap to being elite but it just hasnt happened yet.  He is pretty much the same player as he was when he came into the league at .  He really came up short in several big moments tonight.  Maybe this is just me being overprotective of my favorite player but I think the Rangers need to hire a sports psychologist to help their players with the mental side of the game.  I know a lot of other professional sports teams do this and maybe the Rangers have one already but if that is the case then they need to hire a better one because time after time this team has cracked under pressure.,TexasRangers,cw031yw,6,t5_2rrdy

5393397,0,t1_cw127dh,I think he can still be useful but I dont think the Rangers can count on him to be a top  outfielder.  Its been a long time since he played at that level.  First half of  I would guess.  Thats a long time for a guy on the wrong side of .Addiction isnt only a mental demon.  Its very much a physical one as well.  Additionally Hamilton has put his body through a lot on the field in addition to the substance abuse.  Hes not just going to snap back into MVP form.  The skills arent there like they used to be.  Reaction time slows as we age.  Hes become quite injury prone.So realistically you get what you can out of him but you dont count on him.  Hes maybe capable of having a good season but a lot would have to go right for him.,TexasRangers,cw12epa,3,t5_2rrdy

5568781,0,t1_cwmiomb,Because it is pretty easy to find a guy to hit at an above average rate that cant play any defense. See Kendrys Morales Mike Napoli past  years etc.  There are a surplus of good hitters that cannot play any defense. On the other hand it is incredibly hard to find even a major league average hitter who can play shortstop defensively. If you compare Prince Fielders offensive stats to other DHs his numbers are roughly average for a DH especially adjusted for park. The  qualifying DHs this past year were Cruz Encarnacion Abreu Ortiz ARod Morales Pujols Fielder Gattis and Butler. Even the worst Butler and Gattis were still league average hitters. On the other hand only  of  qualifying SSs were roughly league average hitters. It is a question of scarcity. Just about every team can find an above average hitter to play DH. It isnt hard to replace them. Most teams can find a Mike Napoli level hitter if they need one. They are therefore less valuable.,TexasRangers,cwncwne,1,t5_2rrdy
5599574,0,t3_3rthuk,He could accept it though its not likely. Its interesting to see this new wonky system start to shake out after everyone has gotten used to it. Seems GMs have benefited the most from it while players like Kyle Lohse and Nelson Cruz found trouble getting signed. Gallardo isnt a pillow contract candidate though the .mm deal would be more than hed get next season signing any other contract.

Its against the rules to go hard into second like that especially after Bautista does than and then gets in his face. Could have ended his season like Tejada. I guess thats why that rule was made and I dont blame him. Bautista thought he was larger than life and the new rule didnt apply to him with that slide. Bautista was winding up too he just happend to get railed props to bautista for keeping his jaw shut and absorbing it though. That didnt look like the first time Rougned has punched someone. After Beltre playfully full nelsoned that hot head he stopped being a fuckhead. I think the bullshit is over with Bautista. Prince Fielder was even nonchalant about getting beaned. This team shows fight and composure they need an enforcer like Rougned. If its not us I hope they go further. I miss the old rules when there was a brawl with AJ  Hes gonna get  games though and for a newer fan its gonna be interesting to see how his  wRC and hustle is going to be replaced. Fuck whatever hate and appreciate badass players. He tried to put an end to his shit and well see it in this years playoffs. FUN FACT Gonna say Robin was a sick player look up his fWAR numbers he had better seasons than any other player on the  team he managed. Would have been arguably the best player in his prime with teams hes managed.  ,TexasRangers,d3770ef,7,t5_2rrdy

Hes been very hot recently and finally got a win despite having the worst run support in the AL last time out so we all have our hopes up.  With just one lefty in your starting lineup tonight smart move I wouldnt expect to see the slider much which he has showcased in a few of his best games. It will be mostly sinkers with some FBChange action sprinkled in the ndrd time through the lineup. Mid s good movement on the off speed.

It was and still is a perplexing situation.I dont see Choo being the DH although Id like to. What well likely see is Choo at RF Mazara at LF and Desmond at CF with Prince continuing to DH. Rua should be playing over Prince. Choo should be DH as Mazara is arguably slightly better defensively.

8002827,0,t1_d4fkr78,Well the only top level prospects that are level of might be good are probably Ortiz and Tate.  Gallos power will play at the MLB level whether hell be a star who knows but the floor is still very productive.  Brinsons defense is so good hell almost certainly be a productive player at his floor.  Mazara is obviously off limits.  I wouldnt trade Profar given what our record has been with him up we barely noticed missing Odor and Beltre when he was playing.  I doubt you could get a return comparable to what hes done for the team so far. There are certainly other prospects we can trade Cordell Ibanez DDJ level guys that should net some good relievers without hurting any long term outlook.  We have to remember Desmond and Moreland are gone next year.  Were gonna need a first baseman and likely another outfielder as I dont think Brinson will be ready bat wise unless he turns  around.  Im not opposed to moving Brinson Gallo Tate or Ortiz in the right trade.  But I want a controllable starter and a depth bullpen piece if one or more are included in a trade.  I wouldnt move Profar unless it was an absolute ace were getting back.,TexasRangers,d4fldk0,2,t5_2rrdy

8556148,0,t1_d6b2aq3,Well sure there isnt a lock down available for us.  Id argue the only truly lock down closer this year is Britton then a ladder below is Chapman.  I have no problem with Dyson closing...however Id rather not have him be defined as THE closer.  Let a committee do it for the situation.  Jeffress can close Diek has showed he can Bush def has the stuff to close if hes mentally capable I think Kela is the closer of the future even Barnette was a great closer in Japan.  So Id just rather have the flexibility of having no one defined as that.  Once you define Dyson as the closer obviously any guy in the league wants that position title and will be upset if its taken. Its a several million dollar a difference in income of course it matters to them.  Just  cents but Im not uncomfortable with Dyson closing and in that Ballpark Id want a sink baller all day i.e. Jeffress or Dyson. ,TexasRangers,d6b3du2,1,t5_2rrdy

We will survive. We are grooming Profar and like all the trade talk. Dodgers are going to ask for Profar and Gallo. Which as you could see by JDs stance this past July talks.

He always had a gun for an arm and once was considered our closerinwaiting.  Happy to see him back and possibly playing a crucial lateinning role again.

I dont know why it always seems to be the assholes who can afford tickets to these playoff games road amp home.Admittedly I havent been to many Blue Jays games I live on the East Coast of Canada. But the ones I have been to have been nothing but fun and civil. One of the games Ive been to was the epic inning marathon in which Darvish had a great game against Buehrle and the Rangers came back to hand Jansen his first blown save of the year.Maybe Im speaking from the standpoint of a Jays fan who doesnt live in Toronto like the majority of fans and those that live in Toronto are much more rabid. I honestly cant say for sure.Believe it or not I didnt make my way over to the sub to defend Jays fans I was just curious how excited the Rangers fans were for this upcoming series. Call me naive I guess. But I didnt realize how much most Jays fans needed to be defended fuck the assholes until I read through the posts outside the Jays sub. Primarily because most really arent as bad as it apparently seems.So as you watch the upcoming series just please keep in mind should shit go down I hope they dont the few do not represent the many.

9195611,1,t1_d8h7x6f,If you follow baseball in general a lot of people have issues with Bautista. He is one of the bigger dbags in the league. He will pretend to throw a ball in to the stands to fake out child fans of opposing teams. He was caught doing this against KC last year. In no way was that a cheap shot first he slid in to Odor then he got in his face Odor pushed him back and then Bautista came back at him. Anyone in the situation you should expect to get hit if you dont you gout lucky.Not a cheap shot in any way. If you look what Donaldson did charging out of the dugout that was a cheap shot he was throwing punches at people not looking at him. if someone pushes you away from them and you come back at them you better expect to be hit. ,TexasRangers,d8hm0rv,1,t5_2rrdy
