3940221,0,t1_cr5erys,I forgot to mention it specialy I asked about House of Snoo only. Rising has the  mark one with the doffs and commodities. Perhaps I am online at the wrong times but I see  of the time the project with  marks around  no special project and  the k mark one. just a feeling no actual measuring  .Commodities are easy since each of it is buyable trough the replicator but to get  Fcredit for k EC is problematic and you need k EC to fill all up and get around k Fcredit for it. That isnt worth it that is why noone fill it up.,HouseOfSnoo,cr5f3bm,1,t5_2ulnl
