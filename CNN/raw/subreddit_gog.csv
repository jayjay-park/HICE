488603,0,t3_1zptk2,gt Bad influence. Just like the Roadrunner cartoons.gt gt Harvester the infamous adventure game exploring the darkest corners of human psyche and boasting graphic violence in the best tradition of bmovies is available in its uncensored version on GOG.com for only ..gt gt Remember this is all just a game. Youll play as the amnesiac Steve who is such a kidder! as you try to figure out why you should join the Order of the Harvest Moon and discover the horror that lurks just beneath Harvests smalltown veneer. Meet some of the strangest characters to ever grace the computer screensuch as Mr. Pottsdam who really really loves red meat or Colonel Monroe who guards the nuclear missile base and holds The Button. Harvest is a lovely town and the locals aim to keep it that way no matter the cost...gt gt Harvester is believed by some to be the inspiration for establishing the Entertainment Software Rating Board as the games first public showing at  CES caused enough controversy to take the debate over violence in games to a whole new level. This title takes every possible opportunity to throw gore and graphic violence at the player. It wasnt however designed only to shock the audience. Its trippy story taking off in smalltown America and touching down in massmurderville can easily be attributed with a deeper meaning. How dark is the darkness at the bottom of the human soul? In its own campy overthetop way this unique title looks for the answer to that question. With traditional puzzleoriented pointandclick gameplay liveaction sequences and characters portrayed by reallife actors this nearly  year old game is still more than enjoyable. That is if you can stomach the gore.gt gt If you want to see a game that would never have a chance to be made in modern times you really need a copy of Harvester for only . on GOG.com.gt gt PS. The GOG.com team would like to heartlily thank our longtime user and supporter tfishell whose help in securing the release rights for this title was invaluable!,gog,cfvt35o,1,t5_2sj1u

Maybe some strategy games. I went through a strategy game phase and it would be nice to play those again. When they popped up on the sale I bought for nostalgia. I bought Masters of Orion amp for pure nostalgia and the DampD bundle mostly for Baldurs Gate but I wanted to check out the couple more in the bundle. Baldurs Gate may be my favorite pick up. I spent a lot of hours in that game as a kid. I think my parents still have the original disks for it I wanted to instal it and play it before but one of the disks has been lost.

3801309,0,t1_cqpk49c,But here is the problem with this arguement You dont know how much money the buyer actually has.  A Ukrainian business man will most likely have a much higher incomewealth than a student in the UK.  So you are not pricing to actual individual income. Ok so you say you dont know individual income so well just do it by country.  Two blaring issues with this presumption.  First the pricing does not seem to be consistent with any one particular economic measurement.  I looked at GDP per capita income etc.  This does not explain pricing when compared to Ukraine UK or US.  What is the measure they are using?  And nd its only for some games!  So if you say ok we will adjust prices based on GDP or some other economic measure but we will only do it for  games out of s and then also adjust some of those  games by different percentages.  The entire system breaks down and there is no logic behind it or at least I can not find how they came up with only certain games at certain price adjustments.  Is there some objective measure they are using to price the games?  Furthermore there are only a few regions which is some how supposed to represent the entire world.  So its not based on country except in a few instances you can buy off of GOG without being in one of the regions.  Its not based on region in any typical fashion ie not continents.  So again I dont understand the system they use for the region designation.All the price adjustments seem completely arbitrary.  Its not uniform across countries with different wealth.  Its only for some games.  And then the discount varies between those games.I really dont get it.  If somebody could offer an explanation of the methodology I would be grateful.  Not sure what I am missing. ,gog,cqpkv5l,-8,t5_2sj1u

8276696,0,t3_4stk6h,GOG has consistent problems that havent been addressed and are already and will continue damaging its reputationFeature parity and update parity.The first one is when a game on GOG has cut down features such as Spelunky daily challenge only available on Steam Ultra Time Force exclusive Steam characters or the newest one Necropolis lacking any kind of multiplayer with the smallest text warning about coming in the future added post release to the store page.Update parity creeps pretty often but not in all games with updates released on Steam taking from several days to weeks or even months to appear on GOG if I recall correctly Ittle Dew went around  months missing  or  updates.In the first case it has never felt that GOG forces devs to either be transparent on the storefront or demand feature parity this lands a hefty amount of responsibility on them since this is put in their storefront which unlike Steam is heavily curated so both dev and GOG are both willingly lying by omission when this lack of features are not shown or theres a lack of control that goes to the detriment of the customers and ends damaging GOGs position. For one Im now used to double check features because I assume the GOG versions have less features by default.On the second case even tho it lies completely on the developer Ive never felt GOG has some measures in place to deal with this because theres either no communication or on forums you see a its the devs responsibility response which tells me theres no contract binding on updating the game on GOG when it has been updated somewhere else. This also makes it so GOG shares some responsibility on the matter.In general buying on GOG may feel like you are buying on a different platform rather than a different storefront and this will keep pushing people away instead of towards GOG if it keeps going as it has been.Last but not least Steam refunds are better period. But given the DRM Free nature of GOG theres nothing you can realistically do to close the breach because once you sell the game theres no way to take it back from the costumer. This is an advantage that Steam will always have but people that like DRM Free will most likely do their research more when buying games as well.,gog,d5c593y,7,t5_2sj1u
