Quite true when strictly consider the parameters as input and strictly consider the output as things returned by the return statement.But when you say for my example that inccounter has an additional input of the current state counter and a secret output counter output to append to stdout as well as the actual void return value all concatenated together then it acts exactly like a mathematical function.  You could argue that since it actually displays the output to append to stdout its not a real function but this happens even in a pure fp language like haskell your functions act on the IO monad which then acts on the change by displaying the output.This is quite similar to math you often dont explicitly state all the functional dependencies for compactness of notation.

Thats my feeling at least.On that I would agree. But there is a shift in many areas of NLP to start using deeper information i.e. semantic instead of just syntactic so natural assumption would be that accuracy has progressed sufficiently to start using them. Its quite an obstacle not to have a standard evaluation set like PTB is for syntactic parsing. I feel that would help drive deep parsing further.

I have single web pages that have K lines of code behind them more if you include the tests.   Most of this is surprisingly necessary.   Im quite confident that a great deal of the business logic in the various government agencies grew organically. healthcare.gov is an aggregator of information across a fair number of entities including the IRS Social Security Admin and a bunch of other agencies all of which Im sure have their own business logic system access controls and interfaces for access.  That alone is a nightmare. plus healthcare.gov has its entire own mess of business logic The law was I think  pages and then there were a ton of committees to write details on how to implement the actual law.  A lot of the decisions behind the site were surely on the fly. also healthcare.gov had to integrate with upwards of  businesses each of which had a selection of plans each of these businesses were also interpreting the law and also had probably never opened up their business processes to an outside aggregator. and healthcare.gov rolled out to  some odd states each with their own peculiarities including the fact that each state had their own plans available and pricing structures. then make it secure ADA compliant multilanguage compliant and fully integrated with extensive live support at any step of the process. then make the team developing it a mish mash of outside vendors government and legal types and have it run by politicians who are busy well politicking.    lastly feature business logic changes that were taking place as recently as a few weeks before going live to an immediate audience of nine figures.Note that google or facebook for example could scale over time add features at their choosing and didnt have to really interface with anyone particularly with systems such as the IRS which are profoundly important extremely valuable to hackers and massively complex in their own rights.Im neither defending nor attacking healthcare.gov but I do think most people dont appreciate the scale of what was going on.

Start your projects early. Avoid procrastination like the plague its a terrible habit and Ive seen it ruin people.. If you work with people be smart about it. Dont be afraid to ask other students for help or give it to them. Do be afraid of being caught for cheating.    The cheaters the bad ones at least get caught.. The math is not that hard but it can be difficult to grasp. The theory behind computer science scares a lot of people away. Im not all that great at it but I find it facinating once I understand it.. Finally the most important one of all get out and have some fun chat with your classmates because lets face it you will use each other. Some will get the theory others will be better at prgramming others developing test cases. the major can be extremely stressful and at times at least at my university  unrelenting.

1552177,0,t1_cjasajg,First you should take an algorithms course to learn about asymptotic notation also known as big O notation and how to analyze algorithms.  Very roughly when you say ON that means that when N gets really large if you double the problem size to N its going to take  times longer.  Imagine the exact running time was some function fN  .  N   N   N  .  If you plot this function for large N youll see that asymptotic behavior as the other terms become insignificant.  Basically for polynomials you just take the term with the largest exponent drop the leading coefficient and that is the complexity though theres a fancy formalism to it.  You should also note that exponential behavior is anything where N is in the exponent.  E.g. ON and that these grow much much faster than polynomials for large N.In an algorithms course youll learn how to internalize that say double nesting of for loops is ON or binary search is Olg N or the best comparison sorting algorithms are ON lg N and how to do all the math that goes along with that and the subtleties and to learn the relative hierarchy and learn to think about worst case amortized average running times as well as memory complexity and other things like little onotation bigtheta notation etc and the formalism behind it.Note we wouldnt say a problem like multiplication or sorting or traveling salesman problem is an ON or ON lg N or ON problem though we will say a specific algorithm that solves one of these problems is ON or ON lg N.  For example Bubble sort is ON merge sort is ON lg N TSP solved with dynamic programming is ON.For problems computer scientists talk about complexity classes e.g. P NP NPcomplete NPhard this problem is a member of P etc.For your second question P problems should also be decision problems answered by YesNo but thats mostly for ease of definition.  This difference doesnt matter much its just theoretically easier to work with decision problems.Its straightforward to turn more general problems into decision problems.  Instead of saying what is the product of x and y you ask is the product of x and y in the range ab?  Now its a yesno question.  Its still going to be in P as given x and y you just compute the product say by long multiplication in polynomial time and then check whether that product is in the range and answer yesno accordingly.Similarly instead of asking what is the integer factorization of N you ask does it have a factor in the range ab?Or for the TSP problem instead of asking what is the shortest tour through the graph visiting the N cities you ask the decision problem Is there a tour through the graph visiting the N cities that is shorter than x miles?The difference doesnt matter much.  You should note that given TSP find shortest tour reduces to the TSP decision problem which we know is NPcomplete.  Hence TSP find shortest tour cant be in a harder complexity class than TSP decision problem.  Though technically it is not a decision problem so it is not NPcomplete but instead instead FPNP  completeThe reduction goes as follows Basically you determine the path of the shortest tour by binary search  is there a tour shorter than X use decision problem TSP?  Yes than what about X ?  No?  Then try  X   So you find out that you can tour your  cities in  miles but not  miles and all distances are in units of a mile.  Now on your map there are  edges connecting the  cities.  So you can then in linear time on the number of edges use your decision problem TSP oracle to ask  can I find a tour of the  cities on a modified graph with the first edge removed in  miles or less?  If you still can then the edge isnt in the shortest tour so throw away the edge permanently.  If you cant then the edge must be in the shortest tour so put it back in.  Repeat for all the edges on the graph until you have built up the shortest tour.,compsci,cjau7g6,3,t5_2qhmr

Even if theyre still way over your head they will be in the best position to mentor you w.r.t. the curriculum at UW which has a very strong theory group by the way. And the sooner you can sign up for reading courses with these people and take their graduate courses the better. Dont feel shy in this respect if youre comfortable with proofs there is nothing to stop you from approaching them. And try to make it to their seminars and reading groups. Even if you get lost after the first  minutes which is expected youll get to meet all the visiting speakers and ask them for advice. Likewise there are many excellent mathematics faculty there who have joint interests in combinatorics optimization and CSrelated themes.That being said I studied both industry CS and pure mathematics in undergrad and Im now a PhD student in CS theory. The mathematics portion of my education is overwhelmingly more important with courses on algorithms and basic complexity theory being the only parts of the CS degree that are relevant for my graduate studies. I think every field of mathematics was useful for me to learn the ones I use most directly are linear algebra probability theory combinatorics real analysis and abstract algebra though number theory topology and algebraic geometry show up occasionally. And to answer your implicit question every part of CS theory is susceptible to mathematical inquiry. CS theory is literally just another field of mathematics which is not the impression you get from the kinds of discussions of CS theory on the internet and particularly on reddit. I do program a bit on the side but mostly for fun for heuristically checking my conjectures and for my computer science blog which is literally called the intersection of math and programming . But my undergrad had absolutely no research program math or cs so I was classically trained as a software engineer before I realized how amazing mathematics is. It was very much overkill for graduate life but at the same time it increases my job prospects in the event that I fail to succeed in academia. So if you find yourself with a ton of extra time it wouldnt hurt to take a CS course in AI or graphics or machine learning. Youd probably find them fun because this is where a lot more mathematical techniques occur as opposed to operating systems networks etc.  as a side note you may enjoy my own posts of PCAeigenfaces as well as my many posts on more classical cstheory topics the blog is mostly for fun though so I have only recently started directly covering the kinds of researchlevel tools CS researchers care about.,compsci,ck2nj1f,2,t5_2qhmr

2429349,0,t1_cmbsep9,The latter part is definitely in line with what Im interested in.

As an example say we have pages set up such that only two functions can fit on each page. Say we also have a function C called by A and B and A and B are on separate pages. To minimize separate page accesses we could write two pages AC and BC so that you could call A or B and subsequently call C by either one without an additional page being cached andor accessed.You also raise an important concern about ensuring synchronization across redundant sections of pages. That would potentially negate any benefit that this method could generate.

2503496,0,t1_cmk9npr,Its very common actually. It makes more sense than you might think for several reasons Performance is not as bad as you might think. As someone else mentioned it does JIT compilation so in some cases your code gets turned into native code. The one area where JIT doesnt do well is in slow startup when you first run your binary but server binaries run continuously so thats nearly a nonissue. On backend servers CPU power typically is not the bottleneck. Instead its usually storage or network. Backend servers typically do a relatively small amount of actual computation and they spend a lot of their time waiting on other systems disk storage network latency limited bandwidth etc.. Java is a safe language in the sense that it has array bounds checking and it doesnt let you go crazy with pointer arithmetic like C does. This is really valuable when dealing with potentially untrustworthy requests coming in over the internet. Remember the Heartbleed bug? It basically just would not happen in Java. The language would say I know where the end of that array is youre trying to read past that point theres no way you want that and Im going to stop you and throw an exception. Due to its portability its easier to do things like develop on Windows and deploy on Linux. And your build system only needs to produce one binary which can be run anywhere. It has garbage collection.None of these features are exclusive to Java but few languages have the combination of features and are as low level as Java. For example if you want a language that provides safety portability and garbage collection you can use Python but thats slower than Java. You could use Lisp which has all this and which can run as fast as C but for whatever reason people dont use Lisp on a large scale.People are working on other languages that have some of the desirable features of Java but Java had a huge head start so a lot of people have standardized on it now.,compsci,cmlcfmi,2,t5_2qhmr

Obviously if we know something takes constant time saying it takes On while technically correct would be less informative than saying O. This is why as I said above you can often assume someone saying On actually means n.  A case where they would not mean the same thing would be a problem like where the best lower bound does not match the best algorithm. For example if I need to check through a list of items to solve a problem it might be easy to show the lower bound is n if I know I have to look at each entry at least once.

3290475,0,t3_2xts3k,There are things you can do with trees that you cant do with all graphs because trees are restricted.For instance if you want to make a list of everything in the tree you can start from the root and walk through each child in a depthfirst search You cant do this for just any graph because you might end up looping back on yourself you might not end up reaching every node you might reach one node twice etc.The rule of a tree is that you must be able to find one root node from which everything is reachable and that every other node has exactly one parent. This allows depthfirst search to work properly. So its useful for us to define this concept as tree because lots of things we want to compute on files in a filesystem for instance have this sort of structure and if we make this restriction we can use simple tree traversal algorithms instead of much more complicated graph traversal algorithms that can work on any possible graph.For different types of data we can add or remove restrictions. Binary trees have no more than two children at each node so we can implement binary search. In a Btree each node has at least some number of children but no more than some other number which permits some neat algorithmic analysis. Generalizing from a tree directed acyclic graphs come up in version control inheritance diagrams program analysis etc. and knowing that theyre directed and acyclic permits some algorithms that dont work on arbitrary graphs its not quite as convenient as knowing its a tree but its way more convenient than merely knowing its a graph.,compsci,cp3c9tr,2,t5_2qhmr

If a book is misplaced it is eventually noticed and corrected.For your problem if we want the array to be fully sorted at the end of the day say with the shuffles happening randomly in the array as far as I can tell we need to do a full scan in order to find the shuffled elements and correct them.

You start trying to break your compiler GNU extensions or your external tooling build system  macros to get around the shortcomings of the languages lack of abstractions. You are still writing code that takes one variable change to dump the stack into foreign address space and crash the computer if the kernel is retarded enough to let you do it.Great programmers can write magic C. They can avoid the billion edge case undefined behavior gotchas and take full advantage of the language features to write maintainable clean code using pretty much any language feature there is from generics to functional to object oriented. It can do anything and the best can take advantage of that to be much more efficient in their time maintainability and brevity of software. It can even run faster because a well optimized C compiler has more information to work with if the types are cleanly defined no passing around void and the control flow is sophisticated.C outright raises the skill bar. On the bottom end it makes matters worse and C is already pretty bad for the unskilled. It will make a rockstar that much better but it will wreck software for the underling that much worse. So if you are managing a free software OS kernel C is a terrible choice. You will get tons of commits from bad programmers writing bad C that can ruin your day. But C is worse because you will get tons of commits from bad programmers that will destroy everything you hold dear and it takes so much more mental effort to interpret bad C than bad C.

Intel has some of the best compiler optimization experts in the world but they just werent able to get the expected returns.Softwaremanaged memory which relies on new compiler techniques sounds a lot like prefetch hinting which is another technique that has been tried before and remains in some places notably HPC but similarly suffers from the EPIC compiler problem because the solution was largely to not even try to have the compiler figure it out but have the developer insert explicitly insert pragmas. Also have you considered how much rewrite developers are going to have to do to take advantage of softwaremanaged memory? One of the principle obstacles to Nvidia getting taken up in HPC space is the difficulty of writing complex code for CUDA and the volume of legacy code that must be rewritten to use it.When you say massively manycore VLIW it sounds like youre designing a DSP with corelocal memory. Those have been done and were fairly powerefficient in terms of FLOPS per Watt but were never taken up for HPC workloads because they were streamlined to work out of the corelocal memory and paid for it when they had to hit main memory. There just werent enough HPC workload atoms that could fit into CPUlocal memory to make it worthwhile and like CUDA mentioned above the cost of handtuning code to take advantage of the architecture made it even worse.If youve got a randomly accessible ZBT SRAM at the nm node that can operate at the required speeds  GHz thats really impressive. I would have thought the transistor switching latency in combinatorial circuits alone would have ruled that out. But the software managed part makes me wonder if you arent just going to end up paying back all of the savings with interest when you have to execute instructions to flush or fill the CPUlocal memory.Im trying to tease out what the aha that cant be published is but it just isnt coming to me. It sounds like a compilation of techniques that have been tried before. Some were abandoned some live on in particular niches.,compsci,ctffhh8,27,t5_2qhmr

5902848,0,t1_cxtd812,gtAnd as for your edit... care to demonstrate? Ive literally never seen someone manage to do this. If you can Ill take back everything Ive said so far.Sure.So when I first started working in my current job about  years ago they told me one of their clean coding rules was no comments. The general mantra here is comments are lies. I was all for clean code but at the time I thought this was a step too far. I didnt see the value in it.That was until I talked myself out of my own opinion one day. We practice pair programming here and me and my workmate were pairing one day when we spotted something that had changed in one of our javascript objects on the page. Another dev had written some code that we couldnt understand very easily he was emitting an event if I remember correctly. I recall this was in the middle of a function and just didnt seem to make much sense. Why are you emitting this event at this point?I argued at the time that this is a good example of a place where comments could be used  the meaning is unclear and we spent a while trying to figure it out the other dev wasnt in that day.As I was talking to my pairing partner I said something like this gtSee this is why I think comments can be useful. This code is hard to understand and a simple comment summarising what its for could explain it so we wouldnt have to go through this logic again...But then I continued...gt... although if you wanted to be pedantic about it I guess you could just extract this line of code into a function that describes the intent of the code instead of adding a commentAnd thats how I changed my own mind... So the code went from what would have been    emit event to alert other components that this component is drawn     myObj.emitdrawnto    announceDrawnStatusI cant remember the exact name of the function and the real method calls etc now but this is the gist of what happened. Turns out in most places where you think a comment is required you can quite often extract the code youre commenting into a function that describes its intent.If you wanna paste some code my way Ill show you the kind of things I might do to refactor it.

We have business analysts who sit down with us and we go through changes requested together. Once we agree upon the changes we are going to make the devs and QA try to break down the problem into testable stories tickets are made and then we work collaboratively to achieve our goals. Working this way instead of willy nilly deciding to change something because I feel like it means that I dont need to know why Mr President decided he wanted a button to work that way  thats knowledge that should be kept well outside of the code base.If you wrote a comment like that in my application Id delete it instantly.,compsci,cxumc2y,1,t5_2qhmr

It is very likely that there is no way to do the update via an IEEE specd interface.However the update might be less useful on an AMD board anyway as the implementation might not be fighting the SSD stock firmware in the same manner.TLDR AMD and INTEL have different cheat codes to access low level hardware,compsci,czprbc5,58,t5_2qhmr

We are already parallelizing over a cluster and threading within node so the choice is now to use standard fpu arithmetic for the large bulk of the in thread work which is what we have now or to accelerate it by using AVXSSE. Yes it isnt the fastest use of simd but given our data is not available in that format that isnt an option. And using simd in this case is significantly faster than using the fpu.,compsci,czroe2y,1,t5_2qhmr
6506203,0,t3_44rfyj,I started looking an academic year before graduating uni. Just casually though. I did not get really into it until  months before graduating.Bigger companies have a very long hiring processUsually your resume is analyzed for keywords and such by some algorithm and then followed to someone on the hiring with many others if it passes that.Then a number of people eventually review it and if you pass that you get an interview usually with someone fron the hiring team. Pass that interview and you either get a test or another interview date.Next interview is usually more technical with someone from the team you would be assigned to.Pass that and you might get an offer.Accept the offer and it might take a while for them to add you into the system and get a computer for you and such before you can start.Smaller companies vary. They might be just give you one interview done by someone on the team you would be placed on and decide then and there. Others might have a longer process.Larger companies can be pretty quick too though. One company called me up a few weeks before I graduated two days after I gave the hiring team my resumecv at a career fair gave me the three interviews in one day like an hour apart from each other. The last one ended in an offer. I took it and started working two weeks after graduation.So the hiring process varies a lot. But you should apply well enough ahead of time so if there is a long hiring process you dont get stuck unemployed for a while.Also I live in the States. UK might be different when it comes to hiring.,compsci,czsagq4,2,t5_2qhmr

6935073,0,t3_4an7ea,According to a  Byte Magazine article licensing for Research Unix version  was  for commercial entities and  for educational entities.  In the context of the day this was ridiculously expensive for businesses and essentially free for universities. The license was just for source code on an asis basis with no support whatsoever. ATampT management was not interested in being in the OS business having recently pulled out of the MULTICS venture and the government essentially forbid them from competing there anyway.  So they were not planning on making any money the license cost was essentially a duplication and media distribution fee for universities and a please dont buy this label for businesses. See this Ars Technica article for more details on the legal situation that led to this odd licensing model.Of course the combination of the relative affordability of the PDP and the easy availability of a practical OS and programming language to universities meant that Unix and C spread like wildfire among universities just as people were starting to really see the career prospects in computing and sign up for computing classes at universities. The Computing Systems Research Group at Berkeley in particular took an interest in Unix and soon created with the help of Ken Thompson who was a visiting professor for a time the BSD version of Unix. In the process they ended up rewriting a significant portion of the source.A few years later ATampT saw the massive popularity of this thing it had inadvertently created and practically given away and decided itd like to get back into the computer business after all. In  the breakup of ATampT from the regional carrier Baby Bells allowed ATampT to compete in the computer market and this is when ATampT Unix System V became a serious commercial product with marketdriven license fees.  Of course thanks to the previous license scheme for Research Unix System V was only one of many competing commercial implementations at that point several systems vendors such as Sun and DEC had purchased source licenses and incorporated changes from BSD to various degrees to their internallymaintained versions.Anyway we all know that the Unix workstation market was huge compared to the minicomputer market and ATampT got a significant chunk of the license fees for SysVbased Unix sales so I think its safe to say they made a considerable sum from Unix licenses. But I think its unlikely that Unix would have been the huge success that it was if it hadnt first been practically given away to universities at just the right time.,compsci,d12f116,16,t5_2qhmr

Her rationale is something like thisIn the older version of C they use in that class when I took it they werent even using C theres no such thing as move semantics and char makes copying explicit when thats actually what you want to do. The problem with C objects is the pass by value semantics that are done by default she wants you to think about the actual costs of what you are doing the copying that happens behind the scenes is too invisible.I think she is in a bit of a hard position. You would notice that she also drives the point home about all the terrible decisions that had been made in C. Python does have similar problems but by the point you are using Python you just throw out this attention to detail entirely.If you land a job in industry dont write your code like you did in that class. I believe that those classes should be taught using C which she would prefer to do if she could and C is used more for political reasons they want the data structures classes in particular to teach object oriented programming. Teaching C properly would be too much work so instead you get taught C with some details from C because they also dont want to trade off to Java or C and abandon the attention to low level detail.When she gets to the java at the end of your data structures class she will be happy with the string data type there given the semantics of Java making that more sane to do things are passed by reference by default and strings are immutable.,compsci,d2nirdr,1,t5_2qhmr

Im glad to find someone else on the internet who gives a crap about algebraic approaches to solving problems.If you want a more indepth characterization of the closure operation any monograph on Kleene Algebras will give you a pretty good survey. A more algebraic approach will probably land you in the world of universal algebra. Its a wonderful stepping stone for students of computer science to whet their appetite in the field of modern algebra.Gondran and Minoux do focus on partialrings endowed with a star operation what they call the quasiinverse with the sole law    x  y x   iff x  yleft or right closed depending on whether were looking at left or right multiplication. However their main focus or at least from what little I have read seems to have more to do with other tools and machinery that you can use to show certain desirable properties of a particular algebra. Note Ive only gone up to chapter  of the text and skimmed through parts of  and . For example Chapter  is dedicated towards different proof strategies you can use within this framework to give convergence bounds on expressions with quasiinverses.  A large bulk of these strategies extensions of the topological tools discussed in Chapter  with special case analyses based on the cancellation or absorption properties of the underlying partialring. What does it mean to iteratively refine the solution for y  yA  b by iterating yk  ykA  b? What kind of topological measure do we need in order to visualize these methods converging?Its actually a pretty great resource as it was written as a crossdisciplinary for operation researchers to harness this asyetof relatively unknown technique. However its a bit of a sludge to go through without a bit of algebra under your belt. Nevertheless   and  look especially promising.

This will allow you to check for eg. fastest traces which in your case would translate to shortest path.If you need more expressive prices on edges than just time you can look into Priced Timed Automata here you can add integerrates to an costobserver this would be Uppaal Cora .If you want even more expressive features for instance differential equations that describe the behaviourcost you have to go for full hybrid automata  in which case your problem is undecidable  although you can try to get some approximate solutions via simmulationbased approaches. We also have a tool for that Uppaal Stratego .

8346615,0,t3_4tv7k9,It depends on the professors and quality of the programs honestly. CS has the potential to be more useful and interesting  but the modern tech culture doesnt really care much about degrees. Theres a lot of CS fundamentals I would have liked to learned in school but at the same time Im glad I never learned the vast majority of it. The complexity of the system is vastly beyond anyones comprehension and as hit the exponential growth spot of moores law  we bottlenecked. CS is dominated with patterns that just arent applicable anymore and every bottleneck is caused by wrong assumptions  legacy architecture  so i got into coding without the burden of bs  and I did shit my friends with a degree would have never attempted  because I had no idea what my limits were i did things people didnt anticipate was possible because we all self limit our own potentials. I didnt get a CS degree because I thought programming was hard. Once I realized its not that bad I look around at the population in disbelief that they know so little about the technology we depend upon. But I think most of CS should emphasize the premachine theory  and the algebra  calculus mathematical parts of the theory. Which is why math  has a much higher provably of being useful. Some people would argue that there are algorithms like for loops that are fundamental. But I think for loops are full of shit and havent written one in  years. Linear algebra is important. I also think algebraic topology and some abstract math is probably the frontier of our understanding. Everything is math. Everything is program. But that doesnt mean that our symbolic representation of math through language or computer through machines has anything to do with    reality. Its limitation  limitations are the containers of logic. Without limitation theres no logic. Nobody seems to get this. Rationality is bounded  finite. Always. If we see the limits of a philosophy or programming environment or whatever  we can master it. ,compsci,d5kvow1,2,t5_2qhmr

8514685,0,t3_4warxx,Clearly all On log n algorithms become without change at most On log n sqrt n.The question is Can we do better?We need to access each element at least once giving us a lower bound of Omegan sqrt n.I am sceptical that you can avoid Omegan log n sqrt n.When you have an element you need to compare it in average with Omegalog n other elements. Therefore you have to read them from memory.One way to do it faster might be a parallel approach. You will have some kind of tree to access the memory. Send all the data to the central processor. When on a branch let the the lower value pass first. The whole procedure takes On iterations. One iteration takes Osqrt n  log n time. Therefore sorting takes On sqrt n  log n. The data arrives in the middle sorted. To store it in memory we need the same amount of time. Note that we process the next data item in the middle before the previous reached it final memory position.So parallel approach with linear number of processors and On sqrt n  log n runtime.

And in case their proof is right the checking wouldnt be PSPACEhard and their results wouldnt be extendable to P either.And as Laszlo Babai already argued there is no such thing as inertia for proofs that would force them to be extendable to more than what was proved even if something unbelievably big was proved.,compsci,d8w3h16,1,t5_2qhmr

Assuming the desired outcome had high enough percentage among all outcomes which unfortunately it doesnt you could still run Monte Carlo algorithm of generating random screens until a desired one occurs. Estimating how much time that would take depends on the percentage of desired outcomes which I dont think we can even guess properly but we can be still very sure its too low for this to work in practice.,compsci,dcjdw6g,4,t5_2qhmr

10607478,0,t3_5rq2nd,Ive always been of the opinion that if you know HOW to code in a couple of languages that follow the same paradigm eg. functional object oriented functional then you can assume that you know HOW to code in almost any language in that paradigm. The trouble isnt how to format the code and getting the syntax right thats the easy stuff once you understand the basics of the HOW. The hard part is how to get things done with it. That is learning how all of the standard libraries for the language are laid out and where youll find the particular thing you need to find to be able to make an SSL connection to your server or what the code logging mechanisms are or how to display a window on the screen that contains a form of data elements to fill in and save. In fact when interviewing candidates if I already know Im going to have to teach them the specifics of our libraries I dont care if they have particular experience in the language we use. And thats also why so many companies like to stick purely to well known and commonly used libraries. Because then they can tailor their job descriptions to the specifics of the libraries they use and new hires can be productive quickly. TLDR dont focus on learning to program a different langauge. Focus on learning the libraries that are commonly used And that means find out what those are and go through their tutorials.Youll pick up the language as you go along. The only better way is to first pick a specific project and a particular language and just do it.,compsci,dda2w1c,2,t5_2qhmr

10734390,0,t3_5tdix0,Computational model Refers to either definitions of costs of certain actions etc. Can also refer to models of computations like lambda calculus the Turing machine or other stuff.Abstraction Usually involves the duality between interface and implementation. Some sort of object whether it be a function or an object will expose an interface by which a user does not need to know about an objects implementation to use it. In the simple untyped lambda calculus there exists a lambda abstraction or a way for encapsulating a function with a pairing between formals and the body of a lambda expression.,compsci,ddn6715,2,t5_2qhmr
10781495,0,t3_5u7y7b,If you go to college for computer science youll be taking a lot of math classes. Im currently in my fourth year taking Calculus IV but Im getting a math minor a normal CS major only has to take Cal III at my school. As far as actual programming depending on what you like doing there may or may not be a ton of math involved in your applications. The most math Ive done so far is some basic trig for an augmented reality I made that uses the angle between geographic coordinates to calculate direction. That said Im still just a college student and havent worked in the real world yet so I cant tell you what itll be like in the professional field. I just know that Ive had  friends drop out because they couldnt handle the math that it takes to get the CS degree.

If you do internships thats leaps and bounds better than contributing to open source projects.For a new grad if they contribute to an open source project thats cool I might look at it. However I will usually look at their resume  minutes prior to the interview and then just do my interview. The recruiter isnt going to look at their GitHub commits they are going to lean towards someone that communicate well.
