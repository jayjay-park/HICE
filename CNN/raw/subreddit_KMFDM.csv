2146629,0,t1_clbgj4k,Its like I listened to the album and was like damn I dunno... so I come here and read this and youve said everything I feel. Especially about Kunst and OTWC. Its like I like it a lot but I dont love it like I normally do KMFDM. Kunst was just kinda oh okay cool... and now this album and I listened to it for a moment and then actually took the cd out and started listening to BTBAM. It will have to grow on me. Your line up for the much better album is perfect. ,KMFDM,clcootp,3,t5_2rt67

11661228,0,t3_65oxeo,Underrated? Probably ADIOS. It had a lot of good material that people kind of just look over and a lot of catchy hooks and complex soundscapes with some great vocals.Overrated? Well its definetley NOT NIHIL as that album truly is one of the greatest Industrial Metal albums of all time.I think Im going to have to go with Angst. A Drug Against War Light Blood Evil Move On and Sucks were all pretty good but the rest of the album is forgettable. KMFDM has much better releases with NIHIL XTORT Naive and Symbols to name a few. ,KMFDM,dghtcnf,3,t5_2rt67
