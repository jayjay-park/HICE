Its what your comfort level is and you knowledge of the game.  You can win races against cars that you know have no way possible to beat you with perfect times but you still have to worry about early launches missed  shifts or tracking loss.  Low risk low reward.  The higher in campaign you are the more money you make  increments I believe,RacingRivals,cjl0dc5,1,t5_2yd46
