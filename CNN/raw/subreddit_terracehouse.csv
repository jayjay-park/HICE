9374884,0,t3_58ylic,I got the same feeling. She knew it was something special and it clearly looked like expensive premium stuff and she didnt even left him a plate or something. Shows little consideration. He did overreact a bit but he was right in being upset,terracehouse,d94bzvt,6,t5_32sg0
9455081,0,t3_59pewh,Surprised no one noticed that Riko is the most scheming and careerist of all of them.  I think all are taken in by her youth and innocence.  Ill bet money that she was always the most focused on using the show to further her career and played to the crowd always.  All do that to some extent but I get the feeling that Hayato is a piker compared to her.,terracehouse,d9ehymi,1,t5_32sg0

It feels like a house that big would have more than two bathrooms... And if thats the case whose sink and toilet were that disgusting? XD,terracehouse,d9l6c54,1,t5_32sg0

9583993,0,t3_5c6si0,I started watching the youtube unpublished footage and it feels definitely essential to get a better understanding of their personalities. Arman for instance and his date with rikopin.spoiler Seems weird they still restrict themselves with time considering it is on netflix.Also the conversation you linked felt more interesting than some of this weeks footage.spoiler,terracehouse,d9uf83v,2,t5_32sg0

10252995,0,t1_dc682pi,RIGHT. Come on man youre  years old and youre letting the  year old take all the heat. I remember he did speak up when Riko said I like him and then Hayato said But even when were alone you say youre not sure. Which granted is something valid to be upset about but when thats one of the FEW things he said it sounded as if Hayato was trying to align himself with the others and appear as if HES the one being strung along by Riko and that annoyed me off even more. Theres a time to talk about that and it certainly wasnt then. ,terracehouse,dc68enn,4,t5_32sg0
10372095,0,t3_5obfv6,I feel like even though Yusuke might not have been the most interesting or good looking. He probably took a huge step out of his comfort zone and grew up a lot as a person. Happy for him.,terracehouse,dcjqm80,1,t5_32sg0

10543804,0,t3_598ntb,I think its pretty rude that they didnt even leave anything for Uchi. However I feel like he wouldnt have overreacted so much if they had left him some. Minori was definitely being a bad girlfriend at this point. Uchi works hard at a job hes good at and he gets rewarded for it whereas Minori is basically being a bum at the house.Not only that but it seems like a Minori didnt seem to like the meat that much and b Uchi said that there was specific instructions to preparing it and it seems like they didnt do thatSuch a multifaceted bad thing lol.,terracehouse,dd39akp,1,t5_32sg0

10872176,0,t1_de17p4g,Thats what I mean that isnt at all a fair comparison.  Obviously they arent going to start off the same and there hasnt been nearly enough episodes to determine which one is better.,terracehouse,de1dykl,1,t5_32sg0

Shes exploded as well and is now the most popular member of Aloha State. She has like k instagram followers which beats out anybody from the past two shows by miles. ,terracehouse,dg5gnfw,6,t5_32sg0

11568898,0,t1_dg331ra,I think its OK for someone without expertise to try to add value and to me its a sign of investing in a relationship i.e. real talk is always a risk but Taishi needed to be much more humble positive and supportive during that conversation.
