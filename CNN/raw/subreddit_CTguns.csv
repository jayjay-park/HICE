2781136,0,t1_cnjgftj,You are probably right.  I just figured most of the people on this sub were residents and may know the laws or be able to interpret the laws better than myself.It is very hard to believe that the government would allow citizens to posses guns in their own home but not allow them to transport their guns to a range for practice.  But then again this is CT so I wouldnt be surprised...,CTguns,cnk7f29,1,t5_31jg5
6695012,0,t1_d0bi081,Thanks for the reply. Im sure speeding would be OK as mentioned its an infraction. Mine was originally leaving the scene of an accident. There were extenuating circumstances however. This is why it was reduced to if I remember correctly failure to provide proper identification or something like that. I can find no record of it however.,CTguns,d0btm02,1,t5_31jg5

11666957,0,t1_dghgxb8,Why are there no higher profile Republicans who want the job?  I mean aside from the political disaster that Malloy created and is now walking away from like a pussy.  I dont see someone who is a political unknown being able to undo the mess we now have but as long as he doesnt attempt to push more antiA policies he may get elected.  This state is in sad shape with the budget and everyone and their mothers leaving this state to move elsewhere.  If he thinks bashing gun owners and A rights will get him elected.. he will be mistaken.Now if we could only get rid of Chris Murphy and Tricky Dick!,CTguns,dgigquz,2,t5_31jg5
