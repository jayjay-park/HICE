5487760,0,t1_cwc8enh,Holy christ at those Black numbers for Bernie and Hillary.Im not a Bernie supporter or Dem supporter for that matter but I have to wonder why do Black people support Hillary so much more than Bernie? Is it something about his policies or is it still simply not knowing about him?,Forecast2016,cwd419m,1,t5_384ji

6368695,0,t1_czdis15,I understand. I apologize for sounding harsh.If people who report on this stuff every  years for  years still botch it daily I watched Mark Halpern do it yesterday on With All Due Respect it certainly follows that most other people would believe the conventional wisdom. gt Clinton with  Sanders with  and OMalley with .This is pedantic and no one in real life refers to it like this but the MOE is not  its actually plus or minus four percentage points.So what your example means If we were to use identical methodology and survey the total population all of the KK people who show up at the Democratic caucuses in IA represented by your sample  or so likely dem caucus voters  times  of those times would produce a result for Clinton between  and  a result for Sanders between  and  and a result for OMalley between  and . Does that make sense?This is why Ive said that I view subsamples with more skepticism than most. And why it irritates me when people say a poll is wrong there was a shitty article I read about this yesterday in WaPo I think that was just full of misinformation when in fact the result falls within the polls finding but the way the poll was reported is wrong. Really its the reason why I made this post.Edit Changed the text from All of the KK Dems who show up and caucus in IA to All of the KK people who show up at the Democratic caucuses in IA. Again pedantic but its technically different since party status is measured and not only Dems but independents and others of any label can show up at a Democratic caucus.,Forecast2016,czdjujv,1,t5_384ji
6576938,0,t3_45r8qd,Clinton will need to maintain this lead to continue being seen as the front runner. If she wins in single digits Sanders would have to be considered the favorite and a tossup if .,Forecast2016,czzlxxl,2,t5_384ji

6713394,0,t3_47lapg,TargetPoint is the same Republican consulting firm that released a similar poll also for the rightleaning media outlet the Washington Free Beacon for the Nevada caucus.Not only did they underestimate Clintons lead by  in that poll they also asked a series of push poll largely antiClinton messaging test questions that led to it being highly criticized by some including me.Undeterred TargetPoint has almost wordforword asked the same exact questions in their Colorado survey. I remain both concerned by their methods and unimpressed by their track record but will still be adding this survey to the scant polling we have for Colorado albeit weighted very lightly.One other quick note on this totally not a push poll poll. Im reporting Clintons topline as  instead of . The definitelycouldlean numbers add to  but the cumulative is being reported as . Whether this is a typo an arithmetic error or due to rounding I dont know but feel free to use the  in your own personal calculations.,Forecast2016,d0dq0si,5,t5_384ji
6815248,0,t3_491oq6,Its interesting to see the disconnect between delegates and states won. Its so easy to say Sanders won these states Hillary only won Louisiana! But that still means the same number of delegates. Its a good point of momentum for Sanders though...but unless something dramatically changes it wont matter. ,Forecast2016,d0ot0p3,1,t5_384ji
