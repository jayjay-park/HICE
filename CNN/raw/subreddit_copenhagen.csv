1063488,0,t3_26abpz,gtWhat kind of clothes should I bring?If youre going from January to June youre going to have to bring the whole damn wardrobe. Seriously its going to be freezing in January and if youre lucky C F in June.gtAlso what to the females wear on a night out?Anything they want. Seriously. In any ordinary bar youll find women wearing everything from the nicest evening gowns to old tshirts with paint stains. If you want male attention thats not really what matters  and few women are going to look down on you regardless of what you pick.gtI hear that there is a lot of racism towards minorities in DenmarkYeah Denmark has this weird reputation for racism. I honestly dont know where it comes from  of course Denmark has its share of racists but in my experience much less than the countries we usually compare ourselves to and certainly much much much less than the norm in the US.If I were to venture a guess Id say its exactly because most are not racist that they notice the racism more. In any case almost all the racism that does exist is directed at people of MiddleEastern heritage. Asians will experience very little of it.gtI hardly drink and smoke but I assume that this will become very second nature to me when I get there! Drinking is a national pastime but not smoking isnt going to be a problem at all. In fact probably quite the opposite. With the smoking ban any bar over  m  sqft wont allow smoking inside. And the drinking  dont do anything you dont want to no ones going to shut you out for it.,copenhagen,chp68p7,4,t5_2qtd1

Maybe its doable outside rush hours but aside from special cases its a dick move and me being a nice guy and all would still give you hell if you delayed or inconvenienced me for just a second. Sorry to say.  Just get a bike.

My roommate is a waiter at Pixie in sterbro where they have several foreigners working. My point being it definitely does exist. Barkowski at Nrreport also has nonDanish speaking workers.
