18858,0,t1_cegekx0,I dont think you understand the weight of the SHA or the Scrypt algorithm being broken. You would effectively solve the PNP problem at that point. The world would crash and burn if that were so. In a laymens analogy breaking the SHA function would make hard problems easy.I also dont think you understand how silly it is to say that a nation could ban bitcoin. It would be like the USA cracking down on J walking. It would be the absolute biggest waste of police resources. It is a distributed network on every computer using it. The only way to stop bitcoin is to outlaw computers along with the internet. Bitcoin along with all cryptos is a collections of nodes in a network to stop it you must stop each node or disconnect every node i.e. outlaw computers in general or stop all internet traffic. The PNP question computers and the internet are here to stay.  The only way any of these cryptos will ever survive is if they are used. To be used it must be useful. We can see that a crypto possessing the right parameters fast block time many transs centralization resistant etc would be massively more useful than any fiat to date. Even semi useful cryptos bitcoin litecoin already do a massively better job than credit cards and banks in many many various aspects.,litecoin,cegkw7q,3,t5_2szgd

They are starting at nm versus nm. This means that when the devices shrink down to nm the smallest available for ASICtype projects the cost savings will be at most x better than  the current models which dont offer much better costperhash with the savings entirely being in electric consumption.This means that you may see devices that do say MH for  at best.

OS X is built on the Darwin system which descends from Mach and borrowed heavily from BSD kernels. The BSD and Linux kernels do not share code.However kernel compatibility is of no concern. The userland tools in OS X largely come from BSD and Linuxs come from GNU but these tools were built in parallel and are often dropin replacements. If youre at home in the OS X terminal youll be relatively at home in the Linux console.Most people though never interface with the console userland tools and Linuxs GUI borrows some concepts from OS X but a lot from Windows and NIX and a fair bit is unique as well.,litecoin,cgtgodi,1,t5_2szgd

1503236,0,t3_2bdbvv,I am pretty divided on the issue. On the one hand I can acknowledge that Dogecoin has managed to pull in some people by appearing accessible and friendly to newcomers particularly younger people. On the other hand I have always felt that Dogecoin makes a mockery of something I feel should be taken seriously that was the original point of it after all. I feel that over the past six months or so the vibe in that community went from its all for fun to were going to the moon in spite of the fact that the coins economics are not built for that...in any way shape or form.They have an identity crisis. If its REALLY all about fun then merged mining makes  sense because it basically removes the economics of mining from the picture. The supply is so gigantic that itll never have the economics to support price increases but at least the network is secured by merged mining and the coin survives. On their current trajectory though that network is guaranteed to come under attack within a month or two...and itll cost the attacker almost nothing to accomplish it.Those who are trying to insist that a  attack isnt all that bad are fooling themselves. Even if they dont do anything to attack the integrity of the blockchain...look at what the concentration of dumping by miners in Litecoin over the last two months have done to the price. Anyone who points enough hashrate at Dogecoin to take over  of the network and to be honest in two months itll be easy to take over far more than  of it can create such a gigantic amount of dumping onto the markets that itll drive the price into the dirt. That in itself will kill the coin in terms of its realworld utility...people will bail out of the coin as its value is drained. So its not just theoretical in terms of being able to attack the blockchain...its also economic.,litecoin,cj4pczi,3,t5_2szgd

2143872,0,t1_clcbr9a,A few things. Number one this time last year there was no way to short sell Bitcoin or Litecoin. As soon as exchanges started supporting leveraged trading the bears were given influence on the markets and started profiting from price drops. Number two the growth we saw in late  wasnt real...it was hypedriven and probably contributed to by Mt. Gox and their Willy bot trying to recoup losses while staying on life support with a fractional reserve approach. It was a bubble and it was only a matter of time before it popped.Along comes the Peoples Bank Of China and they start shutting down banking relationships with exchanges. Bad news seemed to keep coming in the first quarter of  so the price just kept going down. Itd recover for a spell then more bad news would drive it down more. I think the weak hands finally got tired of sliding downhill from the November highs and bailed out. So were back to being about where we were in mid...although a LOT has transpired in the meantime and progress continues.

2241176,0,t3_2krml1,First of all adding new hashrates does not change the number of coin production. It means that one needs higher hashrate to produce same amount of coins than before. Most new miners were preordered at the time when LTCs price was higher. So if new owners of miners sell at current market he may not be making any profit but reducing his loss if LTCs price drops further. Its very unlikely that price can drop further down from this point. More or less LTCs price is dependent on BTC news and speculation.Here is a calculation for MHs ROI calculation assuming . per MHs as people are selling Titan for  on Ebay. At current difficulty it will take ..x..x.x  days  considering most efficient miner Kncminer Titatn  MHs for W . per KWhr cost Fpool daily pay rate LTC ..Guess what? Titan was priced at  which is per MH for . Also we know that difficulty most likely will increase so it will take longer than the assumption. At some difficulty before the ROI if power cost becomes higher than the coin production this miner may never make ROI let alone profit. It can happen sooner than later as more efficient miner comes along and difficulty goes to the roof  Also the miners effort and maintenance cost should be considered.,litecoin,clopglz,1,t5_2szgd

One of the fundamental principle that I am following with Coinomi is to minimize the trust needed this includes trusting ourselves as little as possible.One example of this principle is this in the future we will add a feature of labeling the addresses but the seed alone cannot backup this information. So the solution is for the client to encrypt the label with its own public key and send it to the backup server. Like this the user data can only be decrypted by the proper private key. A big plus for us in Coinomi is that dont have to worry about data breaches.tldr you need to trust Coinomi as much as you trust BitcoinLitecoin developers not adding backdoors. If you dont trust them you can review the code and compile the app yourself. edit typo,litecoin,clvlstu,3,t5_2szgd

You can put big flashing arrows at every point a new generation of ASICs deployed on the BTCLTC charts and see where the dumping hit it. Of course we also had that  LTC market order that crushed price as well. But its been holding steady relative to fiat for months now.The BTCLTC ratio only really matters if you trade between the two for arbitrage gains.

If everyone just sits around with their thumb up their arse holding their coins then the price will continue to fall because the coin has no utility.  If the coin is regularly exchanged for goods and services then it has utility and will see a growth in demand as more people get involved.Digital currency is a revolutionary idea  it is the ability to send value around the world almost instantaneously and without using a bank.

The Coin Balance features is there but the balance itself is pending.  According to Chris an announcement will be posted over the weekend.  We all know how Chris is with communicating as well as being on time.  It is already Saturday night and still nothing who knows when we will hear something.

3578444,0,t3_31bo0d,Well theres the normal caveats.. it is very very hard to get an impartial opinion in cryptocurrency. Youll of already gathered that with your post on rbitcoin. It was actually this attitude which is bordering on fundamentalism that made me gravitate towards Litecoin in the first place. Imo all of crypto is in trouble at the moment. A lot of people are losing interest. The general public view Bitcoin as a scam. The push to turn BTC into paypal has failed. More and more thefts and scams are plaguing BTC. So should you hedge? Im not going to lie and say its not very risky but I can tell you the reasons Ive held on to my LTC. I still think its way too early in the game to say that BTCs network effect is that important. Its user base is tiny. The anonymous Satoshi and his mill coins are always a concern. BTCs reputation is fucked probably beyond all repair. Sending BTC is always a nerve racking experience. I have had coins just disappear into the ether for hours on end.Bitcoiners will always say that transaction time doesnt matter but once youve sent coins with LTC BTC just seems so sluggish. I know there are other coins that are faster but LTC has always been super reliable. Ive never had a st confirmation thats taken longer than a few minutes. LTC just works better than BTC.Another thing that Ive always liked about LTC is the identifiable people behind it. Among them youve got Charles Lee that most people in crypto know and youve also got the lead developer Warren. He was the guy that started the fedora project. I find this reassuring compared to other coins with their shady anonymous developers. Its also got a large amount of asic hardware securing the network.Now whether this actually is of value to anyone. Who knows? I dont personally  see crpytocurrency going away anytime soon and imo LTC has more potential than almost all the other coins. It just needs more people developing services for it.,litecoin,cq065qx,11,t5_2szgd

4475228,0,t1_csurtzy,ampampamp Short squeeze sfw gtgtShort squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock that occurs when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock. gtShort squeezes result when short sellers cover their positions on a stock. This can occur if the price has risen to a point where short sellers must make margin calls or more loosely if short sellers simply decide to cut their losses and get out. This may happen in an automated manner for example if the short sellers had previously placed stoploss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility. Since covering their positions involves buying shares the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stocks price which in turn may trigger additional margin calls and short covering.gtShort squeezes are more likely to occur in stocks with small market capitalization and small floats although can involve large stocks and billions of dollars as happened in October  when a short squeeze temporarily drove the shares of Volkswagen on the Xetra DAX from  to over  in less than two days briefly making it the most valuable company in the world.  gtRelevant Short interest ratio | James J.

10686585,0,t1_ddi4s3d,OK with a tightening of the rules instead it would be a soft fork. An additional POW would be added I follow the reasoning so far.But the nodes would still follow the chain with the most POW not POW. And then the current miners control the POW algorithm.  Nodes that have not upgraded will ignore POW completely. I can not see how the POW could be forcibly changed without requiring all nodes to upgrade or split the chain.If the miners would stop performing POW the chain could easily be attacked since a small amount of work would be required to build another chain with more POW. Nonupgraded nodes would follow that chain.But I might have missed some crucial detail.,litecoin,ddi8p5b,3,t5_2szgd

10803974,0,t1_ddubzw4,Well it does look like they are moving on. And thats perhaps why LTC value has been lagging behind people are moving away but no one is coming because everyone in the cryptoworld bases their decisions on whether a coin is profitable or not.LTC dropped to around . last week. This was probably the result of BTC crashing but this proves my point there is only a negative correlation not a positive one. Which is another reason to stay away from LTC.I regrettably still hold a lot of litecoins. I have no expectations but selling now after having seen so many potential profits wasted would hurt me more. Id rather lose it all at this point. Needless to say I am someone who is VERY disappointed in litecoin. Not only because it is almost worth nothing compared to other major cryptos but because it has no other uses. The pain would have been slightly less if I could actually USE it but it fails even in that aspect. So the only usability it has despite it being a socalled honest coin compared to others is as an investment instrument... And it has only provided me like most other LTC investors perhaps apart from the miners who instant dumpconvert for BTC with losses. ,litecoin,dducr0o,5,t5_2szgd
10817275,0,t1_ddvop1p,As a miner it takes me about  seconds maximum to move each mining unit to a new pool. I understand that could add up to hours of work for a large miner.Its my understanding that some pools have customized software that can take longer to upgrade. I also noticed that some pools have already managed to upgrade. It would be interesting to hear from those pools how much time was required.I do know that the last time LTC released a major release the upgrades went quickly enough. Perhaps its a competency issue with new staff. I dont know.That said the major players will upgrade its just a matter of being patient. ,litecoin,ddvq4wn,2,t5_2szgd

People are frustrated precisely because the solutions are there but are not being activated. If a solution is close to being activated then yes I may consider not holding Litecoin. But practically speaking it could take years. Look at all the posts back when Ethereum was proposed. People said rootstock would kill Ethereum. It would be an elegant solution if Bitcoin could do all these things. Right now however it is doing none of these things and by the time they do it could be too late.

The developments that are happening in LTC are the biggest this coin has ever seen. Obviously  feels expensive compared to  right now but if SegWit turns out to be great this should easily be a  billion cap coin considering where BTC and ETH are sitting right now. Thats  per LTC. In pretty much all of its history LTC was bashed for offering nothing over BTC. But that is about to change. This could be a major turning point. And if it  is nothing in crypto. I know it sounds greedy but its true.As far as diversifying goes thats actually not really possible right now. DASH and ETH are done BTC might as well be fiat at the moment and everything is too much of a gamble. I just want more LTC.
