10986260,0,t3_5wvugm,I didnt love Damage when I first heard it. It has grown on me over time though. There are a few songs on it that I really do like.I feel that Integrity Blues reaches back to some of the earlier albums Clarity Bleed American in that it is more rock than the latest albums have been. Overall I really like most of the tracks on the album.Also thats awesome that youre going to see them. They are definitely one of the best live bands.,JimmyEatWorld,ded9ado,3,t5_2rr06
