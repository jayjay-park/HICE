8149196,0,t3_4qutiu,How old is your flashcart? I bought one of this a few weeks ago and the only things I had to do was to extract the Wood . kernel and the games on a microSD and it worked right away on my New DS XL .,flashcarts,d4w73qi,2,t5_35sng
8421878,0,t1_d5u9qt0,Yep! GBA is a bit touchy so once again Id recommend CFW for emulation. But it should work regardless. Just know GBA might not work as well as you may want. Youll also be able to do emulation through Homebrew if you so choose. New exploits came out that run on your current firmware so if you have the ds on you you can get some emulation running right now! Head over to rdshacks for thatMost New ds units come under .. Gamestop has a habit of opening new machines and updating them for whatever reason. Id say your best bet is to return your new ds and buy one from somewhere else Amazon Best Buy etc.A skyds card would be a lot more of an expensive pursuit. Anyone in the homebrew scene would recommend a CFW over a skyds any day.,flashcarts,d5u9zbo,1,t5_35sng

9499418,0,t1_d9jregx,I stand corrected. Thats not what sprung to mind when I heard DSGBA linking find the term a bit confusing but maybe thats just me. But thats cool I had no idea there was such functionality or at least I had forgotten about it.,flashcarts,d9k07js,2,t5_35sng
9563063,0,t1_d9rtymt,No it cannot brick your system. It does nothing to your systems software.And yes you can play it online. However you will want to get a private header or risk being banned.,flashcarts,d9ruden,5,t5_35sng
9952939,0,t1_db4vwlh,Yes but not a perfect clone. Some can run risdhc kernel on risdhc cards with a patch.     It didnt work for me though.,flashcarts,db4w6ak,1,t5_35sng

11035583,0,t3_5xk1wc,Let me tell you something if you have enough money to get an EzFlash IV DO IT! I had a Supercard SD. It wont even auto save. You have transfer the saves to the SD card in order to continue where you left. I ended up selling it.EzFlash IV is what I use right now. It has only  downsides NOR games sometimes get corrupted maybe mine is defective you need to patch the roms with an awful app same as Supercard SD and it doesnt have a Real Time Clock same as Supercard SD. However you get to play Pokemon games without problem auto save upto gb MicroSD card not SD nor MiniSD and NOR memory which allows you to play bigger games like Mother  and Pokemon Hacks. In addition this NOR memory allows you to write roms INTO the cartridge itself for some lightning fast load speed.I got mine from eBay and I dont regreat buying it. I advice you to get an EzFlash IV.Im chilean and english isnt my main language,flashcarts,deiv3v2,2,t5_35sng
