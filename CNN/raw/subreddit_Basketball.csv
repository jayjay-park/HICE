Catch the ball with your back to the basket and you can simply turn right around and shoot over your defender.  Or you can try and use a hook shot or another kind of post move but that would require more practice.  Once you start scoring look to teammates to give the ball to when the defense starts paying more attention to you.  ,Basketball,cfbwneo,2,t5_2qhsv

If youre looking for a scoop or underhand practice left hand dribblingcoordination because its a pretty fancy shot and can get blocked easily if you dont do it right. If youre looking for a basic overhead layup use your right hand as a template to copy from for your left and just practice.

6544593,0,t3_457i2k,My best playmove actually happened  days ago. Let me preface this by saying Im  lbs white kid with glasses. I have a decent jumper but am far from the best finisher. The guy guarding me was probably  and had half the other teams points at this point in time.  I bring the ball up to the top  point line. I hear someone jokingly say Take him! So I thought eh why not give it a try?I sized him up with a couple between the legs moves and then hit him with a inandout dribble with my right hand. Shockingly to me he bit and shifted left and I darted right split  help defenders and went to lay it up as a rd help defender another big guy came in for the block.  Somehow I pulled a midair DRoseesque minus all the crazy athleticism up and underdouble clutch kind of a move and payed it in off the glass. Since then my confidence on the floor and in my ball handling ability have doubled and Im more confident on my drives and finishing more of my layups.

If you jump off two feet thats a gather jump because you GATHERED all your force and are using both of your legs to apply force to the ground....gathering your force.In a running jump you are using your velocity and force the force against the ground is not as great but the velocity can carry you farther. Im not sure if there has been a lot of science regarding these techniques and I am not sure if one allows you to jump higher but they are different techniques that should be used in different situations. Running jump is also quicker get off the ground to the hoop faster where a gather jump is more controlled allows you to adjust your shot mid air if there is a defender thereThe michael jordan switch shot that was famous would not have been possible had he not done a gather jump.,Basketball,d5mmpuz,2,t5_2qhsv

Look at the picture you have of Steph.  His shoulders definitely are not even.  One is clearly in front of the other.  Im also going to have to disagree with part of the B in Beef that you listed.  No good shooters jump straight up and straight down.  Again well use that photo of Steph that is posted.  His legs are coming forward.  If you looks of videos of quality shooters Steph Klay Korver etc. they dont shoot straight up and down.  They land in front of where they take off from. They have a slight lean in their posture.I will also disagree with half of what you said regarding eyes.  You arent that specific so thats why Im only saying half.  The best quality shooters do not look at the back of the rim the entire time You didnt say entire time you just said back of the rim.  They will look at the rim as they go up and on the release their eyes will find the ball.  They watch the flight of the ball.  Steph KD MJ Reggie Dirk etc. all watch the flight of the ball.

10208379,0,t1_dc15cgk,Im on the different page from you there. I think he ruined that chance for himself when he moved to Miami for rings... And when he moved back to Cleveland for more rings. And it always made me think that he never considered a team in the Western conference where he can be eliminated by one of the many strong teams on the way to the finals at least he and his team eould be much more worn out than the eastnoticed how he makes to the finals with a record like  every year? Peoples perception of LeBron is not a winner like MJ they see him like freaking Gollum chasing a ring wherever it is. He is like a size queen just going for the numbers.,Basketball,dc16d9b,2,t5_2qhsv
10272272,0,t3_5muyn0,Yeah I get this too. I play volleyball as well so when I reach back too far behind me my back tends to get tweaked. Work on jumping straight up with a straight back and proper posture. Your hips and knees should bend at equal degrees.,Basketball,dc8f2fb,1,t5_2qhsv

10441819,0,t3_5pjatp,Im not sure about books or youtube videos but I think teaching him a basic pick and roll as both the one setting the pick and the one receiving it would help a bit with court awareness. Its a great move to use in game and will give him a goto move for when hes not sure what to do or when theres not any action going on just go set a pick for the guy with the ball. ,Basketball,dcrnqzw,2,t5_2qhsv
10462699,0,t3_5pg36h,Identify your strengths. Identify your weaknesses. Work harder on your strengths to make them elite level and bring your weaknesses to average level at least. Most players including myself in the past get cut cause of unrealistic expectations and trying stuff in practice that were not good at. If youre a good rebounder rebound. If youre a great shooter shoot not go for the fancy layup.,Basketball,dcu1xp1,1,t5_2qhsv
