8257801,0,t3_4s9ed3,Nobody Ive shown it to agrees but holy fuck everytime  Beat drops for the chorus I die a little on the inside. Its channeling the fuck out of the dance final scene from Napoleon Dynamite its all I could imagine while listening to this song. This throws it on the top of the list for me. Mick Slow has the most ridiculous bass line and I totally agree with that confetti description haha. Fucking great album.,Metronomy,d59s5xt,2,t5_2uxne
