Similar to the bad sport coding that GTA  haswhich is dumb for GTA because its GTA lol but people with a lot of points in the previously mentioned categories would be sorted together and those who dont are left to play with others that have a similar play style.I would also like to add that in order to fly you would need to maintain a certain.....kill to crash ratio.. maybe?

People would have been upset but there wouldnt have been this level of resentment. I bought the game and premium and i wish i hadnt. I will not preorder Battlefront or BF just because of this disaster.  As for not playing? So i take my fame back which means EADICE get to keep the money i gave them.

38926,0,t3_1ujt1t,I can empathize with peoples frustration regarding the games. I just get annoyed how they say that. People who like the game are casuals who cant see the bugs. Although the tone annoys me I do kind of agree with this to a certain extent. The people who complain the most will be the ones with the most time in the game. I normally only have an hour to game per day at most. Playing that much I notice the bugs but they just dont really irritate me. But a couple weeks ago I had extra time and spent around  hours or so per day playing the game. I probably experienced bugs at the same rate as I normally do but they felt more frustrating and they stuck out in my head more making me think they were more prevalent. . People who say the game is for casuals or arcadey or like COD without giving any aspect of the gameplay that makes them think this. Its just a vague insult that will get upvotes that the author fails to provide any aspect of BF that substantiates their thoughts. And because the general vibe of this subreddit is that the game sucks they will get upvotes in spite of their unsupported argument because they match the prevailing view of the game. . People who complain about balance. Again my main issue is that these complaints are vague and they are almost always highly upvoted because of the prevailing attitude but are scant on providing any arguments or actual aspects of the game. Every time Ive seen this complaint pressed it turns out theyre just complaing they cant go  in a jet or helo. . There are more but I ran out of timeI fucking love this game. I didnt really enjoy BF that much. It was ok I enjoyed Back to Karkand the most. But I just overall love BF and am having a great time in the game despite its flaws. And I dont really have an issue with people who take issue with the game. I just wish they didnt crowd out the substantive discussion about the game and its features. This game has already come a long way since launch but my fear that the tone of the community has already been set and that nothing DICE can do will ever fix the toxicity of the community no matter how many issues they solve. ,battlefield_4,ceiv29c,3,t5_2uie9

44209,0,t3_1ujvu7,I will probably get downvoted for what i am about to say but what the hell.I have lots of servers on my favorites and have deleted many due to the nature of the autobalancing mechanics. This happens too often that I get swapped to the losing team and on many occasions get swapped back when the team I got swapped to starts winning. This isnt so bad if I am playing alone but when I have a full squad of friends all on TS and gets swapped regardless it really pisses me off!st off all of us join servers on each other and we have all the same Clan tag. There was one particular day that I got swapped every single time when we are winning! and when map changes we are all back together and get swapped again when we start winning!! WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F is going on!!! So how I retaliate is sending tanks to my enemies dropping them off to my friends crashing choppers driving as many vehicles as I can out of spawn and Cing them and  creating as deep a ravine as I can with my support class with C in the base spawn! and rage quit after that to find another server.

59389,0,t3_1usaf1,I dont think that its a good idea. The actual mechanic of the MAA is fine we just need some damage balance and fix.Whit the damage or the spread balance of the main canon and a fix to the detection zone and flip ability to the ARM the MAA will be fine.Currently the main problem is the ARM. they detect any enemy jet in a cone that comes from the MAA. so the further you are the easier is for the MAA to hit you. They need to be like the other auto detect weapon ie a small sphere around the missile. If the ARM can only detect jet taht are m around it it would balance tthis weapon by drastically decreased its ability to take out target at long range.The other porblem with the ARM is its ability to flip chopper. they deal low damage  per missile so theyre not a big threat. but as long as they destabilse choppers they will be unbalanced.ARM is design to provide as a no warning fire and forget low damage without critical mobility hit missile to frighten pilot. Its also a stealth way to engage a target since you can fire your missile then move quickly to another spot before being engage,battlefield_4,cel6xcu,1,t5_2uie9

60503,0,t1_celauxm,gt My idea for Active Radar was to make it into more of a skill based longer ranged weapon by doing so that increases the viability of Passive Radar as an equip choice since it works at the shorter ranges where Active Radar doesnt.I understand your idea but I think its not a good idea. For me the  missile should be classed like this ARM with balance Close range engament. They are not really good cause they dont deal high damage nor criticalmobility hit but they have a short alarm time before hit making it diffilcult to dodge it. Can engage target behing cover. Need a lot of skill to engage a long distance range. HeatseekersMedium range engagement. Fast lockon fire and forget missile with average damage. The target have  differente tone and the time to launch his countermeasure. The missile is lost if it was counter. Its the jack of all trade easy to use but easy to dodge. Passive Radar MissileLong range engagement. Slow lock on time missile that require to maintain your lock. Really awfull at close range due to the speed of the target. Deals high damage. the missile isnt lost if it was counter allowing the launcher to lock again its target REAAAAAALLLLY USEFULL AT LONG RANGE.For the scout helis i understand but i think your idea is a bit too complicated or i dont understand it well. I think they just need to apply a . to . ratio to the repair rate. So if the player use the Mech perks its capacity to repair is still bigger than a guys without it.

If you release a game to the public with an overall price tag of around  the fucking thing better work right and not have unnecessary files in it. I had pretty much stopped gaming with the exception of Battlefield when BF was released. After this I might be done gaming for good. I got the game upon release and put in . hrs so far. Thats only because I enjoy gaming with friends but they only play BF Which some have stopped because they dont enjoy it. Ive only played a few matches in the last two months. I will probably not play again until after Mantle gets added and more patches are released.

Playing defensively and killing others is PTFO and contributing to ticket depletion. Furthermore by killing people on the offensive team youre creating havoc and confusion and allowing for an opening for your team to arm the objective.There is no farming kills in rush. In fact in any game mode youre PTFO by killing other players. Thats the crux of what this game is about. Do you see people running around capturing points without killing others? No.This is why youre a loathsome badmin and the scum of this community. Youre the kind of person who would yell at others for camping when theyre defending an objective.

125706,0,t1_cesojek,People dont realise the stress of working in the games industry. If one person is sick and that person was meant to get a model ready to be coded into the game the coder cant  do his job delay. If the fan base or rivals are pushing you for release thus reducing time if needed everyone goes into something call crunch time. This consists of up to  hour days away from home sleeping at work half the time this also causes stress and eventually sloppy work. Now dont get me wrong DICE knew exactly what the release date was or the higher ups did anyway communication can be bad and like in your work place there are employees who dont pull their weight. Its a business with everyday people working on something immensely difficult to get right first time not Gods. There will be the new nervous guy there will be the lazy guy who wont pull his weight and the bad communication between staff with last minute changes. They got it wrong first time yes but all good things come to those who wait. There will be an update soon no doubt and it will be a huge one that will probably fix  of the current problems TLDR go to the top and read it. ,battlefield_4,cesqvfw,1,t5_2uie9

The maturity of this sub reddit has no effect on the game. The community has tried being reasonable. Yes the vocal minority can be immature but they are simply looking for a rise out of other redditors.

They colab a lot. For the past few months their BF videos have been a bit lackluster and boring to me. LevelCap is kinda preachy and harps on the ACE  and getting DMRs buffed.

There could always be a time where they could be paid in order to not comment on something that should be said. Something is worded to protect the publishers developers and games rather than inform the consumers. We wouldnt really know. We would just have their word. Theres really no way to prove the lie of omission. So I see  options Youtubers can reject money from publishers and people can trust their content more easily Youtubers can take the money from publishers but they need to realize that will come with baggage.

IMO this type of thing is ruining shooters.People used to find as low of a ping as they could and now all this smoothing and shit are being put in so you are artificially lagged to the average of the server or sometimes worse.

For instance  if you ADS even on single fire and stand still while aiming a single point on a wall  your bullet wont always hit that exact spot  thats the accuracy of the weapon.  Then of course it is affected by full auto fire and then additionally by movement while firing full auto.   Maybe Im wrong though.

Up from these are the higher damage normal pistols m and c which kill faster but also run out of ammo much faster.The machine pistols are great for cqc and decent further out if the player is good.The revolvers have over double the reload time of vanilla pistols with about  the RPM  capacity and double the damage. If you screw up youre dead but you can take out the whole enemy team if youre good with one.Its just annoying that the character doesnt raise the hammer as hes pulling it out or in between shots. No he has to do it before the shot which is authentic but stupid because theres no differentiation between squeeze trigger and squeeze trigger harder its all the same button.

So youre still hitting what you have mapped to the keyboard when using the controller.For keyboard I have NumMinus to allow me to eject out of vehicles.  Also you must have the controller on before starting BF or it wont pick it up or picks up only some buttons.,battlefield_4,cf66eql,2,t5_2uie9

245467,0,t1_cf64z7y,Hi I think you two are talking past each other.Hes saying that it does not make sense for DMRs to have the sound and not other firearms that fire the same cartridge. Youre saying that it makes sense to have the sound.Do you see that those are different things?Ill give you the most equivalent example as I think it demonstrates the point.  The SCARH is the military model of the SCAR .  Its classified as an assault rifle correctly because its select fire. The M EBR Mk  RFB SCAR H SV and ACE  all fire the same round and within a few hundred feet per second of the regular SCAR H.   If were being consistent they would all make the same sound and have roughly the same damage output.While the b may have a slightly lower muzzle velocity because the chamber is cut with looser tolerances in a LMG vs a DMR it would be highly unlikely the human ear could differentiate the sounds from one to the other at the typical engagement range in BF.I hope that helps.  edit dont get me started on the SKS,battlefield_4,cf6716s,2,t5_2uie9

If youre willing to play along it really does enhance the competitiveness and if more people playedmaps were biggerthere was balancing attention I honestly think it would be far superior to the infantry only modes in BF.The loading screen has the BC style blurbs presenting some background on the setting of the area  romanticized images of Helmand provinces fields and mountain valleys or the war torn urban sprawl of Kabul  and a quick brief on the mission of the coalition forces who are fighting the Taliban in the area.Theres radio charter between some command structure and your unit while you go through the last rounds scores and your loadout and end of mission cutscenes either depict your forces in full retreat and opfor gloating or your soldiers having secured the areaa bombing run.I get what people say about them getting repetitive but a blank screen is pretty terrible.I think DICE LADanger Close could have had these things in BF and in many ways its clear that MOH  was a features and gameplay prelude to BF Which clearly have also subsumed the Bad Company gameplay but they probably just had to get a product out the door given the lack of polish on so much else.Its a shame Warfighter wasnt well done either when they had the chance.,battlefield_4,cf8hr9u,5,t5_2uie9

Basically single shot mode but much faster.Ive never thought the AS VAL was an issue in BF I didnt see it get used that much. What it was though it was interesting. Instead of just another hipfire spray gun or another weapon with the same stats as all the others it was something unique. Battlefield needs more of that. In BF the only weapon that are different than all the others are the SCARH and perhaps the burst weapons.Nothing of the uniqueness survived in the BF version. Its basically a hipfire spray gun that only works in extreme close range. For the rest its fairly useless. Its a bit like the ACWR or the MTAR but much worse at range.

I said that if theres going to be strengths and weaknesses the intent should be that they balance each other out somehow.  Right now the Z has nothing but weaknesses.If the Z took  damage from stingers instead of  resulting in a light mobility hit instead of a heavy mobility hit the balance might be a bit better.  Or if it could take harder impacts without exploding.  Or the cockpit glass was bulletproof.Theres a lot of ways to fix balance without homogenizing.

Youre losing TONS of effectiveness if you dont know this  you can absolutely dominate enemy armor by running double RPGSRAW as long as youre confident ving the enemy little bird pilot.  You can kill tanks in  strafe without ever having to land to put new ammo on and both engies can always repair.  A much more safe and nearly as effective route is  stinger  SRAWRPG.  You can harass jets and have a ridiculous advantage against other little bird pilots.Squad perks are bugged and only activate if you leave and reenter the vehicle after you get the perk or swap seats.

Its the same thing for crashing issues although this are taken more seriously the same thing  it could a small logical error a static variable that doesnt dump and crashes when it overloads its capacity a broken loop drm package loss...Its all a lot more complicated than it seems.,battlefield_4,cfcm1ry,1,t5_2uie9

On multiple occasions with different people we have all found that when getting the  health bug the player received no damage at all even though on our client side we put enough bullets into them to easily kill them.Im convinced the  health display bug is caused by multiple bugs one of which is where the client side damage is not being registered on the server side.EDIT I should clarify.

310905,0,t3_1xmg80,I get rubber banding lag all the time playing BF on my wired PS even with a high end expensive internet package with a pingtest.net A rating. Generally this happens on  player conquest maps. I play on PS North American East Coast servers which I always select using the battlelog website and filter by ping usually  to  ping. These servers are always overpopulated with players from South America who have horribly high pings. The best round of BF I have played so far was when the server was almost completely full of only Canadian and American Clans the server ran perfectly smooth and ruberband lag free ON ALL MAPS. In order to improve game play DICE needs to implement pingregion filters and improve their server hardwaresettings. It is obvious that the current batch of PS servers can not handle the wide variety of latencies from local and out of region users thus ruining the game play for everyone.,battlefield_4,cfczs70,10,t5_2uie9

This was mid JanuaryHe told me they wouldnt do refunds since I had owned the game for  weeks and I said Well ok thanks for the help. He then told me to hang on for a few minutes and when he returned he asked for permission to log into my account. At this point I got suspicious and asked why he needed that. He said he wanted to see how many hours I had played the game. I was reluctant at first thought I was about to get scammed but I had no other games on the account I didnt have my credit card listed on the account and it was a throwawayemail so I thought what the hell. He told me again to wait a few minutes while he contacted his supervisor. When he returned he said he would give me a refund since I only had played the game for  hours! I seriously didnt expect this when I opened the ticket so I thanked him very much for his help and his willingness to go the extra mile for a customer.I sadly dont remember his name but it was some Indian name starting with A.

320755,0,t1_cfe0dal,I know its anti air but considering that of  encounters that I had with choppers I won . I lost the last one because the pilot flew not straight into me it kind of circled around. Having a chopper available in the parabolic map is pretty much a waste of tickets if someone knows how to use the AA. I dont think I could lock onto the AA from the chopper with those missiles for vehicles until after the AA shot and by the time the missiles on the chopper reload the AA already shot you again. I enjoy being in the AA when its possible those kills are easy. I just dont think that choppers have much of a chance at surviving it. Maybe Im not good enough with the choppers to take out an AA yet I dont know.How do you guys right against the AA?,battlefield_4,cfe0l7n,0,t5_2uie9

I dont think there are any who have been banned by PB or FairFight because tourney organizers are usually pretty strict about players not having any bans associated with their accounts some limits on that depending on the organization. TLDR yes competitive players have been caught hacking.

Second Assault should have been out by DecemberJanuary for everyone else.  Naval Strike was probably slated for March already so they are just releasing it at the time it should rather than holding it back.However with BF by the end of March only one DLC pack was released.

And dont tell me it is hard to port second assault to PC  xbox one has the same architecture as a PC.And more importantly you have no declaration of DICE to prove they didnt hold off on second assault because of the microsoft timed exclusive.

He jumps up and I drop dead instantly and apparently it was not a head shot according to the head shot indicator... all in  frame.Another one was I was using a morter hiding in the back of the map. Suddenly i would apparently die from this guys sniper rifle head shot even though he would have been shooting across the whole map and through a building.

When you play the game somewhere between casual and hardcore it really gets to you when hit detection an animation sync etc. isnt spot on.

370118,0,t3_1y9f59,Caspian and Firestorm are as good as they always were if you liked them in BF of course. I did and so far they seem to still be nice maps. They both seem to have additions that make them better than their predecessor like the massive wall on Caspian that adds a little more tactics to the map.Gulf of Oman has never been my favourite. The addition of the sand storm event didnt make it any better in my opinion. It looks great but I dont know how a feature that makes it so you cant see shit is something to be enthusiastic about.I cannot comment on Metro though since I cant finish a round on that map without getting the sound loop crash. But its probably just as boring as it was in BF.Also very nitpicky why arent the map names in full caps on the loading screens? A bit inconsistent compared to the vanilla maps design wise.

411081,0,t1_cfncxi4,Well I havent considered gametypes so you may be right. I primarily play player Conquest. Ive heard lots of people complaining about how Rush is less fun in BF and how DICE shouldve made gametype specific maps instead of squeezing multiple gametypes into the same map designs.I think its also a comparison between current and next gen systems too. With  players on the PS there is no shortage of targets. Although I remember the A and SU to be equally devastating when I played BF Rush on the Xbox . I actually miss being able to kill infantry with the main cannon.Im not gonna lie I do miss playing parts of BF and I wish it was backwards compatible for the PS. ,battlefield_4,cfndi1h,3,t5_2uie9

Then I noticed I was suddenly dying a lot quicker.After playing for a bit I looked at the server in battlelog and saw that it was HC. I figured I might as well try it out since I was already in the game.I adjusted my tactics to account for the new lower health and what I knew of HC mode having never played it. And I had a blast I played  matches in that server. I dont know that Ill be going back to a normal server.Ive always liked single and burst fire weapons but in normal they dont seem to be very effective.

423099,0,t1_cfolixa,Okay I appreciate that you have your own vision of how the game is going to look like and assumptions that I make about games today is completely subjective and what i expect from games is probably wrong I applaud the effort that you guys are making to actually communicate with your player base but i cant help feel as we really should have been at this point much earlier on.I find it hard to accept that platoons would have been a stretch to far for the launch with a company as large as dice and that if you were facing issues before launch surely your quality control would have made that abundantly clear months before? and with enough time and expertise to deal with them before the release date. I of course recognise that my assumptions about DICEs development structures are not accurate and i can only look at how other games developers have responded to issues with launches and see how they have very quickly address them if not actually implementing a fix but acknowledging them. I mostly look to SonyOnlineEntertainment for thisWhile it is clear that you want to create one of the best games releasedand I do have exceptional moments in game that only you can get in Battlefield I still feel that the game is lacking polish that big franchises have.Do you feel that your development has been focused more on your initial plans for battlefield or has it evolved to a more community based system?,battlefield_4,cfomaxd,3,t5_2uie9

Nearly all of his kills are with these two snipers apart from  kills with another sniper  a tank  and his sidearm  which further proves my point.Also Id like to add that he got  headshots out of  kills with the CSLR. Its not a hacker but he did what I described above. If he would be a hacker aimbot considering his HSK ratio his kills per minute would be way higher and not just below  kills per minute.He also got  HSs out of  kills with the SRR.

459562,0,t1_cfs50l6,Rubber banding is the game trying to play catch up and puts the player into a state until it can catch up.  From my basic understanding it a visual showing of the game trying to play catch up but cant.   A range of measures to be taken which smooth the game out and should make the game smooth.  So you dont notice it the game is out of sync for almost all the clients.  Network smoothing factor is one of these measures just unsure what it is.   Of course only so much can be done if you allow high ping clients into the game it goes out of the window. You may be playing on East US but right now the matchmaking is putting people into servers not suited for them this must stop.  Happy to see DICE have learnt from the matchmaking in BF and not allowed DLC maps into the main pool.Its not just down to what you play on but what other people play on.  box symbol is the game showing you there is a problem it could be due to not getting updates from the server or you or something else. IF rubber banding happens during that time it likely something is going wrong.  It was added to allow DICE to understand what is going on.Rubber banding is random due to the nature of networking.  My worry is that DICE reduce the rubber banding system and allows even higher ping clients to play and possible to abuse it.  A couple factors at play feeding into it not just server side it player side too.  ,battlefield_4,cfsi2oq,1,t5_2uie9

Trick is to juke GMs in similar way to AA missiles to deplete the active protection with st one hit with nd and just wear the rest down with a cannon.TBH only thing wrong with MAA is its actually as resilient as MBT.

466411,0,t1_cft3og1,The indicator is there for DICE to diagnose videosscreenshots where a user claims to see something wrong. Thats why theyve been kind of dicey as to what they mean I think but they loosened up and told us in the end.In this video the issue is probably a desynced state where the client and the server does not agree on a PARTICULAR flow of events. As you can see there is no other visible lag and other things seem to update. The enemy doesnt run in place or warp around. Nor does the player stutter back and forth.Another typical example of a particular type of events not syncing up is when the client does not update the direction in which players are facing. This often happens to me personally when I join a server. I can see someones player character moving in a way that implies theyre running and turning on their own screen but the character model just has the default standing stillanimation going on. Like gliding on ice but instead of going straight as expected he might slide a zig zag pattern.So there seems to be an issue in this game where different types of states are not updated properly whilst others are. Debugging this is troublesome because theyre using multithreaded code. And theres a lot of tricky shit going on when you do that. Ive done a bit of coding that kind of stuff and its not easy to figure out.Also DICE has already stated that there is a probable error in the simulation rather than the netcode being poor. My experience confirms that this is a possibility and its going to take a while before they fix it. In the meanwhile youll be hearing fix the netcode from those who dont know in the slightest how a computer works.,battlefield_4,cfta6gt,19,t5_2uie9

466484,0,t3_1zftpj,I support this in principle I think it would be good to send a signal to EA about the state of unrest among their customers... but theres so many reasons it wont work. BF has too many players across too many platforms. Reddits been great to see the few DiCE devs that engage the community but this sub only represents at best  of players. The official forums while perhaps more active only draws in as a form of community another  of players. Im guessing that  or more of players do not actively engage any community outside the actual game itself so how do you get them involved?Second despite the wide spread criticism of the bf release and current state many of us have significantly fewer problems with the game.  We all are affected by the poor netcode but I think enough of the problems are related to subjective expectations rather than actual bugs and errors that it really blurs the line of whats broken and whats merely  not BF  CoD  CS  Some other game I like.Third I dont think EA cares. When a new premium  alpha title is released theyre going to make  of their sales in the first month or so of the game the trickle of residual sales doesnt make or break a game from a financial point of view usually.  EA is already into Titan Fall promotion mode and by a few accounts that game isnt really ready either... EA has been voted worst company in America  years running for a reason and yet we still buy their games  do you think theyre gonna care that the people they already got their money from dont play the game it costs them less in terms of resources if nothing else I think the better boycott would be to boycott Titan Fall and any other game EA releases. Dont like BF? Dont play it I guess... but dont tell EA its ok that BF sucks heres more money for another bad title I love you baby dont leave me tldr  Boycott Titan Fall  not BF. ,battlefield_4,cftah81,4,t5_2uie9

472384,0,t3_1zibx0,Boosts work only when activated.  Which means if someone spawns on you you normally will get  points.  When you have a  boost active you will get points.  If you have  boost it will be points.  Boosts are tallied during your playtime as a deployed soldier or commander.  Boosts stop count down when youre killed and waiting in the deploy menu.  At the end round your total score is visible but at the end of the ribbons display it will show you how much of your total score was due to boost.  Ribbons also are affected by boost.  So if you have a  boost on a ribbon normally worth  rewards points will count as  points.  If you quit out of a game but your team still wins you will miss out on getting the reward for winner ribbon as well its boosted value in points.,battlefield_4,cftynw3,1,t5_2uie9

I also wonder how long the it takes for the armed objective to explode. It should be quite a bit longer than standard Rush. AT least in  you had to destroy some consoles first and then also deal enough damage to the core.

I mean if its so easy what difference does it make that they all have the same clan tag they could all coordinated regularly.A stacked team is when the admin indiscriminately chooses all s and moves them to their team. That is intentional stacking for the purpose of a win. But team mates playing on the same team coordinating working together I see nothing wrong with that. They are stomping you over and over because they are working together. In other words they are rewarded for playing as a team in a team based game with nothing but team oriented mechanics. Seriously I couldnt care less if it was  of them on the same team. They deserve to stomp the shit out of the opposing team because they are all working together in an organized fashion.

516718,0,t1_cfyzrht,I think there is a fine difference between realistic KD and artificial KD. Realistic KD is what happens when a player plays well to his role helps the team PTFO squad etc. That means he is usually in the line of fire and is fairly competent. Such a player will die but he will do so while taking enemies with himher. To me a realistic KD for a good frontline soldier is anywhere between .  . KD. This means that your usefulness outweighs your price in tickets. Usually. Artificial KD is when a player goes out of their way to inflate their KD ratio beyond .. They may sit in a vehicle play only specific mode only play a specific map and many other ways. Their PTFOindicators such as WinLoss Squad Score KPM Skill Objectives Captured etc are very low for someone with a high KD. I do not have respect for Artificial KD. The entire point of Aritificial KD is to obtain a spot on leaderboards. One may find that AA whores or people that only play  OP Locker with AEK or FAMAS are in the Artificial KD zone. There are select few players that can combine Artificial KD and PTFO. But they are too few to be counted in this. ,battlefield_4,cfz06dt,3,t5_2uie9

Im saying you could have actually assisted your team in capping an objective at the end of a close game.Spearhead an attack provide close air support distract a large portion of the enemy team by pushing the line and yes even fly to an objective and cap it yourself.None of those options are guaranteed death.As a self proclaimed ace chopper pilot none of those things should be too difficult for you.

Lots of people go by themselves to capture the objective and stuff. Always stick to your squad you will get more points for squad actions than for the normal ones and if you are the squad leader ALWAYS mark the objective that your squad needs to attack or is already capturing.

And not just a quick revive. I always run Combat Medic so I can get guys up at  health faster. When I see a bunch of people clustered I throw both medbags. Lastly play smart. Stick to the outsides of the map and shoot inwards and remember to stay in cover. One way to keep your SPM up is to stay alive. More cover  longer life.Edit And after seeing your stats and loadout all I can say is move away from the MTAR... Its on all of your classes. That adds very low variety to the classes.

Its only a clusterfuckmetro weapon anyway...gtAnd in real life almost all heavy gunners in squads are told to fire in full auto to suppressWith a bipod. Ive never seen someone accurately fire an LMG with just hands. Its impossible. Weight doesnt matter at all because its either a high rate of fire or a big round.gtThe Scout Elite can shot people in a certain range.In close quarters maybe but its supposed to be a sniper rifle. Not a long range one but still the range should be a bit higher IMO.gtThe MB and SRR are meant to be long range snipers which they are.They are.

If the mortar received the buff you described then many people would put em down and sit in their deployment and spam mortars at everything they see.What do you suggest then?

A human would predict a pull up or turn on some situations wether the IA would thought it would just continue to go on a straight line. Anyway i hope we are not giving ideas to anyone.

573292,0,t1_cg5fn6d,You make much more sense now thanks. I can see how maybe just maybe they could not be OP but I still think Its a useless gimmick that will only cause stupid skill less kill to happen to people who dont deserve it. Say your in a room and a guy with a Shield comes in and you can kill him but it will take five times the time to kill him as opposed to an enemy without one and then another guy come in the room from behind you while your trying to kill the shield guy and the guy behind you kills you because the shield guy takes a while to kill when if he didnt have it you could have got both if them. Its a very annoying and stupid situation to be stuck in. And I honestly dont think it adds anything worthwhile to the game do you honestly think people will use it to work with their team or to fuck with people? I can see a tiny percentage of people who will use it to benefit the team but most of the time some prick will be camping with C in a corner ready to ruin your day. ,battlefield_4,cg5fs7f,1,t5_2uie9

Think Metro Lockers and any typical map chokepoints Dawnbreaker alley ways inside housesbuildings where people have bunkered down. They have a niche they can fill without being OP nor underpowered. Maps like Metro and Lockers are renowned for being meat grinders and they end up with one team being steamrolled into the ground. A squad that is pushing smoking the area using a shield to protect them and cooperating as a squad would counter the meatgrinder stupidity or even make tactical CQB pushes simply more viable and make those braincell killing matches more teamwork oriented giving cooperating squads a better chance.,battlefield_4,cg5h9iv,1,t5_2uie9

In  Loren David an independent farmer was ordered to pay almost k because he could not prove that the seeds got into his crop by natural means.  They sued another independent farmer named Vernon Bowman because planted seeds from a grain elevator that had Monsanto seeds in it and was charged when he informed Monsanto himself.  Also they use child labor in undeveloped countries.  Did I mention that they were selling  of the markets polychlorinated biphenyls which are known carcinogens?  Also in the case you cited the Schmeiser never knowingly planted Monsanto seeds in his crop he only replanted the strongest plants in his field which happened to be Monsanto strains.  They sued him for doing what farmers do.I cant even fathom how you are defending this company.Edit  All info from here.,battlefield_4,cg67zt9,9,t5_2uie9

593327,0,t3_20xoqe, Find your classweapon of choice. For most people its assault because the ARs are easy to pick up but maybe not for you so try them all. Concentrate on doing what your favorite class does well. If its assault drop medkits and be on the frontlines if its support drop ammo and suppress the enemy etc. Itll earn you points ranks and youll learn the ropes while having fun hopefully. Dont trust your teamate unless theyre on mic with you. Youll get killed MANY times thinking Oh these guys can handle this side Im safe from attacks coming from there. As was said think tactical. The minimap is your best friend. Try to flank your enemies dont engage systematically the enemy if youre not spotted try to judge the situation first. You might be able to kill more enemies in one strike if you just wait a little and dont make yourself known. VERY IMPORTANT go to the test range and try every vehicle. Those you like learn how to use them THERE before trying into battle. Especially helos and jets. Otherwise you will die. A lot.There are many other points but if you think tactically try to flank pick the class that works for you and play it like its meant you should be on the right track. Get in those vehicles as well they have more HP and the enemy will be coming to you. Good luck !,battlefield_4,cg7prd6,4,t5_2uie9

625858,0,t1_cgbdcgg,it is mostly good stuff but there are still a few bad things mixed in  Increased the time it takes to get new M FLASHBANG and M SMOKE grenades from ammo boxes.gt those two things are rarely used and encourage a tactical playstyle rather than explosive spam so there was no need to nerf their resupply rate. Further reduced the repair rate for the Transport Helicopters. gt The transport helicopter is so easy to shoot down because of the mobility hits than a nerf to its repair rate wasnt needed. Changed the flight ceilings on Gulf of Oman Caspian Border and Operation Firestorm to better match the height of the structures in those levels. gt please tell me they didnt lower the flight ceiling. Increased the accuracy and direct hit damage of the AC mm cannons. mm cannons can now be used to fire pinpoint shots in  round bursts enabling them to provide accurate fire on infantry and vehicle targets. Their velocity has also been marginally increased to aid their accuracy.Increased the splash damage and range of the AC mm cannons. These cannons now do approximately  more damage in a slightly increased area of impact. The increased damage as well as increased suppression effects will allow the mm cannon to fill its role as an area of effect weapon against infantry. gt buffing the AC when it looks like its invulnerability has not been fixed in the patch ? Not too sure it is a good idea.

The JDAMs power was not properly balanced with its difficulty to use. The JDAM remains a primarily antivehicle weapon though this change will increase the effectiveness against all targets.

You both join a game with  slots left open.  on each team. Well in your world. The squad system should just let you  fucks on the same team..but how can it do that if each team only has  slot? Should the game autoswap a player who was already on the server to the other team so both empty slots are on the  team? This is why its not fair and you are stupid. IN bf you and your friend will sit there in battlelog waiting for  slots to free up on  team or when the map changes.In this new pregame joining.

633833,0,t1_cgcb8g2,gt Yet the result is far more enjoyable than BF  Titanfall at least during beta works flawlessly  guns hit what they are supposed to you dont crash you dont rubberband...Thats because of the lower bandwidth and resource usage. The engine is older and just got tweaked. Its more CPU based. Frostbite on the otherhand is GPU based and takes a lot of resources.gtSome people argue that its a complicated game and its bound to have those problems because no other games has levolution  players and vehicles destruction ballistics and whatnot..Thats exactly the reason. You got so much going on on the battlefield and everything needs to be synced with the server. Every BULLET is something that needs to get send to the server. Hitscans like in Titanfall work different. You dont shoot an actual bullet its just a visual that then needs checks whether it hit the target or not but only a hitscan. Like if your crosshairs are over the enemy its a hit else it isnt. All youre sending is hit or no hit. Far less bandwidth.

640970,0,t3_21hpmw,for those who havent played bf end game the dropship is an ac you can spawn in which cross the map in a straight line.After you spawn in the ac you can look down and decide when to parachute.Of course the IFV drop is irrelevant to carrier assault but awesome nonetheless too bad they dropped that feature.so once the hull has been breached a drop ship appear and cross over the carrier and you can drop like in bf end game. After it exits the map there is a small timer and it comes back for another run.Care should be given for the dropships to have enough hull points to not be too easily destroyed by stingerampiglas before people can paradrop. Or maybe make it unvulnerable.Advantages of these system over the current one  create a wave system instead of a constant barrage of parachute spawns. If they add a red lightgreen light system where everyone jumps at the same time it would be insanely cool too. Can reuse the in game asset of the ac gunship  no memory issue and DICE can reuse work assets from bf.Cons   might favor the defenders too much but can be tweaked through ac dropship respawn time.,battlefield_4,cgd4nd0,31,t5_2uie9

686202,1,t3_220x77,I cant agree with this idea more mostly because Ive been playing a lot with the SR so far and quite honestly I enjoy it actually and I noticed that DMRs would actually have a pretty good potential as effective longranged weapons. However its obviously difficult to use them on longer ranges already since they can only equip x scopes at max so why not make them able to have high power scopes as well whereas thats only able for the Recon class obviously. And to address the potential problem DarwinMoss mentioned I think they might make DMR loadouts in the Recon class seperate from all the other classes so that might not be a big problem Im imagining it like e.g. your Engineer has a SVD equipped with a PSO and you also want to use the SVD as a Recon but with a PKS you can change it how you want the one for your Engineer keeps having a PSO. Also did anyone else notice how youre able to zero your DMRs?

690437,0,t1_cgi0s1r,Yes. It is with  accuracy the cause of all the net code problems with the game. You see the the tick rate that the game uses is the rate that your consolePC sends data to the server. The higher the tick rate the higher the bandwidth because your device is communicating more with the server. Battlefields tick rate is currently around  ticks per second because of the ballistics data it has to send for each bullet fired and it cannot be changed. Counter Strike on the other hand can have a tick rate as high as . This is why you sometimes especially in cqb you feel like you die instantly because so many bullets are being put into one tick that you receive the full or most of the damage almost all at once. If the tick rate was increased by even  it would feel like a whole new game. ,battlefield_4,cgir6hi,1,t5_2uie9

Dont be afraid of sucking. The game can be fun even when you suck and not to cause a PC master race circlejerk but just about any game imaginable plays better on PC than it does on console aside from perhaps racing games. Once you get used to the keyboard and mouse setup youll realize that how much easier it is than a controller it allows for much more precise control.

699693,0,t1_cgjsahj,WWII titles saturated the market back around the time Battlefield  came out. So using that as a benchmark compare all the differences between Battlefield  and Battlefield  since they essentially offer the same setting and style of gameplay between each other. Compare the destructibility improved graphics physics animations largermore detailed maps etc. Also compare how they also play very differently and offer a different environmental experience. Based on that youre still saying that theres nothing new to be had?The vast majority of WWII titles in the past were fun. But the lack of detail made the experience a little bland even goofy at times. I remember being blown away by the Normandy beach level of Medal of Honor Allied Assault first game. Looking back now the game hasnt aged very well. Some of the explosion effects and scripted events might still be nice. But the animations character models and bland environments ruin a lot of the authenticity of that scene.Then you had WWII titles with good graphics and classbased multiplayer warfare... which were great! Except they tended to lean strongly towards the fictional side RtCW CoDWaW etc.. Return to Castle Wolfenstein had a strange backstory dealing with occult worshipping. Call of Duty World at War had stupid nazi zombies and fictional weapon attachments in addition to zero structural destructibility and very limited vehicle physics.I think Red Orchestra  is pretty much the only one that offered the full package of both good graphics and authenticity. But a game like Red Orchestra  could still strongly benefit from an engine like Frostbite where the flexibility of scale and detail could give the subgenre a refreshing experience.If you took Battlefield  and all its expansion packs and completely remade EVERYthing with the new Frostbite engine theres no doubt in my mind that such a sequel would be truly epic and unique.,battlefield_4,cgjt2wz,2,t5_2uie9

The phrase is in the top left and along that line it is split into individual letters.  I used the CODE function to get the numeric character code of the letter.The next bit is to prevent nonalpha characters being used in the cypher.I created a lookup table on page  that showed the code of each character and created an index  for us to use in our cypher.  I then duplicated the character codes in the column after that for the second lookup function to work.In the simplest example if we encountered hint that says AB we know we have to add  to each letter.So I got my index number added the desired number its on page  next to the result cell and used a lookup to get the new character code which we can then display.Finally in the result cell we concatenate all the new letters and can check for patterns very quickly.This spreadsheet can be tidied up an awful lot errorprotected writeprotected except in the entry fields have frontend user entry page added or just used as an intro to the functions.

Not my point.gt I think a reasonable average latency for a client is ms and say a great tickrate would be ms. So on average something like ms is going to be the lag.Whats DICEs problem in making this happen? Other than sloth andor incompetence that is.Once upon a time people played Doom and Quake  on dialups and didnt have the problems were having now when broadband is ubiquitous and hella fast. I understand the differences between hitscan and modeled bullet drops and  people running amok in destructable levels but what DICE has pinched off is useless. BF from  years ago never felt like this.The difference between your ideal achievable latency and what DICE has done is the difference between playable and manure. Its like how latency in digital recording means the difference between a slight chorusing when tracking ms and getting the delay suitable for the intro of Sex Pistols Pretty Vacant ms. ,battlefield_4,cgofxuj,1,t5_2uie9

But seriously I have never understood why they dont just make a Custom Map Creator DLC that includes those tools and just require you to have that DLC to play custom created maps.  Not all servers are going to run those maps so their DLC possibilities are still pretty safe.  Or include it only for those who buy Premium.  It would make me pony up for Premium a lot faster.  ,battlefield_4,cgp3vzh,66,t5_2uie9

789869,0,t1_cgtwrqb,About the delay if what you are saying is true the damage dealt by the C is done before the visual explosion the exact moment you press the trigger not when the C actually detonates. I really cant see how this could be true since the C detonator has a coded delay on it which isnt caused by net code or lag.Even if I had detonated the Cs too early I would still have got vehicle hit indicators at least  damage or so. As we can see on the video the first tank is inside the C explosion visual blast and it has been hit by the jeep since it is knocked on its right side tracks.The crater left on ground by the C explosion is also right next to the tank which means that the tank was clearly inside the blast radius. I have done this numerous times and my timing is always similar with what is seen on the video never before have I experienced this kind of events.On the second clip we can see that even the JEEP is undamaged from the C while it should be just a crater on the ground. It kept rolling on after the explosion. BF physics when ramming vehicles with high speeds together also makes them glued to each other momentarily as if they were welded together from the impact or as if they went inside each other.Also on the second clip when the jeep hits the tank it hits it on a straight angle which means there is no way it was knocked on its side by the collision.So what I am thinking is the jeep actually hit the tank TWICE before I detonated and after the detonation OR the blast from the C knocked the tank. If the blast knocked the tank it means that the tank should be destroyed since getting thrown around by C requires that you are very close to the blast.Edited a few times to fix typos.,battlefield_4,cgu28tf,1,t5_2uie9

But I still wanted to give BF a try.And I have to admit BF isnt so bad as many people say. The netcode still isnt perfect but the game is playable and from my  deaths on this weekend there where about  that were unfair. So that means  legit deaths and that is really ok for me.I also love the new deployscreen where you can click directly on spawnpoints in BF the points were unclickable i love the Dual Monitor Support Map on my second screen I like the versatile weaponmodifications the cool graphics and the genius sound. Also I really enjoy the mapdesign.On the other side The Singleplayer really sucks   BF Single Player was way better in my opinion.Finally I can say I expected BF to be a lot worse than it really is and I enjoy the game.sorry for bad english,battlefield_4,cgyu6pl,1,t5_2uie9

When they ll try to shoot at you they ll slow down to the point of stall you can then start firing your missiles at them remember not to stay on the same spot but you can start descending or flying left to right.

Make them spawn every  minutes but to actually do some damage.The Cruise missile is retarded too  sure it has huge blast radius but on most maps it drops after  seconds and the enemy commander can block it with EMPProxy Attackdo an evac order. ,battlefield_4,ch7nzem,2,t5_2uie9

Many patches ago  dice made a change to how firing from the hip while switching to ads worked.  They made it so that even if you fired early as in started firing before your sights were up  your maximum in accuracy was tied to your ads not your hip fire accuracy.

1059251,0,t3_2684gs,Love this map one of my absolute favorites. However I have two issues with it.One is the occasional and all too often constant propensity of people to get onto the two center roofs and camp there the entire round. Whether theyre sniping spamming grenades and C onto the objectives below or just sitting there with Stingers while waiting for choppers to come by it tends to really hurt the map overall. You cant run anywhere outside of the two center objectives without being bombarded by the constant whiplash sound of DMRs and snipers from those buildings. Capturing Delta and Charlie to a lesser extent becomes an exercise in dodging grenades and C from above. People often use the transport chopper solely to get to the very top of those buildings and stay there.Now its not mapbreaking when this happens. In fact Im rarely killed by enemies up there when I play on Zavod. However Zavod is at its best when everyone is focused on the ground game  using the trees and dense foliage to flank objectives sneak behind enemy lines etc. It is very much a groundfocused relatively narrow map and the two center buildings are a kind of strange outlier in that respect except for the tower on Foxtrot but that doesnt provide nearly as many vantage points as the buildings in the center. Of course I dont think people should be barred from getting on those roofs. My proposal is to simply change the vehicles for each team slightly to emphasize the groundfocused nature of the map. IMO the transport chopper should be removed entirely leaving the Scout Chopper as the sole air threat. Each team should get either an extra LAV or an AMTRAC in place of the transport chopper as they are both ground vehicles capable of filling the transport role while maintaining the groundgame focus. Players can still quickly get on top of the center roofs via the Scout Chopper but the number of players will obviously be smaller ideally further discouraging constant roofcamping.Second the MAA has no business being on this map at all. The MAAs never leave their own deployment and have an effective range consisting of the whole map. A single transport and scout chopper does not necessitate an MAA even less so if the transport were to be removed. If the MAA just has to be on this map however then have it be a captured asset at one of the two center objectives ideally making it less likely to stay in its own deployment for an entire round and opening it up to actual threats.These are just two small complaints and ideal suggestions. I really enjoy playing on this map regardless very few maps are perfect after all but it is definitely at its best when everyone on both sides is PTFO and pushing together on the ground and not just trying time and time again to get on those two buildings. ,battlefield_4,choow7e,2,t5_2uie9

1078045,0,t1_chqtlyo,Any sort of use of an exploit is a bannable offense even if it is a bug. The same thing happened when I used to play Desert Combat. Specifically on Lost Village there were numerous houses you could get underneath the floor and just kill people constantly and not die. If you did that you got banned from servers. Why would this be any different? Its a bug sure but its still an exploit. You cant expect that by getting underneath a floor and being unable to be shot at while being able to shoot out is acceptable.Funtimes edit I do not work on the game so please dont take what I say as law as someone else just did.

The difference is that you can stick SLAMs to walls and vehicles allowing much more versatility like for example usage as makeshift C to blow up enemy vehicles.

However its as if youve forgotten that EA still has released a BF game and plans a BF release Im guessing if you want your military shooter fix you can go their but Hardline represents a different approach to as Ive said a stale market. I semi agree with you on their options to bring out a sequel title for previous spin offs but then again maybe they DICEEA dont feel they can offer something substantially different to attract a new consumer base compared to the core titles to justify making another sequel. they probably have better reasons but thats my best guess.,battlefield_4,chtjs9k,1,t5_2uie9

1130450,0,t1_chwnzq5,No. As a matter of fact I find that spotting makes minimal impact on score but its beneficial for the team as a whole. Always spot everything you can even if you plan on taking the kill because you might not get it and that guy might get away. My scores as recon always tend to be just a bit lower but my team will usually win and I definitely feel like Im impacting the game. Plenty of times well be holding an objective but not moving up. Then I spawn in drop a tugs drop a spawn beacon and next thing you know were all over them. Rinse and repeat and we roll over the other team.Edit sorry I jumped up and started soapboxing without even really answering your question. Theres really no way to tell whos spotting but when youve got  snipers on top of a mountain at the edge of the map and none of the enemies that are wide out in the open are being spotted you know theyre not doing their whole job. ,battlefield_4,chwsa2u,3,t5_2uie9

1154979,1,t3_27ckiw,Id be inclined to say no. To both.Hardline will sell decently but will sell less than BF.The problem Battlefield  suffers from is general lack of passion. As a generic shooter it is great. It is different to Call of Duty just enough at least to maintain a dedicated playerbase. That said DLC fragmentation monotonous multiplayer and generally bad game play design just leads to player attrition.Features like doritos over enemies or being able to spawn on way more than just control points and squad leaders basically make the game nothing more than a glorified hypercasual deathmatch.Deaths dont matter and the spawn points are made up. Even classic modes like Conquest Assault are denied an appearance furthering the clustercuss design DICE went forward with.To top it all off there is no difference whatsoever between factions. All tanks planes flag distances base positioning and even weapons are practically and statistically perfectly mirrored. There just isnt any adventure or excitement in the game beyond the endless and meaningless barrage of bullets and explosions.The game is so shallow you wouldnt even hydroplane on it.,battlefield_4,chzjuru,0,t5_2uie9

1172249,0,t3_27jqzn,From experience it seems that in Rush if you are Defenders and are in the vicinity of the enemy spawn you will be shown on the map. Not sure if this is intentional or if its simply a bit buggy. Been accused of hacking many times because i kill some spawn camper thats hidden in a corner. Also using the Tugs on locker is incredibly buggy. Quite often if anyone has one up every player on both teams will periodically flash on the map. Doesnt happen everytime but ive definitely noticed it many times.Basically i just assume that even when using a suppressor im never not on the map. ,battlefield_4,ci1hy96,1,t5_2uie9

1211721,0,t1_ci5u9j7,Having played the beta for a couple hours I really do like the blood money gametype and think it is somewhat novel for the BF series however not significantly more so than Carrier Assault vs. Conquest for example. IMO. The driving physics are certainly better though.But as a FPS the gunplay feels mostly the same as BF preCTE which is to say not great... Given the issues with the BF engine in CQB fights it seems a mistake to use the same engine in a setting where the combat is exclusively smallscale.I agree that the line between new standalone game and DLC is not a clear one and I think its a conversation worth having. But as someone with significant hours in BF  and a couple in BFH Hardline immediately feels like BF in the core shooting and movement mechanics the most significant aspects of a FPS to me though I could not say the same thing about the BFgt transition.,battlefield_4,ci5xqni,5,t5_2uie9

If not by rushing games they will be recycling the same game assets in different combinations over and over again like with COD.Then there is the community which due to marketing has become one of the most toxic in the industry.Then there is the vulnerability to hackers which could completely destroy the game.

As a consumer I dont appreciate spending  on a product Game plus Platinum only to be called names when the product I received is not working the way it was advertised to work. You got my money on BF and if you just apologized and did your best to fix it I would have gladly supported you and bought more products from your company.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.Just want to clear something up before people go nuts.  There have been many bans by Punkbuster in which people would run to the forums to claim innocence only to have their appeal denied.  There have been many players out there with mediocre stats who were caught by Fair Fight or Punkbuster.  Hackers have all kinds of stats.  Theres no fluid number I can give you that is proof of hacking  other than specific stats like damage per shot head shot to kill ratio etc.  But I also cannot suspend disbelief over people repeating the same patterns in both the Battlelog forums and Reddit.  I administrate  well taking a break from Battlefield  now  BFDB and weve quickly implemented a  line in the forums here in which we are not banning anyone with this gamehack violation until we are absolutely certain it is a legitimate ban. Im in the same boat in which I usually reserve judgment until the dust has settled.  But again this pattern of professing innocence isnt new to those who have been a part of the anticheat community.  Hopefully it ends up being a false positive and we can all move on.,battlefield_4,cid15m7,5,t5_2uie9

1385301,0,t3_29xqiu,Numbers  and  can be addressed by checking over your server browser filters. So fist things first set the region to the one applicable to you. After that you can maybe set a play mode normalhardcoreetc. Then I go through the maps I want to play and the game mode. Thatll be the most successful way of finding a server with space. With dlc maps it is possible that theres only a couple servers running them in your region ymmv.Regarding  if youre in a server that feels particularly weird try opening settings and then in network theres like a network diagnostics option. dont recall the actual name offhand sorry. in it you should see a ping to server and age packet loss. If your ping is very high  or your packet loss is gt then youre experiencing bad connections hence the spikes. There are a great many things that can cause lag spikes and only some of them are dices fault. If youre getting high ping or huge packet loss on every server it might be an issue with your Xbox your router your modem or your ISP.Regarding  supposedly the smartglass app is better? Ive not got a compatible device so I dont know. I have a laptop bear my Xbox and just use that for battlelog.Lastly  it does save your loadout state every time the game preferences are saved. This means it saves your load out for every gun and vehicle and class. So you need to set all the guns before saving. For me I found this easiest by going through battlelog on my laptop setting all the guns and attachments applying and then pulling up a game verifying the update came through and then saving.,battlefield_4,cipxhoj,1,t5_2uie9

1461647,0,t3_2awkqu,What are you running it with? Stubby  Muzzle is just awful in my experience. An Angled Foregrip with Flash hider works quite well tho. Its not fantastic at medium range but you should be able to kill an enemy with  shots at m distance. The bullpup design comes at a cost . ADS base spread and the spread increase of . doesnt help either. Patience is the key here. shot bursts at most and let it recover a bit after each burst.  Its a good CQC gun which excels in on fights but with the terrible reloadspeeds you have to be quite defensivepassive and cant play it as aggressively as the ScarH for example.Overall I like it.

1531494,0,t1_cj877dt,First of all work on your grammar that was really uncomfortable to read. gton live i have times where i empty my whole magazine for  guys and they still live and i have to use my postolI cant think of a gun which doesnt do enough damage or have enough rounds in a mag to kill two people. In fact many of the guns have enough to kill quite a few people with one mag  and Im not talking about LMGs. This is as problem with your accuracy not the TTK of the game. Or should we factor in how inaccurate one random guy is into deciding the TTK for everyone?gtIf I am correct was it not the whole point of Battlefield  to be a competetive game for Esport? If i remember correctly one of the guys from original DICE or EA said that Battlefield  will be the biggest shooter for Esports in  months or something like thatNo youre not correct. The guy who said that Daniel Matros did so only once a few weeks before release and on his private twitter account. You cannot use that to make the claim that the whole point of BF is to be a competitive game for Esport. In fact the whole way through the buildup to BF every time a dev was asked about Esport he said NO BF was not being designed for Esport or actively tried to dodge the question. gtImo Snipers should be one hit kills all the time there is no logic being shot buy .magnum and surviving or just tanking ish damage at long rangeLets make almost all guns one shot kills and lets remove respawning and reviving and health packs and simple controls for vehicles because where is the logic in any of those? The logic is that this is an arcadey video game and those things make the game fun just like sniping the way it currently is is only balanced when they are not a one shot. ,battlefield_4,cj88zn8,4,t5_2uie9

In our game  ratail game you know for us with cheap seats and without premium and thus without cte access netcode is worse than ever after the july th patch. In your cte game it may be improved but that means squat for  of bf players.Only about  or so of all bf players can actually play cte beta game  as can be concluded by all the zomg pls come play cte threads here  so the other  are stuck with retail alpha game that is unplayable....

I very calmly and clearly debated the points you made while demonstrating inconsistencies with what you said in contrast to reality.You have to remember this is the internet.  If youre going to say something ridiculous and then expect everyone to just believe you at your word youve come to the wrong place.I love debate because its a way of investigating what I know and to learn both sides of every viewpoint.  If you cant stand debate because it might present an idea or piece of evidence that conflicts with your world view then debate is not for you.  The very important lesson here is ideas to the contrary of your belief system are not attacks on you personally.

When we reached the last set one MCOM came down pretty quickly but the other one B I think to the righ side was being watched closely by the defenders.  I armed that MCOM  times. They defused. I wrote in the chat guys Ive armed  times lets take it. A guy in my squad instantly said you should play anything more useful than recon. I told him to check the scoreboard. I was the MVP on that round. The guy did not reply...  I armed it for the th time and somehow we made it.  Its not the class you play but how much you PTFO.,battlefield_4,cjqhr3l,2,t5_2uie9

1731502,0,t3_2e8ete,The point you make about the doritos is fair. Always played BF on console so I never understood people whining about D spotting since they were small unobtrusive and I loved the concept of visualizing the idea that your squad was pointing out to you enemy locations. Now that you show the Diablo III comparisons I more fully understand. They are indeed an eye strain to look for at long distances especially if Im sitting further away so I imagine theyre a lot easier to see on PC if the HUD isnt adjusted at all.

1742854,0,t3_2ee7nt,I agree with the AS VAL. It shares quite a few traits with both carbines and assault rifles in BF. Classing it as PDW is a stupid move on DICEs part.As for the GC why not just up its rate of fire to its IRL rate of fire of ? It was that way in BF and the gun was very well balanced. No idea why DICE thought it would be a good idea to nerf it to something unrealistic. While it isnt difficult to use the gun it still is WAY too underpowered and there are quite a few carbines that are better suited to every engagement. ,battlefield_4,cjyuklu,2,t5_2uie9

But in order to be successful at it you need to know the maps and know the limitations a soldier on foot has vs all the various classes.Of course thats why we here like it you want to do the run and gun thing? You can. You want to be a sniper and stay back supporting your team you can. You want to drive a tank or a jet you can. There are a lot of different ways to play and all of them have some use to the team.The biggest thing to get over I think is that your KD ratio is not the most important thing anymore. Playing the objectives and playing with your team is much more important than simply racking up a good KD ratio. The KD ratio can still be good but if that is what you are playing for you are missing out on so much.,battlefield_4,ck04igu,5,t5_2uie9

1821845,0,t1_ck8ozb6,It is a trade off with the primary shell alone. When it isnt a coaxial weapon it takes just as long to fire a canister shot as it does a primary shell so your choices are between a canister and a primary. I will say limited ammo did affect this somewhat but only to boost HLMG which arent limited for the minor fraction of players who might run out of primary shells then even canister shells too. As for the LMG and HMG you dont have to make this choice and you get both. The only edge I would say the canister has over either of those is its damage potential to aircraft and the smaller ligh vehicles which are incredibly niche benefits.As for BF. It didnt make any sense realistically but very little makes sense in the game and it was accepted as part of game logic. To compare it to something like the M DART is irrelevant because one had very clear signs as being caused by a glitch resulting in something that didnt make sense realistically or in game logic. The M DARTs behaviour abruptly change without announcement from that of which it had from launch. It lost characteristics of unique bulletsdamage model to be replaced with something you could predict and relate with as being caused by something else. It was recognized and dealt with as a bug as fast as DICE dealt with any of the bugs in Bf. Quick reload in tanks was in the game from day one. It remained unchanged for several patches without being addressed or mentioned by anybody while the USAS M or even silencerholo were addressed and changed. Furthermore there was no evidence that the behaviour was caused unconsciously by another factor at play within the game or code. In fact for it to be fixed DICE had to invent a behaviour rather than fix one. There is no proof quick reload was unintentional.EDIT The exact patch note wasgt Changed reload behavior on Tank  Tank Destroyer cannon weapons to prevent being able to fire  shots from different weapons quickly one right after another.This is the same language changed as the removal of gunner flares or scout heli laser designator. When referring to bugsglitches they are referred to as such and noted as fixed not changed. You are wrong. ,battlefield_4,ck8pxh1,1,t5_2uie9

Add a new class to inherit the Carbine with tools that can mobility kill or objective kill fire and forget weapons as well UAV type gadgets.. Remove spawn in vehicle from all vehicles NOT located in a teams deployment. Possibly remove it from all vehicles that can be reached on foot when spawning in deployment.. Set spawn on leader only as default for all modes.. Revert shock paddles to Battlefield Classic  design.. Add map call out for handflares. Make handflares spottable as objectives move toattackdefendetc... See stats on Commander Tablet use if it is low compared to platform use rebuild commander to better suit active commander play     Add mcom stations that can be repaired and destroyed. Bind these to commander assets.     Unlock assets from bases Holding a base should not give assets.     Remove bomberac devices.     Replace Cruise Missile with either an artillery barrage or rocket artillery barrage.. Increase squad size to .. Show only squadmates on HUD  except when aiming at a blueberry.. Allow users to bind Spot to something other than Commo Rose  make commo rose pushtoopen rather than holdtoopen.. Allow users to spot from a list of items when actual spot cannot be done enemy boat spotted.. Give players immediate access to loadoutsspawn selection when dead. Let players enter spawnloadout screen while alive. gt Bring back Battlefield   style tabbed UI rather than layered UI.. Improve spawning at bases Tighten spawn locations to better reflect base selection.. Let players move PC minimap to upper right hand corner move chat to bottom left and kill feed to top left.

2014831,0,t3_2hty6x,If you have a modern Nvidia card I highly recommend shadowplay. Shadowplay uses a hardware encoder on your GPU to record x p   fps with very minimal fps loss. Its bundled with Geforce Experience.AMD also apparently has a similar alternative but Im not familiar with it. Aside from those options DXtory OBS playclaw fraps etc. There are tons of options out there. All of them have a much larger performance hit than using a hardware encoder like shadowplay though especially if you are trying to record p  fps. As far as editing it depends on how fancy you want to get. Sony Vegas is my personal favorite but I got by for years with free alternatives like virtualdub avidemux windows movie maker etc. All those work just fine if youre mainly wanting to make clips amp not do any fancy editing.As far as making gifs you can just upload your video clips straight to gfycat  seconds or less if video amp it will convert them automatically.

Also its easier to track your target while ADSing depending on your sensitivity settings.One good way to get used to ADSing is to grab a shotgun  on those things unless youre using slugs you should basically always be hip firing. There is virtually no advantage in ADSing a shotgun it only tightens the spread of the pellets by a bit. If youre ADSing to hit a target youre probably out of the effective range of the shotgun anyways.,battlefield_4,ckzaiet,1,t5_2uie9

Other levolution like rain on dragon pass or snow falling on altai or fog on guilin are so insignificant that most people wouldnt even know its there if it wasnt told us by the developers that those are indeed the promised and hyped levolution events.Which even arent levolution by following the definition set by DICE themselves those events do not influence how the match plays out at all.,battlefield_4,cl14oqk,7,t5_2uie9

2111175,0,t3_2j3nkf,I find that sniping can actually be very useful if you play it correctly. The only thing is that correctly means something different for each person. Youre probably getting a lot of different opinions on things and thats awesome but dont take anyones opinion as absolute truth. No one can tell you how to play this game as everyone has their own play styles that suit their needs.That being said heres my tips. Find a rifle you feel comfortable with. Get to know it. See how the bullet travels and drops. Knowing those two things is the key to sniping on this game. My favorites are the CSLR JNG and the SRR but Ive recently stopped using the SRR because its way too easy to use haha.Elevation is an awful idea in my opinion. When people think about snipers in this game they look up. Dont be that guy in their crosshairs. Find a spot that you can have all to yourself. Elevation can be a good thing but too much of it leads to a lot of missed shots and exposing yourself unnecessarily. Ill normally find a small hill short wall around a building or a rock and Ill work my way around the sides of it to keep any one lining up a shot on me guessing.Speaking of which stay mobile. Dont stop moving unless youre lining up a shot. The PLD is a wonderful tool for this. If you aim down the sights of your rifle everyone and their mother will see the scope glint even if theyre across the map so youll want something that can zoom in without being seen. Also on the subject of movement dont stay in the same spot for long. Get a few kills in a spot then move to the next one. Especially if you kill the same person twice or a sniper from your spot. What Ive experienced in this game is that people get butthurt when they get killed on this game and theyll seek you out for revenge.Long range headshots are boner inducing but theyre very difficult to get. Even more difficult to master. My longest headshot is something like  meters which is crazy for me but some people can do that nonstop. I try to stick to around  meters from my target. Youll land more shots on enemies and youll be a safe spawn for squad mates that are playing the objectives. Dont be that guy sniping from your spawn. Teammates hate that guy.Lastly learn how to use ALL of the scopes you can. The x and the x are the most common and they havent changed much throughout the battlefield franchise. Each rifle will handle each scope differently though so this ties into the first tip. I love the x scope its my baby. But I can use the x or even the x with little to no adjustment because Ive learned how to use the tick marks on them to compensate for bullet drop. I dont like the zeroing deal it takes too long and my target isnt always going to sit still for me to fire a test shot or something.Keep working with it. Sniping on BF is something that comes with practice patience and some hard learned skill. You might not do well for a while and thats okay. Just remember that a well placed and talented sniper can be an extremely powerful asset for your team. After a while youll be able to blend sniping and playing the objective which is an easy way to the top of the scoreboard.,battlefield_4,cl86bha,11,t5_2uie9

2111939,0,t1_cl7qb4c,Freedom of Choice is great for sandbox games and democracy. However Battlefield has a history of limiting that freedom of choice. Those who put in a lot of hours in the previous titles know the camaraderie when anyone on your team revives you gives you ammo reps your vehicle etc. etc. You feel more involved and it gives you a real high of teamwork and cohesion. Thats lost in BF. The other big issue is that giving everyone whatever gadgets they want speeds up the game.  Imagine a support player who has two gadgets that kill you like C and UCAV or XM or an engineer who has two gadgets that kill like RPG and Mines.. what this does is it increases the numbers of ways you as a player will die. And statistically you will be killed by them more times throughout a match than if they werent there. This means you go back to spawning come back and die all over again much sooner because again more threats. Feels very CoDish or Titanfallish in that sense. ,battlefield_4,cl89tfn,1,t5_2uie9

Rules?  Just one.  Drink.  Otherwise its pretty chill.  Have fun play objectives  This means you can be kicked if you if youre obviously sober.  This server is for the inebriated only.  Yes we even kick our own clan members and admins.  Drinktards not tryhards...  But how do you know if Im sober? we hear you cry.  Well until we can get rich and provide everyone with a USB breathalyzer... it can be pretty obvious. If youre playing excellently and have an incredible KDR you risk being kicked to go make a drink.  Then on a second offense tempbanned min to go do a couple shots.  If you come back again and fuck everyone up or talk shit to us game over man.  Plenty of warnings though.  We also dont put up with bullshit disrespect.  Aint nobody got time for that on a Friday night with drink in hand...  Obviously ballbusting and drunk insults are fine...  Current Maplist    We run a votemap plugin and the maps that populate the vote choices are the leastplayedmapssofar chosen out of the maplist.    Like to drink and play BF on a Friday night?  Get the fuck in here! Server normally starts filling up between pm and pm CDT.  Maybe later... were big boys with wives and lives most of us so give it time!    GOMLInfst  TLDR    Get Off My Lawn!

Punishing a teammate mostly means that the teamkiller in question is unable to assist the team for   seconds. Hence if you punish a teamkiller you are mostly helping the enemy team by removing an asset from your own. Most teamkills are accidental. Yes some are dumb or downright stupid but punishing a dumb teamkiller wont make him improve his play and you will once again aid the enemy team. As said before its mostly used by butthurt  year olds that just cant handle being teamkilled yet they will classify their own teamkills as purely accidental. Even IF you have a ragingteenteamkiller do you really think he cares about being punished and change his ways?I try to avoid servers using childish scripts like this.

Ill poke some people and investigate more but we dont hand out bans on a whim theres almost always more to the story than what threads like these mention..As a side note the ban should be for multiplayeronline play he should still be able to login and playdownload his games if they have an offlinesingle player component.

This isnt a difficult concept.gtYou mean hide behind the nearest object to break potential locks?Assuming you cant lock through objects which you can assuming its even possible to fly to the nearest object in the face of effortless lockon spam with m range a faster missile acceleration and top speed then any vehicle has assuming youre playing on anything but the two maps with any appreciable cover.gtAll I see in the game are Scouts getting double digit to triple digitNo you dont.

But with the x scopes the amount of lock on weapons and long range explosives the choppers and jets who could bring attacking troops anywhere faster then you could shoot them down wake was a sniperfest in BF. no matter what time i joined a server with Wake Island one team was always steamrolling the other. Either the russians managed to spawwnlock the US or the US managed to get a food on the island and from there it was just minutes to the total anihilation of the RU site.Dont get me wrong i loved the map in the older installements but it didnt work in BF in my opinion. And all of the points are made will be MORE valid in BF. why? more lock ons x and x sniper rifles more explosives more long range killing abilities drones for example.they would have to make some big changes to the map for it to be playable. i think other maps would just work better. even damavand peak in conquest! it just needs another big tunnel and a few smaller paths through  over the mountain.,battlefield_4,cmrnau3,1,t5_2uie9

DLC that devides the community which results in less players playing all the maps. Premium. Double XP where was the time you needed to do stuff to earn points battlepacks.

2656265,0,t3_2qe3wv,If you can handle the recoil and dont want to use any other barrel attachment its very useful. The first thing it does is make the first shot more accurate which mostly benefits single shot weapons. With a fully automatic weapon the second shot is going to be worse than the first shot of that weapon without the HB so it really just means you can make your burst  round longer. It also decreases the spread increase per shot. This is very useful as it makes the time between bursts shorter as the spread doesnt get as high it will return to base spread faster. Remember that it also reduces the accuracy penalty for shooting while moving so unless you stand still while shooting this will be very useful. Ultimately if you can control the recoil and dont want a suppressor you should always use it. ,battlefield_4,cn5axi6,2,t5_2uie9

2667640,0,t1_cn6qz69,Its not really a fair comparison as CSGO doesnt have the same player persistence layer as Battlefield which at this stage is more akin to an MMO each players soldier has over  individual stats tracked.What youre actually seeing is an error in contacting the Blaze stats backend system which is a common EA stats system used by all online titles not just Battlefield. Battlelog is just how Battlefield PC players interact with the data stored there for consoles they simply see the Could not connect to EA Online error or a variation thereof. It also has a multitude of endpoints based off title and platform which is why not all titles and platforms may be affected at the same time.But to go back to your direct connect point it does act as a DRM layer yes but thats not its primary purpose which is to track player stats and unlocks for each game on each platform for each player. You have to go through the Blaze backend in order to connect as thats what stores your player data which is what tells the server what you have unlocked and what contentDLCs you have bought as well as your current player profile stats platoon information etc. This system also handles the master server list for titles like Battlefield  and  and is what the game servers connect to in order to be able to accept players to join them.So to wrap up it is actually pretty well sharded and compartmentalized but the system still has reasonable thresholds and limits based off projected and historical load as with any system.I have a hard time believing that you could do matchmaking andor get a server list if the CSGO master servers were offline unless Valve switched CSGO fully over to a PP system. They still have a set of central servers aggregating all CSGO data they just havent been targeted by successful attacks yet that I know of anyways.,battlefield_4,cn6s9ur,2,t5_2uie9

It wont come out far from its spawn unless you guys have lost all real estate or it wants to die to some real tanks.

Then if they really wanted to get crazy they could keep a count of how many conquest large players from region A got placed out of region in region B servers and if enough region A players are in other regions the game could split the lobbies and start up a region A server for all off those players as it would offer them a better connection and would offer a good lobby for any other players from region A looking for a conquest large map. utiggr Long read but you guys need something. ,battlefield_4,cngvfh2,3,t5_2uie9

2766779,0,t3_2rqoal,I specialize in tankIFV gunning. Here are a few tips that I see rarely repeated You can bypass the repair torchs cooldown. If you stop repairing and resume immediately every  seconds or so you will never have to deal with cooldown. The . cal is pretty decentgood up to medium ranges if you burst or tap fire it and you can get used to the slow velocity. If you magdump it at medium range youre just frustrating yourself because spread will cause your shots to fly off target. Your soldier loadout is also useful for tank gunning  PDWs to drop C runners rockets for enemy armor and C jeeps grenades for blowing up mines etc. You can continue and almost finish rocket reloads inside vehicles. Seat switching with a friend can double your vehicles ammo countermeasures and weapon choices.For more tips see my video tutorial seriesComprehensive guide to tank gunning part Comprehensive guide to tank gunning Part ,battlefield_4,cniklyz,4,t5_2uie9

2776632,0,t1_cnjl310,Ive been wondering about this.. Wouldnt it be possible to implement some sort of hybrid system? A hitscan system which follows a curved vector rather than straight laser trajectory and with a travel delay taken into account. Something like this .Player takes a shot. .Game checks for collisions but uses a Beziercurvelike method rather than laserstraight path. A. When a collision is found game calculates how long it would take for bullet to collide and does another collision scan after that time has passed. If the target is still there  hit confirmed. If the target has moved  no hit. EDIT nevermind I guess that wouldnt work when something moves into the bullet path AFTER the initial calculation took place. B. Alternatively instead of calculating travel time on the projectiles a clientside hitbox offset could be used. The game would check what weapon you have equipped and based on its bullet velocity it would offset hitboxes of all visible targets based on their distance movement speed and direction relative to you. Kind of like this but with the player model and hitbox swapped places so the hitbox is ahead of the player not behind. EDIT I guess that wouldnt work either because travel time would still be instantaneous. Or does that count as a simulation at this point?Nevermind now that I thought this all through in different scenarios you do need a proper simulation. On a bit of a sidenote UT does have projectile weapons too such as rocket launcher pulse rifle altfire with shock rifle though they have no drop and travel in a straight line. Theres also biorifle and flak cannon which do have a shortrange drop.,battlefield_4,cnjoyzf,1,t5_2uie9

The game has been out for over a year so there is not much of a long run everybody has learned to cope with the red on the sights and green on the helis and yellow on tanks ect. The SRAW nerf WILL encourage lock ons. Once people stop using the SRAW and if they dont like the RPG they will use stingers. And it isnt always as simple as go behind cover like every good pilot. Countermeasures dont work  of the time aswell. You most likely will some times get caught without countermeasure and will get chain disabled over and over till you die. Most people use cannons? I dont know what platform you play on but on PS you have to run miniguns or you will get Rekt. Also I am not too fond with the maneuverability of the Helis being buffed especially the scout even though I am a scout pilot it will be a HUGE problem to buff scouts trust me. I have gotten  kill games in  ticket servers. A buff is DEFINATELY not necessary.But to each their own. I respect your opinions aswell but you are wrong about the stinger thing.

Not a lot of variety in servers. Give me  dom all maps rotation and I will play that. Third  I need a warming. I am an old diesel engine. Those cuts and screen loading time are just killing my stamina. Dont judge it is how I work cant help it. Fourth  some round are boring some round are glorious.

3018425,0,t1_coasc7f,Because  of the players dont know what classic mode is. Probably never even heard the term mentioned. Theres at least  or three every round that type in the chat that their D spot isnt working. Theyve just stumbled into the server  how many dont even speak up? Who knows... Point is unless youve been closely following the game or happened to see that paragraph of a post about it on battlelog youll have never heard of classic. And thats a crying shame because classic is simply the best way to play the game.Over the last couple of years weve seen a seepage of things into the core series that change and damage how it plays. Right up there is Doritos  most at home in the bad company series altho introduced in  that is where they should stay   i will welcome their return in BC. Thats not to say they cant have any role to play in BF but certainly not every spot. This drops the skill level of the game down at least a notch  you dont have to see the enemy you just shoot at luminous orange triangles. I didnt realise that i was a culprit of this until i played classic. Second is regen  health and armour. These things directly contradict the supposed mantra of the game  teamwork. Medics are there to heal engineers are there to repair. Auto healing and auto repairing diminishes teamwork and the point of a class system severely. Third squad leader only spawning. The squad is the functional unit on the battlefield. They stick together and use their complementary specialisation to perform teamwork. Allowing any squad member to spawn on any other spreads the squad around the map  the squad becomes no more than a collection of mobile spawn points there to get you as close as you can to the firefight not to your squad leader. Finally no ammo pooling. In normal reloading is that penalty you accept after every time you kill a player or even after just shooting your gun. Mag dumping brings mag management  you must be more accurate shoot less in general and not over shoot your enemy or youll have too few rounds in your gun to kill another. The penalty is that you have to drop rounds. This is a whole new facet of a skill  self control. It also can change up firefights in that the guy youre shooting isnt  guaranteed to have a full mag. There is another effect of the mag dumping mechanic that exists because it is a class based game  the power of teamwork with the support class is greatly boosted. When you have a support player  you dont have to worry about dumping ammo and all of the penalties that come about when you have to be careful. Another skill notch dropped in normal. Then theres no rd person view. This is controversial but im for it because a combination of a narrower FoV unstabilised screen lower height off the ground and a general decrease in visibility whilst in armour changes how tanks interact with infantry in close quarters for the better. It is much easier to hide from a tank and let it pass by and they have to be a lot more self aware or rely on their gunner more to protect them from C. You have to keep moving try to keep some distance and be more alert to do well in a tank. gt skill level. In summary classic mode doesnt hold your hand anywhere near as much as normal and encourages teamwork to blossom. End result more fun and satisfying to play. Besides classic mode is not an alternate version of the game like hardcore  it is the regular version of the game that is what battlefield has been about since day one. The current normal mode is the recent introduction  it should be the alternate version of the game  there to pander to the more casual players. ,battlefield_4,coauvhj,4,t5_2uie9

Its ok to have your preferences or constraints due to money but the console versions are inferior in EVERY way.  No trying to hide it.  If you played the PC version even once on a decent computer youd know that.But have fun with your little games box.  Ill just be sitting over here with my superior graphical fidelity superior performance and no backwards compatibility issues which means I have a  decade long backlog of games that dont need approval from Microsoft or Sony.Also you sound like a complete tard.

3332878,0,t3_2yc3np,I just wrapped up a weekend long LAN party and played hours of BF with the new patch. What Ive seen is that movement works great now. No longer have to bunny hop up stairs or through doorways. Cant tell how bullets work but rocketsRPGsvehicle weapons seem to be complete shit. TV missile straight through vehicles rockets dont impact things. I shot volleys of Zuni rockets at some infantry hiding behind cover and watched as they just drifted through the ground instead of blowing up. My hit registration with guns seemed mostly fine but incoming damage markers are completely useless now. Even more useless than before somehow. Sound effects or kill cards also seemed to be a problem. Many times I died to what looked and sounds like some type of grenade or tank shell but the kill card indicated I was killed by a sniper rifle or shotgun. Every time I was killed by a UCAV or mortar my death didnt show in the kill feed and I either got no kill card just laid dead until respawn or got a blank kill card with just a player name. ,battlefield_4,cp86a52,2,t5_2uie9

3468781,0,t1_cpnjvjl,You have that completely backwards. You are not an invincible terminator while knifing and you already need to be stealthy or you are going to get killed doing it. You are fully vulnerable to being shot while knifing. If they shoot you quick enough into the animation before you a actually stab they can even save their team mate. Knifing has zero effect on the attacker taking damage.  Its the victim that becomes invulnerable to damage from the attackers team mates. This has basically no effect on gameplay and nothing you brought up is really relevant to it. Really all it does is prevent assholes from stealing their team mates kill midknifing. The invincible guy is already dead it makes absolutely no difference that you cant shoot him unless you want to be a kill stealing dick. The only time an issue arises is the stupid front melees and counter knifing. Given the victim is the invulnerable one and the winner of the animation you do get a guy who is still alive who had temporary invincibility. You could remove the invincibility on front knives only but then you make front knifing way too effective. You could engage all close range combat by knifing to prevent the enemy from shooting then have your team mates kill them during the animation. This would be a way bigger issue than what this clip shows. This is the better way already if counter knifing is going to exists. Moral of the story knifing invincibility on the victim is all that exists and it should exist as there is no negative. Counter knifing throws a wrench into this though but given how bad of idea front knifing is to begin with the fix should be to just remove the entire front knife option. Since thats not happening leave it as is. ,battlefield_4,cpnnzn4,4,t5_2uie9

You cant cover every angle by yourself and if youre capping a flag defenders can spawn in any direction in relation to the flag meaning they can just as easily appear behind you as in front of you. Unless youre supremely confident in your abilities your teams abilities and the enemys lack thereof always stay just behind the front line. Use thermal optics constantly to spot infantry and only push forward once you know the way if clear.

Most of our gtexisting sniper rifles are collecting dust because rate of fire bullet gtdrop and damage fallout are the only major factors so people use gtthe same  sniper rifles hopefully the new balance pass will gtreinvigorate thisI disagree. There are a lot of good ways to balance these. Just as an example.DMR  damage up to m and then drops of to  at a normal DMRdistance but make it have a RPM of . This would make it a skillful weapon because it can shot HS in CQB or  shot body shot if you play it right. A slightly better SR in CQBSniper Make it have  damage up to m but drop of to  to make it a real CQB sniper.

Though I feel everyone should have premium now since playing the same mundane maps gets to be old rather quickly. And premium should be very inexpensive now  since hardline is out buying from something like GA or the sort. But thats to say they value the game enough or feel its worth which may not be the case.

3643360,0,t1_cq5vdv9,I respectfully disagree.  By far the easiest way to get the kills is to go after boats on paracel storm or naval maps and in HARDCORE so they are probably carrying damage already or will maintain their damage while you come back for another run.  Also laserguided missiles are supereffective in this.  I tried air superiority to get the kills and I returned to it many times and my consistent experience is that most of your good runs will end in somebody else stealing the kill or the enemy crashing and denying you the kill.Even now when ive personally become pretty ok at jets Im grinding towards my  stars at present I often dont get a single ribbon when I return to air superiority!  but I can easily get a dozen ribbons in a game against boats or vehicles.,battlefield_4,cq7kj7l,1,t5_2uie9

They may be OP in some aspects but that doesnt mean shouldermounted AA launchers should be as ludicrously overeffective as they are.

My problem is that this inherently destroys air balance for helicopters.

4233508,1,t3_39e65j,For me its. AEK tops above everything. This is my goto assault rifle when Im not using a carbine. Im mostly a close combat guy so this gets the job done and Ive also gotten really good with the gun in medium range engagements.. MA for accurate midrange burstfire. I just started using this gun for the first time in this game. After using the M for a while I can say this is basically a much better version of that gun. Not great for close quarters but it can do in a pinch. Amazing in medium range engagements especially with Kobra  magnifier.. ACE for just outside of closerange and medium range. This is probably the best all around assault rifle in the game. Good fire rate good range good accuracy for a full auto.. M as a good all around any situation gun. One of my favorite guns in real life and it serves as a slightly less effective although more accurate version of the ACE.. AR for medium to long range. This gun pretty much blows away the other assault long range assault rifles for me.Bottom five worst is first would be. Bulldog. Ive hated that thing ever since it came out. The two hit kill is annoying and its annoying that everybody and their brother use it. The mag size makes it balanced I just dislike the gun.. Famas. Hate this gun in all video games. Some of it is irrational some is I just dont like the way the gun looks. The reload time makes it unusable in BF as well IMO. AN. This is mostly carried over hate from BF and especially BC. Gun was right up there with the KH in terms of an OP burst spam accuracy gun. Ive used it in BF and its a perfectly good balanced gun it just has that past stigma for me.. SCARH. Irrational dislike in all video games. I dont really have a reason for this one. I hate the gun hate the way it looks and pretty much everything about it.. SARCZ. Both are just very meh. The SARs role was taken over by the AR its basically just a worse version of that gun. CZ is just mediocre and I would prefer another assault rifle in literally any other situation.Guns I would like to try out in the future. QBZ. Never really used any of the QB guns as I tend to use guns Ive seen in real life or in other games. This seems like it could be a viable mediumlong range option with good accuracy.. LA. Loved the gun in BF havent gotten around to using it and was discouraged from using it by a friend who said the nerfed fire rate made it very UP. Would still like to give it a try though.. AUG. One of my favorite guns. Its not very good in this game which is why I havent used it much but I still want to give it a shake.,battlefield_4,cs2t2qj,2,t5_2uie9

4359153,0,t3_3aw1gy,Feedback You should adjust the positioning of the ammo and health counters.  With your design its hard to know from a quick glance if my health is  or if thats my ammo.  You should also move the remaining ammo count next to how much is left in your mag So .  Id also slightly increase the padding between the  and the circle around it right now its too cramped.  You should add in the fire mode indicator as well to signify if Im on full autosemi autosingle fire More on the health icon  I think the way youre presenting the health is backwards.  Its hard to tell if my health is say  or .  If youre showing the amount youre damaged youre going the wrong way.  The amount missing should be taken counterclockwise. You need to show the class that each player is.  Its important to know what my other squad mates are running.  Also what happened to the field upgrades? The timer is OK but the bars below that which I assume are the ticket count has to have numbers to show the ticket count of each team.  Plain bars look nice but its hard to tell the difference between two teams and their ticket counts.  It doesnt scale well either with high ticket count servers since a difference of say  tickets might only be a few pixels. Maybe youre not finished with it but the diamonds which I assume are the flags dont show the flags themselves.  Which one is flag C?  Will they be colored in according to the team that holds them?   For the mini map this will get lost on any map with snow or light colored ground textures.  Its confusing too as to which parts are ground buildings or water.  I do user interface and user experience as my job so if you have any questions let me know.,battlefield_4,csh0d2z,4,t5_2uie9

Its about capturing flags in conquest taking mcoms in rush and delivering the bomb in obliteration. Remember that during a match. If you want to work on your gun skill or grind play TDM or domination.gt However I really enjoy flying around in the jets and helicopters although Im pretty useless with them.Get in the test range with the helicopters and strafe the boats. A lot. Watercraft can take damage from the scouts miniguns so youll see the feedback from hits. As for jets try and its hard to find an air superiority match because the respawn time for jets in most modes is crazy.gt One thing Ive noticed in my matches though is that there is never any team communication via voice chat.You have to be on teamspeak and sometimes its a blessing if youre not,battlefield_4,ct77gw0,2,t5_2uie9

4588888,0,t3_3duq3j,Was there ever to be a change with lock ons? I think I heard from someone on this sub that lock ons would be looked at. My opinion is that either they shouldnt get a maximum of  rockets andor directional indicators should be more accurate and tell more of where they are andor they shouldnt give a mobility hit because that can lead to a  hit death or leave the driver immobilized while they reload and shoot more andor the range should be decreased andor the countermeasures should work  of the time andor you should get more than  countermeasure andor the turn radius should be adjusted for missiles so that you can skillfully outrun them andor the range should be decreased to give you a chance on certain maps to avoid the lock ons especially on maps like Hainan where  lock on can have complete dominance over air vehicles including jets.Lock ons are probably going to stay in future games so there should be some balancing to them or ways to skillfully avoid them and not getting caught in a mobility hit where you are an open target to anyone.Edit formatting and adding some clarification,battlefield_4,ct90ya5,3,t5_2uie9

They always go back to their homebase or behind the buildings and wait there until they get countermeasures back. To do so they also take the narrowest and most dangerous routes to avoid trouble. TAKE AWAY THEIR SAFE SPOTS! STIGLA the hell out of them. They will most likely crash into buildings or on the ground. Remember YOU DONT HAVE TO GET THE KILL but you just have to keep them dead for a while. Unlike the Scout Helis AH arent very nimble so the ckoser they are to your homebase the more vulnerable they are against other rockets. Dont worry SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOU WANT THAT CHOPPER DEAD so at least you have another STIGLA bro somewhere. Yes I know that some people say STIGLA are cheap but what else can you do?

4781688,0,t3_3gdmrs,MBT HE is pretty bad low velocity high bullet drop low splash damage slow reload. So either AP as the allrounder good bullet velocity and drop and reload awesome splash damage against Inf or Sabot on wide maps which has the samesimilar? stats as AP but higher velocity and less splash damage against Inf. IFV The best allround main weapon imho is the APFSDST. Less splash damage than the mm but higher bullet velocity and pin point accuracy. You can snipe people across the map with it. And unlike with the canister shells you can actually defeat enemy armor with it.  TLDR MBT AP IFV APFSDSTEdit Check out Symthic ,battlefield_4,ctx9t20,9,t5_2uie9
4785985,0,t3_3gg38w,attachments come in different classes optics  they are purely visuals so it depends what you like most. put a x scope on your AEK? why not.. You know best what you prefer but sure there are some rather useless combinations high rate of fire and a high zoom  does not make sense to shoot with a high spread weapon on longer distances. My personal preference I like the coyote for x very low profile so you see the surroundings best and the pso for longer rangers x. grips the last spring patch changed a lot on how the grips behave. theyre still useful but not so much as they were before. I run most of my guns without any grip. the folded or angled grip still do some good but I personally dont think the difference is that big. all the other grips give you a very small penalty in the time it takes to get full accuracy back after firing.  barrels heavy barrel is on most of my guns. it gives a little bit more accuracy. muzzle break compensator flash hider are all gone from my weapons. they dont do any good. if needed I add a silencer all work the same but keep in mind that a silences slows down your bullets reduces range and increases hip fire spread. so they are no always on option. only put it on if youre going to adapt your playstyle to make some use of it! underbarrel special I like to take the bipod UGL rail or straight pull for sniper rifles as a separate class because the actually change a lot on your gun. put on the bipod or UGL rail if you dont want anything else no harm if you dont need it.best way to approach this spend an hour or two on the test range and shoot at the walls.,battlefield_4,ctxt9si,1,t5_2uie9

If you are in a squad and the current squad leader has yet to issue an order you can request orders a single time and if he doesnt issue orders within  seconds you become the new squad leader.

Or at least thats my memory of it before I stopped playing the game because no one was playing on PC.If the current squad leader is not spawned into the game when you request the order the timer wont run on him.,battlefield_4,cun6z5d,2,t5_2uie9

4993138,0,t1_cunttks,Not a programmer or game developer so apologies if my guess is not even possible.What I would do is let FriendsSquad Members stay together.  I would try to team balance based on rank score Last round and skill base score to determine the balance.   The balance would only occur for that map.  Next map the team that got switched would automatically start on the opposite side.  If they were defense twice in a row the last map they would automatically be attackers the beginning of next map.  After a certain period of map rotations the team would be stuck to a side.  Meaning that they would stay attacker then defender after each round after that.  In addition their friends would also stick to that side just like the squad if they had more friends on than the max  squad.I think it should be possible to fit an algorithm like this within the game mechanics.  That way you can let the game attempt to balance properly.  After say like  maps its over.  The balancing is complete.  Then after that put another variable that makes it after  matches the whole process starts again.Like I said Im not a game developer or a programmer so I have no clue if you can design the game mechanics to function this way.  But Ive played Socom RIP Call of Duty and startin from Battle Company  BF and the team balancing experience like this has never occurred until now.  This maybe due to the skill level of the current game or just bad game design.  Im not trashing the game but these are basic concepts.  Having a team defend for   hours because they have become good isnt logical.  The point of playing a game is to excel at it and to master.  Not to be completely clueless and just do one thing because you are inept and the other team isnt.,battlefield_4,cunuy8j,1,t5_2uie9

5185105,0,t3_3lywqn,I read something recently that skill in BF is not so much how to handle weapons but positioning. Im beginning to think more and more that this is true.You seem to have no situation awareness. What I meanWith in the first  seconds of the video you kill two enemies without ever looking at the hallway that leads to the C flag even though you ran by it on the other side of the street. The enemies have it yet you never look there to make sure there are not enemies coming from there. This is why you get killed when you turn to go up the stairs. Instead you should have used the cover to your left to look to the left and make sure there was no one standing there or coming out of there. You killed two enemies without a silenced weapon any one at C knows youre out in the area where you are because you showed up on their mini map for every shot you took. This all precludes that you did not even need to run down that support coming down from the stairs. He did not even see you and you had cover from fire that could have come from across the street. When you spawn back in you seem unsure of the surroundings even though your team has the two closest flags why? Sure there was an Amtrac that just drove by but even then if any one would have jumped out they more than likely would have been trying to go to E. You come to the top of the stairs and stop. This is probably one of the worst spots to stop at on that entire map. You have no idea if an enemy coming up the other stairs which seeing as they still have C is very likely. You should have run through the top and to cover. You stopped in an open area wide open to several lanes of fire. The nade throw at makes no sense. Even more so since you barely stayed to make sure there was not someone hiding behind that tank. You just lost your only nade. Now you have to wait  seconds to get another. Youre standing out in the open again without knowing what is going on around you. Are there enemies on top of the buildings to the front and left as you come through the doorway? You always seem to be stopping out in the open. If you go out in the open youre moving from one cover to the other. Even if you have the flag. A friendly fires a RPG and use your grenade launcher without knowing where the enemy is now the enemy if any are around know where both of you are. Then you proceed to run up the stairway cover and expose yourself from all angles. You try to shoot the enemy but cant because of the changes to head glitching. The enemy knows where you are since they threw the nade but you jump down without knowing exactly where he is since you didnt spot him whether you tried or not is irrelevant. The fact that you did not die the instant you landing is amazing. Since you have E it would be logical that the said enemy that you just tried to engage ran up those same stairs. Not only did you run up the stairs without looking first but at the top of the first flight you ran around a corner. This is like one of the rules of BF never never run around corners. The only exception is if you know friendlies are around that corner and that would apply to only stairs like the one in you video. Its not impossible for that to be the guy you engaged earlier. You were there way too long and showed yourself multiple times. I personally would have either jumped on that sign and gone across to E turned around and gone down the stairs make sure that it was clear all the way down or just jumping down. While all are risky staying there is way more likely for you to end up dead. Your teammate revived you and is looking at the cover for the stairs. It looks like he knows an enemy is around there. Instead you divert your attention to the E flag. While that guy with the XM is dangerous its not possible to know if he knows you were revived. Your teammate is far more interested in the stairs though. That should have been your primary focus. v is better odds especially since youre both Assault. Why are you not on the fly when your squad mate just ran in to take it? Again youre leaving yourself out in the open. As mentioned by someone else C is all over the floor. This is an obvious trap and someone is watching. You engaged in the open you should have died. Though it was v which is why you survived. I personally would have stayed in the building if everyone was jumping out. They can take the flag and Ill be the lookoutmobile spawn. Running around corners chasing an enemy that you have no idea where he is exactly. You know the guy is up there because of the muzzle flash at  why did you switch to the Unica? You should have cleared the building all the way up. Because you didnt you get shot in the back down to  health. Then you come out of the bunker thing and do not even give one glance up to see from where the shots came from. Its likely at  that you died so quickly because you where shot by at least  different enemies. This makes absolutely no sense. I dont even know why you nor your teammates nor your squad mates went in to that building where the support that killed you was. You could have used the grenade launcher to remove the building cover he was using and completely expose him putting him on the defensive. You knew that guy was probably in there too. This part just baffles my mind at how not only you but also your squad and teammates engaged the whole thing from  to . They were not camping by the way. They were clearing the area of known threats before trying to take the flag. There was like  of you there. They were playing it smart. That guy probably spawned at  as I think I hear the audio queue when you ran through the previous room without taking a simple side to side look. Corner running again. Again you stop at the top of the stairs exsposed and this time the flag is being contested which means you know enemy are around. Your out wondering around in the open again.  You should be inside the area there to the right of the stairs as you come to the top of them. I usually run around the back as most people are not looking in that direction. Why the pistol? This makes no sense. Another bad set of stairs to stop at the top of. Personally after being shot from there once I would not have gone back up those stairs as they were expecting you. The wall is gone and you have no cover to your right. You should not have peaked this corner again. You have no idea if theyre watching or not. Unless you know you have the advantage never peak a corner twice especially one you just got shot from and killed. You stopped at the top of the stairs again. Goodbad spawn. Not much you could have done here. At least you got the Assault players. Only thing I can think of is you should have switched to your pistol faster. You might have been able to finish him off. So many mistakes. You knew enemies were up there since your squad mate just died up there. You saw an enemy parachute down. Running around corners in an area that you know there are enemies. Stopping at the top of stairs again. When you get shot from an unknown enemy your natural reaction should be to run to cover from the direction the fire is coming from. In this case it would have been back down the stairs. Going further out in the open is the reason why you died.Theres a lot more but it keeps repeating. Basically you have no situational awareness of where the enemy is or could be coming from and youre constantly putting yourself out in the open even when you know where a potential threat is located generally or even specifically. You need to learn to move from cover to cover and know where the threats are or could possibly be and neutralize them or put them on the defensive. On the other side if you see an enemy and cant be sure youll kill him dont engage but spot him. Now you have the advantage. You know where he is but he does not know where you are. Even if you dont engage youve now given your team the advantage against him. You dont have the engage every target.And for the love of everything good spot. If you see an enemy and do not spot him youve just lost your only advantage.,battlefield_4,cvazuq2,12,t5_2uie9

5256719,0,t3_3n00t9,There are a few route you two can take to help each other but it ultimately comes down to spotting and stealth.Have one of you guys run as an engi with rockets and the other recon with something to lock onto the tanks with ie. SOFLAM PLDs or even SUAV. This will allow the engi to have the rockets guided to the target from a safe distance or cover. This method is the easiest but would mostly require additional ammo boxes from a support.My favorite option is using C and there are a few ways to help each other out. The easiest would be to place C on a friendly vehicle like dirt bikes or quads run that vehicle into the tank exit the vehicle and detonate the C. You could have a recon use other equipment to spot and guide the jihad bike through the battlefield. This will take some getting used to if you have never used this method. This method to me and most people is the funnest and more challenging option.Another option would be to tank it up. Have the driver run as support with ammo and maybe even C or a UCAV which can disable the tank in one hit if placed right and the passenger as an engi with a repair tool and rockets. The support supplies the engi with rocket ammo and the engi repairs and rockets when needed. This option would require getting in and out of your vehicle. If you are new to vehicles just take your time and keep at it. It also helps to turn up the vehicle mousecontroller sensitivity.Usually with a two man team attacking vehicles one will always provide support while the other attacks. Again take your time and pick your targets. Try to find that lone tank or armor and be stealthy. It will get frustrating against good tank operators but keep trying and find what works best with your play styles.,battlefield_4,cvjmfde,4,t5_2uie9

Waiting long after clicking join server seems to get me in consistently it just doesnt show what place I am in line.  This is a major problem because trying to join a server where you are th or th in line sometimes means a  minute wait without knowing your progress in the queue.

Hence on PC people can turn  on a low setting in almost no time. That derives from the massive input you can just force it to do. You cant do that without a high sensitivity on console and high sensitivities cant change how you turn the TV AFAIK.,battlefield_4,cvnw3ct,1,t5_2uie9

5424759,0,t1_cw5209r,Because its a team game. I dont particularly care if I win or lose each round so long as everybody is having a go. The best games are when everyone is pushing flags hard and it comes down to the wire.When youve got guys sitting on ledges buildings and hills a mile away from the action it means two things. One is that theyre not helping. At all. And secondly they almost invariably suck.And to be clear I dont even care when people have zero skill but I do really care when people dont even make any attempt to contribute at all. I dont care if every one of your shots misses but at least react to the guy who appears behind me and try to shoot him before he kills me. At least drop ammo revive put down a motion sensor rep tanks and SPOT. A quadruple amputee could contribute more than people who sit on skyscrapers all game.Look at the profiles of these people on rooftops and youll be lucky to see a single Spotting Ribbon in their entire time played. I regularly see enemies flank them in the most humiliating ways because they have the situational awareness and reflexes of a boiled spud. Theyre up there because they need to be because they get annihilated at ground level. I understand that. Thats why theyre desperate to find a way to avoid the enemy being able to fight back. But they need to understand that theyre not going to get any better by continuing to do the same thing by not even trying to get better by giving up throwing in the towel and sticking a x on their SRR.And they often take the Attack Heli on Shanghai too. Thats unforgivable. Its one thing not helping your team its another thing entirely actively sabotaging them.So yeah its a game and were all just there to have a bit of fun. But I think you would have every right to criticise your teammate at football when he stands in the corner all game with his hands down his shorts. I dont care if you fail just do something.,battlefield_4,cw52i2g,9,t5_2uie9

And i also like that one More flares amp reduced reload for all aircrafts. Was an issue with the Stealth Jet. Above Increased damage from boat miniguns. All miniguns damage drops faster. A ground vehicle has a problem  fix it for the vehicleOne aircraft has a problem  give all a massive buff.Maybe Dice is ruining the game on purpose so more people buy Battlefront and play there.

5756136,0,t3_3tz0cz,Honestly Id like to see less in BF than there was in BF so there can be more focus on other things netcode map design balance.Like reduce the amount of needless gadgets and weapons. Sure someones favourite thing may disappear but for the sake of balance and developmenttesting time a lot of things can be removed or consolidated to different parts of the game.There are SO MANY things that can destroy vehicles in BF compared to BF for example that being a tanker or LAV driver or pilot has you covering your own ass more often than being offensive in any way. Do we really need new gadgets with every DLC? New maps sure. New guns maybe. New game modes maybe. But new gadgets are a lot harder to balance and make work and tend to have limited use anyway.The classes feel less unique now because they have access to pretty much anything that can be useful in any situation to lesser degrees sure but still useful. All classes have access to gadgets that can damage and destroy vehicles when before this was primarily the Engineers job. The Assault class has the hardest time with it but taking potshots at a tank with the grenade launcher can be effective.While having a lot of weapon diversity is nice many of them hardly differ from each other other than a slightly different firerate or very slightly different recoil pattern. A . recoil in one direction wont be really noticeable compared to a . recoil in the same direction on a different gun to the average player. However the weapons differ dramatically visually which I think is the primary reason there are so many. Some people like the guns purely based on visuals and thats fine.However with all the different weapons comes all the unlocks. So many unlocks that have to be earned through kills for each gun individually. If I unlocked an ACOG for one rifle why do I need to unlock it again for a different one? Its the exact same scope! It makes sense that some scopessuppressorsgrips would only work for certain guns due to agefactionetc but we dont need to be unlocking  things for each gun all the time.The Battlepacks were a neat idea but after opening hundreds of them and getting so many useless XP boosts that cannot stackbe exchanged which rendered the SPM stat completely useless as well as silly objects for player icons that they kind of wore out their welcome. Youd sometimes unlock addons for guns but USUALLY they were for guns youd never usehave not used yetuse a lot but would never use the addon you got.I think that DICE thinks that the player must be constantly rewarded in order for them to keep playing the game. The sentiment has some truth to it but I dont think rewarding the player with undesirable attachmentsXP boostsweird profile image things is the way to do it. Let players pick what they want to work towards so they can make their own goals keep XP boosts to special events or specific weekends and make attachments less of a grind. If I unlock an ACOG scope for ARs then I can use it on any AR it could realistically be attached to. I dont need to unlock the ACOG for the M AND ALSO the M separately.So TLDR Less is more.,battlefield_4,cxalqet,2,t5_2uie9

5890285,0,t1_cxrj8u7,Almost but not quite. It might seem that way if you havent used it much but its quite different in practical use. It has a much slower rate of fire than even the slow DMRs and a different damage model.Its a one shot kill to the head at close range which none of the DMRs will do in normal mode and also two body shots to kill close up. But the damage drops off quite fast so at usual distances you need at least one more hit after a headshot for a kill like with a DMR.The slow rate of fire means that you have to be more accurate if you miss the first or second shot you will most likely lose any engagement against an automatic weapon up to medium range if the enemy is aware of you.Another key difference from the DMRs is that you can equip all sniper scopes but I find that anything beyond xx is not really useful for this gun because of the damage model. Its really only useful at medium to long range not the extreme sniper ranges. If using a long range ie. x scope then I find canted ironsights to be much more useful than the x variable.What I miss most from the DMRs is the ability to use the target detector with the closemedium scopes. I find it to be very useful both for me and my team when spotting  scanning for enemies at range. Its almost cheating.I wish there was an option to use the target detector also on sniper rifles only for the close and medium range scopes.,battlefield_4,cxrr11g,1,t5_2uie9

Its like vsync but it should prevent the controls from feeling sluggish which happens sometimes with vsync.you can try some different numbers some people like . since the p setting for BF in the settings is at . hz.

6232603,0,t1_cyy28by,Weird that they locked you out is it an arris touchstone? Normally the username is admin and the password is either password or a number on a sticker on the modem. I assume you know the gateway address since you seem to know what youre doing. I personally recommend a Motorola surfboard modem and use a rd part router like a nighthawk. The combo routers are shit plain and simple. Plus most docis providers broadcast a seperate wifi signal out of your routergateway for other customers to usecomcasts is called xfinity if you search for wifi networks. You also lease the modem so buying one pays for itself and you can configure and monitor whatever you want. It is very important that the customer be able to see the connectionsignallogs page as thats the best way to monitor your line for issues.Docis uses codewords for forward error correcting. So if you cannot monitor your accruing uncorrectable codewords how are you supposed to know if your line is healthy. Uncorrectable codewords leads to packetloss which leads to modem reinits. Plus you should be able to see the signal to noise ratios and such. Its ridiculous that they would lock you out of the modem im not doubting you im just saying that the company is stupid to do so. Also if you have an old drop wire the wire going from the pedestal to your house it may be worth it to run a new one. Throw the dude  and im sure he would do it i would. New splitters and connections also go a long way to a healthy connection. You are having a new homerun run already  so thats great.

6468945,0,t1_czoefrn,That would mean youre only hitting them with one or two pellets. See this page for the stats on canister select tank gt canister then scroll to the bottom. Each canister shell contains  pellets IIRC. Each of those  pellets does  dmg to infantry within  m so you only need to hit with three out of the sixteen pellets in the shell to kill infantry within  m beyond that youll still only need four pellets but pellet spread becomes the limiting factor.But at  m the pellet spread will be tight so its not a very forgiving close range weapon. If your aim isnt perfect at this range you might just nick them for  or  dmg instead of killing them hence why I think LMG or HMG is a better choice if you like to get up close. Canister is best used if youre sitting back a bit. In the    m range the pellet spread makes aiming a lot more forgiving  just aim near a target or slightly ahead of a moving target and you should get the kill.,battlefield_4,czofnwh,1,t5_2uie9

6540973,0,t1_czuwijb,I somewhat agree but as the attacking teams performance is based both on completing the objective and not dying too many times it would be wise not to encourage people to be TOO reckless. In fact Id say the amount of points awarded to a successful MCOM planter already does this and isnt fair just by planting you often havent helped the team that much not to the proportion awarded since it will take others to defend the plant and any one of them could have easily armed it themselves. What Im saying is the scoring system needs entirely reworking in the direction of teamwork.I suppose you could remove both kills and deaths and just give a raw score though there should probably still be a score penalty from dying. If score is weighted in the direction of teamwork actions and completing objectives as a team those who are actually playing the objective sensibly will come out on top whilst overly reckless players and cowards will suffer scorewise. Since score would be the only number to focus on it should potentially improve play.,battlefield_4,czvw1bj,1,t5_2uie9

7200080,0,t3_4e334n,Over k kills in the Attack Jet on PS and I was rank  in Attack Jet kills in Finland for a long time. Also around  kills in both jets combined on PC so I would say I know my shit. Stealth Jets mm shreds through aerial targets mm is a bit worse on aerial targets but does more damage to ground targets than the other two and mm is somewhere between. The Attack Jet mm shreds everything. not so much after one patch a while ago where they nerfed the attack jet To get those fast turns you need the correct velocity. Around  is fine. You can see your velocity in the hud so you can check it whenever but after hrs of flying you just sort of feel how fast you are going. Slower than  makes you stall and faster than that just makes your turn radius bigger since you are going so fast it is pretty logical imo.  Laser Guided is pretty shit imo. But thats just my opinion. Try to help out your tanks in their tank battles and you might steal a kill or two on your own you cant do shit against a tank with the laser guided. There is spawn AA but the enemy jet needs to be spotted for the AA to start firing.About dogfights Do a vertical circle loop. Think of it as a clock. Full throttle at  let go of throttle at  and start braking at  then repeat. And then learn to time when to break the circle to trick yourself behind your opponent. Any questions I am happy to ask.Edit Here is a dogfighting video I made a while ago. The enemy team couldnt do shit they even tried to v me but no luck my flying was perfect. Always look at your air radar and use ECM to hide yourself from their radar. Edit Added details and corrected typos.,battlefield_4,d1wlalv,5,t5_2uie9

Even with reasonable amount of kills with it still give you place in the lower part of the list.From my experience I admit that constant spotting with it even though not everyone observes the minimap and destroying enemy charges does hell a lot of difference for your team but it simply doesnt affect your final score that much.I really liked flying with this thing started after DICE kd my previous toy  SRAW but after FLIR balancing patch its simply not fun starring at whole gray screen with few bright spots in it.

I give orders every single time an objective changes status depending on which objective  sometimes Id let the objective go. gtIm on my second account.  BF is my first online multi FPS so the road to  was long and hard.  Second account stats are much better because I know the ins and outs.   I mostly run Engineer  love flying and driving  but Ill also run AggRec and PTFO Medic on certain maps and Support when I want to goof around.Whoa. No way would I do this journey again. I am level  right now. gtAnd yeah the MBT LAW is the best launcher in the game.  Fast flat quick reload laser designated and consistent.

What happens is that you generally get badly designed maps for a specific modes like Rush in BF or Conquest in BC.As far as the quick vehicle respwn rate you mentioned I agree . Vehicles in the game should be a prize and regarded as a high value asset but the game makes them way too easy to obtain. Especially with fast vehicle respawn servers. This breaks the vehicle and infantry balance. Been saying this since release but admins that allow this dont care. This is also DICEs fault for allowing these servers to be ranked.,battlefield_4,d35f44g,14,t5_2uie9

7634290,0,t3_4jv02g,efficient way to deal with ituse a cable for a match or two yeah probably is some work to set up the PC near the router. If you see no ping spikes get Powerline It delivers a much more stable connection than Wifi that means less packet loss and less latency variation. I used Wifi for some weeks and went nuts with the network delays because I was used to ethernet cable connections then I bought some powerline adapters and everything was fine just like in my cable days.Gamers should never use Wifi!If you still get those ping spikes when connected via cable then you got a driver problem or router problem or ISP problem. This can get tricky to figure out if you dont have other hardware to rule out causes.And btw In BF go to OPTIONS gt GAMEPLAY gt ADVANCED OPTIONS and enable NETWORK PERFORMANCE GRAPH rd last entry and post a screenshot after the spike appeared.,battlefield_4,d39z6e6,2,t5_2uie9

8509350,0,t1_d657v26,Well if you say so yourself. I think because your parents for some reason thought it okay for you to play these things when you were young you now think it is okay for your son to play violent games at a young age as well. You see what is happening here? Im sure you will find people that tell you that drinking vodka and smoking is perfectly fine for a  year old because their parents also said so. That does not make it healthier.Does your son watch regular TV? At  years old? Your argument is not coherent at all and makes no sense.I am not saying your son is not cute or caring but there is only so much reason a  year old can have. Rayman seems like a great game for him. Battlefield on consoles and on PC is not the most violent game in the world but has enough blood splatter especially when you do headshots and realistic graphics to seriously fuck up a childs psyche. Also I dont really get how your son is harmed if he cant play BF until he is  or older? There are so many great games for kids. I played Max Payne and GTA when I was  even though they are adult only games... so I do somewhat agree with you just  years old is too young if you dont get that fine.,battlefield_4,d6582zk,1,t5_2uie9

10386128,0,t1_dclbomr,Was that assignment in one round?  Part of the problem people have with TOWs is that they dont get many chances to use them in tough spots.  I only started using them because DICE removed the ability to use lockon weapons in the fourth seat of the Attack Craft.  So all the topboat drivers have a dedicated repper I didnt so I had to improvise with TOWs.  It took a lot of trial and error.  I would suggest using the LAV first and then go to the Attack Craft when youve learned the tendencies of the TOW missile.  ,battlefield_4,dclbyuj,2,t5_2uie9

11204748,0,t3_5zt2aa,The RPG is fantastic for killing tanks. Make sure youre only taking rear and side shots because the rockets you land in front arent getting crit or damage modifiers. Its really not even worth showing up on the enemy minimap for a frontal tank rpg or rocket of any kind unless you think you can get the kill shot. Two good rear shots will kill a tank and the first one will disable it making the second one a piece of cake assuming you werent immediately spotted by the tank objective or enemy infantry. If all else fails use C on a quad and take the longest route possible to try and flank the annoying tank.  A lot of people dont have the patience to make a worthwhile jihad run in a jeep or quad because theyll take the most efficient path to reach their intended target and that method is usually going to result in being marked before you ever reach your target. Instead take the LONG way around the map so you can approach from the rear and hopefully avoid being spotted in order to initiate the c attack on your own terms. ,battlefield_4,df21ld2,1,t5_2uie9

I have changed the filters around.  For example I mainly play HC and if I have only HC selected and nothing else or everything else selected in all categories as that should have the same effect theyll be HC servers in my favorites that dont show dont show up in search.  It doesnt apply to all my favorited servers either so I know its not that favorite servers dont show up in search.  Hell sometimes I search with HC selected and all other options open and itll display like  servers max I know theres more than  HC servers for BF across the entire world.

Obviously the SJ beats the AJ if the pilots are of equal skill  but that just didnt happen the older the game got.,battlefield_4,dgiux3l,1,t5_2uie9
