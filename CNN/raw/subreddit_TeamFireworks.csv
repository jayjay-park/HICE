6197121,0,t3_40gki9,My weights almost always been an issue. Looking back at pictures sometime around age  or  I began to pile it on. I remember as a kid sneaking food up to my room... jars of peanut butter sleeves of crackers cookie after cupcake after candy bar. My parents would find wrappers hidden everywhere but never said anything about it. I learned early on that food was the answer to stress and emotional discomfort.I dont think I realized my weight was an issue though until my mids. I never really paid any mind to the way I looked. At my heaviest I was a size  so I never struggled to find clothes. I had friends who were bigger than me so I always felt kind of normal. But around age  or so I started to feel tired all the time. My back ached. My knees would twinge. We moved to a place with stairs and a single flight got me winded. All of this I realized was not normal for a  year old body. That was  years ago and Ive managed to lose the same  lb  times now. Now Im on round  after putting the weight back on postbaby!,TeamFireworks,cyu1one,6,t5_3bqvy
6211870,0,t3_40dyol,MFP afilczer Though maybe someone can help me. I have been updating my weight loss and exercise and none of it is posting to my feed. I checked my settings to ensure it was public for anyone to see and it still isnt showing up. I also made sure all my updates to my app were current. Any thoughts? ,TeamFireworks,cyvq0zz,1,t5_3bqvy
6212440,0,t3_40m1s3,I wanted a little dessert last night so I decided to make a little oatmeal concoction. I used Pumpkin Spice Jello Pudding mix almond milk quick oats splenda cinnamon vanilla extract ...and chia seeds. I accidentally got into my overnight oats routine and added chia seeds which need a while to plump up. I was bummed because I really wanted dessert RIGHT THEN... so I thought what the heck maybe theyll plump up if I microwave it...ampnbspFriends this was the best idea ever. My kitchen smelled awesome my house smelled awesome and the chia seeds were all hydrated n stuff. Good choices. ,TeamFireworks,cyvsd1v,5,t5_3bqvy
