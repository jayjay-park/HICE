9451523,0,t3_5a5z7m,Maybe try an orange or yellow color for better contrast. Bright red and dark blue is kind of hard on they eyes. Also personally I would just lose the captain daddy hat seems random and out of place but if you like it you should keep it,RLFashionAdvice,d9e1piq,1,t5_3ch88
9473006,0,t1_d9gqjzh,I like making a contrast rather than matching colors or mixing things up a little bit. For blue team i use Dark Blue as my primary color and red as secondary color and it goes great with default chakrams.

9728097,0,t3_5eg0h7,My suggestion is sell the heatwave for  keys giving you  keys Then getting painted loopers for  keys which I believe is a fair price then with the other  spend  keys on each and get your two Chakrams. If they ask for more than  keys you are overpaying. Hope this helps! Or you can always just wait out the market until things drop in value,RLFashionAdvice,dac78to,-4,t5_3ch88

10899610,0,t3_5vnhqn,I could reccomend painted loopers. Something like sky blue or saffron. Unfortunately you wont get one for each team with  keys i think! Maybe you could also try to get some lime lightnings and burnt sienna lightnings  both look pretty good imo ,RLFashionAdvice,de47u2y,1,t5_3ch88
10915681,0,t1_de5re9t,Yes but I like that you can customize two colors on heat wave. Only selecting one color on distortion isnt quite as cool IMO,RLFashionAdvice,de5virt,4,t5_3ch88
