2846941,0,t3_2spfnu,Hey there!Youll definitely want to observe from the darkest skies possible. Light pollution really takes away from the views of deepsky objects like nebulae star clusters and galaxies. Youll get your best view of these under dark skies. Id recommend observing from the more rural site as much as you reasonably can.When you begin looking at telescopes theres really one thing that you want to keep in mind and thats aperture. One misconception that a lot of people have about telescopes is that their purpose is to magnify objects however that isnt the goal of a telescope. The main purpose of a telescope is to gather light and deliver it to your eye so that you can see objects that are much too dim to see with your eye alone. The more light a telescope can collect youll be able to see dimmer and dimmer objects or see more detail in brighter ones and on objects like the planets youll be able to resolve more detail such as the cloud bands on Jupiter. With that in mind the amount of light a telescope can collect is determined by the area of its primary mirror on reflecting telescopes or objective lens on refracting telescope and a telescopes aperture is simply the measurement of the diameter of these mirrors and lenses. So long story short youre going to want as much aperture as you can get.You probably know that there are two main types of telescopes those being reflecting using mirrors and refracting using lenses. Since mirrors are typically easier to manufacture than lenses youll typically find that reflectors are much more affordable than refractors of similar aperture. So as much as I like the look of refractors my main scope is a refractor youre probably want to buy a reflector to get the most aperture for the money.There are a lot of good options for starter scopes too many to list here but one good line of scopes that you really cant go wrong with and is frequently recommended is the Orion SkyQuest Dobsonians. These scopes are very simple and intuitive to use as opposed to a scope on an equatorial mount and give you about as much aperture as you can get for your money. Since theyre reflectors they do need to be occasionally collimated meaning the mirrors need to be realigned every so often but that shouldnt be too hard to learn. You can check out these scopes at Orions websiteOne last thing Ill say is that you may want to save a part of your budget for accessories for the telescopes such as eyepieces barlows and filters. Most of these telescopes only come with one or two eyepieces so you may want to buy an eyepiece or two keep in mind magnification is equal to the focal length of the telescope divided by the focal length of the eyepiece so the longer the eyepieces focal length the less magnification is provides in the telescope. Barlows are often said to double your number of eyepieces as they simply double the magnification of whichever eyepiece youre using. You may find filters to be of use if youre observing objects that are in some light pollution. Filters such as Light Pollution Reduction filters LPR and narrowband filters help to block out as much light pollution as they can and allow you to more easily see the light that is coming from deepsky objects. Also you may find a MoonNeutral DensityVariable Polarizing filter to be of good use since the Moon and some of the planets can be quite bright in the eyepiece and can easily ruin your darkadapted vision.Id also recommend downloading Stellarium free onto your computer so you can see what the sky looks like on a given night. Theres even a plugin in Stellarium that allows you to put in the specifications of your telescopes and eyepieces and simulate what the view through a certain eyepiece and telescopes would look like in real life note brightness isnt really scaled though so youll find that objects in real life look way dimmer than they do in Stellarium. I use this program all the time to see whats up.Hope that helps and be sure to ask any other questions you might have!,telescopes,cnrp35t,5,t5_2qnl1

3161814,0,t3_2wcyfr,Hi there!It really doesnt take much to see the Galilean moons  Ive been able to spot them barely in binoculars when I hold them steady enough and thats x magnification. So its no surprise you could see them at x in your scope with mm of aperture. And yes the factors you listed certainly could have improved your viewing conditions.The mm shouldnt really be useless  the maximum magnification for your scope is about x rule of thumb is x per millimeter of aperture or x per inch of aperture and the mm will give you x. Then again the quality of the mm is probably not that all that great so that may be affecting your experience with it.What barlows do is essentially double the focal length of the telescope which in turn doubles the magnification any given eyepiece will provide so the mm eyepiece which normally provides x would provide x when used with a x barlow. So yes a mm would be redundant in a sense since it would provide the same magnification as a barlowed mm eyepiece. However one thing to keep in mind is that a mm eyepiece would probably give a slightly better view then a barlowed mm but the difference is typically pretty small if you have a good quality barlow.What kind of budget do you have for buying a new eyepiece andor barlow? With almost all astronomy equipment you generally get what you pay for in terms of quality so knowing your budget is useful for recommendations.Hope that helps and be sure to ask any other questions you might have!,telescopes,coppy04,2,t5_2qnl1

3720526,0,t3_3305od,Hello A . reflector is a good entry into the hobby. Have you observed with it already? Are you interested in planets deepsky or both?Judging from the Amazon reviews the telescope or at least older models came with a . focuser and eyepieces. In the download manual Meade states . eyepieces so newer models have a different focuser or an adapter included. Please measure if your focuser fits . eyepieces as these are todays standard and it will decide if you need an adapter in order to use them Amazon Reviewer mentioned that Meade sends them out for free but you can get them for  bucks at eBay too. You can of course still buy . eyepieces at a few places but better and cheaper  eyepieces are typically ..I found different products listed some came with two eyepieces MA mm MA mm some also had a x barlow. What came with yours? And again . or .?The MAEyepieces are a tad better then some of the cheap kit eyepieces but they are still pretty basic. Kit eyepieces tend to have short eye relief a narrow apparent field of view internal reflections low contrast and they are accused of untying your shoes and causing global warming If you have not already observe with what you have despite the kit accessories. The cheap x barlow is pretty useless. Combined with the mm eyepiece you reach over x which is too much for this telescope and typical seeing conditions. Also the kit barlow ill lower the contrast and show a lot of chromatic aberration. Now there seem to be two models of the telescope one beeing mm Aperture with mm sometimes mm focal length the other mm focal length. There should be a stickerlabel around the focuser or backside of the tube. If it is the mm version Is it a long tube or a short one like this? With mm focal length  mm eyepiece  x Magnification  mm eyepiece   x Barlow    mm eyepiece  x  mm eyepiece  x Barlow  xWith mm focal length  mm eyepiece  x Magnification  mm eyepiece   x Barlow    mm eyepiece  x  mm eyepiece  x Barlow  xSo as you can see the Barlow makes no sense at all in this kit. With the mm eyepiece you reach about the same magnification as with the mm. The mm plus barlow reaches too high magnifications. x is about the limit of the telescope and more is rarely possible due to seeing anyway.The budget route would be to buy two PlsslEyepieces decent quality cheap older eyepiece type Short eye relief under mm and a achromatic Barlow of better quality. If you are willing to order in Germany or at Aliexpress China you can get a mm mm and Barlow for under  shipped. Check for dutyfree regulations on small orders. From the US you would need to spend about  per Plssl and a bit more for the Barlow  shipped.If you really want some better accessories consider getting some wide angle eyepieces. There are pretty good ones available for .  Sadly the mm is sold out at a lot of places. You can still get it for  at Aliexpress or for a bit over  in the UK. In the US I think it starts at around  with a brand label.The degree apparent field of view is very nice also makes searching and tracking easier. While with cheap eyepieces its like looking through a narrow tube wideangle eyepieces feel like looking through a port hole of a space shuttle This is a simulation made with Stellarium and not for mm focal length but gives you an idea of how a wide angle eyepiece differs from a kit eyepiece.   vs degree apparent field of viewAnother thing  you need is a collimation eyepiece. This can be a dust cap or film can with a hole in it or a cheshiresight tube. Basically you look through these and adjust the mirror  with three screws until everything is centered. Only then you will reach the highest contrast especially at higher magnifications.     a lot less complicated if you actually do it with a telescope infront of you. The basic steps of adjusting the primary mirror and checking collimation is actually much easier then the whole procedure    Forget about the cheap laser colimators. While laser collimators make collimation easy especially on longer telescope tubes the cheap ones are often not adjusted well themselves dont fit tight in the focuser and wobbly entry level telescopes focuser can be a problem  That all can make collimation even worse. Do not buy eyepiece kits those in a case with dozens of filters and cheap eyepieces you wont even use half of those and zoom eyepieces They always have a narrow field of view on one side of the setting.The next thing is the equatorial mount of your telescope. While an equatorial mount makes tracking of objects easy and looks pretty neat it has a few downsides.First beginners may not understand how to align and use it thanks to the bad manuals out there. A quick search on youtube should find you a  few helpful guides.Second most entry level telescope sets come with one of the weakest equatorial mount to save money and shipping cost. Especially at higher magnifications for planets it will juggle with every touch and adjustment sometimes needing two or three seconds to settle. This can be very annoying.Sadly a rigid eq mount costs more then the telescope itself. This is why dobsonians have become so popular in the past years. It is a simple rigid wooden box with gliders or ball bearings under the telescope leaving more money for the actual optics. It is a simple AltAz AltitudeAzimuth Updownleftright mount so tracking objects has to be done in two directions rather then just turning a knob on an EQ mount. But with a bit of practice and wideangle eyepiece this is easy to do even at high magnifications.A while back I bought a few used telescopes with bad or no mount and built rockerboxes with students.  Not pretty but amazing what less then  dollars and very simple tools can accomplish . Of course if you build only one you can use nicer boards and colors Last but not least keep in mind that   will buy you a telescope that is a bit better  one that is a lot better. So do not spend too much on accessories! The telescope and  the weak eqmount will always be the bottle neck at a certain point.Again use what you have.A lot of deepsky objects Nebulae Galaxies StarClusters will be visible at low magnifications much better then at high magnifications.Consider buying Turn left at Orion The Paper version! as it explains how to use a telescope where to find objects how to observe and what to expect great drawings. The visual impression       will never match the colorful photographs long exposures multiple stacked imagesAlso see the influence of light pollution here for planets it does not matter as they are bright.For Deepsky observing you will need to go to a dark location. Can you see the milky way from your place?Also make sure to download the free  .TLDR Observe with hat you have first. Book Turn left at Orion. Do not spend more then  on accessories but rather choose ones that suit your telescope. Go to a dark location.

3843291,0,t3_34f19e,Dont buy it.  I owned one and hated it.  uschorhr already described the technical details of why its inferior to other scopes notably the BirdJones corrector and cheap spherical mirror.  Ill expand on them here just to make sure anybody else reading this understands completely just how bad this scope is.  If you have enough money to buy an AM and live in the US youre going to be MUCH better off buying one of these   its a cheap telescope that makes compromises in all the appropriate places and maintains quality in the places where it matters  optics and stability.The key takeaway about the AM is that its precisely the kind of telescope you end up with when you build something that is meant to look like a fancy high performance telescope but cut every single corner you can find to drive the price down low enough to make it look attractive to new often naiive buyers.OpticsThe . shortfocallength spherical mirror is about as cheap as they come.  Spherical mirrors are cheaper to manufacture but they dont focus light as accurately as a proper parabolic mirror.  But its still cheaper to include a corrector lens in the focuser than it is to grind a proper figure into the mirror.  The result is pretty good optical quality at a rockbottom price.  But the ultimate cost of this design is that you cant really properly collimate align it.  The corrector in the focuser prevents use any laserbased alignment tool and the focuser is too wobbly to use a cheshire.  On top of all that the primary mirror isnt centerspotted again to save money so even if you could use these tools theres no reference point for alignment.Another cost to this design is that the fast focal ratio of the primary necessitates a very large diameter secondary mirror.  This reduces contrast and limits the amount of light the primary is able to collect.industrial designThe benefit of that fast spherical mirror is that the telescope can be short.  Since its short it doesnt need to be very stiff as it wont flex much.  So its made out of cardboard and plastic.  Again cutting corners.  Nicer scopes will have steel or aluminum tubes with metal fittings.  Everything on the AM is plastic to save money.  Again it works pretty good but there are problems  the tube rings dont fit properly around the plastic trim so its impossible to properly balance it in declination.  The plastic secondary holder in order to be stiff enough has to be made with relatively thick plastic compared to a comparable metal holder.  Thus you get HUGE diffraction spikes in the image.  And finally the plastic focuser is weak and wobbly so the mere act of adjusting the focus means the image shifts in the eyepiece.MountThe equatorial mount the AM ships with looks fancy in pictures but like everything else about the telescope is a study in what happens when you cut every possible corner to get the price down.The tripod is frighteningly weak and wobbly made of some of the thinnest aluminum Ive ever seen.  All the hinges are plastic so even with some TLC you cant make the tripod particularly stiff.The mount head is made from cheap cast iron quality mounts are made from steel or aluminum.  There are no ball bearings  all the moving parts use plastic !! bushings.  The mount flexes with anything more than a couple pounds on it.The RA worm is actually not bad and with an optional motor drive it will behave just like you want tracking objects in the sky.  But the RA axis doesnt have anything with which to polar align not even a borehole to sight through.  So you basically have to guess that youre pointing it in the right direction.The declination axis is terrible.  Its literally a screw with handle on it that pushes on a paddle with a spring behind it.  There is no wormspur gear system you only get  about  degrees of declination fine control.  And its not particularly fine  the screw that moves the declination paddle isnt properly sanded so as you turn the screw the image shakes and wobbles all over the place.Both axes have clutches but theyre just unsanded! thumb screws that dig into the soft cast iron.  With even a modest amount of weight the clutches slip forcing you to severely overtighten the clutches just to keep the thing stable.,telescopes,cqudali,5,t5_2qnl1

You mentioned you can spend a maximum of  and if you have a really sturdy camera mount and want something neat for planets consider buying the Skywatcher Skymax   or wait for a used one  The  Mak is an awesome short planet telescope.You can easily magnify over x during a good night.While the field of view is small compared to the Heritage only a bit over a degree unless you buy a T adapter it performs much much better then all the mentioned when it comes to planets still fits in a backpack and shows some details in DSO if they fit into the field of view. No comparison to the little mm Mak... Maks usually never need collimation. But they are quite pricey compared to other telescopes a  will cost as much as a  dobsonian  Cooldowntime can be a bit of an issue and the mentioned small field of view. Obstruction is relaitvely high but it has no mirror holder bars gt no spikes.For DSO imaging one of the shortersmaller PDS newtons is probably a better idea.

With the bulk eyepieces  a barlow youre already looking at  on the low end  on the high end. Even if youre the manufacturer and have the economies of scale and can amoritize stuff packing labor any kind of finderscope and collimation tool and all that jazz costs money. Put in the costs of shipping and the retailers cut and I dont know how you can break even let alone make a profit. You could probably use a spherical mirror at F without too many problems. A return to sonotube basically cardboardplywood dobs would be cheaper and make the Dob lighter. Plus that stuff is better at damping vibration anyways. I think  is a good aperture size for a serious beginners scope so maybe you can build a F scope and save some on the mirror there. As far as library programs have you checked out the NHAS?

For serious deep sky photography consider buying making every photon count before investing any money and while youre at it  turn left at orion.

Also you can use a cellphone or tablet app. To prevent it to ruin your night vision you can get a deep red plastic sheet from stage lighting or anaglpyh stores for  thatll dim it down and prevents stray white light.I do not know what ICS would charge for a Telrad or Rigel finder. The rightangle upgrade and the reddotfinder is optional and without additional cost. The red dot finder is similar to this one so not as simple as the cheap red dot finders but not as fancy as the Telrad See A rightangle x optical finder is a better choice if the constellations are not visible due to light pollution as it will show more stars. But it also adds to the confusion. If you see a lot of stars you can get lost easily as beginner. The telrad proves to make things simpler    occasionally. ,telescopes,cswf1te,1,t5_2qnl1

For planets you will need a higher magnification eyepiece which can cost cad or so or a cad Barlow that doublestriples magnification is another option but lowers the contrast and its not ideal with the cheap kit eyepiece!..Anyway enough about the az. Normally I would recommend the Heritage p or better xt which will show more and lasts a lifetime Call for availability before ordering there but its over budget and you insist on buying at Costco. IMHO the sticky has a few outdated suggestions and there are other brands amp prices in Canada.Dont forget something like Turn left at Orion and a dim red light its crucial to use a telescope. Compared to an App it  preserves night vision better and does not only show you where to find objects but how to observe whats worthwhile observing and what to expect. Also binoculars. E.g. Cometron x  not highend but decent budget. Their wide field of view makes orientation easier and go together well worth a first telescope.Sorry for the lengthy reply TLDR The az is probably one of the better sets they have in the price range but I would suggest something else Heritage p  dobsonian or at least CelestronMeade eq as they specify the mirror.Where are you from?

6061942,0,t3_3yjy16,Hello The SkyWatcher  for  would be the best bang for the buck regarding aperturesize as it shows the most for your money Link to comparisonsIf thats too much there is the   version. Note that the accessories are very basic. The Zhumell z has a lot of accessories already included but costs a bit more....Imaging is more difficult than most think. You ideally need a precision equatorial tracking mount which can cost more than the telescope. Even cheaper tracking mounts such as the Nexstar SLT or at least Skywatcher Virtuoso would break your budget with accesories and are not exactly great for imaging other than a few snapshots. And most money goes into their plasticy mounts not the aperture thus limiting what you can see.If you dont mind the manual tracking and are patient enough a manual telescope can be used for moon images and  planetary snapshots. Some manage to take quite impressive images see  Especially when beginning and when just holding a cellphone camera to the eyepiece expect this though  For galaxies amp nebulae you will need an equatorial tracking mount. See    But if you already have a DSLR you dont even need a telescope!   If you really just want to take a few snapshots that can be done with almost any telescope even when using a compact camera or tablet camera. There are several  camera holders available Sample   Cheap tablet  telescope moon double star  iPhone on a computerized telescope  Saturn.Else there is no imaging telescope for under  that is reccomendable. The Celestron Astromaster EQ MD Motor drive is not the most sturdy thus tracking and focusing is tedious even without camera attached and the Skywatcher Virtuoso mm shows less as its smaller and the mount cant handle heavy cameras either. Visually    will be amazing but limited regarding imaging..What camera do you have? How important is imaging to you VS seeing as much as you can with your own eyes?,telescopes,cye7q44,1,t5_2qnl1

6121859,0,t1_cylgm96,Glad I could help Just one thing I forgot What to expect visually and a bit about lightpollution  gt collimation isnt required immediately out of the boxIts usually not but of course its important. You can even do it without a tool e.g. defocus a star and see if everything is centered or just by looking through the focuser tube and eyeballing itgt eyepieceObserve with what you have but especially for planets youll probably want more magnification right away  The gold line are a good compromise. Not perfect but cheap and overall good performers.gt FiltersLight pollution filters have limited effect. Getting to a darker location is the best filter Nebula filter only work with certain types. IMHO at first dont bother. Get one if you really need one for your targets especially as cheaper ones often arent too great.Color filters can enhance contrast on planets but are not required. Also rather get a single one than any of those eyepieceampfilter sets. They may seem like a bargain but they are not.Planets are also not affected by light pollution..gt BarlowA dedicated eyepiece will perform better than combining a cheap eyepiece and an achromatic barlow. There are great apochromatic barlows but they cost a bit more an usually its wise to get a few decent eyepieces at first as the mm isnt all that great.If you do want a great tool for Planets consider the Astro Zoom. Other than widerange zooms the zoom range is rather small but the apparent field of view does not change.You can also get the zoom adapter without eyepiece for  and combine it with the  gold line. The way this works is that modern eyepieces have a barlowlike element built in to achieve a decent eye relief and large field lens. Changing the distance to the lens in the bottom barrel changes the effective magnification. I have an older AstroZoom and its a nice tool. It will allow you to switch to the highest possible magnification depending on the target and observingseeing conditions without having to use three or four eyepieces that you will rarely use anyway.Clear skies!

Also see thisSo while the aperture is slightly smaller the long . has some benefits regarding contrast e.g. when observing planets.Still the difference between . and  is  regarding the surface area thus gathering more light Aperture is key especially for deepsky observations.The AWB is much more compact Its short focal lenght results in a larger field of view at low magnification making it a bit easier to get oriented for beginners.

Size does not really matter but  diagonal will allow you to use  eyepieces for better field of view on the wide end.  diagonal is usually preferred for terrestrial over  because of more comfortable angle but is less suitable for astronomical purposes FWIW youll get  mirror diagonal with the OTA so that one can be used for astronomy should you decide to.

8768781,0,t1_d71q8hh,Ah yes I think thats what the ED means. Skywatcher EQ that you mentioned should be an excellent mount and allow for room to grow a bit in the future should you decide to get a heavier longer focal length scope.That lens should work fine maybe even excellent. One of the main problems with deep sky imaging with a DSLR lens as opposed to a telescope is going to be focusing. The manual focus throw on that lens is very short. Maybe  degrees or so. Thats so it can autofocus quickly to get the shot which is nice but makes it difficult to be precise to get the critical focus for deep sky imaging. A dedicated astrograph telescope will have much more precise control over focus. You can make it work though and for the cost of that lens Id say its ideal for starting out. Put the extra money into a better mount.,telescopes,d71rfkd,1,t5_2qnl1

Do you think it is worth it for a starter?No. Its price for a scope in ideal shape is  tops  more realistically. The telescope is old. Like  years old Celestron Super C was first introduced in . So keep that in mind. Usually the telescopes age very well but  years would have definitely taken their toll on the mirror coatings if the telescope was not stored at perfect conditions which rarely happens.gt What kind of photography would be possible with it?Planets Moon maybe some brightest DSOs. Do not expect anything requiring more precise from this telescope and mount. If anything this whole telescope class SCT is not particularly good at DSO imaging because of its slow Fratio. Sure you could defork it and mount it on a proper equatorial mount but thatd cost you most likely more than a new simple rig since youd need a more powerful mount than say for ED and youd still be stuck with an F scope having all the problems associated with SCT class narrow TFoV high field curvature.,telescopes,d9fu667,1,t5_2qnl1

For this reason I have selected thethree stars in Orions Belt and the six in his Sword which havebeen long well known groups and I have added eighty other starsrecently discovered in their vicinity and I have preserved as exactlyas possible the intervals between them. The well known or oldstars for the sake of distinction I have depicted of larger size andI have outlined them with a double line the others invisible tothe naked eye I have marked smaller and with one line only. Ihave also preserved the differences of magnitude as much as Icould. As a second example I have depicted the six stars of theconstellation Taurus called the PLEIADES J say six intentionallysince the seventh is scarcely ever visible a group of stars whichis enclosed in the heavens within very narrow precincts. Nearthese there lie more than forty others invisible to the naked eyeno one of which is much more than half a degree off any of theaforesaid six of these I have noticed only thirtysix in my diagram.I have preserved their intervals magnitudes and the distinctionbetween the old and the new stars just as in the case ofthe constellation Orion. ,telescopes,db1wf0c,4,t5_2qnl1

11703925,0,t3_66zvbp,There are two common dovetail types vixen and losmandy.  I do believe the AVX uses a vixen mount.  I have a CG which the AVX replaced and that is a vixen mount. Where are you located?  If youre in the US then Id recommend ScopeStuff.com for rings.  They have dovetails as well.  You probably wont find rings with the exact diameter but you can add some felt or other padding to essentially shim it in place.  And yes  is about right.  My  SCT has an outer diameter of mm so Id expect it to be about the same for a Newtonian.The AVX SHOULD be able to handle the OTA if youre using it for visual work.  If you intend to use it for photography youre probably going to be pushing it.  If you get the balance just right and theres little or no breeze you might be able to do some  second subs without guiding but thats about as far as Id expect.  Still good OTA and good mount so it should be a decent combination.,telescopes,dgmnq8v,1,t5_2qnl1
11799997,0,t3_68cut7,I have a  inch Maksutov. Id like to have a  inch Maksutov. They fit my needs for portability. But not Goto. I can set up my current telescope in  minutes Goto requires careful aligning and telling the computer where the sky is.And Im a bit of a Luddite. I dont trust advanced machinery. I got a Computer Science degree back in the dark ages of the s and was raised on horror stories of stupid machines taking everything way too literally. And the computer systems they stick in Goto scopes are like that.,telescopes,dgxkjn2,2,t5_2qnl1
