Soon after the family poses in a similar tableau but for a happier occasion  Eileens wedding. While relatives sing at her reception Eileen hysterically grieves for her dad and recalls happy times of her youth. Tony and Maisies memories however are more troubled.

Which way does sanity lie?Critical receptiongt Im a Cyborg But Thats OK received generally positive reviews. As of April  it currently holds a  fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Tarun Shanker writer for Asian Cinema Drifter gave the film a B. He characterized the movie as part One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest part Amelie and praised it for pure cinematic exuberance quirky humor and exceedingly likeable characters. Tarun hypothesized that Cyborgs relatively poor box office performance was due to its genrebusting The film has a slower pace than the directors previous works and it strikes a strange hybrid tone where it is far too cute to be like his dark revenge flicks but its a bit too dark and odd to be a cute romantic date film. Some viewers may simply find that too jarring a blend. In fact Chris Tilly of IGN condemned it for this exact reason Scenes veer violently from comedy to violence to tragedy amusing and dumfounding in equally sic measure.... The result is a confusing mess of a movie that lacks the marvellously sharp structure and cohesion of his previous efforts.

2089112,0,t3_2itng5,    SCIENCE FICTION    Brad Dourif Ely Pouget William Hootkins    Chaank Armaments is experimenting with the ultimate fighting machine which is part human  part machine.    Really great hidden gem. William Hootkins Porkins  Star Wars has a good role. Many characters have names referencing SciFi directors two even bear the name of the company Weyland Yutani from Alien .    From IMDb  Death Machine is a film which really surprised me. I was expecting a gorefest with weak plot and even weaker acting. That was until I found out it had Brad Dourif starring in it who is in my opinion one of the best actors ever. The film itself is not overly gory but is instead remarkably discomforting and surprisingly funny and thoughtful. It takes quite a while for any real action to start the beginning instead being used for interesting plot and character development sequences.    The film remains constantly engaging has strong actors all round and is directed very well. A great script with quite a lot of comedy moments sets this film apart from other lowbudget scifi horror movies. Great fun.,fullmoviesonyoutube,cl5deux,2,t5_2vlad

On Rotten Tomatoes the film had a score of  based on  reviews with a consensus of Rush Hour  is a tired rehash of earlier films and a change of scenery cant hide a lack of new ideas. Todd Gilchrist of IGN movies said A movie that not only depends on but demands you dont think in order to enjoy it. Christian Toto of The Washington Times said The Rush job should put the franchise down for good. Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail said Infecting this third movie is an extra deeply unpleasant level of racism that we havent seen before in the series. Roger Ebert of the Chicago SunTimes was slightly more positive giving the film two stars and saying ...once you realize its only going to be so good you settle back and enjoy that modest degree of goodness which is at least not badness and besides if youre watching Rush Hour  you obviously didnt have anything better to do anyway.

3285826,0,t1_cp2ok3n,While I enjoyed Birdman a lot disliked the ambiguity of the endingspoiler though I agree that it could be deemed optimized for getting Oscars. They are mostly about the making of movies and hence acting directing ... anyway they are not the movie quality indicator from the perspective of the audience.What I enjoyed the most about Birdman was Michael Keatons exchange with Edward Norton near the beginning. That was great acting on many levels right there. I pity those who arent Englishenabled because they are missing out a lot. I live in Germany all movies that come here have dubbed audio hence I watch none of them and not only does that paint a coat of goo over the original acting the voice acting of the dubbing actors is too often atrocious. I am sure that if I would regularly watch those movies instead of watching originals I would not even be able to tell because my brain would be artificially retarded.In the Netherlands Our neighbor to the north west. movies keep their original sound but are subtitled in dutch.

They want to see something of the country and to meet everyday Indians but are frustrated by the British communitys insistence that relations with the locals are best experienced from a distance. Finally a friend introduces them to a Muslim doctor whom Mrs. Moore had seen briefly on her visit to a mosque. He takes them on an outing to the nearby caverns a local attraction but what happens there threatens to destroy any civility between the British and Indian societies.IMDbCritical receptiongt Leans final film became a critics favourite in  opening to tremendous praise worldwide. Vincent Canby of the New York Times called Leans film his best work since The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia and perhaps his most humane and moving film since Brief Encounter. Though vast in physical scale and set against a tumultuous Indian background it is also intimate funny and moving in the manner of a film maker completely in control of his material . . . Though Lean has made A Passage to India both less mysterious and more cryptic than the book the film remains a wonderfully provocative tale full of vivid characters all played to near perfection.WikipediaAwards  Academy Award for Best Actress nominated Best Actress in a Supporting Role Best Cinematography nominated Best Costume Design nominated Best Director nominated Best Film Editing nominated Best Original Music Score Best Picture nominated Best Production Design nominated Best Sound Mixing nominated Best Writing Adapted Screenplay nominated  Golden Globe Award for Best Director  Motion Picture nominated Best Foreign Language Film Best Original Score Best Screenplay  Motion Picture nominated Best Supporting Actress  Motion Picture  BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role nominated Best Actor in a Supporting Role nominated Best Actress in a Leading Role Best Cinematography nominated Best Costume Design nominated Best Film nominated Best Film Music nominated Best Production Design nominated Best Screenplay Adapted nominated Another  wins and  nominationsMore info at IMDb Freebase Wikipedia Rotten Tomatoeswww.rottentomatoes.commpassagetoindia Netflix  I am a bot.

The consensus on Rotten Tomatoes is Despite its stylized and impressive sets this horrormonster movie mishmash suffers from endless cliches and wildly implausible plotlines. The main complaint was the lack of character building and overly familiar cliches with Neil Smith of BBC Online calling it a generic duffer that is as exciting as a hole in the ground. Robert Koehler made the same obervation in Variety writing The Cave feels familiar as it goes through the rote edicts of the scientific crew vs. beastie formula. In her review for the New York Times Laura Kern praised the films sets and visual style but denounced the script writing Having worked as second and thirdunit director on the Matrix trilogy and Dark City Bruce Hunt is no stranger to inspired and stylish productions. But whereas those films managed to inject new life into tired territory The Cave his first effort as director fails to generate anything resembling innovation. Judy Chia Hui Hsu wrote in in The Seattle Times the serenity of the largely aquatic underground world framed by majestic stalagmites and serpentine corridors succeeds in capturing the moviegoers attention but added The insipid dialog lacks even a hint of comic relief so the audience is grateful when the action quickly kicks into gear and one of the films biggest letdowns is that the vicious beast seen in the full light of the final scenes is not such a surprise after all. The creature is simply an amalgamation of monsters weve seen before. Tim Grierson gave the film a mildly positive review in The L.A.

4433944,0,t1_cspg9v2,Honestly I have my doubts about that  the only real difference between Graces edit and the ones done by other fan editors is that Grace edited his version on an Avid which is the same editing hardware used by professionals. But while an Avid is excellent equipment Grace didnt have access to any extra footage or anything  he was editing from the same DVDs anybody else would use. An Avid is great for actual editing cobbling together a film from multiple takes etc. but when all the editor has to work with is the final version of the film theres no real difference between an Avid and a copy of Sony Vegas or Adobe Premiere.So while Grace may have made a very good edit odds are pretty strong that its not much better if at all than any number of other wellmade edits of the prequels.   ,fullmoviesonyoutube,cspl408,2,t5_2vlad

According to Mary G. Hurd the film is loaded with sight gags one liners numerous sexual jokes and puns. But many critics found it to be a comedy which relies on sophomoric humor. According to Gwendolyn Audrey Foster the film is both a rather clever gangster comedy and both a clever homage to s gangster films. But perhaps too clever for a mainstream audience. According to Leigh Hallisey the film is a parody of oldschool gangster movies and reveals Heckerlings awareness of their conventions and stereotypes. Foster finds the comedies of Amy Heckerling to be relying on fastpaced witty repartee and droll humor. She finds Heckerlings sense of comedy similar to those of Frank Tashlin and Jerry Lewis.WikipediaMore info at IMDb Wikipedia Rotten Tomatoes Netflix Freebase  I am a bot.

Even though it seems most if not all of the speakers on this are xxxx of the family xxxx thats NOT the angle I am coming from. Ive witnessed too much abuse of state power neglect of duty ultra vires actions and downright disrespect by the police already  I posted this as a citizen of the uk in order to rebalance the scales.The first speaker John Harris once said something like Ive nothing against the police I just want them to do their job PROPERLY. Plus one quotation from  of this film states The police are an integral and necessary part of modern day life. They put their lives at risk on a daily basis and the majority would protect us from harm without a moments thought. For that we respect them. The intent of this documentary is not to belittle the police but to make sure that when they deal with noncriminal matters they conduct themselves properly. As this will probably be the only interaction most of us will ever have with them. I hope you see my angle better now and maybe even enjoy this.

6424359,0,t3_43dltt,Ah yes Funky Forest.  When I first moved to Toronto back in the mid s I went to the After Dark Film Festival the horrorscifi alternative to TIFF and caught this movie because the trailer looked pretty out there.  Since the movie was keen on being weird I decided to get equally weird by way of a jazz cigarette before the start of the film.    Funky Forest is kind of more of a sketch comedy special that has a loose story arc that keeps everything together think Mr. Show style.  Now this movie is pretty weird but its also Japanese which makes it double weird.  I know youve all seen those bizarre Japanese TV shows?  Well the movie here is like one of those combined with SNL combined with a Cronenberg flick.  The film is often classified as a comedy but many people in the west will just end up being confused frustrated or outright angry when attempting to view it.  Everyone else will find themselves pleasantly surprised and probably pretty baked.  You should be able to figure out which camp you belong in within about  minutes so if youre not into it by then just turn the movie off.    Its hard to discuss Funky Forests plot... Its kind of about Aliens and... also alien... interaction.  Unlike a lot of movies about aliens where the world is really excited Funky Forests characters are kind of more ambivalent maybe even bored of the alien creatures possibly because each group of characters has more pressing matters to attend to.  First theres the story of a young woman and her English teacher although theyve been getting closer and closer from hanging around one another outside of class they havent yet made the leap to a romantic relationship.  Theres the story of a homeroom class which is run by that one guy from the Yakuza movie Brother and all the bizarre shit they get into.  Theres also the story of Guitar Brother a long haired creative type his older more creative brother and their third younger shorter fatter and whiter brother who inexplicably is part of the crew.  The movie cycles through the storylines as it goes on but if youre looking for resolutions youre in the wrong place brother.  This movie is just fucked up for fucked ups sake.    Funky Forest doesnt really have anything unique in regards to cinematography lighting or anything else.  Where the film exceeds is in creating a bizarre world of surrealistic daytoday encounters with a dash of aliens on the side which it manages to do surprisingly competently.  It also manages to have some pretty good acting.  Yeah the actors arent doing any elaborate or moving performances here but each actor plays their character well and you feel them growing on you as you find your personal favorites.    TLDR    Funky Forest is not for everyone.  Part sketch comedy part critique of Japanese entertainment part movie and part Bmovie scifi the combination is sure to throw some people off.  I personally enjoyed the film but I can see how many people wouldnt get it and for you I say dont bother trying.  For everyone else this movie is worth watching with some odd friends on a night when you just wanna watch this weird Japanese film I heard about.,fullmoviesonyoutube,czjtdg1,3,t5_2vlad

6823641,0,t3_497l1h,It Might Get Loud is a documentary that puts together three of the most famous guitarists of their respective eras and gets them to have a jam session.  From the late s and early s youve got Led Zeppelin virtuoso Jimmy Page.  From the mids to mids youve got Us The Edge.  And from the s youve got Jack White of White Stripes and The Raconteurs fame.    The movie goes through this list more or less in order of appearance starting with Page moving to Edge following up with White and then wrapping it all up at an event known as The Summit where the musicians will have a chance to talk play music and sesh out for a bit.    Apart from describing the varying guitar styles and influences that makes each member unique youll also accompany them to locations that serve as important spots to practice in Page in a famous recording house The Edge on ... a cliff edge and White in a run down suburban Detroit house.    The documentary offers some fascinating insight through a fairly diverse group of rock guitarists allowing them to discuss their craft and really bare their personalities in front of the camera.  It might get loud not only offers the history behind each musician but also their philosophies behind their sound and wraps it all up in a pretty decent package.    TLDR    This documentary kind of reminds me of the Metallica documentary Some Kind of Monster.  Its pretty revealing and puts three musicians under a relatively thick magnifying glass and will either leave you respecting them or confused as to why some of them are famous in the first place.  I personally enjoyed the Page and White sections but seeing The Edge literally plug his guitar into an amp at a cliff edge and play for the ocean was one of the corniest things I think Ive ever seen.  Still a good documentary and if youre at all involved in playing music this might even get a nudge up to an .  ,fullmoviesonyoutube,d0prbcj,4,t5_2vlad
