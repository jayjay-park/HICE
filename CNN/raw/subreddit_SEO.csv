Second this still doesnt sound like the right way to go. Social should play a large part in the strategy so too audience building. Its not about whether anyone wants to follow a mold inspection Company thats absolutely irrelevant its about whether they have a reason to follow you. When you write content what are you writing about? Mold? No disrespect intended but most people probably arent going to be interested  much in the same way when we blog for our company website EVERY day we dont just write about SEO we write about personal development business entrepreneurship startups etc. Its not about manufacturing backlinks  its about appealing to your audience on a human level. Once you do that youll get more followers for reasons other than what you do youll get more links too. Sound wishy washy? Think about it. Your blog neednt have anything to do with mold take the example of Simply Business theyve got a massive content marketing strategy going on  they sell many different forms of insurance but pretty much all they ever write about is small business marketing and for a few reasons  People are far more interested in reading about small business marketing than they are about insurance.  Their audience is FAR more likely to share marketing advice than they are to share top  tips on how to lower you insurance premium Theyve likely prepared content personas to get a feel for what their audience wants.  This type of content is more likely to get linked which means overall domain authority increases which helps fuel rankings for commercial queries. Ive written a lot more about this kind of approach in my free  words book on SEO here  Search is a lot more holistic nowadays targeting specific generic keywords fitting everything into a process building a set number of links per month...its all shorttermism and largely ineffective.

If all youre after is a quick analysis of the website to determine if theres any missed areas of improvement then use Moz Analytics. Pretty straight forward to use.Beyond that Id use something on an enterprise level maybe look at linkdex and see if that fulfils what you need.Im not concerned about how you got the contract but Im more concerned that you could do something potentially devastating based on an opinion on a bit of software. Changing something is going to have a rippled affect and you need to have the knowledge to back up changes. My guys here use a lot of enterprise level software to get a topdown view of a website from both an onsite and technical viewpoint. This then gives them the insight to better understand how websites are performing.We use a lot of search visibility software as well semrush searchmetrics etc. Great for finding lowhanging fruits with regards to keywords. Gives a good insight into where traffic is potentially coming from i.e you cant get keyword data from GA thats reliable so using this shows you where the website stands.Using the crawl data from screaming frog or Linkdex and corss reference these pages to build a list of where that page ranks and the changes that could be made,SEO,chcm0nf,2,t5_2qhbx

1128744,1,t3_271rw6,Hey there! I assume that you have at least done a good bit of research on Google about onsite SEO. This is obviously a good start however I imagine that your keyword is going to be pretty competitive with competing websites engaging in some serious SEO. Therefore you are going to need backlinks from quality highauthority relevant websites with the anchor text greentown lawyer.As an example Google search the phrase click here. You will see that most of the results on that page are not really relevent and dont even have the text click here on their webpage. The reason that these sites rank well for this keyword is the power of backlinks. Lots of people link to those sites with the anchor text click here.This answer is a very short and simple explanation.

1429961,0,t1_civifm1,Ah I wasnt sure which definition you were going with there. In webdev usually a static page would be one that was in html and loaded itself from a flat file. A dynamic page is generally going to be in php or some other lang connected to a database. Usually a static page loads by Apache loading the file and displaying it when requested. A dynamic page starts loading its first file then gets instructed to open the database go grab the fields it needs from the DB load them into the necessary variables and build the html file put of the php and database. The biggest operating difference between the  is that the dynamic file has more overhead but is easier to modify or show changing information on because the data display method is a database query. People used to argue all the time and I was one of them that the overhead of WordPress wasnt worth it and to use static landing pages however its less than a half second speed difference now. I still maintain that blog posts and content do help but you need to do your keyword research and make sure youre using html tags right and using proper SEO or youll never get traffic on them. ,SEO,civito9,1,t5_2qhbx

Real organic links require relationships and leveraging those relationships in a truly symbiotic way  otherwise Google sees right through it. eventually will screw you with an algorithm.It takes time for someone to learn your business well enough for someone to write content people actually want to read.  It takes just as much time if not more to actually write it format it find images or other media create internal links etc.  I wrote damn near k words today and got it formatted and pushed out there but thats In the course of a  hour day Not something I can do on a daily basis because theres a boatload more to this than just writing and publishing good content.A good SEO knows what theyre doing and knows how to leverage their time and knowledge in the ideal combination.

Will post with an update in a week or so.Also anecdotal but on another site I saw Google traffic drop by well over half after doing nothing but cleaning up HTML replacing a table based layout with DIVs. No content change of any kind pure HTML structure. I put the old HTML back and traffic would bounce back. Makes no sense at all from a logic point but something with the way Google ranked factors or parsed the site made a massive difference.

2163456,0,t3_2jo67i,Yes. Ask them to do an audit tell them the people you have on staff to implement it and then figure out a plan you can implement.One reason why this is rare is because what will often happen is that they make a ton of recommendations that you dont have the budget or staff to implement. This is a little annoying in the case where you spend a big chunk of cash to discover that you dont have enough money and expertise to fix your site properly. That doesnt work well for either you or for the firm doing it. Its not so much that theyre hooking you its more that professional SEO is an ongoing task much like running advertising. In the same way that your local big grocery store advertises every day of the week for decades on end and you pay your landlord every month achieving and maintaining search rank requires a continuous outlay. There are a few reasons for this Search is competitive. Your competitors are spending to beat you in the rankings. To maintain rank you have to at least compete with them equally in terms of the results that you get. Part of why youd hire a good firm is to detect inefficiencies in the strategies of your competitors to take advantage of. Your hired team would be competing with the inhouse or hired team of your competitors. Search is changing all the time and you need people who have paying attention to it for years and stay abreast of new developments to change the strategy as time goes on. Search looks for sites that have maintained Googles definition of quality search results over time as an indicator that affects rank in and of itself. It also often deprecates older links and older content on the site.Is it a racket? If it is lawyers manage their racket a whole lot better than SEOs do. Well its kind of a mix of marketing bizzarocyberlawyering to pay attention to changes in search policy web development and design. The cost tends to be high because the people who are big winners in search have the budget gained from their success in search to work their hardest to squish all the little competitors that want to eat their lunch. Its a nonviolent arms race.I dont think its exactly like those rentasite schemes. If youre concerned about that make sure you get detailed reports and documentation of what the people youre hiring are doing. That way if you cancel the contract you can bring it inhouse or hand it off to someone else. There are also site rescue packages like this that include hands on web development work. I can suggest a few options if you PM me about it. That will be a oneoff deal where they find problems on the site fix it themselves explain what they did give you suggestions and then scoot. Sometimes that sort of arrangement can create a lot of value if many things are currently not as good as they should be. ,SEO,cletpij,1,t5_2qhbx

Not even close.... This isnt about coding or just technical SEO. Its about all of the SEO features and capabilities of CMS platforms  about enabling best SEO practices for admins and automated SEO performance of the system. Go SEO a Wordpress site and then go try to SEO an OpenCart site or a SaaS system like Volusion ew. Then tell me which was easier faster and better in the end.             We arent knit picking which SEO practices matter and which dont this is about systems. But on that point in competitive markets it all matters and  makes a very big difference  as in many  or many jobs sort of differences.

In these modern times where Google is actively trying to understand text and context in a semantic search effort  you will need to deliever real quality content. When writing an article for your website first things to think about are Do my reader have a problem? Can I help them solve that problem ? Can I answer their questions? By building up articles in a way that a real living human would like to read it  and actually share it with their social network  you will please Google and the other search engines. Google measures on several hundred parameters and can follow us as users across many platforms and websites therefore they properly know more about you and me than we do! Google will like to serve the user with the result that matches their intent so if they are searching for a cheap online backup service Google will list the  best and cheapest backup service providers. If you search Samsung TV well Google will look at your search history and think Do you just want information about Samsung TVs or do you want to buy one? this will alter the results and personalize them. So buttom line Think intent and only one intent per page. Then you will soon rank high in the search engines and oh about  words is the magic number for a  minutes time on site and high number of shares  ,SEO,crawa0g,2,t5_2qhbx

The Dos and Donts are good and provide some value. Design . The content was good i was reading it but before I came to the last Dos and Donts i was pretty bored because the infographic contained only text and no images. . The color selection was not good. White text on yellow background was not at all looking good. . There wasnt enough white space. The infographic was filled with text. . No images were used. With imagesvector graphics you can make your infographic much more appealing to the readers.. The Dos ended at  but the Donts were upto . You should not do this. Moreover the blank area after  in Dos part was unattractive. That is why experts say that awesome content is always ignored. Its because of bad UX design etc. I didnt read the whole infographic just because of bad design. So this way you can get an idea how people will react to your content. I am also a blogger and a graphic designer. I have recently published a guide on creating infographics. If you want I can send it to you in your inbox. Apart from that you can get an idea of good infographics by Quicksprouts infographic. They are amazingly designed. And last thing if you use Adobe illustrator then you can get some free vectors from freepik.com and use it for your infographic.

4968621,0,t3_3iw9gl,Just going to chime in here.As an SEO consultant i think these things are the most vital basics that you should spend time perfecting and learning or pay for On page optimization  headers anchor text selection interlinking image alt tags page speed Call to action copywriting Tactical SEO  Creating relationships with a network or group of authority figures or sites that are highly influential statistically or extremely popular with your ideal audience Automation  getting research for topics keywords content all done quickly and easily Content Creation  build up a resource of at least three writers and designers that can write great content design equally great quality imagery or videos for the content as fast as you need it.With these in place you simply need to create content check it to improve it further inform your group of influential bigwigs to help share discuss or promote it and you also just have to create additional buzz among your subscribers or intended target audience either with email marketing or social media advertising.I started learning marketing around  years ago to help out my familys brick and mortar beauty business. I discovered through trial and error  and tons of stupid spending and i really just stick to the above points in every project i do now.I am adept at email bulk sending  cold emails or targeted promotional campaigns i also write ebooks and website content for additional income on top of being great at this SEO fuckery. Dont get me wrongi know how bad and spammy the SEO industry is. But i shut out the negative noise and just do what works in SEO today and still obtain great results for myself and my clients.My advice is to ignore things like what google likes or if a tactic is whitegreyblack hat or if buying shit fiverr gigs etc will help you in any way to achieve your goals.Learn the above points or pay someone who is able to communicate with you and understand your industry  your goals for growth and treats your company like he or she has a major stake in it.As for pricing i see some debate in the comments about  or  etc etc. That is all irrelevant the only thing that matters is return on investment or ROI.Think for a second How much more do i want my earnings to increase by?If your answer is  then i ask is  a lot to pay to get started off on the right foot to get there?Good basic tactics like the above are largely ignored in this current phase of growth hacking or tricks or guerilla marketing and whatever fancy names people are coining together these days.Just remember SEO is all about increasing leads or direct sales. Thats all it is.I hope my response helps you or provides some value to you and others here. Good luck.,SEO,cuktyn2,3,t5_2qhbx

One thing I failed to mention is that you should think about future Practice Areas as well.  If you see yourself expanding into say defense family IP in the next ten years then floradainsurancelawyers.com will lock you into a practice area.  I see this all the time with Injury attorneys who bought ie FloridaInjuryLaw.com and want to add a new partner in defense or family and the practice doesnt work with their domain.The safest bet is to go with Difatolaw.com.  That way you dont have to worry about ethics changing practice areas etc.  I dont think there is a huge benefit to adding Florida in the domain.You could try to get floridalawyers.com floridaattorneys.com tampaattorneys.com tampalawyer.com as well and those are pretty long term bets with changing business structure but they will also come with a high price.I think there is some benefit in having keywords in the domain as pointed out earlier in that urls are used often in link anchor text.  I have also seen firms brand themselves as Florida Insurance Lawyer Group and stick with it and over time as Google understands that is your brand to allow you to rank easier for ie Florida Insurance LawyersIt really comes down to what you want to invest and the level of risk. ,SEO,cx858o5,2,t5_2qhbx

But its going to be harmful for SEO  youre creating your own duplicate content. Youd want to include canonical links on two of them that point to the main one and have that one be the one that ranks. Doesnt matter if theyre slightly different or exactly the same.Press release links are kinda hit or miss in my experience with SEO but better than nothing if done right. However I dont see why youd link elsewhere unless there was a reason for it. Like if youre saying Our company is partnering with X company then sure link to X company too. But linking to other properties is only going to raise the chance that people go there and not to you.

6698752,0,t3_47crwm,To be honest I dont think Google sees blogs as very different than your site. Content is content. Google simply wants index content and send the right searchers there.Landing pages vs articles really depends on your business. What are your goals and what types of links are you trying to attract.Ill give you an example I work in higher education and we sell services to college students a service they can easily do for FREE even some of the universities publish free help content that competes with our service. What we did was create the most detailed guide we could I mean it took months and a lot of money and included videos interviews. In the first year the guide attracted links and about  organic visits but no conversions. We missed the point of the guide. Last year we put part of the guide behind a registration but allowed the user to download the entire guide in a PDF instead of reading it on the site. We then create a followup email campaign to the email addresses that registered. We are not where we wanted to be but we are finally seeing residual sales.I know it was a long winded response but sometimes we forget that SEO is marketing and it takes some creativity and though instead of just focusing on keywords and optimizing titles and getting a link here and there.,SEO,d0c7j2x,3,t5_2qhbx

AMP doesnt mean adopt AMP and get a massive boost in search ranking. That is not the case. All of the other signals need to be satisfied as well. But without question speed matters. If we had two articles that from a signaling perspective scored the same in all other characteristics but for speed then yes we will give an emphasis to the one with speed because that is what users find compelling.

Try to include numbers lists rank well emotive language as well as placing the keyword at the beginning.  Youre Metadescription isnt appealing. More and more Google is ignoring Metadescriptions and just pulling relevant content from the page instead. Worth optimising nevertheless.Things you can do right now to improve your CTR Improve your rankings. For quick wins here add  words of great quality content to the page you want to rank. Make sure to include plenty of LSI keywords as well as many  authorative internal and external links. Update the publication date and check Visualistan.com for suitable infographics you can add to your content. Ive found that infographics increase the time on site by  seconds. Not bad considering you can get them for free and with little to no effort. Also check out Youtube for relevant video content you can embed at the bottom of the page. Also try using anchor links and FAQs to allow Google to understand the content of your page better. Improve your MetaDescriptions with UTF characters and Schema markup. This is literally the best and easiest but not necessarily cheapest way of improving your CTAs. UTF characters are a really quick win and draw the eye. Using Schema Markup can get you stars on your SERPS usually increasing CTRs by .
