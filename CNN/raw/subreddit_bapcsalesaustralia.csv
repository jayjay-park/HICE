2491741,0,t1_cmjt019,Thanks for your input. Its really appreciated. Yeah the site needs a bit of design work of course. But its fully functional and thats whats important to me design will improve over time naturally. I only have one supplier at the moment and those prices are near cost price. But of course Ill be looking into other in the near future.  ,bapcsalesaustralia,cmjt46q,1,t5_2tevl

4675207,0,t1_ctjqref,Im looking to get the MSI one as well. Well mainly i think Kogan takes weeks to ship coz Kogans main warehouse is located in HK. Maybe dependent on the item not really sure. Warranty can be another issue as well since it is not local stock. MSYs MSI  is supposed to be back in stock tomorrow according to their web.,bapcsalesaustralia,ctjuz40,2,t5_2tevl
