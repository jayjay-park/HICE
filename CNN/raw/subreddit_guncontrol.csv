793136,1,t3_237svb,Im sure Mexico would love it if the US incorporated the same laws.   Then they wouldnt have to deal with the massive amount of assault weapons being imported into areas controlled by the cartels.  Dont even bother bringing up Fast and the Furious chances are you know nothing about it and it represents . of the assault weapons being trafficked across the border.  ,guncontrol,cgufluc,-1,t5_2rdus

However the argument youve mentioned is a single case argument a philosophical straw man of sorts. Sure maybe for these cases it wouldnt matter and those it would all Im saying is for those that it would matter for its somewhere to start. Again not a cureall. ,guncontrol,cih3hsh,1,t5_2rdus

5014164,0,t1_cuqbytj,You dont have to kill someone in order to defend yourself just stop them from being able to attack you or get them to flee.A short barrel shotgun is only for defense as with birdshot you are no longer able to take any game reliably or humanely. Any gun can kill but so can any knife and I have a good feeling not one of my kitchen knives are made for stabbing let alone killing. I have built a heavy barreled ar designed purely for target shooting its to heavy to hunt with and being scoped it is impractical in home defense.Just because it can kill doesnt mean that is what it was made for.,guncontrol,cuqe9vs,1,t5_2rdus

7920102,0,t1_d469hzx,gtThis is a great question.I happen to live in the UK which has great gun control laws IMO. It has been six years since we had a mass shooting here and they are incredibly infrequent events.Part of the law states that a person must give a valid reason for owning a firearm. Being a member of a shooting club is a common one.Was this guy a member of such a club? Did he have a valid reason for owning a gun? I guess being a security guard in the states is considered a valid reason? Here in the UK very few criminals use guns so this would not be considered a valid reason in our culture.Anyway lets assume he was a member of a gun club and could therefore legally own a firearm. Here in the UK there is no concealed carry. You have to carry your gun in a specific way depending on the firearm. I think full details are available on the home office website. If you search this document for the word transport youll get some idea of the regulations.This rule alone would have prevented the massacre.Lets assume that he just violated this rule and took the gun to the nightclub anyway.Yes  he could have killed a great many people just as he did in the states but would he have done it in the first place?Dude the nightclub has like three layers of security to prevent this exact scenario from happening. Ive been there. Do you really honestly notajoke that if the law said you cannot conceal it that wouldve made a difference? The nightclub itself has stringent no firearm policy much less a concealed firearm. It enforces those rules. A concealed permit is illegaluseless anyhow if the business sells liquor and says no guns. I really dont get this point at all. He broke just as many firearm ordinances and rules by bringing the gun concealed even with a permit as you would without it. A concealed permit isnt a Wild West fuck the haters monopoly card. if someone at any point detected it he wouldve been boned big time.,guncontrol,d46alo4,1,t5_2rdus

9335313,0,t1_d8xapqb,Yep. It is beyond obvious the well regulated militia in A is the militia as defined by congress under the powers that were literally JUST granted to it under the Constitution. The notion that the A restriction clause could possibly refer to any other militia definition is bizarre. The notion that the very regulators of the militia congress would allow for the militia their own militia! to then overthrow said regulators themselves! is equally bizarre. As is the notion that the Framers would specifically enumerate Congress can call forth the militia to suppress insurrections but would then fail to enumerate something as important as violently rebelling against Congress and any conditions that might justify such treason?? To say nothing of the fact that not one rebellion in the history of the world before the U.S. or since had any such protection as a A or for that matter even needed or wanted one. In the history of the world what rebellion ever required a permission slip from the very authority it was rebelling against? And what rebellion of note ever failed to find arms willingly supplied by others having a shared interest in the potential overthrow? Were talking about REBELS here. So you know... badges! We don need no steenking Badges! uproarious laughter. And wouldnt something as monumental as the complete destruction by violence of everything the Founders created... wouldnt it appear in the main body of the Constitution instead of being relegated to the punch list Bill of Rights and wouldnt these brilliant men enumerate conditions that might justify such a thing?? It is in these absurdities that the socalled political philosophy of gun culture is demonstrated to be well short of even half baked.This less than half baked political philosophy is also profoundly dismissive of the real methods the Founders intended to keep government in check Separation of powers checks and balances the ballot box petition and redress separation of church and state due process civilian military control etc etc. Its also worth noting the Founders were gun grabbers. The Founders banned arms to nonassociators. Colonists that refused to sign the oath of loyalty to the revolution were denied arms without regard for their defenselessness against natives wildlife or criminals.,guncontrol,d8zbi0q,6,t5_2rdus
