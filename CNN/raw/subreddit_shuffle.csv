3873268,0,t3_2yi9dy,I have been shuffling for years feel free to send a msg any time for some specific help! I love that there are still people interested in learning.If it interests you and you have not already I suggest looking up Malay style and trying it out! It is a good style to learn with at lower BPM due to the focus on basic movements and looks legendary once you can do it faster. ,shuffle,cqxsaki,1,t5_2slk5

8576133,0,t1_d6526dr,This is incorrect. All of the best shufflers heavily incorporate upper body styles into their dancing. Its less of a combination dance and more of a shuffle with xinfluence. For instance cykomelody seems to have a lot of tecktonik influence in his shuffling whereas Zannimask clearly shows background in tutting and liquid through his shuffle. Some shufflers even have discoesque hand movements  and almost all shape cutters have active upper bodies. Just experiment with different styles that interest you while you move your feet its not hard. ,shuffle,d6dlll2,1,t5_2slk5

8882416,0,t3_51vc8h,Unless youre a shape cutter LED shoes are going to break almost immediately because the circuits are in the heel of the shoe for every manufactured brand. You can always make your own LED shoes and put the circuitry up somewhere high on the shoe like under the laces or behind the tongue but this will still interfere with things like toemoonwalking and pindrops. I would reccomend just getting some LED laces and LED fluffies. Fluffies with flash patterns look way cooler than LED shoes when you shuffle anyway. ,shuffle,d7fjh4e,1,t5_2slk5
