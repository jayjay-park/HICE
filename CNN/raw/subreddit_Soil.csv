2759909,0,t3_2ro72v,Of course they do. Maybe even more than x the erosion if you look at commercial mining and artisanal mining. A few years ago I was very outraged to have a firefighter move in to a forested area near me then tear every single tree out on his  acre plot! There are plenty of lands around here that already have no trees or bushes at all. Why couldnt he just buy a plot there????  WTF! ,Soil,cnhshfw,1,t5_2rzci
2898807,0,t1_cnw7tyn,ha! free my ass! clearly you havent paid to water a field or seen the prices of farmland in the past decade!  ...shit certainly isnt free! ....but its definitely a helluva lot cheaper than putting it under hoop houses even let alone plastic or glass structures made out of concrete amp steel.I by no means think that large monoculture crops can or would ever be replaced with indoor growing.. ...nor do I even remotely see where a need for them to does.  but when you get into highervalue crops like tomatoes peppers etc the costdynamics change. Field crops can be stored for much longer periods of time and dont necessitate a quicktriptomarket like fruits amp veggies such as strawberries cucumbers etc....and its in these croptypes that indoor farming makes a bit more sense. ...and is done constantly insert cheeseburger argument here. Corn may make  bushels per acre such as Iowa did in  but bringing in  an acre because I have a calculator is a far cry than the k per acre per year for indoor tomato farming that Ive met plenty of farmers claim to achieve.I think that when you get to orchard environments indoor just doesnt make sense ... vs growing in the environment the trees naturally grow in. ... there are a few exceptions but for the most part its not only not economical but theres simply no reason to.Id imagine that costs can amp will continue to come down for indoor environments or go up depending on how high tech a business wants to make their operations and technologies may be right around the corner that drop the costs even farther... ...but just as those technologies round said corner so will other technologies that will make outdoor growing both cheaper easier ... and more sustainable. My approach hasnt ever been to push for indoor growing over outdoor but rather to increase the methods used in any approach in such that it not only promotes the growers bottom dollar but also the environment as well.  ...and those two very often go handinhand surprisingly.A dime a dozen for the number of products out there that are unfortunately not an actual dime a dozen in cost claiming to be the next greatest thing... but they usually cost an arm amp a leg.... and dont do as much as they advertise ... or at least ot enough to justify their cost.In the end it takes one helluva lot of hard work to create an environment that is conducive to profits. ...and a helluva lot of that hard work is ensuring that they can do it again the next year. Im not a permaculturalist rarely post there and think that its more hype at this point... but there do seem to be a lot of principals in it thatre worth incorporating where possible to help growers improve the environments in which they grow.Soil health is a major concern as the article states... and it will become even moreso of one if ignorance is continued to be spread over fields.. burning out the nutrient amp water retaining S.O.C. ... which also means streams creeks rivers lakes become polluted and surrounding wildlife and forest environments suffer. I see it time amp time again where the outlying areas are destroyed or ridiculouslyheavily altered by some farmer going overboard on a hot dry day trying to desperately save their crops... ...costing themselves a bundle doing little and wreaking havoc.   Swales water redirection ... even simple things like plowing on contour can go an incredibly long way towards both increasing yield and limiting inputs work money fertilizers pesticides etc.  ...while at the same time helping to keep the soil healthy rich and diverse of life.Indoor farming is just a different beast altogether. ...but Ive seen plenty of huge greenhouses with tractorsized doors and farmers driving their John Deer down rows... but hobby farmers usually... ...or with good primary jobs that help them ebb the flow of the learning curve of their millions in investment. Do they produce great crops? absolutely do the ends justify the means? no not usually... though theyd never tell you that.. ..what they do tell you is that theyre having a lot of fun! and learning a great deal in the process ... ...its their money who am I to tell them how to spend it?,Soil,cnxllmj,2,t5_2rzci

3463090,0,t1_cpmtgbp,No the soil knife is a Hori Hori made by a Japanese company called Nisaku. Im not so fine a craftsman unfortunately. It really is the best tool for soils work though.Were looking to quantify soil carbon and soil nutrients including nitrogen phosphorus and exchangeable cations and to see how soil mineralogical and hydrological characteristics impact residence time and aboveground productivity. At a series of other sites weve already found that  of soil carbon  of soil nitrogen and between  of exchangeable cations are found below  m in soil.One of the most interesting questions I want to examine with samples taken from these sites is how reactive is the carbon and can it be mobilized in soil solution until it enters a streamriverlake. There is evidence that microbes in aquatic systems preferentially consume old terrestrial carbon if it becomes available partly because old carbon has not been touched by sunlight in centuries to millennia and will undergo photodegredation. I would have loved to dig further but our sampling depth was limited by the depth that we could get a small backhoe arm to reach. Its possible to dig a little deeper at the bottom with a shovel which is how I found the red massive clay layer at this site but theres very little room to move around especially with shores in to make sure it doesnt collapse and no way to get soil up to the surface. Its actually kinda funny  we set out to try to sample deeper than anyone had sampled these soils before and we found that at many sites we hardly even scratched the surface.,Soil,cpn0mlf,1,t5_2rzci
3481687,0,t1_cpp3kup,gt That negative results are more often recorded than positive ones vs control when applied gt by volumeWe did not find this. We applied at    and  by weight which I think even at the highest rates would be well under  vv and results only popped up at the  and  rates vs the  rate.gtThat smaller amounts... added continually over years... is the way to go.  year after year.This actually makes a lot of sense it spreads costs out. The pelletized BC sounds pretty cool do you have a link?gtMixing it with manure before applying with a manure spreader is a pretty common type of application.This is where I think BC really shines as an amendment. Its pretty piss poor on its own but creates a habitat for soil microbes and nitrifying bacteria. Adding another green fertilizer with it esp. if you did it over a few years as you suggest earlier would be pretty beneficial imo.gt Ive personally used power seeders to inject it into lawns.The issue with injection is that it requires another pass for the farmer andor slows him down if the injector is dragged behind other implements i.e. manure spreader. This ups his costs substantially.I think you make a really good point as well with the tractor analogy. The problem is there hasnt been any  year studies which play with application method  every  years vs  every year so its really hard to see what will happen in the long run. I think theres a lot of benefit BC can provide I just dont think its very good as a quick amendment or on its own. The C sequestration is almost enough to make application worth it.One thing I dislike though is the comparison of current BC practices to terra preta.  Yes those soils are very old and still hold elevated C levels and have benefits from the char but much of what you see is still highly stable C. Just because its black doesnt mean its automatically benefiting the soil. Thats just a nit pick however and I think were mostly on the same page with BC.Thanks for getting me to think about things a bit more in depth! Some very good ideas here!,Soil,cpp4yti,2,t5_2rzci

5394186,0,t1_cw12ndw,Thats true. I think though we should be picking land based on what contaminations are present. So instead of saying this is beautiful pristine farmland lets place a subdivision here we should be zoning much for strictly. As the article said Oregon places much stronger restrictions on rezoning farmland. Lead in the soil isnt a problem normally. Its a problem when kids move in and start eating the soil full of lead. Its not kicking a can down the road for successive generations its laying the road so it goes around the pollution. I think even if you did have an incinerator with a lead scrubber which I think your right they probably do have them you still have to plant the exact species that uptakes lead into their leaves most plants uptake it only into their roots if they even uptake it at all harvest it continually dry it and then incinerate it. And this must be done for at least a decade. I think large scale this will be just as infeasible as soil dredging. In the end I think due to the scale of the contamination I would require zoning to remain farmland until the area has been thoroughly remediated however its expected to be done. So I guess I agree we should be working on remediating and certainly phytoremediation could work but youd have to plan for it now for it to be clear in a decade or so and the efforts should only be focusing on areas that will be rezoned. Otherwise human populations are growing well always eat apples leave the land as farmland and call it good for now. ,Soil,cw161eb,2,t5_2rzci
