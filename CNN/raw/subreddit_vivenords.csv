7184063,0,t3_4dvqi2,Can you update mine to shipped? i still have the money in my account though.So i got the tracking info just  mins ago and a DHL sms where i can opt in for  either home delivery or picking it up at a service point.Im thinking of just staying home when its supposed to arrive but does anybody if theres any difference in shipping time between the two? Logically there shouldnt but shipping companies have some fucked up internal logic.,vivenords,d1urk1s,1,t5_3e2or
7239142,0,t3_4eiprs,Update for ujanoves uroskva ustoneofbrad ugeirms ufirepork Talked to DHL The problem is that HTC have shipped their packages with an open T document this should have been closed by HTC and this is causing the delay. I dont know what a T document is  but it sounds a lot like the thing that allows the package to go into Norway toll free. So the fact that DHL have stopped the package is actually a good thing or else we could have had all sorts of toll  VAT problems. DHL are working on closing the T documents as we speak possibly some sort of shipping action DHL estimates that the solution will be resolved and packages should hopefully be in our hands by tomorrow.EditCalled DHL again today early thursday. The packages are now being returned to Prague into HTCs hands unfortunately. We will have to hope that they find expedited processing there and do not return into some queue. I am a bit critical of DHL who a havent discovered this lacking document before Leipzig and b didnt just return the package immediately the origin was  hours away now it has gone over two days with attempted processing...,vivenords,d211d95,8,t5_3e2or
