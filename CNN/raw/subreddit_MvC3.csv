Im thinking ammy because doomammy and strangeammy THC are godlike with doom second I get THC between doomthor from hard tags. Getting doom in from Thor and THC using hidden missile to otg ends up at like .m its pretty ridiculous But Ive been trying strange last to help against anchors doom with bolts is pretty fun I just lose any good DHC options between thorstrange like full screen mighty punish to SoV xfactor.Im sticking with my main for now but im still debating.,MvC3,cefmloa,1,t5_2s01r

61693,0,t3_1ut9xq,Dont be under doom dont get baited to jump no matter how long he floats up there and keep an eye out to see if he uses his air dash as already mentioned. Learn the difference between his H and S footdive H is much harder to convert from and has a more slanted angle whereas his S is a straight up bop.A handful of characters can straight up counter a footdive as well among these are dorms S Dantes Smaybe have to double check and a couple other chars cant remember just now.Just play smart wait for doom to fuck up. Due to dooms tight movement most will forget they used their dash or straight up mistime the dash cancel. Do however look out for baits as doom can flight cancel both H and S  FD. Just be patient sometimes as with helmbreaker zero lightning pressure or any other difficult to deal with situation you just gotta respect it until such an opportunity arises that you can take advantage. ,MvC3,celgchl,1,t5_2s01r

168169,0,t3_1w06gk,I am a beginner myself at UMvC but I do have a fair bit of experience with Street Fighter.Let me just tell what youre getting yourself intoI dont want to scare you away but fighting games take DEDICATION over anything.You are going to hate yourself and you are going to want to quit and you will throw your controller across the room because you just cant seem to get ANYTHING right.Weve all been there.These arent casual games at least not if you intend to get good at them. The first  months depending on how much you train you will lose basically all of your matches online and thats factual.However the beauty of fighting games is that the rewarding feeling comes from you knowing that it isnt the characters you play that get better but you the player is the one improving. That is what make these games feel so personal as well because getting good at them and finding your own style is something only you can do and no new weapon or piece of armour can help you on your journey.You will spend hours grinding combos in training mode and hours trying to do all the missions trails for the characters you want to learn.When you want to get good at fighting games you have to live and breathe them. When you dont play the games you watch or read them. Become a part of the community and watch as many matches as you can on both youtube and on streams.Watch EVO the biggest fighting game tournament to date and pick out your favourite players and cheer for them! Find people to spar with online or even better get your friends to play!If you ever get to the point where you think I love these games with a passion! invest in a Fight Stick Arcade StickJoy Stick.If you ever want to play for the lulz or forealz add me on PSN MadsJsh!Happy fighting and good luck! EDITI completely forgot to give you some advice on traning!Start by picking the three characters you think look the coolest in training mode under Offline Play thats the only thing that matters at first. Like Spiderman? Play Spiderman!Youve now picked the characters you like the most visually and are ready to start fighting... a dummy! Total epicnessssss awaits you my friend!Just start out by learning the buttons. What do they do? Get a feel for the game just mash the buttons and get a feel for it. Now start doing motions on the Joy StickDPadAnalog Stick. and then input some buttons. Afterwards push start and hit the command list and then choose the character you have currently selected. Try to do the motions I will not teach you how just try it yourself.Se if you can do all of the motions for each of your characters and if you dont like one of your picked characters moves go back and pick another!Now that you can do the basic motions go into Missions and pick one of the characters you play and try to do as many of the missions as possible. Dont mad at yourself if youre having a hard time youll get it eventually What is left is just to practice. Remember to relax and dont rush things take things slow. Make some tea grab a soda or a beer whatever you prefer. Feel comfortable with the game.Thats all I got hope it helps! ,MvC3,cexl60c,4,t5_2s01r

For example You can do the max damage combo and substitute Roundhouse M for the Knee Drop during Jam Session.

305397,0,t1_cfbwyfg,That was me  if youre playing him with Doom missiles then theres some really easy like day  combos that you can do that get you a charge and still do decent damage. Think cr.LMHS Call missiles during MH j.MHS land charge ADF falling S since missiles will OTG cr.M s.S j.MMHS pillar super. Easy reliable decent damage works with no spells charged and you can fit in spell releases at the end with certain assists for a bunch of extra damage. Since youre not running missiles youll probably have a bit harder of a time charging but theres always opportunities. Any time you use a wallbounce near the corner you have time to charge for example. And I think you can charge during Jam Session and still have time to super.His higherlevel stillpractical combos revolve around cancelling s.H into Dark Matter and then either teleporting or airdashing over to them to catch up and doing a jump loop from there.Heres where I would suggest starting if you want higherlevel stuffOther than that theres thisI have some problems with his philosophies on how to play Dorm he says go rushdown which I disagree with and he overvalues fireball juggling IMO...but its still a really good video nevertheless.,MvC3,cfcf6t7,1,t5_2s01r

592282,0,t1_cg7jo8o,Oh my God FrankEoA is the best. Lv. off of any TAC from Doom to Frank at least Lv. Frank off of any Frank bnb its great. Plus EoA helps when you have levelled up so you can create fast highlows against your opponent and it can function the same way Jam Session does on incoming if you hit the opponent with a j.M chainsaw or j.S before they can air dash away from it or something.Strange anchor is still pretty bad though. I never try to save XF for Strange since opening people up with him is just as hard in XF as it is without. So typically I try to XF in some way that lets me get Frank up to a suitable level like the way I showed in the video and then try and steamroll the opponent as much as possible or if Franks killed and I have DoomStrange I just go for XF Doom so I dont get into the position of just having Strange left.

1099108,0,t3_26lh8x,For Morrigan optimal rushdown sort of has a flowchart. From another Morrigan post of minegtIts all about calculating riskreward and betting your resources. Space buys you time time buys you lockdown lockdown buys you pressure pressure buys you kills.gtIn scramble situations your best bet almost always is to just get away from the madness say they trade their assist and start going ham get some soul fists on the screen to cover you and be ready to unfly if they get past. If they dont keep trying to get enough soul fists on the screen to call your assist then go in when it makes sense.gtYou really only want to be attacking characters who a generally can get away from your barrage or b are in such a position they cant escape it at that point in time. Use your spacing to shoot soul fists at people as close as possible but just outside of the range of their normals. The proximity will prevent them from starting special moves obviously not true for chars with invincible startup stuff so be aware of their options.gtIf the character has no answer for soul fist at all wolverine Felicia etc dont ever bother going in. Just run away and keep soul fisting them always keeping projectiles on the screen so they cant approach. If they do get uncomfortably close always be in flight mode to unfly and block any moves you do. Try to safely get your assist in the screen as much as possible.gtIf they do have options to deal with your soul fists Nova Vergil Dormammu approach at whatever angles you can find that arent covered and keep working your way in calling your assist when they cant punish in blockstun or placed behind them. When they start to break free of the pressure back off and work your way in slowly instead of trying to go nuts.gtBasically always cover your approach be ready to unfly dont take unnecessary risks or go ham trying to punish stuff. Morrigan autowins all matchup except truly wellconstructed teams so abuse your strengths as much as possible until you are forced to deal with their game.Once youve closed the distance by approaching under the cover of Soul Fist and your assists pushblocks will screw the vast majority of your leftright game up. This leaves you really only with dirty highlow setups once you get close. You can rely on the mixups shown here empties highlow double overhead s.L wait s.L etc most of them work without AV on and all of them convert into a full combo if you dont want to use the Soul Drain setups. Combine that with upats guide on negating pushblock with Morrigan and you have some pretty strong pressure once you get in.Other posts in this thread have covered how to use her aerial moves. In the air use your spacing and preserve your air dash outside of flight mode to convert from SJ height. Use your space to shoot soul fists and use them bascially as Sentinel limbs Chill outside of their range and blast them with SF as soon as they get in the range where you know they want to hit a button. If theyre close abuse her air normals. j.L is crazy fast j.M has a great horizontal hitbox and is great for airtoairs j.H beats out a ton of stuff including crossup attempts OS into throw and crosses up on its own if placed correctly and j.S stuffs nearly ever crossunder attempt has f startup breaks armor has a decent hitbox in front of her and the only really bad thing about it is sometimes on hit it will push them too far away to confirm a hit and youll get punished trying to link your next move.For Vergil optimal rushdown on paper consists entirely of RT glitching. If you can RT glitch perfectly you chip every character out and never need to bother mixing them up aside from the mixups contained within your RT glitch setups. Since thats entirely infeasible you have to develop the flowchart around a trying to start the RT glitch b trying to maintain the RT glitch lockdown c getting the most out of the lockdown when you dont get the glitch setup. If youre playing Dark Vergil optimal rushdown is essentially just multilayered mixups for as long as possible into ambiguous incoming setups and kill combos or more multilayered mixups. Speed is the only thing that matters when youre in XF. NonXF Vergil when played optimally should have an assist that helps him set up the RT glitch. This means not Hidden Missiles. Plasma Beam and Vajra are probably the two best assists for this You have to cover the release of your Round Trip with an assist since you can get punished between LMgtRT or LMHgtRT s.HgtRT or H StingergtRT. If the setup is successful repeat and attempt to continue the lockdown. If you released RT but didnt maintain the charge do a backdash into teleport mixup or use the lockdown to activate swords safely and then try to mix them up from there. If they get out of your RT game its back to using Vergils amazing sword normals to try and poke them out or buy time to get an assist and RT out. Without assists XF DT Swords or RT on the screen Vergils mixup game is  ass as he can only approach from the front. Properly spaced pokes punishes and air grabs will be the only hits you find in this state unless the other player doesnt know how to deal with Vergil at all. Force them to stop playing call an assist sword up get them with an RT to get back into your lockdown game.If you dont have an assist to help you RT glitch go for the setup whenever possible anyway and simply play the plan b I described above Such as Hidden Missiles. You will still get mixup attempts off of successful lockdown just not as often meaning you have to play a more patient game and use things like Judgement Cut to cover your assist call before you go in.You want to maintain the lockdown for as long as possible because a Its marvel and youre supposed to make it a  player game  to build meter for swords or DT in the event they ever break free and you need them to stop playing  because its incredibly cheap and you can kill characters outright without them ever doing anything other than block  because once theyre in blockstun and you have stuff on the screen more RT glitch damage is riskfreeIf you want examples go and watch Clockworks Vergil or ChrisGs Vergil if you can manage to find a match where hes trolling and puts him on point.,MvC3,cht8255,2,t5_2s01r

As I said before use mighty spark L to protect the assist call it loses to faster start up projectiles like disruptor but it has enough durability to stop almost anything in the game.

1219238,0,t1_ci6o26v,This guy has an awesome writeup and covers pretty much everything you need to know about the character. Its a little overwhelming trying to learn all this stuff so this is what I recommend starting out with Movement  this is one of Magnetos biggest strengths so take the time to get used to his movement.  Go to training mode and just practice everything plink dashing forward and backwards tri jumping ariel movement etc.Mag Blast motion another huge part of his game and the input is a little weird.  Go into training mode and practice the motion on both the P and P sides.  Its going to be awkward at first but get used to the motion to where you can do it consistently then slowly add it into your combos and neutral game.Basic BnBs  All of your combos should carry your opponent into the corner and end in a hypergrav allowing you to either reset them TAC into another character or do the max amount of damage by ending with Tempest.  Learn a basic midscreen combo the basic fly combo works.  Learn a basic corner to corner combo Fchamp BnB. Eventually learn regular jump conversions super jump conversions and corner combos hyper grab loopsROMs. Start with this and youll slowly incorporate all of his other elements into your game.  ,MvC3,ci6s6n8,1,t5_2s01r

Dooms Plasma Beam and Taskys Horizontal Arrows seem to be the best candidates from the short list you provided.  Another good option would be Hawkeye with x Arrows as the assist is very quick and Hawkeye is a strong anchor.  But for all intents and purposes I would go with Doom.  He is one of the most versatile characters in the game his BnB is relatively easy and can be expanded upon in a variety of ways his movement is great and he can either rushdown or zoneout depending on the situation.

Its still on the Nem player to maintain the distance without letting the Hulk player in because Nem has no good GTFO move besides grab. So its not as easy as just spamming them noodles all day er day. At high level Nem command grab resets are irrelevant...Jan has fiqured out to escape the typical  Nem Tentacle Slam M reset so Ive had to think of other enders when Nem combos wont kill. So yeah the Nem vs Hulk is not as free vs a high level Hulk as you may think. Against other Hulks who arent as experienced in the match up though...hehehe! Many fun times are had.

2285395,0,t1_clu0nhw,I just wanted to talk about Mystic Ray as an assist by itself. Mostly because people probably wont believe me when I talk about NovaMystic Ray.If we are talking about NovaMystic Ray then I think the match up is something like  or even  in Novas favor. So long as Nova is patient the match up is quite easy. All that needs to happen for Nova to beat Zero is throw up a Grav Pulse and sit back until a hit is available. This becomes pretty easy with Mystic Ray back up. Whats really great is to just call a Pulse from full screen Mystic Ray Javelin air dash forward j.H. If they are doing something Mystic Ray will hit and Javelin hits immediately after giving you enough time to confirm into a full combo or go for a highlowthrow attempt.,MvC3,clu6wnb,1,t5_2s01r
2293410,0,t3_2ld26u,Playing Zero vs Morridoom from a Morrigans perspectiveBuster on reaction to missiles call. Use sougenmu to outzone her when she doesnt have AV up and when AV is up just hang around sj height to waste time i.e. dont fight AV. If youre bullheaded and want to fight AV put up sougenmu and hadanageki xx buster when there arent fireballs behind you and if there are jump up amp use lightning gt buster cancel to destroy soul fistsmake her blocksnipe doom.Goal is to get within rd screen distance then just hit buttons because all your buttons beat hers. Shell kick amp jH can be antiaired by cH always sMsHsS can antiair too depending on positioning. If you want to be  safe cM and sH are very good for whiff punishing shell kick it has a bit of landing recovery. She cant beat pizza cutter who can?. Buster will go through a single soul fist and hit herdoom.Obv Zero has low health so you have to make sure to avoid getting hit by random fireballs... sitting down and pushblocking every fireball that touches you will let you take very negligible damage only nets her  of a bar off the standard L S jH jS pattern. Also makes her approach a bit harder since she cant plink in to beat pushblocks too easily.If you avoid getting pingpongd shell have to touch you  times to kill you. Touch her once her team is probably dead. Comes down to a battle of attrition where shes risking more than you. Respecting her goes a long way. One of the few Zero has to.Only time you can really go nuts is round start. Her movement is pretty weak so if youre running a good assist behind Zero you can probably make her blockbully her for quite a bit. Even if you dont hit her youd probably push her quite a ways into the corner  the worst situation for a zoner.Morrigan is definitely the most difficult matchup to play with almost any character just because of the all the information you have to know. Biggest issue for most afaik is not being able to read fireball patterns. Just lab it up until you can spot the holes. Probably should do that before anything else otherwise youre done for if she gets started.,MvC3,clv6k0q,2,t5_2s01r

2371830,0,t3_2mfb72,Ive played Dante since vanilla and I think its pretty average. I play him anchor which can make a big difference but I got a few tips.Always play safe with him. Most of his approach can be made safe dont take any chances. Just keep playing the neutral until they mess up.DT cancels are your friend. DT really improves his neutral game and you can go for a lot of mixups after the flash. For example cr.m reverb shock DT. You can go for a low or a airdash air M. Both safe and its a bit tricky to see. Acid Rain is a very useful tool against flight type characters like MagDoomPhoenix. Its unsafe if they are fast so always DT if you think they will go for the grab. Make sure you always have a bar when you do this.Throw lots of airplay its a staple. Very safe apply pressure with it and it hit in an angle that most projectile cant hit you.Crystal is great for people who keep on jumping towards you. NovaWolverineDoomMagneto are some good examples. Very easy to get a hit confirm too. Just dont throw it too much because it will be too obvious.Dante got  really good get off me moves. One is snapback this is true  with almost any character but its worth noting that its his fastest move with  frames remember Dante normals are pretty slow since his main poking tool is st.m and thats  frames. You have to spend xfactor if they block snapback but you get a free mixup as well so make sure you move quick! His second is really underrated but I like to use twister. Very quick move and a huge hitbox. DT and you get a very hard to see mixup because of the fire and flash. Can anti air which is very useful too.If you are anchor Dante and xf is out. You can always do the DT vortex combo but I DONT think its the smartest thing to do. Dante needs lots of meter to comeback because of his average damage outside of xf and he need to cancel to DT pretty often. So learn his optimize xf combos that kill quick and build meter. Its very easy to gain  meters if you know what you are doing.My xf combos depends on midscreen or corner. Midscreen I do his shot loops about  times and it will kill any character and build about  bars. His corner combos I go for twister  tempest. You can do this  times if done early in a combo and does about k. This build ton of meter and you can go for the jam session infinite if you need the extra damage if it did not kill.Hope this helps man. ,MvC3,cm4v711,2,t5_2s01r

2460115,0,t1_cmfjp5e,SynergySo from reading the above you can tell that Vajra is an absolute must it is if you want an optimal point Jenny but there are other alternatives that work.Best Partner Overall Thor His Spark Assist helps her get in on opponents. Spark assist is the single most damaging combo extending assist for Jenny with an optimal triple relaunch you will max out Jennys damage at K. They also have the  bar DHC gimmick if Thors command super doesnt work because they jumped DHC in Jen. If Thors command super connected then DHC in Jen with Emerald Cannon then continue the combo by doing an OTG with mighty spark nets about K. Jens Torpedo assist is a great combo extender for Thor so they both benefit from each others assists. The DHC between each is also fantastic in combos Emerald Cannon works amazingly well off an extended Thor combo because the scaling is so good youll easily reach mil. And on the other way around youll get close to mil if you do the K combo and DHC into Thors Mighty Thunder super.Best overall assist Strider Vajra is godlike for Jen. I linked the incoming mixup video above but its also just great in neutral. Mastering her runners start canceling is crucial to making Vajra work not only to get the pickup but also to use it as mobility to screw an opponents inputs while at super jump height. You can do stuff like somersault  vajra and actually have time to pick up OTG its a defensive option that is underutilized can also be done with a block string cr.LMH  strider somersault M is a decent string. Vajra also gives jenny optimal snap back combos and even deadlier resets even if you use a beam assist beforehand during the relaunch. Inputs belowAfter Air Combo A DDS FL DDS BH gt Branch  or  or Branch  is snap back the extra H adds more meterdamage st.H QCFABranch  reset you can visually confirm which direction they tech reverse input for forward tech cr.H QCFMBranch  additional damage and forced tech reset due to using  ground bounces tech best combined with a level  reset when opponent auto pilots a roll backwards S sj.HS sj.DHBest overall everything Strange Bolts is an amazing assist for Jen it unlocks her heavy command grab game and the stagger from bolts is an easy confirm with a plink dash into slide. Its staggered hits gives her some interesting options such as using it to put an opponent at neutral jump height in block stun the stagger allows the opponent to fall to the ground setting up the perfect opportunity for a command grab L can be done with other beam assists but bolts is particularly tricky to fight against. Strange also has DHC options out of Emerald Cannon such as whiffing rings on the second hit and going into FoF loops as seen in this video I linked above it adds more damage than a jenny BnB into SoV but youll want a rd assist that can extend damage for Strange. Also in that video Strange has the option to hard tag after a Taking out the Trash in the corner which really helps Jen more than anything as her damage suffers due to scaling and losing a wall bounce. The only downside to bolts is she doesnt have a go to relaunch its doable against small characters and a few others but isnt as practical as the assists Im going to mention below. The major plus with strange is having a character who can do big damage from a hard tag off a command grab Strange can do this very easily and the damage is top tier.Best Projectile assist Iron Man Unibeam is her best get in assist it helps her maintain pressure and it allows easy relaunch combos that dont scale very badly thanks to the way her OTG and the assist interact. Unlike Plasma beam it doesnt cause a soft knockdown which means using it to confirm off stray unibeam hits is much easier. Iron Man is also useful for his TAC infinite which is damage Jen really needs and Tony can even set up a DHC guard break after building all that meter. Probably Iron Mans biggest weakness is a lack of big damage from a command grab hard tag.Best partner for JenXStrider Doom Hands down Doom is a clear winner here and is the reason why this is my exact point Jen team. Plasma Beam offers many of the same benefits as Unibeam confirming off it can be done with st.LMS or cr.HS if you anticipate the confirm quickly enough. Sphere flame is a very good DHC for Jen because it maximizes the sphere flame damage by starting from the bottom where emerald cannon ends and its recovery is so quick that you can just hard tag Jen back in whether they live or die. Doom has the potential to do major damage off a hard tag from Jens level  you can go right into the optimal mazio loops. You also get easy TACs like Iron Man but the obvious upside here is Doom has the edge on his synergy with Strider. Doom has a much better hard tag from Jens command grab than Iron Man even a simple doom BnB that ends with Jens assist will do K.Doom Bnb from a command throw QCFL Plink Dash DDS FM DDS S Plink Dash x hard tag to doom S sj.MhitMhitFHS Dash Down st.HhitS x sj.MhitFHS Dash Down A j.FHS tk.QCFH xx photon array xx emerald cannon  hits.Though there are many other characters who offer Jenny something Ill briefly go over them.Spencer  his assist gives her crumples off any hit which opens up her hard tag potential best hard tag partners are Strange Doom and oddly enough Thor. Bionic Maneuvers is also an easy DHC from  hits of emerald cannon but you lose out on a wall bounce still does good damage overall. Spencer also likes OTG assists that hit low in case Jen isnt on point. His hard tag potential from Jennys command grab is quite good.Arthur  Daggers are excellent for her as they are for most ground based characters. Theory time DHC in gold armor after the nd hit of emerald cannon then you can set up a hard tag with his specials into Strange for instance.Amaterasu  Cold star is a nice lock down assist its not amazing like it is for Viper or Doom but it can definitely help as you can kinda cover the assist with lamp post then use the lock down to threaten them with overheads or command grabs after the block stun of ice. Her THC allows Jenny to emerald cannon THC and get  hits even when she burned a wall bounce. Slow down is a good DHC from emerald cannon as it can set up some pretty nice resets. flow chart is slow down on nd hit of emerald cannon hard tag in jenny go for OTG senton cr.L for the reset then watch what they do because they are slow you should be able to make an easy reaction command grab.Storm  her THC is like ammys but better hail storm is always nice to have in your back pocket her assist isnt all that great though.Tron  SheHulk is more likely to be support to Tron than the other way around as Jennys OTG assist is pretty good for Tron because it will always continue a happy birthday. Tron is actually pretty great in that she can use her capture state special to lock an opponent into an untechable air recovery if you hard tag in SheHulk you can command grab M for free. Whats good is Tron is an excellent hard tag partner off a command grab because her damage output is so good and jens own torpedo assist helps even more.Vergil  Rapid Slash offers Jenny some tricky and deadly incoming mixups as well as a reliable relaunch assist. Vergil isnt that bad as a hard tag character either and Jens torpedo assist means hell always have spiral sword extensions off any hit. Spiral Sword as a DHC is also really good even though you use a wall bounce typically Jenny will side switch during emerald cannon which means you wont be facing the corner so you dont need a wall bounce to kill a character and if youre smart youll still have your ground bounce available.Any character with a strong assist  it will help in some way. She can do some funny resetsguard breaks with Jam Session but its not the best assist due to her having a hard time converting stray hits. Other assists like Tatsu Drones Aim Master Dark Harmonizer have a use in one way or another. drones might work well as a bolts type assist the further away they are the more likely theyll be crouching underneath them perfect for a command grab H as they are locking themselves down. I can tell you right now Greyhound and Disruptor do not work well for her they are good in neutral but you need a neutral assist that doubles as a relaunch tool or youll be struggling to build meter.,MvC3,cmfrsuk,2,t5_2s01r

3482207,0,t3_303uog,Kind of forgot footsies and spacing as well as matchup and character knowledge. If somebody tells you how to plink dash what your normals do and what you do to tech throws that alone wont get you too far even if you are technically proficient doing every single one of them. You gotta know the characters both yours and your opponents and how to control the flow of the match by positioning yourself correctly inside your effective pokeprojectileetc. range and outside your opponents effective range forcing him to take risks and make mistakes for you to punish.Footsies and character knowledge are categories of fundamentals of their own methinks. I wouldnt place footsies on movement nor neutralizing and character knowledge doesnt really fit in any of those  you posted about. Maybe neutralizing is a bit vague and you can fit footsies in there but how could character knowledge be part of neutralizing? Just thinking out loud.  ,MvC3,cpp73op,1,t5_2s01r

3613398,0,t3_31nig3,So I had an interesting weekend. For better and for worse.Saturday I went to my local retro game shop and I learned of a local gaming place in my city. Where I live isnt very big. But the fact that there is venue down the street from where I live is fucking huge. Its primarily card shop Magic Yugioh Pokemon etc and they both hold Smash tourneys on Wednesdays and Saturdays. I stopped by this place soon after I learned about it and chatting with some of the customers there. Everyone was pretty chill and at around  that evening I came back to play some games. I initially played games with  people and then it eventually grew to  people. We were running USF UMvC and DOA  Last Round as well as Xrd. Im not good at Xrd but cleaned house in Ultra and Mahvel. DOA  was a mixed bag. There must have been at least  people playing some version of Smash Project M SSB Wii U Melee. Occasionally the Smashers would watch me and other people play the other games. I overheard this girl saying Ooh USF! I play this with my dad! Hearing that made feel that I should apply for my AARP card lol. I must have been the oldest one there. Im pushing thirty while the majority of everyone else were still in High School...or younger. Uncomfortable as fuck. I had a good time though. Ill be back there in some sort of capacity.Sunday Nothing makes my more diabetes salty when some asshole from Canada takes my bank card information and decides to go on a fucking spending spree with it. I was out . Im working with my bank to get this shit straightened out and getting my money back. I dont like it when people fuck with my money.

If it is a scaled combo the Hard Kick wont connect.In XF you cannot do it in the list I posted on SRK that you have in your main post. Its always better to do raw Hard Kick after the bard tag except vs Raccoon Arthur Joe and one other I cant temember right now.In XF you can hard tag vs anyone except Amaterasu.

3806439,0,t3_33zmve,What team are you playing and who are you playing against? I believe its one thing to know how to approach a match up but you also need to know how to approach a player. Not all people play teams the same way granted they will all have some similarities but each persons play style is their own. For example Marlinpie and Full Schedule both play the same team in much different styles. In addition to this Ill give you a similar example from my experience with the same problem. The person who taught me how to play marvel kept beating me senseless no matter how hard I worked. This is because he was with me the entire time I was growing as a player. When I had habits they were there because I was playing against him and knew what he was going to do because we had been playing so consistently. I had already gone and played and did well at a major won money matches in long sets beaten some good marvel players in sets and he still rocked me sometimes. It wasnt until I met and started playing with serious guys from NY and NJ that I broke most of my habits I still attempt to style even without the life lead and was able to consistently beat him the way he had when I first started. Long story short play as many people as possible even new players can teach you something you may not have known. Best of luck bro hope you find your answer.,MvC3,cqq5x6t,2,t5_2s01r

Initially It started because I wanted to maximize the potential of ChunLi while also taking a stylish approach to the game. These characters hadnt seen much play and I felt that I had something to offer to the community by exploring this team...then  weeks later the CoonLi video came out and I was certain of my choice. This combo video didnt seem to explore the RRStrange elements of the team so I decided upon myself to find as much tech as I could with the team. I then came up with this videoCompetition isnt really a large thing to me but I always try my best to do well and put on an entertaining match when I play.

4040756,0,t1_crgtz1z,Actually I think rock n roll does a lot of damage. The only nuance is that you have to be on P side because MGS pushes them out of the corner PI meant that even though Jill gets pushblock negated if you were going for Arrow Kick chip it would be equivalent to Arthur chip in the sense that they can pushblock it to negate the damage not Jill herself. The thing that sucks about Mad Beast is that no matter how you do it you can only get about  hits max before the combo drops this is even with Flip  Cart loops or however you want to start it. But I do agree a good combo nets k damage more than any other level  in the game assuming your execution is on point. And I meant that a single combo will net you about  meter before you have to spend it. Now going with your current line of thinking you can do a couple of standing resets as I would like to call it and net more meter before Mad Beast runs out but youre risking that theyll call Haggar or Akuma or Shuma or someone that would stop you dead in your tracks. I should have time starting next week to play around with it and it would also be a good addition to this conversation.,MvC3,crgvknx,1,t5_2s01r

4085236,0,t1_crlxh2b,M overdrive is definitely punishable on ground block but if done at full screen to get out of situations its pretty safe for example if vergil does a tk round trip to then teleport M she can do M overdrive to nullify the round trip and air dash away.If he gives more support it is minuscule and it also depends on the team and match up because for example overdrive is the best assist ever against dormammu. Plus the benefit rapid slash give are dependant on the character for example dante with rapid slash is terrible but zero with it is very good so the overall support value of each of these characters will change depending on the team.,MvC3,crlxxnp,1,t5_2s01r

4091488,0,t1_crmlhrs,The meta of Spiderman has changed kinda. Ive never seen him as a battery as his basic combos dont build that much meter. Most of his attacks lend themselves to long range poke and runaway tactics fighting from afar with web ball web throws and a very good DP. Web swing is a pressure tool and combo extender but because it scales is not something youll be using in higher damage combos. Both of his attack hypers are unsafe on block and UWT is pretty punishable on whiff making middle his worst position. That being said along with a self otg in web zip he was probably built in mind as a point character who can go into a support character and setup certain gameplans. The fact that the discovered loops can TOD just enforce the fact that Spiderman is an extremely strong character. UWT is great but in the meta its only a bonus to what he can really provide to a team.As for the SpideyMag tech that is an extremely good guardbreak setup but not necessarily optimal. Spidey  a really good middle character like Dormammu Raccoon Trish or even Morrigan is probably the way youd want to build a team around him.,MvC3,crmnkss,2,t5_2s01r

For Chun li you gotta keep wavedashing after the charge is somewhat complete and then on the last down press you can complete it by doing upattack. Chun can wavedash across the screen with a fully charged ex Birdkick and release it when she gets to her opponent. Just keep in mind that you have to wave dash not plink dash.

Since the blinded mh can be used as both the guard cancel airdash input and a double tapped attack resulting in air H. This means vs moves like buster mag can sj up block the buster input QCbup towards zero then double tap the mh bind punishing a buster.

4715926,0,t1_ctoeijr,s.HS is the most damagemeter but adds to the hitstun decay HSD so you cant get as many reps in a combo. s.MfH is the fastest and best for midscreen especially off of awkward confirms so you can give yourself the greatest amount of HSD leniency for the rest of the combo. Least damagemeter but lowest HSD.s.MS is in between the two others in terms of damagemeter and HSD.

5236902,0,t3_3mp577,Pope selecting can be used offensively and defensively. On offense there are a few things to keep track of when thinking to commit to it. Opponents pushblock habits What does your OS in the air look like? Opponents option after techThe first one while it doesnt seem important I personally think its a big deal. Often times opponents will use their pushblock at odd times to put themselves in more blockstun to avoid a crossupthrow mixup. If the opponent pushblocks really late and you jump and whiff a grab OS in the air then you might be left vulnerable depending on your air OS. Ideally though you will plink OS dash on the ground multiple times to beat the pushblock and then the opponent is either forced to tech on the ground or upback the ground through and be put in another compromising situation. Often times people just jump up and airgrab in reaction to the upback which is a pretty strong option in response to the popeselect. When someone does a pope select they have a different looking dash animation since they have to wave dash the OS to get multiple throw attempts. Check out Fullschedule for instance who is probably the most prominent user of the pope select on offense. There is a different between him just plinking with viper normally and wave plink OSing. The wave plink is shorter and looks more erratic overall. If you see this movement then upbacking the grab will give you more time to register the character going in and lets you focus on the opponent trying to jump up and grab you on defense. This can be baited however since you can run up and just do a grounded normal hitting the person trying to air grab tech. This is a strong option to keep the opponent guessing. The other option to consider is when the opponent ground techs your grab. If you just keep plinking trying to account for pushblock the opponent can take advantage of that and press a fast button like stcr. L to counter hit your Dash OS attempt post ground tech. This takes awareness from your opponent but it is a very strong option if you force your opponent to spread himself between all the options of the OS and not commit hard to a specific option. This will also beat people trying to pope select you on defense too since your normal will counter hit the opponents dash and upback grab. So for me personally with wolverine I tend to try and go for ground grab OS into OS air grab with drill claw. I do this while trying to go for a normal grab in my head and use the OS to cover all the other options. If the opponent counters with a post grab tech button or upbacking and teching the air grab then I adjust based on the option my opponent presented. Hope that helps explain when to use it offensively at least. If you have any questions feel free to respond and Id be happy to answer questions and stuff D,MvC3,cvh8j6k,3,t5_2s01r

I think hes that one character we like to give a pass because hes hard and fun but fuck if that character isnt insanely cheap then I dont know what is. Hes just one of those characters where you ALWAYS have another option. The ceiling is just so high when you have that kind of mobility there is always somewhere more optimal you could have placed yourself whenever you get put into a bad position. Take any bullshit that fills the screen and there is almost always some way to navigate around it. Bias here but I think end game magneto is a stronger point character than morrigan but I think morrigans support is so unique that it is unparalleled. Magneto is insane.

5522915,0,t3_3qr0fb,Its way hard to assess which one is best for Viper because she has multiple equally viable gameplans that fit all those shells at a super high level. And I would be suspicious of anyone trying to oversell any one shell over the other. It really comes down to which backup plan shell is better imo.

A theory team would be weskerstridermagneto as you give Wesker two of his best assists but the damage is ass going from Wesker to strider though there is a TAC infinite its not exactly practical.Id recommend weskerdoomstrider instead you get a good beam assist you have an optimal team order and you can TAC or DHC more effectively.

Then later learned deadpool and the synergy is still being explored but also finding that this is an amazing team as well.

Assist wise daggers and spitfire are suuuper similar but I consider spitfire a worse dagger assist. Not to mention the team super with arm plus goddess bracelet is much stronger.

Speed shot and forwardM shoutouts to Punisher for the find trade with Buster and blue arrow goes through it completely. Jump H beats most of Zeros Air approaches.

6725909,0,t3_47pfcv,Since we play the same team sometimes Ill throw in my  cents.It seems miniboss puts you out of your comfort zone a bit. It looked like you wanted to call strange assist too much when you should use both. Try counter calling his assists with yours since both your assists are great for that log against bolts and bolts against missiles. I can understand blowing xfactor against his team since rrstrange beats anchor doom but try using it to get some momentum. An example would be on the second match where he dropped a strange combo and dhcd to swords. You had three meters and it would have been perfect for a xfactor hyper. Vergil would be dead and he would have no meter for his strange and hes free on incomingSpeaking of incomings I would be more careful with the launch call log trap one. I know I used to do it a lot before too but its a bad one due to how dangerous it is. Sacktap blocked it like everytime and luckily he didnt punish you for it cause it woulda been happy birthday city. A better incoming for a respecting opponent is cr.h. Its more ambiguous and you can make it safer with spark hurricane or punish.With rr crH is your best friend especially against strange doom. Against them you should tag the doom assist everytime it comes out to stop them missles. You can cancel it to skates for dodging shit too. crH is also great for stuffing aggamotto startup. Might want to go on the offensive a little more approaching with bolts backing you up is pretty scary against the taller characters. Also maybe assign a button for LH cause when a mine goes off and it sends them the wrong way Im pretty sure every rr player dies a little inside.I suck with strange so all I can do is remind you that if you get an air throw with him you can teleport L or M call logtrap and SoV. Should give you a full combo with palm loops.Only thor specific thing I can give is try doing empty tridash lows more. You do a great job with the command grab setup but it would be even scarier with the threat of lows too.Thats all i got. I enjoy miniboss commentary he makes me laugh.,MvC3,d0f0n2c,1,t5_2s01r

6814226,0,t1_d0onkb6,Ryu as an anchor is better than many here will give it credit for but my no means good. I know because I ran it for god knows how long. His shinku Hadoken is pretty ballin at level  and even more in denjin mode. x denjin hado is insanely powerful and he can ToD thor in x with a BnB. His meter build it pretty trash so you have to make sure you have some batteries on your team. doom is a good one. By far the best part of Ryu is his aimable beam super which is great for sniping assists and punishing those who try and jump to avoid. You can really easily punish a player who tries to fly away from it and he can shoot straight up which is extremely useful for combo ending and keeping pressure when they hit the ground. If you like Ryu Id say he works well as a nd more than an anchor. Hes got no instant overhead which makes him hard to get in with but other than that hes a solid character which many disagree with. ,MvC3,d0oougx,4,t5_2s01r

7155182,0,t1_d1rfs6x,this is true we have to remember that game development takes anywhere from  years a good game anyways so they may have had the license since about  or  which is right around when the first Iron Man movie was made. Disney was smart they realized that once they had a blockbuster on their hands that they could then set the price to whatever they wanted because now their characters were becoming a commodity. MvC was released in  and Avengers the movie in  by then the Marvel license had grown so huge that suddenly disney didnt want anyone to touch their IPs so they could have full control.Still had this game sold like a AAA title we may have had a patch with maybe a year extension on the license. This games failure to sell is what ultimately doomed any progress on the game but even if it did sell well there was no guarantee Disney would have ever extended the license for any price.A shame because as a result of this Disney game division we lost great companies like Lucas Arts.,MvC3,d1rh2fq,1,t5_2s01r

You cant antiair him conventionally as shown in game  when you tried to antiair with Sentinel. Idk how Sentinel or Akuma are supposed to fight that MU but I do play Nova. You went to the shields gameplan at one point which IMO was the right idea but you abandoned it pretty quickly in favor of box dash H.

Look at how RayRay uses drones unknown uses drones Fchamp uses missiles angelic uses mystic ray etc. They use their assist as a security blanket while on the attack. The wrong move and button the opponent is hit. They only go in when their assist is out. Theres an evo match between Fchamp and J.Wong where they played over  yes SIXTY marvel seconds of neutral before Wong got the first hit and that was mainly because the  time Fchamp went in with out his assist backing him.

8628408,0,t3_4y0uu2,I try to catch the show whenever I can and when I do Im usually entertained by the conversations you guys have about Marvel. I have a couple of ideas you guys can do on your show just for fun. Since I havent seen every episode please excuse them if you guys have already done it on a show.. Interview the top  top  or top  best players in Marvel. One two or three players at a time for each episode depends on your episode time constraint. You can use the shoryuken rank system the eventhubs rank system or simply make a poll on social media sites and let the people decide who they want to see.. After a big major talk about the top  players and what each of them had to do to get there or who they had to beat to get top . Most of the time everyone focuses on interviewing the st place winner which is fine but the other players in top  usually had to work pretty hard to get there as well.. Im not sure if you ask these questions but when you have a dedicated player on the show ask them what theyre training regimen is. Every player trains differently so it would be interesting to hear what they say. Ask them what they recommend for new players who are barely starting off and what they should focus on.. Interview TOs about Marvel tournaments and how they plan to integrate the game into their respective tournament. Ask them what they think of the game and if they plan to include pot bonuses and so on and so forth.Just some friendly feedback the show can use if you havent already. I also hope you guys dont stop airing it because I think it helps the Marvel community a lot ,MvC3,d6k5lpg,6,t5_2s01r

Easier TACs definitely better zoning and better meter gain id think and playing jam session isnt all that advantageous for rush down Morrigan who doesnt have deceptive trijumps or teleports like magneto and zero. I supose the advantage would be a better incoming but a lot is lost to neutral.Not forgetting the backup ofc if Morrigan dies its arguably an even or perhaps better duo doomstrider as opposed to dantestrider.,MvC3,d723hyb,1,t5_2s01r

8918060,0,t1_d7js755,For me it typically goes something like this Are they smaller than Zero or Wolverine? Yes? That shit is free. Tron and Modok? Deep in the corner its pretty free. Are they a big body Sent Nemesis Dorm? Yes? Make them float in the air as you throw down a carpet except for Hulk. Normal bodies other than Vergil?... Very weird timings and spacing that make them borderline impractical in a real match. Can I hit them with it? Sure. Is it worth the risk of dropping the combo going for it when I could just as easily do regular bnb with my assist? Not in my opinion. EDIT These are all in relation to deep in the corner flame carpet juggles. Juggling the feet is an entirely different beast. Also most of the stylish stuff you can do with flame carpet juggles is only really applicable to the small bodies and Vergil. Most other flame carpet juggles should be used to optimize damage after an assist confirm imo.,MvC3,d7jtjg3,3,t5_2s01r

Youd be surprised at how effective BoltsEoA coverage is once the opponent has to block a flame grenade.

10924643,0,t3_5w25bm,I bought the Hori mini for SFV when I gave a shit about that game... and honestly came out of it with a really positive impression. Obviously its not as good as a full size stick but the pros are Its rock solid. I played SFV and Revelator on it for like  months and it never wore down broke or had any sort of technical malfunction. From everything Ive read online others have reported much of the same. The layout is standard and easy to get used to. If you have large hands itll probably feel cramped but it actually felt just right for me. While the parts are below par they were all responsive. I didnt mind if I wasnt getting the tactile feedback of sanwa buttons because at least I was able to do everything I wanted to on the stick.  The price tag makes this a ridiculous bargain. You can pick it up for less than a standard dualshock.The cons are generally lower quality parts the size for me this wasnt a big deal but for someone else I could see it being a deal breaker the light weight and thus the slipnslide. I will say that though this is a problem its actually easily fixed if you just set the stick on some sort of surface to play. Its actually quite stable as long as you dont try to play with it on your lap. Full disclaimer Im a pad guy by preference and the only reason I bought this was because a sixbutton stick feels ways more natural to me for Street Fighter which Ive since stopped playing... and then I bought a brooks converter so I could use my pad with PS marvel B. Yet I was still extremely pleased with how much bang for your buck I got out of this. I do just naturally prefer pad for the majority of fighters that I play but if Capcom ever fixes SFV I would definitely break it out again. If you think the size wouldnt be an issue its certainly worth checking out. ,MvC3,de6su6f,6,t5_2s01r

11649142,0,t3_66868l,Hey I feel you. Morrigan can be tough to learn and there is a lot to unpack. I would suggest spending some time getting comfortable in flight initially. Her flight plinks are pretty lenient and eventually you can practice some fist patterns if you want to get more comfortable with the motions. Her staircase and f.H combos are pretty much the same though the latter is easier to transition into some extensions. Once you get the motions down you should be able to tackle either combo easily.One confusing thing about this character is her movement pressure and neutral are so tightly knit. Take some time with the dummy set to block and adv. guard while you get used to her air dashshadow blade flyunfly pressure. all of her normals are great every single one. j.M and j.H are your gotos practice flyunfly strings with those and throw some soul fists in.As for the combo itself there is a lot to keep in mind initially but your muscle memory will kick in eventually and youll find it easy. Remember to let your stick return to neutral after each flight cancel and try timing the j.H after the air dash downward a few different ways until you get it. Note that the soul fist you use will affect the combo a lot too L drops them lower but a bit slower I think M is a pretty steady drop and H bops them up. Could be wrong play with it and see. Generally for the staircase combo I use L soul fist then H or M depending on height. The f.H one I dont use often enough to advise.Until you do learn the soul fist combos you can do the f.H gt j.MMHS gtcr.MH gt f.H gt repeat into launch or shadow blade stuff.
