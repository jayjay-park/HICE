6691283,0,t1_d0berpz,I can understand why larger groups need to be more cautious in their programming.  I just think a long term plan that revolves around performing the same  operas for decades is excessive any way you look at it.  And sure the world of musicals is no better in that regard.  Im not trying to be overly negative.  Im happy to be working with some amazing open minded musicians.  But come on you know full well that any kind of experimentation is always going to be an uphill battle in any larger production be it an opera an orchestra or what have you.  Sometimes it is a winnable battle or at least a battle worth fighting.  But for me Id rather work with smaller ensembles that will work with me and not against me.  I dont think Im alone in that feeling.    ,ContemporaryComposers,d0bfr69,1,t5_3bkjm
