6844598,0,t1_d0s47h2,His trainerfather figure died. His managers and the people close to him swindled him out of millions of dollars. He wasnt the most stable person to begin with but I imagine that was the tipping point. He became erratic in and outside of the ring. He wasnt focused and didnt train like he was supposed to. The combination of these things caused his career to fizzle out instead of him continuing his domination of the sport. With all that said hes still one of the greatest boxers of all time.,SuperAthleteGifs,d0s53iv,12,t5_3bzv8

7572001,0,t1_d327he8,I mean youre right they definitely worked harder than me to be that good. The problem is that as a former kid I know nothing destroyed my interest or demotivated me more than seeing these kids. I probably would have worked a lot harder if they werent there making the game so much less fun. Basically if you work hard and see the results of it youre more likely to continue to work hard. If you work hard and some cunt whos been playing soccer since he was  is still going to wipe the floor with you youre going to stop working hard.,SuperAthleteGifs,d32we74,1,t5_3bzv8

9542312,0,t1_d9p387h,The bits sticking up that the ball hit are stumps or the wicket. When the batsman hits the ball he has to run from one wicket to the other before the fielding team can hit the stumps to complete a run.     Here the fielder grabs a low ball and manages to accurately hit the stumps from a midair position before the batsman reaches the safety of the wicket.  Basically replace the stumps with a man standing on base and imagine that a batter has to touch the base with his bat to be safe rather than his foot.,SuperAthleteGifs,d9padhc,8,t5_3bzv8
