4883564,0,t1_cua3ax0,Hi  I tried doing that tonight but looks like there isnt anyone local... Im in Northern Ireland.Id like to take it to someone who knows what theyre doing  because I certainly do not.   I tried zapping a few spiders and flies to feed it as I think the nest collapsed over  hours ago so its probably starving but it wouldnt open its beak and I was afraid to handle it too much.Edit  I would be willing to do whatever needed to keep it alive until it can fly.   I assume hopefully with a bird like this flying is pretty instinctive so as soon as its fully flighted it would be able to join the other swifts including its parents who are still around the house.   I dont know if the migration route is instinctive  if not if the rest of them leave before its ready to fly its probably doomed.   I already found its sibling dead on the ground with the nest so Id like to save the poor fella.,WildlifeRehab,cua40r5,2,t5_37tws

10934095,0,t1_de7fzqe,At the center I worked for we never used funding from the feds or the state only public donations. The feds never gave us any trouble. The state tried to dictate to us what we can and cant rehabilitate and we told them to go blow and that they had no legal right to dictate to us which animals we helped with money given oftentimes on the behalf of a nonnative species we would get insanely high donations for continuing to have a reverence for life in those special cases.  We are not God and we werent about to decide a healthy animal should be put to death just for existing in the wrong place at the wrong time. We usually placed Rock Pigeons with racing groups in the local area if we could but otherwise they just went right back to where their little compasses desired for them. ,WildlifeRehab,de7rwuy,1,t5_37tws
