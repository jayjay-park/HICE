No Ragen it did not take you hours of research to write this blog. There is no research involved in quoting yourself. Full post of what Ragen does all day Also someone claiming to know more about scientists and fat shaming doctors needs more credible sources. Why isnt she reviewingcriticizing the latest research that proves there is no such thing as fat and fit etc? Its things like these that proves the FA movement is a joke. Is Ragen with her immense following lobbying Congress to fight fat shaming? Staging marches to protest bigger plane seats okay scooter rolling? Staging sit ins at fat shaming stores that dont have xL athletic gear? Starting a class action lawsuit against doctors that promote weight loss? No. Shes not. Shes a self promoting narcissist whos peddling the same bullshit and is now to lazy to even come up with new material for her blog.

A tiny square of space. New people brought buckets of water to wash their feet  no joke  and ROLLER BAGS for all their crap!To her credit at least she does seem to acknowledge that this is HER problem for not knowing this stuff rather than trying to blame obtuse race officials or something along those lines.,RagenChastain,cw3m76k,12,t5_323a3

What she described sounded more like the aftermath of a cruise ship sinking than an actual race of any sort.  I expected her to mention that there was a string ensemble there playing Nearer My God To Thee.gt Final point  SEED YOURSELF PROPERLY. Sounds like they got in the water and then she had people swimming over her and past her.

Then you start again and keep it going until the pain dissipates. It might mean you need to slow down but Ive found it really helps when side stitches hit So if the pain is on your right side you breathe in when your right foot makes contact with the ground. Then if you breathe in for another two steps then out three steps you start again on the right side foot. Takes a bit of practise but really seems to work. ,RagenChastain,d0l6xpy,9,t5_323a3
6795200,0,t3_48sa8k,Here is the trail Ragen is training on. In the section where she met the douchebros as well as where she wiped out there is a steep rocky embankment on one side and a large shoulder on the other. In both cases she was biking on the side of the embankment so there was no way for her to move over. I have no idea if the douchebro story is true but based on Ragens past history she is probably heavily embellishing an on your left overtake. In the wipeout story Ragen fell off her bike picked herself up and sat there occupying the right lane of the trail rather than moving to the shoulder. Ill forgive the idiot for not realizing the elite fathlete he came across sitting there huffing and puffing and taking up half the trail was recovering from an elite fall rather than having a rest.If anyone is wondering the crazy downhill and uphill sections shes talking about are indeed gentle underpasses.

Like theyre the same thing? What the fuck are you talking about?Nobody cares about your size in relation to what you look like. At the end of the day no gives a flying shit. I dont care how big you are. And if your fat is spilling all over on me I still dont care what you look like. I care that youre in my fucking personal space. The same as I dont care if youre eating food beside me until youre dropping slop and crumbs on my leg. Im swearing more than usual because it pisses me off that she doesnt care that shes stressing other people out.Traveling is a source of real anxiety for me. Its just something I dont enjoy at all and it stresses me out. Even when it comes to casual acquaintances and coworkers and not close friends or family  especially strangers I dont like people up in my personal space or touching me or being too close to other people. And I hate flying but I dont make it a social issue I go on a bus switching buses or a train or a cruise if I can. Way to not care about anyone elses experience but your own. And no flying isnt a birth right. Unless you need a helicopter or a manmade skybird in an emergency situation to get you from A to B flying isnt your right. Oh too bad you dont get to go to a funeral or a wedding or see Germany. Boo hoo. Thats life. And when I read it all dazed and tired I dont even care about the underlying discrimination because how grossly engorged is your privilege to be crying about seats on an airplane? To travel?

7497519,0,t1_d2uauhg,Heartrate training definitely is a thing. Its a training tool in the same way that a powermeter in cycling can be useful In and of itself it doesnt do much but it allows you to make informed decisions about what your body is doing which in turn can affect your training. That said HR training like with powermeters is more useful the better shape youre in. A new cyclist or runner doesnt need to know their stats they just need to run a lot. As you progress and actually get to be a sort of good runner the HR info can allow you to make more informed decisions about how to train. If you calculate your heartrate zones you can choose to do threshold workouts aiming to stay between  of your max heartrate. Or for rest days you can choose to stay in say Zone  using your HR as a method to determine exertion. The thing is though... These are super useful metrics but not when youre anywhere near a beginner which she is based on the distances shes not running. Keeping your HR under lets say  for the bike leg might be really important on race day but for training she needs to build her cardio. The fact she needs to mix in lots of walking with her running to stay in her HR goals means that she basically cant perpetually run thats no bueno for IM. TLDR HR training matters but she just needs to train in general. ,RagenChastain,d2ufge5,6,t5_323a3

I feel pity for the world of hate and victimization shes created for herself I felt rage at her attempts to hijack the tragedy of others to promote her agenda of hate and sell her own scams. ,RagenChastain,d48sggo,18,t5_323a3

In particular gt So you know a lot of my intervals would be go as hard as you can. And I really legitimately thought I was but looking back I think I was just thinking god this sucks good for me for getting through it. Which did not give me the results I wanted.Is encouraging.

10468535,0,t1_dcuey73,Im sure Ragen and Julianne have set hard limits to what Juliannes parents can and cant say around them.  They have probably acquiesced by this point just so theyre allowed access to their daughter.  So they now have to stand by idly as their daughter eats herself to death lest they be cut off from her forever. That is the reason FAHAES are so insidious.  One of the requirements of the family and friends of these people is that they never mention their weight in a negative light.  To have access to them their loved ones have to let them slowly kill themselves.  Any concern shown is seen as harmful rathern than an act of love.  Its the most cultish behavior of the FAHAES crowd.  If family and friends dont buy the BS they are cut off.  That leaves them only other FAHAES folk to associate with.  Its such an abusive idealogy.  The rest of the world doesnt love or accept you for who you are.  Only we do.  Now cast your nonbelieving family and friends aside.  Embrace your debilitating lifethreatening but completely avoidablereversible condition.  We and our ideas are your only hope for salvation!,RagenChastain,dcuprpe,10,t5_323a3
10471501,0,t1_dcv0t9n,Yeah as soon as she has all the perfect pieces she will become champion overnight.  But as long as shes too big to find the perfect thingamajig and too dense to just go and get one custommade already she has an excuse to fail.  Because fatphobia is in the way of becoming champion.  So send more money so she can keep buying more imperfect thingamajigs.,RagenChastain,dcv1w6d,4,t5_323a3

10518329,0,t3_5qh7m6,gtSlow athletes deserve to have places to tell our stories and to have and be! role models.  Slow athletes are only going to be role models for sports in which slowness is the goal.  Usain Bolt is a role model for way more people than I am because hes much better at sprinting than I am.  You may not be a fan of selfimprovement Ragen but nobody else dreams of mediocrity.  gtToday well hear from Angela a slow swimmer in her own words  So Ragen not content with reposting her own content is now reposting content taken from other people?  gtThe teacher got impatient and irritable and said people can walk a mile in  minutes!.  Thats for people with longer legs I never could and still cant.  The teacher isnt expecting you to walk a mile in fifteen minutes.  That example was invoked to show you just how slack you were being.  The teacher was expecting you to run a mile in fifteen minutes and thats something even a midget can do.  gtIm what I call a floater.  I dont sink in the pool so learning to swim for me was something that I have been able to teach myself because it has involved learning the strokes not having to simultaneously learn to keep myself up while attempting to do the mechanics of different strokes.  You say this as though keeping oneself up is a task distinct from attempting a stroke for us nonfloaters.  ,RagenChastain,dd0d71j,5,t5_323a3

For instance you would have to run  football fields to burn off just two handfuls of potato chips or do the wave  times to burn off  Buffalo Wild Wings Dipped In Ranch Dressing.Unless I am blind she made that Shit up for her blog.

10748276,0,t1_ddj8swd,Conscious thought is difficult working with shorthand reflexes is easier. All marketing does is put these reflexes into your brain so that you have to deprogram yourself to think properly.Its the same literally for everything in life. Whoever convinced us that choosing to live  miles from our workplace and taking an SUV back and forth every single day was the rational choice is the same person who makes sure that we buy supersize meals for their value because more is always better. And that we can save by buying a bunch of crap we dont need on Black Friday. These are reflexes bored into our very being.
