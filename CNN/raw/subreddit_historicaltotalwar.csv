11613329,0,t1_dg8j5cq,Thank you for the pointers! I looked at what you said about your Sweden campaign. A similar situation happened to me but instead of France mine was Holland. I was able to take Amsterdam and destroy the UP but it seems that every protestant nation was either allied or in trade with the UP because everyone is hostile towards me now. I did however use the destruction of the UP to attack their colonial holdings in India. There I was able to destroy Mysore attack the Mughal Empire while simultaneously surrounding the Maratha Confed. I used the new money from India to finance a hot war between the United States and Mexico. While the soldiers were away I invaded Mexico and took Texas and New Mexico.,historicaltotalwar,dgcdpun,1,t5_3js8m
