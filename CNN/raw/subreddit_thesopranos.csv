622537,0,t3_219vh8,Maybe Im remembering it wrong but I felt like AJ really didnt like hanging out with those frat kids. He resented only be liked becuase of who his dad was and was noticeably disturbed by their attack on the black kid who hit the car with his bike. Theres also the whole storyline about him trying to take out junior but failing and Tony tells him that hes not cut out for that sort of life which I think he clearly isnt. Another example would be how instead of fighting the noisy neighbors of his girlfriend he just gives them his bike instead as a bribe. I think it shows how he does not like violence at all I think as a result of him not liking his time spent with the frat guys. So I think your read on how AJ would fall into the mafia would be probably wrong. ,thesopranos,cgb1764,6,t5_2sd3j

2104291,0,t3_2j04a5,Everytime this question is asked I have different answers. Here are the episodes I love the most at the moment The final act of season   The Test Dream Long Term Parking and All Due Respect. All of them brilliant. Great storytelling. A complete culmination of everything that had come before. The Adriana arc the Tony B. arc the New York arc all wrapped up in immensely satisfying yet disturbing and heartbreaking ways.  I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano  This episode raised expectations for all following season finales and contains many of the best TV scenes of all time.  Funhouse  Great dream sequences humor and the final act of this episode is just amazing. Pussys death scene and the final montage set to The Rolling Stones Thru and Thru are just brilliantly done.  Mr. Ruggerios Neighborhood  An episode where very little happens but contains some just phenomenal filmmaking. The music in this episode particularly is fantastic.  Amour Fou  Jackie Jr.s arc wasnt the most interesting thing that the show ever did but it all really pays off in this episode as the kid royally fucks himself up the ass in the worst ways possible. Plus that scene with Patsy and Gloria Trillo.  College  This is the episode where everything clicked for David Chase and crew. This is the first episode where they try to experiment with the structure of the show and it works so fucking well. Two plots both given nearly the same importance both very interesting characterbased stories.  Whitecaps  Edie Falco is amazing. What more is there to say? This is Edies best episode and she was always fantastic. This is where everything crumbles apart for Tony and Carmela. The fight scenes are so tense so uncomfortable. Its like watching a real marriage fall apart before your very eyes and the episode heavily implies that at any second Tony could have snapped and hit or maybe even killed Carmela. And then the ending with the Dean Martin song playing from the boat. Just brilliant. ,thesopranos,cl7audg,12,t5_2sd3j

Phil after just being in prison for  years having to eat shit from both Johnny and Tony decides enough is enough. He becomes boss and wants Tony gone. The main reason they all turned on Phil is because Tony had not been killed only his management therefore they saw an opening. The show gives an unrealistic view of the Jersey faction as if they are of some importance to New York. Everything changed when Phil was reminded by little Carmine about his brother being killed. Remember? nothing to do with anything you just said except maybe youre right about Butchie then again he could have just seen an opening and wanted to take it.

4396392,0,t1_cqdo34l,Im running through a few of my Sopranos DVDs and wanted to discuss this absolutely astonishing show this is my rd run through since the finale in . I have to admit I fully disagree with most of the longer diatribe regarding AJs character. Somehow this lazy conniving unintelligent disrespectful mean incapable of empathy or sympathetic emotions and ultimately  selfcentered character has gained somehow sympathy by some of the audience. Look I understand as someone pointed out earlier that symbolically AJs character along w Meadow is basically the reflection of Tony Soprano. However I also believe as the show points out time amp time again that the day to day operations and every mobfamilies ultimate goal money amp power is not much different than the ultimate aspirations of amp how the average midto large industrial corporation runs its operations day to day. If that is also the case then Tony Soprano can at times be looked upon as a businessman. So where does that leave a large chunk of AJs crappy attitude originating from?   It comes from trading time spent with your kids for money spent on your kids. This very much so helps to explain the spoiled amp holier than thou attitude this character portrays. Lets not forget AJ isnt the sharpest knife in the kitchen Meadow occupies that role which is also why it doesnt even dawn on him about his families reality what poppa truly does for a living until Meadow shows him a thing or two on the internet. Then the next real focus scene regarding AJs very slow growing awareness of just how different his family is from most when they are at Uncle Jackies funeral and he is watching his father being greeted with respect along with Uncle Jrs attention as new Boss of northern New Jersey. BUT... and Im sorry if this sounds harsh the AJ character was simply too stupid to really know even after his own sister tells him and his experience  the funeral. So what we are left with is a more typical than not even if its gangster lead family who has spoiled to absolute death their youngest babyboy. I feel as if the AJ character is a good representation of the socalled millennials generation and its quite possible that the directorproducerwriters wanted to show that angle as well. The bottom line is that rich parents due to the nature of money amp constantly chasing it  their kids if children are involved honestly can suffer the most because of it. You have two kids amp each is very manipulative meadow is sly as a fox amp very intelligent  remember the punishment for the party at Grandmas house that Meadow insisted was not her fault? but one uses that trait to excel in school amp the other used it as a means to act as a monster. How does that fact in relation to symbolism bear any trace to Tonys lifestyle? Because there is a light amp dark side to all mobsters? gt so you have  kids    doing awesome while the other cant do much worse? Eh I dont buy that explanation at all. I see a different conflict where Tony NEVER shows AJ the real family business. The reason he doesnt lies within this allpowerfull mobster who instead of bearing a son who could be the strong silent type and take over after Tonys time was up he has helped to create something he himself does not recognize a total punk for a child who is truly worthless amp horribly weak. These stresses weigh in on Tony in later seasons. AJs character at times has made me wanna throw a brick at my screen .. that kid is just awful. Well anyway my two cents... and great thread only one like it specifically about disliking AJs character that I could find on the net  very cool amp thanks for having it!      |,thesopranos,csl7isa,1,t5_2sd3j

Like you say its left ambiguous but I lean toward yes the supernatural does exist in the show. It wouldve been nearly impossible for that psychic to know all that about Paulie and as far as I remember Tony doesnt even see the Pussy apparition so it probably isnt his imagination.Also I think Ive heard that the whole Kevin Finnerty thing wasnt meant to be a dream but then I also heard he may have gotten some of those Eastern ideas from watching kungfu movies as a kid..so I dont know. I also almost get the feeling sometimes that something like God may have left the I go about in pity for myself note in Tonys hospital room or maybe it was ghost Livia in her Buddhaform lol.If I had to guess though Id say the sortof quantum woo ideas discussed in Fleshy Part of the Thigh might come closest to the shows official stance.,thesopranos,ct2b62a,11,t5_2sd3j

5285164,0,t3_3ne15k,I think hes implying that to kill a made man something that should rarely ever happen and even when it does only after careful thought and the counsel of others over something as trivial as an animals life to mafiosos at least would be unacceptable and the sign of a Boss whos losing touch with the principles of the oath they took. Not to mention it would be foolish to kill a high earner thus losing revenue and possibly drawing more police attention to an already pressured family considering how hard the feds started to push Adrianna even if it wasnt yet known at that point that she was slowly flipping.But overall like I stated in the first part of my post made men are supposed to be just that Made for life untouchable. A made man operates under the assumption that he is protected by the family and that no harm should come to him no matter how grievous his transgressions are. As for Silvio I think that if the Boss absolutely had to go the consigliere should be the one to do it considering his close relationship with the boss and station in the family. Regarding Silvio knowing about Ralph and the consequences that would come from that? I honestly dont know what Silvio would have done with that information. While he is a man of strict values and principles Silvio had a close bond with Tony and Im not sure if his first reaction would have been to whack Tony even if he was obligated to do so.,thesopranos,cvn8pc9,4,t5_2sd3j

Even though it was unwarranted and against their rules he pretty much did them a favor and it was even after they had already decided to kill him.I think his unraveling came as you said at the end of the final season.

6389092,0,t1_czftu9b,Id have to agree here. Paulie verged on switching sides into New York by telling Johnny about the Ginnie fat joke but was turned off when he realized Johnny Sac played him and Carmine had no idea who he even was. That said Id imagine Paulie tries to get tight with the New York families and gets duped or even killed and New York finally divides up New Jersey as they had always planned to. I could also see Meadow sliding into the family because they drop little hints that she is very similar to her father  conniving vengeful smart and manipulative but without his mental instability. I always thought that could be interesting. She has to stop whining all the time though and you did catch glimpses of her toughening up toward the end.

On that youre right problem is Tony was pretty disrespectful of Richie and it showed quite prominently. Richie had pride and there was only so far Tony couldve pushed that.Its actually a recurring theme Tony testing the limits of his own men to see how far he can humiliate and push their pride before they snap.

I always thought Tonys dialogue there was a little too on the nose and that the hollowblubber was laid on much thicker than usual the line about helping sick babies and God bless the people trying to help AJ. For a show that almost never felt artificial in its dialogue the scene feels a lot less egregious if we interpret it as being experienced through the lens of Melfis current disgust for him....If that makes sense.,thesopranos,d4y9heo,2,t5_2sd3j

8888654,0,t1_d7g64yw,The thing I love most about the use of music in The Sopranos besides the fact that the songs are always perfect is that they take the time to line up the emotional peaks of the songs with the peaks of the cinematography. When the strings peak in that song Tony sees the guy in his car mirror ready to pull out a gun then the orange juice bottle explodes. Then when he manages to get in the car the music abruptly cuts and its dead silent except for the sounds of Tony struggling until he crashes.In other shows they just pick cool songs then assume that theyll dictate the pacing of the cinematography but in The Sopranos they actually line up the music basically beat by beat. The beginning of season  is another great example. The strings hit their peak when Tony is coming home from a goomar and it makes it even more melodramatic. All the dialogue of the lyrics connects to the characters and the transitions are very carefully picked to fit the scenes.,thesopranos,d7gagu5,3,t5_2sd3j

9385120,0,t3_593hz9,I think youve got something here.  Tony rebuffs Valentina at first by telling her he already took Ralphs horse and it would be really pushing things to take his girlfriend too.  Then when Ralphie finds out Tony indeed took his girlfriend perhaps he exacts his revenge by taking back the horse in a manner of speaking  converting it to insurance money with the fire.  Of course many of us are aware that Joe Pantoliano says he played the climactic confrontation in Ralphs kitchen as though he hadnt started the fire.  But this is a good counterpoint to that perspective.,thesopranos,d95mokq,5,t5_2sd3j

9822198,0,t1_dantlbr,Thats a really good observation and I definitely agree. There were a lot of times that they made Walter out to have nearly superhuman luck and nearly superhuman intelligence. The getting out of this pickle is definitely something that happened to him a lot but I think they did it in a great way. They never skated over details. There was always a ton of plot development involved and it was HUGELY unpredictable. I remember people in the Breaking Bad subreddit trying to predict the last season and every week all the posts were so vastly wrong and off point until there were only a couple episodes left. I agree that they definitely stretched reality when creating Walter White but I have to give them credit for the plot development and sheer creativity of it. I think the reason Walter was so likable was because of his starting point. He was a great guy great dad great teacher and he just seemed to catch a bad break. He really seemed to care for Jesse at the beginning. He was entirely relatable from the start and by the time he turned into a monster a lot of people myself included were too invested in rooting for his success. When I rewatched the series a year later only then did I realize how monstrous he really was. Also a good instance of his vulnerability and Brian Cranstons amazing acting was the Crawl Space scene when he realized his money was gone. Im literally getting shivers writing about it now. And what I meant with the subtlety of the writing was just the absurd foreshadowing and plot continuity. For instance all the times JesseJaneWalter talked about people vomiting on their sleep not waking up dying in their sleep etc. and then boom Walter passively kills Jesses girlfriendlets her overdose. Or the pink bear that appeared in dozens of episodes more than a season prior to the plane crash. Even the color of the clothes the characters wear develop over time to match the plot development. My favorite instance of foreshadowing was when Walter was sitting in that bar in New Hampshire before heading back to Albuquerque one more time. In the background is a game from the s in which the Wisconsin Badgers hockey team made a very improbable comeback and won the game. Later in that episode Badger the character makes a return and proves to be hugely useful to Walter when hes forcing Elliot to give the money to Walt Jr. There are definitely a lot of examples like this that I cant think of but I was thoroughly impressed by these things. ,thesopranos,danuosw,1,t5_2sd3j

10878871,0,t3_5vfqds,Just to expand on this episode and how its always brought up about the supernatural in it I decided to rewatch it.  The three parts that are always mentioned   Pussys ghost in the mirror  which isnt arguable.   The man on the stairs  still a debate.   The young kid???  doing a strange walk around Livias burial plot  This is still very confusing and the main part I wanted to rewatch.Heres what I noticed Right before what appears to be a young kid dressed in street clothes doing a strange looking walk around Livias burial plot theres a close up of Tony and you can see Cheech behind him and then behind his left shoulder you can see a deadringer for Uncle Junior or possibly young Uncle Junior.  Then when it goes to the wide shot for all of a second or two you see that young guy doing the goofy walk around Livias plot and the Uncle Junior lookalike is not behind Tonys shoulder anymore and nowhere on screen at all.  While Uncle Junior himself is off to Tonys left down the line and clearly visible in his fedora and glasses.  The guy who I think was the Uncle Junior lookalike is seen walking off screen a few seconds later while Paulie is sucking up to Tony to tell him what a great service it was so that ruled out any possibility of him being a ghost I assume.  But it is strange as hes dressed very similar to Uncle Junior with the fedora and thick glasses.  It also made me think this same actorextra was the man on the stairs.  So all and all I couldnt figure out any kind of meaning for the person walking around Livias plot.  I dont really want to believe it was a continuity error of sorts and Chase just left it in.  Nor do I want to believe the man on the stairs was unintentional and just an extra wandering a bit at the wrong time.  The one at the grave is the confusing one as it looks like a younger guy dressed in street clothes kind of tiptoeing around Livias plot.  But this wide shot does come right after a close up on the wreath saying Beloved mother.  So perhaps it does have some kind of meaning?  Argument against  Nancy Merchant did die unexpectedly going into S.  Perhaps Chase did just kind of throw this episode together and not worry about little filming errors like these?  But the presence of Pussy kind of throws a wrench into that.  Chase was devious enough to sneak in that ghostly moment of Pussy and Tony even reacts to it.  So whos to say the other aspects werent cleverly planted to be some manner of ghosts?,thesopranos,de22tpo,5,t5_2sd3j

11499049,0,t3_642gph,Oh boy... you asked so here we go Richie talking to Ally Boy about whacking Tony. The scene is just great and hilarious not just because of Alberts parroting. Richie was so confident about his ability to draw people to his side and not even a minute after the conversation started Albert got the high ground. Its oddly satisfying seeing an old experienced guy like Richie getting beaten by a much younger man.  Kudos to Alberts balls not many guys would dare to mock Richie Aprile like that and walk away unscathed.  And Richies facial expressions throughout the scene are gold its so obvious that he isnt sure what the fucks up with Albert. But hey Junior warned him about that slippery fuck didnt he? Brendans execution by Mikey backed by the angelic singing of Meadows choir. Always loved that scene because of the violence combined with the Irish lullaby. Sleep my child let peace attend thee all through the night raises gun Hijack bye Jack! The irony in the lyrics perfect. And of course its a nice hint at the Godfather baptism scene.  Tony asking I mean... dont you love me? And then Junior tearing up. Pussy and Paulie comforting Ade in the hospital when Chris is in critical condition. Junior singing at Jackie Jr.s funeral beautiful. After Livias death when Tony watches Public Enemy and tears up at seeing a loving mother care for her gangster son. Johnny Sac at his daughters wedding. Dancing with her and singing Daddys little girl for her. All of Tony Bs jokes. The party in Marco Polo. Sils dream about Pussy where someone stole cheese from a strippers handbag. The lunch scene with Gigi and Patsy. Gigi seemed genuinely concerned with Patsys grief and felt clearly guilty about what he had done. Also the scene where Patsy pissed in Tonys pool. Gloria being threatened by Patsy who then drives home like the loving husband he is picking up groceries on the way. Almost all scenes at the construction site especially the one where Little Paulie gets glassed. Most of the Little Paulie scenes are either pure comedy or otherwise entertaining to watch. Even if its something as small as him cheating during a pool game while his unclecousin is at the phone. The dream sequences in Funhouse. I am pretty sure the creaking sound Tony hears equals flatulence in real life. Pussy as Santa Clause. Ralphies whacking. When Tony scolds his Capos for not earning enough. Its cringe inducing how he behaves around the guys. Coco losing his teeth Tonys look at Butchie before he kicks Cocos neck is chilling. Chrissy and Albert killing Dino then the car pulls up with a cursing and screaming Furio. Back when he was still a badass and not Carmelas crush. Bobby holding his daughter after killing his first man while This Magic Moment plays. When Johnny Sac finds his wife munching chocolate in the basement and screams at her while she has no idea what hed almost done for her honour. The hilariously failed intervention for Chris. Paulie and the psychic. Sil brooding over missing the Columbus Day protests and just not stopping to talk about his opinion on the matter. And Gary Cooper was gay?! NOO! When Agent Harris says We might win this thing! showing the sympathy he felt for Tony in the end. The movie investors talking about horror movies and Larry Boys comment about how boring film making really is.TLDR Its the greatest fucking show ever how am I supposed to pick just one favourite moment?,thesopranos,dfzf0si,15,t5_2sd3j
