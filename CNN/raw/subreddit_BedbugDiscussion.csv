2992057,0,t1_co83ysh,You are not overreacting you are taking precautions.  Part of the feeling of anxiety you have is that you feel helpless and not in control.  When I found my infestation I thought the only way to get rid of them was to tent the house and throw away everything.  That is not the case.  You are doing everything right.  Be on the lookout for the signs.  Blood spots on the sheets and black spots along the seams of the mattress and boxspring.  See your doc if the anxiety starts to get the best of you.  I lost  pounds in less than  weeks and hardly ate.  Ended up in the ER with severe anxiety.  I didnt know it at the time but I actually had control of the situation by having an exterminator who used sprays and steam to get rid of them.  I hate not having control and thats why I had so much anxiety.You are taking control so try to let go of some of that anxiety.  Keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. ,BedbugDiscussion,co84hth,1,t5_33ymp
