9173911,1,t1_d8es8qw,There are aliens that can destroy entire planets just by pounding the ground with a staff. The earth needs more Luke Cages. They need a million Luke Cages.When nuclear weapons already exist and those could blanket the whole world within  hours and kill everyone in existence the argument that Luke Cages could invade countries has already nuked the fridge.The argument youre making could be applied to almost any scientific research in human history. Chemical warfare developed from Japanese data dynamite nuclear fission etc all of which is already more effective than an army of Luke Cages at killing people.There are loads more potent methods of destruction that already exist both in reality and in the MCU. A largely defensive change like Luke Cages mutation does far more good than bad.Im not buying the whole some things should never be invented angle Marvel is pushing here. Its very scientifically backwards.,lukecage,d8ev040,0,t5_2z3l1
