2128931,0,t1_clac3wb,Thanks for the analogy pal. Theres obviously a lot of skill involved and I dont expect to produce something that will match the work of arguably the best motion design studio on the planet. I want to understand their process so I can learn from it.After Effects was certainly used but I would be very surprised if the bulk of the wave animation was done in AE it was likely made in Flash. If the waves were done in After Effects using shapes or masked solids or something I would really like to know their technique.If the cel animation was indeed made in Flash then I definitely want to be more comfortable in that program. Hence the tutorial request. Most Flash animation tutorials Ive found are garbage.,motiongraphics,clafmqh,3,t5_2qi3l

5498636,0,t3_3ntl6a,How was that very first sequence done? Im talking about the frame by frame spiral bit. Is that a plugin or is it hand animated?,motiongraphics,cwei414,1,t5_2qi3l
5520780,0,t3_3qppi7,Not sure if you want a critique heres one anyway.This needs work.  Im not a huge fan of the low poly movement but if thats the intended look I wont argue against it.  Message and Legibility  Make sure you can read everything on the screen especially by the time everything settles.  Right now it looks like it reads reative not creative.  The pen tube and cone? on the side feels really unnecessary as does the Studios script font.  I think with this version its a little too much to put all the verbage Corporate Identity and Branding and etc etc.  Full service agencies and production companies dont even use a tag line that long.  Keep it simple.Motion  The background is very static and flat try to move the camera a little in D space.  The floating dots do not react to the incoming text in anyway not sure what the floating dots are supposed to do or represent.  Moving the Pixilx letters down one at a time or having them animated like they are attached to those strings independently would help.  When the creative flies in it just floats in on a straight line.  Maybe have it fly in from the side and ease out as it lands.  Or you could use the negative space boolean object Im guessing to wipe on the letters on.  The write on effect doesnt seem to match what the pen is doing as well.  The overall pacing is way too slow...which brings me to...Music  If this music is your only choice cut it way down.  You could have something less emotional for such colorful and fun design.  Something fun and light would be dictated by the rainbow of colors and shapes you have going.Edit  An ID like this should never be over  seconds usually .  You could time ramp this in Final Cutor Premiere or Avid and it would be much more compelling again with new music.  If you are going to do write on animation like studios its much easier to do it in After Effects.Final Thoughts  It looks like you put a lot of work into this.  I hope you take my opinion seriously and not as an attack on what you are doing.  There is a lot of good work out there to pull from and tutorials galore online.  One piece of advice I got years ago  Love the work you do but dont fall in love with the work itself.  I know its hard to be objective but its so important to improving as an artist.Best of luck!AnvilDesign,motiongraphics,cwhbvj3,2,t5_2qi3l
