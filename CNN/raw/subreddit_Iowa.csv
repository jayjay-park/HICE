What specific corruption are we talking about?  Hes on the judiciary committee was there some specific corrupt policy there or on one of the dozens of comittees hes been on over his  some odd years as senator?

908473,0,t1_ch79xf9,The article didnt really say but from the previous postsarticles regarding this bill I believe it is Cannabis oil high in CBDs the main non psychoactive ingredient that helps with numerous ailments and not THC the main psychoactive ingredient. One of the problems with the bill that I see is that selling cannabaloids is still illegal in Iowa. So the families would have to either get the oil from ColoradoWashington and bring it through the connecting states which would be Illegal because its obviously illegal there as well or have it delivered which I think is Illegal in Iowa to have drug paraphernalia or the drug itself delivered.  But I am not aware of what the changes to the bill are that the article mentioned. I think from a previous article when the bill initially passed in the house I believe it mentioned something about allowing testing to be done for further research? Im not  sure or even  but Ive might have read that for another state.Edit Yep it was from another article that I read. So Im still not sure what the changes are. ,Iowa,ch7js1v,2,t5_2qn1h

2279538,0,t3_2lc760,Well here come downvotes. You guys are more embarrassing to me than you guys are of those who were elected tonight. Our state is wonderfully diverse. We have some of the most hard core conservatives and liberals in the nation. We have farmers and we have lawyers. No matter what your political affiliation or profession is we are all Iowans. Ive seen in some comments around here in the past that quite a few people think that Iowa is great politically because we have a lot of good moderate people. And our state takes pride in being intelligent levelheaded people. But this sub is just embarrassing tonight. People saying that farmers should die because a republican was elected senator? Because quite a few positions have elected republicans now? Under no circumstances would I wish anything bad on anyone especially in my home state. I take pride in being an Iowan. I understand that apparently everyone on this sub is disappointed in the Democratic Party tonight. But good lord dont wish natural disasters in the good hard working people that provide for not only the residents of our state but throughout the nation and world. We live in the farming capital of the world. No one can really dispute that. Our state alone produces more corn than the entire country of Mexico. Our state is literally dependent on the agricultural economy. And just like every other state agricultural areas tend to lean right. So when the majority votes republican dont tear the others apart because you didnt get what you want. Today the democrats didnt show up. WHO said that according to their numbers Dems who are normally really good at coming out and voting just didnt show up. Dont be mad at republicans be mad at your peers. Approval numbers for congress and for the presidency are very low right now. Most people would vote for the other party or a different candidate to attempt to get those who are disappointing out of office. When that happens those who did that are wrong and incompetent fools.

Regardless of political leanings Id be much more upset if I was socially liberal and my candidates continue to chicken out over social issues.  For all the anti gay or abortion bills that conservative politicians put forth why dont liberals propose bills to officially make them law?  If the culture war has been won by liberals as an earlier poster mentioned then it should be easy to pass a bill that spells out the legality of gay marriage.  Instead they are content to hide behind a court ruling while leaving the state law as officially not recognizing same sex marriage.  Its disgraceful.

And the vagueness argument has been raised before with the Iowa Court of appeals rulingA statute may be unconstitutionally vague if it authorizes or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Anspach  N.W.d at . Gear argues the vagueness of the statute is even more troubling because it provides no guidance for police officers to determine at what point a person is intoxicated. Although the statute does not reference an explicit objectively measurable standard for intoxication such as the . blood alcohol concentration used in section J. describing operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated we do not agree the language of section . that applies to Gears case encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. We conclude the statute provides sufficient guidance to law enforcement personnel so that they can understand what conduct is prohibited and does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.State v.

6033890,0,t1_cyaf4qm,..and yet you have no problem telling us why tuition is skyrocketing. Especially considering one of the people you were talking to literally dealt with college budgets. Did it ever occur to you the things you believe you believe because they are convenient to your presupposed political opinions not and because they were true or actually corresponded to reality in anyway? They increase the availability of school loans based on the rise in tuition because if they didnt significantly less people would be able to afford college. On the other hand tuition increases based on a wide variety of factors. Youre arguing that the tail is wagging the dog essentially. Decreasing loan availability wont necessarily drive down tuition hikes they may increase tuition to make for lost revenue or decrease services but it definitely prevent many people from getting a better education that they would have gotten otherwise. I dont think you even know what interests your policy suggestions serve.I think you just have bought into them because you read them on some Libertarian blog somewhere and decided you had the solution to all higher educations problems.

Tact and diplomacy are keys to being leader of a diverse nation and are fundamental components of politics.  We live in a global society.  I like how you think I support Bernie.  Bernie Sanders is also unqualified to lead America and his plans would ruin us financially.  Donald Trump continues to drive a wedge between Americans and is less qualified that Barrack Obama ever was remember when the GOP crucified him for his lack of experience?.  You can be hostile toward me but that wont change my opinion of him.  He has done less than Sanders Clinton Cruz Rubio or any other candidate to prove he is worthy of my vote.  He is a buffoon an embarrassment to this country and is disgusting.  He is a glorified Nazi and is a borderline democrat.  He is a RINO.  Show me some substance and stop being hostile...

6609033,0,t3_463re4,Eh. All of this speculation of which I am admittedly a part is kind of pointless until Obama actually nominates someone. In my mind continuing to fret over an obstruction is just playing into the hands of the Republicans for whom it just gives more airtime and legitimizes the stance. Even if they dont actually go through with it it allowed and continues to allow them to make the first move by changing the expectations that we might otherwise have for an Obama appointee.In fact more likely the best outcome in this situation would be to faint towards blocking the nominee as they have done in order to shift the presidents nominee rightward then to eventually relent and allow a vote or even approve the nominee. Theres no guarantee the Republican nominee will win in November and putting all of your chips on that option is just asking to lose it particularly considering the damage they could do to themselves by going through with a filibuster.Ach.

10804128,0,t1_ddu278r,Well yes and no. The vocal majority being against it doesnt mean the actual majority is against it. Union membership has been shrinking for  years after all. Also some individual politicians can vote outside of their party lines in some cases but if a politician doesnt agree on the basic ideals of a party then they arent allowed to run for office as a member of that party see political conventions. Republicans are antiunion as a rule. Its literally one of the few ideals they were founded on. Its not like abortion or gay marriage.

10814202,0,t1_ddvdn9c,But what are Minnesota school districts doing for their teachers for benefits? Any benefits that are included when working in Minnesota as a teacher could easily offset the differences in cost of living. And there are plenty of areas in Minnesota that are smaller and have very reasonable cost of living.Aside from any of that it does not matter if the primary reason for leaving Iowa is to move to a state where you no longer have to worry about having some of your pay and benefits cut out from underneath you with nothing you can do about it.

10817950,0,t1_ddvguzn,Which is human nature and interestingly supports my point.  People vote against their interests often.  Not because theyre stupid since I got attacked for believing it even though I never said it but because their immediate interests may be different than their long term interests.  Again I never said anyone is stupid but I will say people do not always act rationally.  Tax cuts now are in my best interest today obviously.  But also having an educated populace  years from now that can help keep unemployment crime and unwanted pregnancy low is also in my interest as well.  Politics was once about finding a way to balance present interests of the individual with the long term interests of a society.  Now it has become a partisan Im right fuck you bickering match.Are labor unions for public employees required to educate people?  Probably not.
