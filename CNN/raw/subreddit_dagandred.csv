9961652,0,t1_db5t96a,When I was in college all of my football soccer team mates were Arsenal fans. I started following Tottenham at that time but also picked up following Dagenham and Redbridge as I really enjoyed the name and playing with them on FIFA haha. That in turn grew to a full grown fandom throughout the years. There is a local team for me to follow its an amateur team however that only plays in the summertime. MLS teams are on TV less than Premier league. I can watch any Premier League match on television. Following the local team doesnt lead much of anywhere. There is NO promotion and relegation in ANY sport here in America. The MLS teams will always be MLS teams and the only hope I could ever have of a local team playing in our top flight is a wealthy businessman starting a new club pay the MLS to let in an expansion club. The idea that every match matters throughout the English football pyramid has always invigorated me and it gives the fans something to rally behind. I dont follow MLS closely like I do Premier League.,dagandred,db6127h,2,t5_3fvcz
