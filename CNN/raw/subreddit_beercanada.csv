2807617,0,t1_cnn6jhd,Ashton is unfortunately not a top notch poutine experience of Quebec. The meal by itself is pretty standard usually French fries cheese curds and brown gravy. Its absolutely delicious. The particular cheese cannot really be found outside of the province of Quebec. You can also add different toppings like onions sausages bacon etc. I really like smoked meat.It usually looks like this ,beercanada,cnn7ucz,1,t5_2tqqt

3550140,0,t1_cpwfhp7,Their sour and barrel aging program is top notch.  They were one of the first here in BC to really have a consistent sour beer release with their Bird of Prey series.  Theyve also been using fresh american and french oak which is something not too many breweries are doing.  I think their overall quality is quite high and their regular line up good.  Kind of like Lagunitas.  The sour and special releases is where Driftwood really shines.  ,beercanada,cpwxtdv,3,t5_2tqqt

4402671,0,t1_cslws8k,I wish they were still doing oneoff beers just for the growler bar. Now theyre releasing seasonals that also go to the growler bar. I love the guys at Ft Garry but the Saskatoon tasted like burnt plastic with some sort of fruit flavouring to it. I have a can of the maple waiting but might not drink it for a few days still. I really enjoyed their coconut stout at Flatlanders easily one of their bests,beercanada,cslwzan,1,t5_2tqqt
