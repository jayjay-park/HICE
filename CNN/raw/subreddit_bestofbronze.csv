96982,0,t1_cdvwq8l,Im not you can disagree tho. Im far from trolling Im too old to waste time like this. Riot would never do that but itd be good solution. I dont know if you have ever used Steam for a little longer but you should definiately try and then youll understand what Im saying. Obvious reason is money unfortunately. And Riot bad policy they try to alienate their game. Its like go f..k yourselves gamers play lol or nothing. I suggest reading about major stationary multigaming tournaments that couldnt include a few games because Riot didnt let organizers do that. They are trying to take advantage of temporary leading role in egaming. But Im sure they will fall with that monopoly policy. Im not happy about it but itll happen.,bestofbronze,cepgyz3,1,t5_2wtws

192162,0,t3_1wa2ui,Im  positive that there is a bug where projectiles go straight through a champion but deal no damage at the moment. I main varus and have played him an absolute shit ton the last  months and both my friends and I have commented on my Qs seeming to pass directly through enemy champions without doing any damage.

530709,0,t1_cg0lddb,Honestly if I were that Vi Id be a little bit afraid of that Draven. Entirely because Vi has hardly any armor built. GA wouldnt help Draven much against Vis armor shred but that extra damage against a Vi with no defenses really hurts.Once Vi gets her Randuins which it looks like shes going for with cloth armor and giants belt Id be much more confident in her ability to v the Draven.,bestofbronze,cg0lk7a,1,t5_2wtws

Thats not even the main problem though...Thresh autoed Jinx twice during the whole fight and not at all until had already Flayed positioned to cut off her escape while not attacking at all but then hooked her back toward them?  What was she going to do escape through the minion wave into the jungle?  If he had attacked at all in the  opportunities he had to do so earlier e looking back he did have a ward he could have thrown into the bush Jinx ran into maybe the Flay chargeup damage would have been enough to secure the kill...to speak nothing of the tower dive.,bestofbronze,ch0zb91,1,t5_2wtws

2490883,0,t1_cm855id,Rakas isnt that far off tbh. SV increases self healing and such so her q would be quite powerful in v or a team fight I personally build it on ARAMs for her if we are lacking tankiness. Zekes makes sense for a lower elo builder on support with the do it for the squad mentality. I can only assume the vamp was going to turn into the essence reaver for mana restore so them naners would be filled with proteins! ,bestofbronze,cmjp39u,1,t5_2wtws
