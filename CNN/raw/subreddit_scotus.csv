While Justice Scalia did bring up Article IV Section  does the second sentence And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof. not give Congress the ability to determine the effect thereof even going so far as to say that the record has no effect?

But lets assume that it is.Im not sure that the fact that something is optimal necessarily means we should do it because optimal means different things to different people. We might optimize the health of the population if we allowed the government to snatch carefully selected healthy people off the street and distribute their organs to sick people or contrariwise if we just killed off all the sick people but in both cases are we to give no input at all into fundamental policy questions of whether treating people in a certain way is acceptable at all?,scotus,d0bzjs3,1,t5_2rfsw

My argument is that the Senate must vote one way or the other.  They cant just sit on a Presidential appointment and refuse to vote on it one way or the other as a means of blocking the appointment indefinitely.The Senate is free to vote down Merrick Garlands appointment.

7297800,0,t3_4fcj75,Pros  More transparency in the procedings of the court More familiarity with how such hearings work due to more accessability. More interest in procedings and therefore the judicial process in general.Cons Repressenting attorneys and justices may behave differently under the percieved and real incease in scrutiny. importance of oral arguments may become overblown in the public eye when written briefs and precedential case law may be far more relevant in practice. Sound bites will be taken out of context in order to push an agenda. From what little Ive heard of SCotUS justices durring oral arguments they are fond of devils advocate and reducto ad absurdum questions.Honestly not sure where to stand on the point. Transcripts are already available for the proceedings as far as I know but audio and video are easily manipulated and highly effective at giving false impressions of intent.,scotus,d27pkv6,4,t5_2rfsw

10320016,0,t3_5nrv2b,You can look into the challenges to FDRs executive orders that were successful at the SCOTUS as an example. More recent is the Clinton case Alexander v. Sandoval which was not a major case in terms of effect but which was a ruling on it.We couldve had a huge ruling on the Obama immigration orders but the Court divided  and wrote a short opinion saying the Texas courts ruling was affirmed by an equally divided court see here Hope that gets you started!,scotus,dcdtwmk,3,t5_2rfsw

11722423,0,t3_66kjvd,gtIm having a tough time finding any database or listingThats because as far as I can tell there isnt one. Furthermore understand that most constitutional challenges to laws of any sort i.e. executive action regulation statutory whether state or federal are usually what are known as asapplied challenges as opposed to facial challenges. The former takes the position that the law in question is unconstitutional asapplied to the challenger whether in general or just as its being enforced in the instant case. The latter takes the position that the law in question is unconstitutional on its face. A claimant successful in an asapplied challenge avoids the application of the law in its particular case but the degree to which that decision represents useful precedent for anyone else is an open question. The law remains in the books and can still be applied to partiessituations not substantially similar to the successful challenger. There may or may not actually be any such partiessituations so the number of other parties that might benefit from such a challenge can range from Almost certainly none to Quite possibly everybody. ,scotus,dgorm6z,2,t5_2rfsw
