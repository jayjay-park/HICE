673127,0,t3_21udht,Yes and no.You should be prepared and cosplay on a day where you dont have events planned. Youll get stopped for photos costumes can be uncomfortable etc. Its better to cosplay on a day where you arent rushing to get into panels.I spent my first SDCC in costume for two of the four days. I didnt really get to experience anything on those days. The second year I was in costume for one day. I got to enjoy the rest of the convention in civvies and not get stopped for photos.If you decide to cosplay plan it on a day where there arent a ton of panels you want to attend.

1562507,0,t3_2c2mmc,I noticed a lack of interactive exhibits inside Con this year. The years past there were booths you could walk through take pics in do cool little interactive stuff in. Im noticing that theyre focusing more on the stages or seating areas in the big booths to do celebrity signings. A few years back I did a video game demo and got a shirt for signing up and coming back at my allotted time and completing the demo. Theres a lack of awesome swag this year. I used to get multiple free shirts blow up swords awesome buttons or temporary tattoos or keychains. This year the coolest thing I got swag wise was that foam Sharknado chainsaw and a button from the cartoon network booth....and thats not saying much.The movieTV aspect of things has over run Con. Im a fan of a lot of those things too so I cant complain. But its also drawn a crowd that Im not really a fan of. I dont see as much awesome and detailed cosplay. Thats one of my favorite parts of Con is the awesome costumes people spend tons of time making. I still see it but its few and far between compared to years past that Ive attended.Hall H I dont even attempt. I could have tried in years past to get in and actually made it but this past few years its too much of a mad house. I just wait until the panels hit youtube the days after Con. The wristband system was a good theory but had poor execution from what my friends told me. It could have just been their experience though who knows.All of that being said I had a fucking blast this year. I made a game plan and wrote down what I wanted to do in the days before Con started. I wanted to see Joe Hill amp Gabriel Rodriguezs panel for Locke amp Key the most. It was a smaller room easier to get into and was totally worth it. I was in the second row and got to meet them briefly afterwards. I got to meet the cast of the walking dead but that was completely outside of the Con. I met them at their hotel. My bf got to meet Hideo Kojima in the same place and nearly shat himself. He was so happy to run into that guy. We had a blast because we planned our days out and had plans. I didnt get to do every signing I wanted to but I was okay with that because Id met some of those people in years prior. I got my exclusives and didnt have to pay for food inside the convention center. I made Con fun for myself. Its all about what you make it. ,comiccon,cjc4srl,2,t5_2qzn8

3541753,0,t1_cpvyjk8,Absolutely! I agree completely. And it will clear up those huge crowds that form around the Hall H area. There wont be the same crowd control issues and there wont be the same difficulties with maneuvering through and around the Hall H areas that we now have because crowds block the walkways. Ultimately it could be just like the autograph lotteries where you line up super early to enter the lottery find out later if you won a pass into the big HallBallroom then go there and line up for the opening of the room that day. This would solve about a thousand issues. CCI would have to issue the passestickets as a plastic security wrist band for the winners to prevent a black market resale of the pass to get into the Hall. It looks to me as if the future of handling such large crowds for SDCC is in lotteries. CCI has already moved the badge sale to a lottery the parking sale to a lottery and I DO think that the hotel sale should be a similar lottery at this point. I believe they will do it for hotels. If the autographs are a ticketed lottery the big halls could be too .... its no different. The random lotteries are the best possible system at SDCC to handle every aspect of the con and make it fair to all in a kind of general way. It hurts those of us who have experienced the SDCC of the past. It prevents us from having what we used to have and it prevents us from even getting in! So we are in pain now because we are dealing with the changes to something that meant so much to us. But lotteries are the future of SDCC and they are the smoothest system that CCI could use.,comiccon,cpvzdev,1,t5_2qzn8

4290577,0,t3_3a4kt3,If you Google where your staying and ask for directions to the con it will give you the option of alternative modes such as bus bike and walking. Select bus. From the heart of Kerney Mesa it looks like it will be about an hour commute via MTS. If your hotel is providing a shuttle you are using the cons shuttle it should be shorter because of less frequent stops.MTS is not bad and I would consider it safe. It will be . for an all day pass.

4354210,0,t1_csfps2b,This is a new post by the CCI people for SDCC that shows only SOME of the things available to do outside of SDCC. There is a ton of stuff more than this very small list including the miniconventions that are scattered around such as Nerd HQ which I highly recommend. I want you to see this to show you that a trip to San Diego which does seem difficult and a bit extreme can be an super fulfilling experience for both of you. There is SO MUCH to do and see and the atmosphere on the streets is incredible. But I am actually showing you this because this post is now the very first PROOF that the Game of Thrones Experience The Realms will be in SD for SDCC!!!!! There was a ton of speculation that it would not attend SDCC this year because the GoT Experience has been touring Europe so it was thought it might not be at SDCC for . I have missed it each year it was there and this year I HAVE TO GO!!! There are long lines for it but I will have days outside of SDCC so I will have time to wait. This is supposedly an incredible event with displays and Im sure you would totally enjoy it. When you show up as Jon Snow you will literally stop traffic. You will be unable to walk around because so many people will be stopping you and taking photos of you. As everyone has mentioned here your cosplay is excellent and you have nailed that expression! Other GoT cosplayers will be there and often whole groups of cosplayers are lined up and photographed together because of their theme. You will make friends at SDCC that you stay in touch with for years!!I know I keep nagging you about the possibility that you might come down to SD but like other people here have said to you you would look fantastic and you will definitely have a trip that is very packed with excitement of all types during your SDCC stay. When you look at this page you have to look all of the way to the bottom to even see that the GoT Experience is listed. And like I said I want both of you to realize how much is going on that you can see during the days of the con. This is a small fraction of what will be there.Follow this blog for detailed info of all types including lists of outside SDCC events and exhibits and displays and parties and alternative conventions   And here is the CCI post that I am telling you about   ,comiccon,csggagw,1,t5_2qzn8

4456133,0,t1_cssb8fd,So the way it works is you pick a ticket and if you win you then pick the session you want for the day.  So the popular ones are gone in about  minutes maybe a little more depending on how quick the line goes that day so have a few choices when you get in line. If you only have one you really really want be listening. They will announce when certain signing are gone.  I figure you get less than a hundred people per signing session since they need to be done in less than an hour.,comiccon,cssdlrp,2,t5_2qzn8
4464236,0,t1_cstbmma,gt  And lucky for me I only watch  tv shows I dont read comics and I have no desire to get anyones autographs or buy any exclusives. So this panel is my priorityIm sorry but why the fuck are you taking up an nerds badge for just this? This aside from all else is a primary reason that actual nerds and mega comic fans cant attend the con because people that are there superficially are snatching up the badges. I understand its an opportunity to see people you enjoy but you get no interaction with them. There are thousands of people out there dying for a badge so they can go to so much more of the con. On top of that comparing your kids huge church play to the  people daily at a con is a bit naive to think the same numerical system would work. Its not as simple as scaling up there is so much more that goes into it. Trust me if a system that simple would work they would have done it already. But it doesnt. Its just unrealistic in application on that scale. ,comiccon,cste880,1,t5_2qzn8

6356089,0,t1_czbwbzi,OK heres the deal for being forever uptodate with everything.The CCI website it the actual source for ALL INFO!!!!!     Everything!!!! And I mean EVERYTHING!!!!!!! will be posted here as they release the info and want to keep you informed. If it is not posted yet it means it is not time to know those things. The hotel info page is blank      The shuttle bus info page is blank     But look at how there is info for the general questions asked about purchasing badges        And they will always teach you EVERYTHING IN DETAIL!! Look at the page teaching people how to do the preregistration sale which took place  already last year. Its for people who attended that year. It offers a small advantage to attendees who have already gone. However it is starting to not offer too much of an advantage. But this is another story. If you study this you will be able to understand how the badge sale is held!   D    If you want check this website everyday during the busy times leading up to SDCC.  The Toucan Blog is a very important source of info also and it can be entertaining on its own  Once you have a Member ID AND you make sure you optin for receiving emails from CCI you will ALWAYS get official announcements regarding the badge sales. So will your mom dad friend and anyone else who has made a Member ID so that they can participate in the badge sale for you. So you wont miss the announcements I guarantee it. They will send everyone their unique code to log on to the waiting room for the sale. The important stuff like that is always emailed to each Member. For the hotels or shuttle bus schedules or other important info if I remember correctly it is up to us to stay informed. I forget if they DO send out an announcement for the big hotel sale or even the Early Bird sale. But they ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS put up posts that give everyone directions on how to do everything. Look at how detailed that page is for the badge registration sale!! So I want to make sure that you relax and understand that it is difficult to know all of the things now. They have to release and post the info. And they will ALWAYS instruct you in detail about ALL subjects.The next step in keeping informed is to immediately follow this blog      Sign up to receive their email newsletters NOW!!!!!! I cannot emphasize enough how important this blog is. The minute they see anything posted from CCI they instantly send you an email! You will NEVER miss any important processes EVER if you get there email articles. They also give their own very detailed instructions for all kinds of things  badge sales hotel sales places to eat events that take place outside of SDCC things to look for INSIDE SDCC .... everything!! You should see how much they teach you about the process for the hotel lottery sale. And they give excellent analysis and they do background research too. They even hold their own party every SDCC for their readers! .... but it costs a lot of money ....  c  This blog and their emails are vital. You will know every single thing as it happens. Sign up with them this second!   DAnd last in line is this subreddit!        It will get very much busier here when important things happen. Not only can you post your own questions and get help here but some people start threads which discuss important issues. What you will want to do is always check it every day and you will notice what other people are asking about or answering about and you will learn tons. The minute that CCI announces something extremely important like the Early Bird sale someone who finds out and has a minute will post it here. So there is literally no way that you can miss anything ever if you follow the blog or reddit.  DAlso to answer your question the Early Bird sale is NOT as hectic as the general hotel lottery sale ... Thank God!!! You will know by then if you DO have badges and want to travel to SDCC. If you have badges then it is always best to check the CCI site every day and very shortly after the badge sale they will post the Early Bird sale. You shop for a hotel room that you think you would like and buy it that first day. Or even the next day. It is more relaxed. You will log on by yourself or call the official phone number by yourself and buy your room. You do not need a set time and it is your choice not a lottery just like traveling to any place. But it IS wise to make your decision in the first couple of days so that you can lock into your favorite choice. The hotel rooms will go quickly but people buy the best rooms over the first week or so. If you want a little bit of insider opinion about some of the hotels you can ask here and see if anyone answers. I can also say a small number of things Ive heard if you want to PM me at that time. I am totally enjoying talking and sharing with you here. Not only do you learn everything blindingly fast but it sounds like you guys are truly taking your trip very seriously and you really want to come to SDCC and you really want to know the proper way to handle everything. It is always nice to help people who I can tell belong in the SDCC family. Thats why I have also recommended some of the other Cons for your future like the Seattle con or others. And I have a soft spot for Veterinary students and the Veterinarian community in general. Ive been involved with this field as well so I have an automatic appreciation of who you are and what youre going through.        Sometimes the help I give people here allows them to go on and know things and successfully do things that they might have struggled more with. Its my pleasure to help and get to know you.   ,comiccon,czc48mg,1,t5_2qzn8
6629052,0,t3_46gywg,Although threads about purchase groups will not be removed as they do not directly circumvent or break the rules of SDCCCCI the moderators of rcomiccon would like to stress caution when joining or participating in a purchase group.

7139907,0,t1_d1pinzy,I can confirm that you are correct. This is exactly the address I received my email from.I have had trouble with the earlier email from them that announced the hotel sale opening on April th. CCI might be having trouble with their computer systems. We used to receive their emails very reliably usually starting at the beginning of the  hour sendout period. It appears that something is wrong recently. Its super good that they are posting the link on the hotels page of their website.,comiccon,d1pqaz7,2,t5_2qzn8
7141260,0,t3_4dcuw4,I would say it is definitely worth it.  I live  hours away from San Diego via car.  I drove in for only Thursday and Sunday two years ago and will do the same thing again this year both times because that was all I could get badges for during registration.  It used to be that Thursday and Sunday were lighter days but that is not really the case anymore. I used to look forward to Sundays because the floor would be less crowded but anymore it seems like Sunday is just as crowded as Saturday.  So IMO Thursday and Sunday are every bit the day at Comic Con that Friday and Saturday are. The only downside is that Saturday typically has the most Cosplay and you cant attend the masquerade Saturday night which is one of my favorite parts of the con.  Here is what I did two years ago and what I will do this year I am guessing something similar could work out well for you tooWednesday  Arrive in San Diego and get settled in hotel.  Maybe hit the beach.Thursday  Attend SDCCFriday  Hit the beach probably on Coronado.  If you have never been the whole town island is great and only  mins from Sand Diego.  You can see Coronado island from the backside of the con and you could see the con from Cornado island as well.  You could always do something like Sea World or Lego Land also both are good  day excursions.Saturday  Outdoor SDCC events.  There is actually more to do outside than you could even do in a day and none of this requires a SDCC badge.  Last year I got shut out with no badges and I still drove in the  hours to San Digeo with my family got a hotel room and attended Saturday for just the outdoor activities.  And we had a blast!!Sunday  Attend SDCCEver since they started this new lottery system SDCC badges are extremely difficult to come by.  The SDCC blog approximated a  chance of getting badges in the general registration.  If you got some badges even if it is only Thursday and Sunday you are part of the lucky  .  Dont lose this opportunity it could be years before you get lucky again.  Go and have fun!! Another benefit is that if you go this year you will be able to participate in preregistration next year which significantly increases your chances.  Feel free to message me if you have any questions about how to make the most of this type of schedule or any other SDCC questions.,comiccon,d1pvv45,4,t5_2qzn8

7676134,0,t1_d3ep3eo,You are ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!!!!  tickets were given to the fansattendees of the Friday night event. Also the twitter info seems to indicate that extra tickets were given away to fans who could NOT get into the event in L.A.HOWEVER!!!! It also appears from what is being discussed that an allocation of  tickets is being reserved for SDCC attendees and those  tickets will be released to us somehow in the near future.I dont blame you for being confused and my weird title to the post doesnt help. But I cant know any more than what these people are talking about. Remember I am only the messenger.A lot of this DOES make sense because the area where there is the movie premiere will hold quite a number of people possibly several thousand. However if they put in folding chair seating it will hold MUCH LESS people than last years Star Wars concert event. That is because the  to  thousand people who were there for Star Wars were standing and packed in tightly together. For the movie the people might be seated using up some of that space. And remember that for both the Star Wars event but ESPECIALLY for the Star Trek movie premiere there are going to be media studio people their guests the cast their guests celebrities and their plus ones all types of people that get to attend world premieres of movies. So that takes up thousands of seats. But that could still leave lets say  seats for the fans of the Friday L.A. event AND the SDCC attendees who will hold tickets.It is starting to make sense how it will be presented. Its just that right now we know so little.,comiccon,d3eqbtk,0,t5_2qzn8

7973915,0,t1_d4atjgp,You are arguing this with one of the exact few people who have experience and education enough to refute everything youve said here. Some simple factsThe world is safer now than it has ever been in human history. You are more likely to get struck by lightning the day you win the lottery than you are to be killed by a terrorist. Dont believe me? You dont have to. Google is your friend. Crime statistics are easily searchable. Knock yourself out. People who posts things like what you have posted here are exactly what the government surveillance junkies want. They want you scared they want you malleable and they want you crying out for security by any means necessary when you should be wildly suspicious as to why there is already so much security everywhere you go in life. And yes ucaptnmarvl It is easy to say when you havent known someone murdered by violence. Just because something is hard doesnt mean its not right. The children of Sandy Hook the people of San Bernardino the people of New York City the men women and children of Oklahoma City all of these people paid the price for our freedom along with everyone who died in the wars weve fought and so on. When you are willing to give away the freedom they paid the price for you are literally tossing their sacrifice away so that you have feel marginally safer when you pull your covers over your head at night. ,comiccon,d4ccdkn,3,t5_2qzn8

10205692,0,t1_dc0q077,First of all ... I NEVER JUDGE!!!!!    D   Its not for me to judge! Our hobbies and our interests are all equal and wonderful things!   D   More power to you. I like that you are so active. Ive volunteered for various things too but youre way ahead of me.   Your comments are fascinating! You actually know a ton about the things you are involved in. I hope you are appreciated  you are quite an asset. I find particularly interesting what you are describing about the dropdown person. So interesting. This is the type of point I was commenting on to uBoroughConOfficial. Organization is everything. It makes the event run properly it makes the vendors and talent happy and it allows the attendees to actually have an effortless good time. That is when you have return customers and your event grows. I knew when I read the many comments here from people who went to the Geek Expo and someone said that the vendor and artistwriter tables were MIXED on the floor that this Con was started by organizers who did not know what they were doing did not plan ahead and were completely unprepared. And your advice to Con organizers is gospel! No one should EVER start a con thinking that they will pay back their bills with the money they make from the Con itself!I think because of your involvement in the organization of so many events and your personal interest in the Con culture as well that you could find the book I recommend interesting. It was specifically written using the huge San Diego Comic Con as the frame the books information is built around. It has a very clever format where SDCCs preview night Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday days that the SDCC takes place form different segments of the business and cultural discussions he will cover. For anyone who knows SDCC very well this format is just brilliant. But if you have never gone to SDCC please do not be discouraged by this style of organizing the material he will cover. The book can be a riveting discussion on the impact of comic con type entertainment cons on business and the impact of business on these types of cons and the cultural impact of all of this no matter where you have attended events or even what type of fannerd cons you have experience with. So anyhow  Good Luck and thank you so much for such insightful discussions here. Im very certain this will not be the last of these problems with various Cons that we will witness or the last of our analysis of them.    ,comiccon,dc0vf3e,2,t5_2qzn8

However to avoid using that link on the BuyWonderConBadges page you can go directly into your Member ID Account to buy Wondercon badges from there. This year they changed how we buy WC badges. You have to log into your Member ID Account and use your account as access.Do that first. Log into your Member ID Account. Then look at the menu tabs running along the top of your account and pick Registration Info tab. THEN when this opens you should see the selection to buy WC badges and you would use that.Can you log into your account at all? If you cant log in something is seriously wrong and you should contact CCI. Since I CAN log in it means the accounts are still open and not closed for technical work by CCI. If just you can NOT log in to your account your account might have been compromised and CCI closed the account. You would definitely have to contact them then! They do remove and ban accounts of offenders who break their rules. But first just try to log in and see if you have access to your account.The CCI contact page  ,comiccon,deuexed,4,t5_2qzn8
