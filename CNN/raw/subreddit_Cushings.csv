4610537,0,t1_cstvffs,I was just diagnosed with an adrenal tumor and after going through all the symptoms of Cushings I feel like that might be something Im dealing with. Id love to know more about what changed for you after your tumor was removed and how your recovery went afterwards if youre willing to share that is.  Thanks! ,Cushings,ctbqoh1,1,t5_2qpbp
