3673804,0,t3_32fumz,Sounds like youre already familiar enough with Mals that I dont need to tell you that theyre the ultimate combination of intelligence energy and athleticism Ill admit to being biased.... Of course those are not always good things if they are not channeled in the right direction!That said for the kind of dog and the kind of activities you describe I would say that there are two facets of Mals that I would be concerned about if I were you Our Mal a male is not the most social dog... Although hes best buddies with my sisterinlaws dog whom hes known for practically his entire life he can be very uh assertive with most other dogs  as if every encounter is a test in which he must prove his social and often physical dominance... So I would worry a little bit about getting along with your other dog depending on his personality too of course. While Mals can definitely be affectionate and are extremely loyal in general I think they tend to bond strongest with a single person. In our family theres just my wife and myself but although we both spend about the same amount of time with our Mal our Mal is very definitely Daddys boy. Hell often snuggle up and cuddle with me but rarely does that with his Mommy  only when asked and then only for as long as he feels he has to... Unless Mommy is preparing food in which case hes Mommys boy because shes more of a pushover... I suppose that may not prove to be a problem with Mals as much as it may be a problem in your relationship with your GF but something to consider visavis the other breeds youre considering.,BelgianMalinois,cqb1da0,3,t5_2wo0n

5982669,0,t1_cy3rv2f,Shes beautiful. I have such a sort spot for mals. I would never ever have one. Id be the wrong kind of home. I worked with a port authority mal at and airport. He was a Sniffer and the most awesomestest pup ever.,BelgianMalinois,cy3uy06,1,t5_2wo0n
5997340,0,t1_cy5jong,This is my buddys dog. My dog also a Mal doesnt care about sticks but loves a Kong. It may be a toy or stick or something else what seems to be constant for this breed is the uncontrollable drive to get it and bite it. ,BelgianMalinois,cy5s65n,1,t5_2wo0n
6883964,0,t1_d0w5pkt,Ive got a  year old full blooded mal.  He weighs  pounds and people think that he weighs less.  If you start training it from a pup by the time it is grown up your building manager wont be questioning its weight but instead complimenting how well behaved your dog is.,BelgianMalinois,d0wm3mw,1,t5_2wo0n

8278195,0,t1_d5b6r0u,Thanks for the advice! Ill try to add the green tripe to his meals.. I usually mixalternate meats from veal bison chicken various cuts of beef.. The girlfriends a chef and normally takes home goodies all the time.. Weve been alternating coconut oil and fish oil supplements I normally feed him the fish oil with his breakfast.. Weve occasionally given Hendrix some fresh milk which he loves and doesnt upset his stomach.. I havent noticed the cat pee funk from the turmeric its been a recent addition to his menu Ill report back if I notice anything.. From the sound of your response you moved away from raw feeding just curious on your decision on going another route? ,BelgianMalinois,d5cc016,1,t5_2wo0n

10906355,0,t1_de4wmh6,Maybe I should have worded it differently I dont dispute the use of a crate its a great tool. I think that if you have to be away from the house for  hours everyday you shouldnt get a puppy especially not a Malinois.,BelgianMalinois,de4wvws,2,t5_2wo0n
11729946,0,t1_dgpk8ts,So would it be covered under a warranty although there is no recall? Or would it be something that would fall under the specific dealer we purchased it from? Because Ill look into it to get them fixed. ,BelgianMalinois,dgpmbsk,3,t5_2wo0n
