1066375,0,t1_chocrqr,If you just walk the distance without looking at anything you can do it in less than an hour. Personally I would allow  hours to properly take in all the sights. Maybe more if you want to stop and have a gelato or a beer. ,rome,chpi2b9,1,t5_2rp3h

7845375,0,t3_4mq9h7,Eater has just published a list of  essential restaurants in Rome as compiled by US expatbloggerjournalist Katie Parla   I agree with most of them and I suspect the more frequent posters on this subreddit will too  My only peeve about this list is that it can be a little confusing as from chic places to more rustic trattorie from world cuisine to pizza places... everything is mixed in the same feature. I would have liked to see different sections that is.If you go to Pigneto tomorrow skip it altogether for your meals and spend some  minutes to get to Osteria Bonelli in nearby Torpignattara the quality of both Rosti and Necci has deteriorated in the last few weeksmonths and while I appreciate their location its not the only element I am paying for and this cannot excuse the rudeness of their servers or overpriced halfraw burgers or gummy pizza. Not included in the article posted over on Eater but extremely worth your money are Osteria  on  via dei Banchi Vecchi but be prepared to spend a lot of money! or Osteria Palmira on  via Abate Ugone Monteverde district.,rome,d3xw0ov,2,t5_2rp3h

11685311,0,t1_dgkcpeo,Locals would probably just pay it. From my experience here Romans are pretty laid back about this sort of thing and rarely examine the check in great detail  meals with friends tend to be split perhead without any fastidious calculating happening because it usually all evens out in the end. Honestly it isnt that common and unless you think youve been egregiously ripped off  euro per person is an acceptable extra in a city where theres no obligation to tip.,rome,dgkjpv1,3,t5_2rp3h
