1552808,0,t3_2bz5c2,Re oil to Bitcoins gold.Think about it  the reason oil is not used as money is because it is expensive and difficult to transport its actually orders of magnitude easier and cheaper to transport than other forms of energy but here were comparing it with other monetary forms. The analog in the currency world would be the transaction fee how much it costs to send the money from point A to point B. So I would only agree with the oil analogy if Ether turned out to have very high transaction fees to transfer from person to person and somehow it was mostly just kept in place to used as contract fees.That doesnt sound likely at all. So if Ethereum works as a fully functional blockchain it is just better than Bitcoin full stop.  The key word being if I admit the inflation schedule being nonfinite does muddy the waters there but as I recall that effect gets smaller over time.I think they are trying to market it as not money for the political advantages it will confer.,worldcryptonetwork,cjax1uu,2,t5_32oz4
