It cant flirt with me across the room at a party or comfort me when Ive had a crappy day.Theres so much more to fucking than orgasms.

2333366,0,t1_cm03xcl,I have two attachments. I forget what one of them is called but it is similar to this one Thats the one that is so intense I can barely last. Granted as I said above I havent used it while using the dimmer so I might enjoy it more with that. Ive also used it by itself with no attachment. I find that it feels amazing at first but after a while I just go numb and dont feel much. I still orgasm pretty quickly  minutes but the way there isnt that great and neither is the orgasm.Lastly I have the geewhiz attachment for prostate. I have two problems with that one. The first is the same as above. It feels great and I mean great the best feeling Ive felt really for about  seconds. After that I kind of go numb. Im unable to get prostate orgasms with this attachment and Ive tried a few times I also have no problem having prostate orgasms. The second problem is that its too limp so if I start contracting my butt it gets easily pushed out. I hope Ill eventually get the hang of it.All in all if I could have my money back for these  pieces Id take it. Now that I have it Ill try and experiment and find ways to make it work.

2967458,0,t3_2u5qqu,My experience is with the fullsize Fleshlight the Fleshlight Flight a Tenga Flip and the Tenga Eggs. Of those I still think the regular fullsize Fleshlight with a texture!!! dont get the smooth is where you need to be. The Flight will probably be too small for you and the Tenga Flip seems a bit fragile and rips easy. The Tenga Eggs are great but they dont have as much mass and although they can actually be used multiple times have a limited number of uses. But the regular Fleshlight can accommodate a wide range of sizes and lasts like you expect a  toy to last.You might just keep your eye on the Fleshlight site and see if anything comes on sale. They usually have some sort of deal pop up monthly. And even if it doesnt the regular Fleshlight with a texture of your choice is only  higher than your limit. If you want something that will last a long time it might be worth it to save an extra month or so. Heres a YouTube video comparing two different Fleshilghts and the Tenga along with a companion more detailed articleAnd heres everything you ever wanted to know about Fleshlights but were afraid to ask.

3129072,0,t3_2vz0x6,Unfortunately prostate massagers are really anatomically specific.  One toy might be great for one guy but awful for the next just as Gspot stimulators can vary for women.  You obviously cant return them so Id start by figuring out whether you want something big or small then go from there.If you want vibrations theres certainly stuff like the Tantus Prostate Health but Ive heard thats a little small for larger guys.  RocksOff makes the Naughty Boy and Rude Boy and Bad Boy theyre not too expensive either and theyre made with silicone which are decent toys with clever designs but the vibrations probably arent going to blow you away if youre looking for a lot of power they use removable bullets.  Jopens EGO series gets bigger and stronger but you pay a bit for the privilege.If I were you Id start with cheap but safe phthalatefree massagers without vibrators then when you find a size and shape you like look for a more expensive product with a similar design and a vibrating function.  Seems like it would be the best return on investment.  I hope that helps.  Also a minor conflict of interest to note my company sells most of the products I listed above but were not U.K. based.

And the outer has lots of skin detailing too. The Maverick is  diameter so its nice and girthy. Length is good. The softer outside means that despite its large girth I at least dont find it hard to insert. ,SexToys,cqkozqf,5,t5_2qimy

The steel glans ring is actually much comfortable in my opinion. The shaft ring was a no brainer. Unlike a traditional cock ring the shaft ring can just be slipped right off if you feel that theres an issue. At most you might need a little lube to slip it loose.Coming up next is the Imperial cock ring. This was the most worrisome. To alleviate my fears I purchased a Tantus Intermediate CRing made of hard silicone which was the same inner diameter. If the size was too small I could just cut off the silicone ring. But it fit fine. Actually the Imperial being a tad less wide and more rounded inside felt much more comfortable.,SexToys,cy0krlo,1,t5_2qimy

7175221,0,t1_d1tqmy7,I dont agree with that. I dont think any toy is more or less safe aside from the material it is made of. If you plan to use a toy it should be standard to check that it is clean and ensure that youre not putting yourself at risk. Your point is arguing that because it has the capacity to hold bacteria which literally any sex toy does if you dont clean it it is less safe. That simply isnt true. Any unclean toy is unsafe.If someone has the conscious ability to choose to use a sex toy there should be no case in which that toy is not clean before use. Accidents are not anything to do with the safety of something given that accidents are possible with any toy. If I had a smooth silicone toy that I didnt wash it would be just as dangerous as one of these toys unwashed. ,SexToys,d1tr8k5,1,t5_2qimy

If you order a feeldoe do your kegles every day until it gets here. You will thank me later. I find theyre not really a beginners toy even though almost all of us reach for it as the first option for the first time I find its a lot better in theory than in practice feeldoes still really need at least a minimalistic harness anyway and you will likely have a better first experience with a harness and flared base dildo instead. Insert an egg if youd like some stimulation for yourself a vibrating bullet placed on the back of the harness works well for me too if I want clit stimulation instead of vaginalgspot. Edit wait I dont think you ever told us your gender. Are you looking for a hollowed out strap onpenis sleeve for a man to wear or for a woman to wear? Are you the one doing the penetrating?

8756582,0,t3_500mqm,If youve never done this before I highly recommend that you buy a CB series cage CB s etc. and buy a REAL one not a knockoff. The advantage the CB series has over anything else is that it comes with different spacers and different size rings which will allow you to play around and get the right fit.If you decide to get a Holy Trainer V its an excellent device but you only get one shot at getting the ring size right. Dont get it right and youll spend another  to correct your mistake.If youve never had a ring around your balls and cock  and at the same time had your cock trapped in a tube theres little chance you will get the sizing right the first time.After you figure out your setup in the CB and wear it for  months or so you can trade up to a steel device. Between the CB s and the Holy Trainer V short I spent three years locked up in them. Guys who have moved up to custom steel talk down about those devices but they can be for long term wear if you are let out for cleaning every couple of days. It can actually be MORE frustrating to be let out and soaped up and edged for a minute or two and put back in without orgasm that it can be to be in the device day after day after day.THAT SAID there are now some pretty darn cheap stainless steel devices on Amazon that are fairly decent quality. Im wearing one right now instead of my custom steel device just for a change of pace. Mine is the Happygo New Stealth mm cage which is even smaller than the CB s and the HT V short.When it comes to length of cage you will find out like so many others that SHORTER is almost always better. Im  flaccid and nearly . stiff and these days I live in a tube thats all of mm long just under . You want the device to stop your erection before it picks up too much steam.Hope this helps.,SexToys,d708c29,9,t5_2qimy

I really recommend you spend some time reading the links in that thread last thing you need is a trip to AampE after an adverse reaction that would really spoil the experience.If I were to recommend it would be one of these...And as long as you choose a proper plug with a flared or Tbar base youre ok they are designed specifically to avoid being swallowed up. This is precisely why you should only use toys designed for the purpose as your bum will have a habit of sucking in anything that isnt properly designed which again is a very bad thingtm also likely to result in a trip to AampE.,SexToys,d873llp,2,t5_2qimy

9308364,0,t1_d8vi0lk,I definitely agree here. The Tango is the most rumbly powerful bullet vibe out there. Some people report that the Touch is a little more muted because of the silicone casing but it seems to work fine for the majority of women so it really depends on exactly how powerful you need the vibration and whether you like really pinpoint stimulation on your clit if you do go with the Tango over the Touch. You do have a lot of options listed here though and it is really hard to choose your first few toys when youre not exactly sure what you want or even after that. Im sorry about your experience with the GKii. It doesnt look particularly appealing to me either. As far as the dildos youre considering go Id guess that the curve on the Lelo Ella might hit you the wrong way if the GKii did but never having felt either myself I could be wrong. You might consider getting a good clit vibe the Tango or Touch first and then saving up for a dualdensity dildo later. The squishiness of the outer layer of dualdensity silicone should help minimize the discomfort you felt while trying to thrust with the GKii. On the other hand you might try the Tantus Silk Small or Medium first to see how the shape and the slickness work out for you I have no problems whatsoever with the drag of dualdensity silicone and even prefer it over slick singledensity silicone but Ive read a number of other reviews where people complain that dualdensity is grabby and creates to much drag. To each his own.. If you decide to go dualdensity you might look at the Tantus Slick Small or the Vixskin Spur for smaller options or Vixskin Raquel or for something slightly larger but still of average girth and without protruding ridges. If you like a good coronal ridge though go for the Vixskin Mustang. I hope you can get these in Mexico.

9592898,0,t3_5cbt9n,If your . diameter dildo is the biggest thing thats been in your ass a  diameter toy would be too big for you.In general I recommend sizing up in increments of about  in circumference or .. in diameter. This should give you a challenging yet fun and doable stretch.If you attempt an increment much bigger than this either it simply wont go in or youll hurt yourself. If you try a smaller increment you may find it too easy and too similar to your current toy.However Ive only ever applied this rule to plugs not dildos. If youre not using plugs at all you should be more conservative when sizing up.Since you didnt mentions a price bracket Ill recommend my favourite dildos Vixens VixSkin line Theyre dual density which means they have firm inner cores and soft outer layers. This gives you the joy of squishiness without the vexation of floppiness. The ones in your girth range are probably Mustang Johnny and Bandit Keep in mind that because their outer layers are so deliciously soft VixSkin dildos feel a bit thinner than they are.,SexToys,d9viry5,2,t5_2qimy

10950166,0,t1_de85w06,Polyurethane exists on a spectrum because it can range from a foam e.g. bench press pad to a rubber e.g. condom to a hard coating e.g. Minwax.  Polyurethane has the same limitations as rubber in regards to oil breaking the material down and it can be porous.  I dont think there is a one size fits all answer because of the varying substances that can be added to it.  e.g.  There are polyurethane pillows and mattresses that dont smell like they are going to kill you and there are others that smell like they are going to kill you and that never air out.There are however instances to where it should be body safe.  e.g. Trojan makes a condom out of it.Just because Good Vibrations sells it doesnt mean that its body safe.  e.g.  They also sell a Pleasure Works rabbit that is made out of PVC.  A consumer always has to double check what they are looking at because almost everyone is going to carry something that isnt safe.Personally I wouldnt use a polyurethane PU coated toy since oil will degrade the coating.,SexToys,de9fkci,1,t5_2qimy

11039345,0,t1_deix0uz,Hi! I have always had trouble orgasming with a partner which means that the majority of my sexy times do not include an orgasm for me. My new found PiV orgasms are way less dramaticeuphoric than the ones I get manually or from oral. However my PiV orgasms only take about  minutes once Im in a good position and it feels like I have the potential to have more than one in a row. For me its totally worth it because Im starting to feel like maybe I can now cum every time I have sex! They wont always be the mind blowing orgasms I have from being eaten out but they are certainly better than me getting flustered and frustrated in the moment because we put all this work in and I couldnt get off. Definitely worth it for me but it probably depends on your sexual situation.,SexToys,dejagly,1,t5_2qimy

Im debating whether it would be better to see what its like and dispose of it after a few months as another user said or just get a different one.I dont really know if a toy would be something Id want to use regularly so its hard to justify spending a lot of money on my first one. Edit thanks for your responses youve helped to put my mind at rest. I was worried Id wasted my money.I just wanted to ask do either of you know about the safety of using a toy with an IUD?  My concern is an increased risk of infection rather than mechanical damage. ,SexToys,dez0pkw,1,t5_2qimy
11330931,0,t1_dfg8d8n,Yeah. Buying a sex toy that is subpar is like throwing your money away because it will break or just collect dust.

11347157,0,t3_61x8eq,Neither of those toys are bodysafe. Check out the sidebar for basic rundown on safe toy materials. Basically if you want it to be realistic or at all flexible it MUST be silicone  TPE TPR PVC and jelly the mystery meat of sex toys are all porous and potentially toxic. You cant use condoms over those materials either since they leach oily shit which basically degrades the condom and lets everything through anyway.Also without knowing an actual size range its really hard for us to recommend something. Whats too thick for one person might well be too small for another. The two toys youve linked are pretty similar in size  maybe thats what you want? If so you might say so thatd make it easier for community members to find matching toys.Not knowing much more I might recommend Tantus brand Vixen Creations though their suction cups are notoriously bad Blush Novelties Real Nude line just off the top of my sleepy head. Lovehoney has some good stuff too and theyre pretty good about accurately labeling their products  plenty of manufacturers or retailers will lie about material quality or construction theyll put bodysafe or bodyfriendly or other bullshit terms on any material or claim that a TPR toy is a mix of silicone and something else which well just no. It doesnt work like that. But yeah surf around a bit just make sure to read the material listing and choose only silicone for a flexible nonporous material.  ,SexToys,dfi6hh9,5,t5_2qimy

If you have a sex toy shop anywhere near you and they carry the WeVibe Tango that is a prime example of very rumbly and very powerful.

11633257,0,t3_65zje2,gt Except this one appears to have some genetic disorder in which her vagina is located on her god damn stomach.That opening isnt anywhere near where a stomach would be.  The stomach is inside of the ribcage on the left near the bottom of the sternum and abovenear the navel.  The opening isnt even high enough to be located where the uterus would be as the uterus would typically be above that circular seal that is above the opening depends on the anatomy chart andor person.gt but for my purposes I need an anatomically correct one.You might want to review some anatomy charts before you continue your search as your perception of where things are located is skewed.  I understand you want the opening to be located lower since it would be on a person but youre probably not going to find that on an item of this nature.gtBasically Im trying to find a decentlooking inflatable doll in the  range that has her vagina in the right location.I did some digging on Google and found something that may meet your criteria.  I can not vouch for the seller they are in the UK their products the manufacturer etc.  The toys in question are probably porous possibly toxic and I have no idea if they are actually made out the materials they are claimed to be made out of.  Due to all of that I am hesitant to post the link but I dont know of any bodysafe inflatable option so Im going to go ahead and do so.  VibeDoll might have something that will interest you.  You need to perform due diligence though and research them before you commit to a purchase.  A doll forum I dont know if a subreddit exists is probably going to be your best source of information on that company their products and to help you find exactly what you are looking for.,SexToys,dgen4oo,2,t5_2qimy
