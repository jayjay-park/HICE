Ive never read the book and didnt follow closely the movie.

11482119,0,t1_dfwbodf,gtLarge sums of money is my guessBuying brains is probably a lot easier now when no one knows about zombies. No humans or at least very few know that anyone is buying brains. The crematorium workers likely believe that the brains are going to science or medical research not that theyre being eaten. But after zombies are outed the brain black market will likely be heavily watched. Humans wont want their brains or their loved ones brains being eaten. The authorities will get involved to make sure it doesnt happen. There might be a few odd people who donate their brains to zombies but not many. The price will also go up when the morticians and crematorium workers realize that the zombies need the brains. And none of it will matter if the government decides to solve the zombie problem by bombing the island.gtIm pretty sure it wouldve been a lot less risky to just kill Clive and Liv.Risk versus reward. Liv and Clive are possible allies possible food sources through their professions and access to dead bodies and very helpful for covering up crimes or warning about threats because of their professions. If youre a zombie who is worried about a humanzombie war infecting the police healthcare professionals and local government are good ways to win the war before it begins.,iZombie,dfxhv2j,2,t5_2us6d

11683392,0,t3_6658e5,My theory is that a new zombie starts in the state of the zombie that created it and that the max ragerutopium combo creates initially ragedout zombies. Eg Liv scratches Drake while calm Drake becomes a calm zombie. Raged out scientists scratch guards you get  Days Later.  Im pretty sure this fits with all onscreen zombification so far.,iZombie,dgkbvjn,1,t5_2us6d
11686381,0,t1_dgjslde,The clues Ive noticed are pretty flimsy but theres enough to warrant some doubt.  He recognized Don E. when he first woke up and mistook him for Scott E.  But he also claims that the amnesia wiped his mind entirely and he cant remember anything at all.  So howd he recognize him?  Or did I miss something important?   That dude can still rock the piano.  Muscle memory is plausible but the lyrics to songs and stuff?  Did he relearn all of those over the course of a couple weeks?  Hm... He knew to run the hell away when he saw Mr. Boss guys in the basement.  Maybe he just saw the guns or whatever but amnesia Blaine was kept out of downstairs business and knew there was shady stuff going on.  Would the guns have scared him away? He definitely remembered how to load that gun and then kill people when he saved Peyton.   I felt like he was kind of playing Peyton when he asked her to be with him for meeting his fathers attorney.  It seemed a little too Poor me with my fuzzy brain listen to my sexy songs and look how hot I am in this suit while remembering that Im just a poor lost puppy want to come see how terrible my dad is so I can get a little more sympathy?   The song he sang at the end of the last episode is Long Long Time and potentially ominous coming from him.  Specifically the line Cause Ive done everything I know to try and make you mine.  Amnesia Blaine hasnt done a lot to actively seduce Peyton except be a sad little bumblebee with a heroic streak.  But old Blaine would definitely consider fake amnesia and rub our fling in her boyfriends face until he breaks so she comes running to me to be a totally viable grand gesture.  I imagine his idea of wooing a woman is probably just that twisted.That said I dont want the amnesia thing to be an act.  If it isnt it opens a lot of doors to the plot and Blaines character for future storylines that involve him with Liv and the gang.  If it is then where do you go from there?  Itd be so beyond the pale that itd barely be believable that any of them would interact with him ever again unless they were super desperate.  Hes already been so peripheral for the past two seasons that Im excited to see him get better integrated and more in because he plays with the rest of the cast very well and we never got enough of that before.  Hes great when left to his own devices but I much prefer when hes teamed up with the rest because its hard to care about his rotating door of cronies when they die or dip every few episodes RIP Chief Don E please go crawling back to Blaine  you know you miss him.,iZombie,dgko36a,5,t5_2us6d
11698972,0,t3_668cao,Ive liked what they did with Blaine . Instead of the soap opera esque storyline of if he has his memories weve seen him encounter people who reveal to him just why he doesnt want his memories back Ravi taking issue is understandable especially in the last episode Peyton is stupid and unprofessional,iZombie,dgm3i6v,2,t5_2us6d
