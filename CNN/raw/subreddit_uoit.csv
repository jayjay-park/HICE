3015236,0,t3_2uooit,Hey finalyear compsci coop student here. You definitely wanna go for compsci. The compsci profs are mostly pretty awesome but the software engineering profs are really hitandmiss avoid Kamran Sartipi at all costs. If youre going into gamedev you definitely need compsci. Software engineerings more about corporatestyle software development and less about how to program well while the converse is true for compsci Maybe some engi will call me out on that lol. Anyway to answer your questions for compsci  Courses are pretty solid materialwise. You get a fairly small class which gives you the chance to get to know the prof if youd like.  Work loads fine pretty fair.  Coops okay. If you want a good position it helps to look on your own but they provide you with a bunch of opportunities to start with. Theres also the possibility of working for one of the compsci profs which is pretty nice  I did  months working for Dr. Collins .  Not really sure what you mean by school life.  Pros better profs more general programming knowledge Cons idk?  Dorms are okay. South villages nicer but more expensive and has a mandatory meal plan. IMO the north simcoe buildings the best.,uoit,coaj058,3,t5_2s1kn

As far as keepign the laptops go the first year you get a laptop nd year you get a software refresh on the same laptop. rd year you return your laptop and get a new one. th you keep the same laptop software Refresh. At the end yes you get the keep the laptop although you have to pay  to keep it. As for how they laptops are... well Ive never personally used them but theyre good from what ive heard.,uoit,cymx9ba,0,t5_2s1kn
6546616,0,t1_czjzk43,Ive heard the odd complaint about the Dell laptops but I only experienced the Lenovos while I was there.My Tp that I graduated with while it didnt have HDMI it had Mini DisplayPort.  So basically you can buy any Apple adapter from their old Macbook lineups or get an AIO adapter which is a minimal cost.  Thats just my  cents.  That and my laptop battery still runs for  hours on a single charge.However battery life varies from person to person and how they use the laptop.,uoit,czwh1vx,1,t5_2s1kn

7996804,0,t3_4oqcdy,You have a few options you can look into. Take a bus from STC to downtown oshawathat will cost you probably since its not the durham transit you get with your pass and then transfer to a durham bus to go north. Somehow find a way to UofT SC and take the durham pulse bus with your pass to downtown oshawa and then transfer north. Or you can try and find a carpool to uoit,uoit,d4ex0pe,1,t5_2s1kn

10326952,0,t1_dcem32k,Yes there is a final exam and Ive definitely taken much easier courses than Social Policy. Writing for The Social Sciences is a easy course as well but there are many small assignments in that course. ,uoit,dcem8qw,1,t5_2s1kn
10327134,0,t1_dcempzq,Pretty much any course that Professor Jordan Harel teaches. Google him and find out his courses. ,uoit,dcemzj7,2,t5_2s1kn
