11069686,0,t1_deghgf8,North America used to have several types of resident early horse species.  They were all pretty small only about the size of a fox or a dog   They all eventually went extinct along with much of the other megafauna in North America so there were no horse like species in North America until European exploration kicked off.One of the amazing things about the plains natives is that theyd never seen a horse before European colonization.  In less than  years they had become master horsemen as a culture.     ,historybuffs,demqljv,1,t5_2ujsx
