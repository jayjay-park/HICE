They apparently didnt like their website enough to pay for the domain but the website is still archived This is what people are told happens in animal brothelsgt You are so small and defenceless you are terrified in horrific pain you have been bound and gagged by your torturer with no means of escape. You have been beaten and kicked until you are almost unconscious then dragged into a room where your torturer has paid another to put you through so much physical and mental pain you are praying you wont survive.gt Still conscious he will deliberately destroy your internal organs your delicate pelvic bones will be smashed your skin will literally be ripped to pieces. Your legs will be forced to breaking point your muscles and ligaments shredded and torn from the bone where your attacker forces your limbs away from your body. So much pain so much fear so much horror for someone so tiny so innocent to endure.gt All the while you try to scream out in hopes that someone will help you anyone just to make this stop. You try to fight back but you cant you are bound and your mouth has been gagged so you cannot defend yourself in any way.gt You pray that death will be kind and take you to where you cant be hurt any more because if you do survive tomorrow or the next day your owner will again take money from another to abuse and rape you again.gt You dont understand what is happening to you. Why isnt anyone coming to save you? Why is he doing this to you? What have you done so wrong that you have to endure this horrific ordeal?gt The truth isgt You have done nothing wrong you are an innocent.

2292854,0,t3_2li0az,While havingwatching animal porn may be illegal where you are a handy list is available here the chances of any legal consequences for viewing it are remote in the extreme. In the UK viewing bestiality was made illegal in  but the only cases where someone has been convicted for it have been when theyve already been arrested for something else and had the contents of their computer searched. There is no animal porn taskforce trying to track down people who view it there are no elaborate sting operations underway to round people up. Its in no way a priority for the police so they only go after people for it when its right in front of them. You could kind of view it as driving with a broken tail light. It may be illegal and if a policeman SEES you doing it then they may well pull you over but noone is actively looking to catch you because it would be a colossal waste of time and resources to do so.My advice would be that if it makes you feel better by all means use anonymous browsing services and the like but if you dont dont stress yourself out about it.

5631541,0,t1_cwuwvzi,Well I did read it in Verschwiegenes Tierleid so you might just as well be right...gt Es war an einem Samstagnachmittag als ich zu Hause angerufen und auf die Unfallstation des Krankenhauses in dem ich arbeite gebeten wurde. Als ich eintraf unterrichtete mich der Bereitschaftsarzt. Ein jhriger Junge war von seinen Eltern ins Krankenhaus gebracht worden. Nachdem sie vom Einkaufen wiedergekommen waren fanden sie ihren Sohn stark blutend vor und zwar aus dem Rektum. Die krperliche Untersuchung ergab zahlreiche ernste Risse des Anus sowie leichte Blutergsse. Zum Glck lag keine Perforation des Darmes vor oder andere innere Verletzungen die tdlich verlaufen knnen. Die analen Lazerationen wurden genht. Das grere Problem bestand in der Aufdeckung der Verletzungsursache. Der Junge vor Scham verstummt weigerte sich die nheren Umstnde zu beschreiben. Die Eltern vermuteten ihr Sohn knnte sich vielleicht aus Neugier einen Gegenstand ins Rektum eingefhrt haben. Der behandelnde Arzt wollte pflichtgem den Verdacht auf sexuellen Missbrauch des Jungen ausschlieen. Nachdem sich der Junge geweigert hatte die Ursache seiner Verletzungen zu enthllen wurde ich als Psychologe hinzugezogen. Auch ich zog die Mglichkeit des sexuellen Missbrauchs in Erwgung. Ich suchte den jungen Mann in seinem Krankenzimmer auf. Nachdem wir mehrere Stunden miteinander gesprochen hatten und eine Vertrauensbasis geschaffen war verriet er mir das Geheimnis seiner Verletzungen. Er hatte Boney den Deutschen Schferhund der Familie dazu gebracht ihn anal zu penetrieren. Nachdem der Hund in ihn eingedrungen war kam es zur arttypischen Schwellung des Penisknotens. Dem Jungen gelang es vorerst nicht sich vom kopulierenden Hund zu befreien. Als es ihm endlich glckte fgte er sich aber dabei die betrchtlichen Verletzungen zu. Genau wegen dieser Umstnde war ich davon berzeugt dass der Junge mir die Wahrheit erzhlt hatte. Mit seiner Erlaubnis sprach ich mit seinen Eltern und erklrte ihnen behutsam die Umstnde und zwar in der Hoffnung eine Basis zur Verarbeitung dieser beunruhigenden und aufwhlenden Situation zu schaffen. Nach all dem werden sie ihren Sohn mit anderen Augen sehen aber in der Beziehung zu ihrem Hund bestanden nun erhebliche Spannungen denn fr sie war er jetzt stigmatisiert. Ich vermittelte den Eltern dass normalerweise bei Jugendlichen sexuelles Experimentierverhalten auftritt und dass die meisten Menschen mit Verhaltensweisen experimentieren die sich spter bereuen. Die Eltern waren ziemlich schockiert und ich wusste dass sich die Beziehung sowohl zu ihrem Kind als auch zu ihrem Hund fr immer verndert hatte.gt Wenn ich zurckdenke erkenne ich die hnlichkeiten dieses Falles mit den von mir therapeutisch behandelten Vergewaltigungsfllen. Die Egostruktur des Jungen zu schtzen zu verhindern dass sich seine zuknftige sexuelle Identittsbildung in diesem Einzelereignis verfngt war mein Anliegen. Wie bei Vergewaltigungsfllen blich wurde auch hier dem Opfer die Schuld gegeben. Wie konntest du das blo zulassen? Da waren der typische Arger und die Feindseligkeit gegenber dem beltter der in diesem Fall zuflligerweise ein unwissender Deutscher Schferhund war. Der kommt uns nicht ungeschoren davon. Ich wei nicht ob Boney seinerzeit irgendwelche physischen Verletzungen erlitten hatte. Rckblickend erscheint es mir seltsam dass keiner der Beteiligten sich um den Hund und seine mglichen Leiden besorgt geuert hatte.gt In diesem Fall galt meine therapeutische Verpflichtung dem jhrigen Jungen und  bis zu einem gewissen Grad  auch seinen Eltern. Dieser Verpflichtung bin ich nachgekommen trotzdem habe ich mich whrend der wenigen Jahre die seitdem vergangen sind oft gefragt wer sich um Boney sorgte. Wie hat sich dieses Ereignis auf sein Leben ausgewirkt? Obwohl er es nicht wollte war er zum beltter geworden. Er war aber nicht minder das Opfer. Was htte ich ihm gesagt wenn ich sein Psychologe gewesen wre? Er war kein Vergewaltiger dennoch wurde er innerhalb der Grenzen und Geschichte dieses Jungen und seiner Familie als einer gesehen. Ich glaube dass Boney hier ausgebeutet wurde als man ihn zwang die Schuld fr den Fehler seines jugendlichen Herrchens auf sich zu nehmen. Ich wei dass es dumm erscheint sich um Boney zu sorgen. Doch wenn ich darber nachdenke kann ich nicht sagen ob diese Geschichte von jugendlichem Experimentierverhalten oder von sexueller Ausbeutung handelt. Die Entscheidung berlasse ich den Lesern.I think this guy is misguided but sincere. From the same essay this is an interesting bitgt Ausgerechnet whrend dieses Gipfeltreffens der American Humane Association im Jahre  hrte ich von einigen fhrenden Mitgliedern der Tierschutz und Tierrechtsbewegung dass sie sexuelle Handlungen mit Tieren nicht grundstzlich ablehnen. Einige hielten Sodomie dann fr vertretbar wenn keine Gewaltakte verbt wurden. Andere vertraten die liberalistische Ansicht dass Zoophilie  definiert als sexuelle Anziehung und Ausdruck derselben gegenber Tieren  eine rechtmige und einfhlsame Umgangsform fr Menschen sein knnte  und vielleicht auch fr die Tiere. Soweit ich mich erinnere waren es in erster Linie Psychologen die diese liberale Ansicht uerten. Ihr Standpunkt findet sich im Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSMIV wieder. Dort wurde Sodomie von der Liste der sexueller Paraphilien gestrichen und somit wird Zoophilie in den meisten Fllen als ein Gegenstand auerhalb der psychiatrischen Intervention bewertet. Obwohl ich mich selbst dem politisch liberalen Spektrums zurechnen wrde pro testierte ich so heftig gegen diesen liberalen Ansatz dass einige meiner Freunde sich gentigt fhlten beruhigend auf mich einwirken zu mssen Anscheinend ereiferte ich mich so sehr gegen das was ich als eindeutiges Verbrechen gegenber Tieren ansah dass ich andere in ihrem Standpunkt verletzte. Fr mich ist die gesellschaftliche Anerkennung der Sodomie und Zoophilie ein Schritt in die falsche Richtung weil dadurch einer weiteren tierlichen Ausbeutung Tr und Tor geffnet wird  dies brachte ich vehement zum Ausdruck. Obwohl meine Argumente mehr durch Gefhle als durch ruhige sachliche berlegungen bestimmt waren provozierte dies eine lebhafte Diskussion ber Sodomie und Zoophilie die intellektuell anregend aber zugleich auch spannungsgeladen war. Um das Bild zu vervollstndigen muss ich jedoch auch von dieser seltsamen Atmosphre von Unwissenheit und Ablehnung berichten die whrend der Diskussion im Raum herrschte. Ein Phnomen das ich innerhalb dieser Gruppe namhafter Tierrechtler nicht erwartet htte. Die Auseinandersetzung geprgt durch Emotionalitt Liberalismus und Voreingenommenheit fhrte den Mangel an einer fundierten wissenschaftlichen Grundlage klar vor Augen. Quintessenz des Tages war dass selbst unter fhrenden Tierrechtlern keine Einigung ber den sexuellen Missbrauch von Tieren erreicht werden konnte sondern vllig kontrre Standpunkte vertreten wurden.,zoophilia,cwv59fk,1,t5_2s3zx
5690074,0,t1_cx26jpb,Theres no discretion to be used when a human fucks an animal. Like I said theres no way to tell if the animal wants sex or not and coercing a household pet or grooming it for sex is just like luring a little kid into sex. Youre taking advantage of them not knowing any better and seeing you as an authority figure. Theres a reason people dont fuck wild animals and live to tell about it.,zoophilia,cx2eqf3,1,t5_2s3zx
5842107,0,t3_3v8one,Telepathy like in stage magic? Certainly not.But especially herd animals seem to use a form of communication that could be misunderstood as telepathy. Just watch a whole herd of horses when one horse shies away from a predator almost every other horse starts running away immediately. This isnt explainable by communication through sight sound or smell. All those forms of communication use time to transfer signals but the entire herd is running a second after the first horse panics.I assume this is some form of empathy. There is some sort of herd consciousness Ive seen it in motion many times and still have no explanation why even the horse on the opposite end of the herd seems to know its time to run.  Ive seen the most impressive display of that in a herd of young colts around  individuals. One shied away from a bicycle rider passing by the pasture and even the colt standing roughly  meters away on the opposite end of the pasture with a wall of horses between him and the one panicing immediately started to run.He wasnt triggered by sight because he couldnt see the other colt not by smell because pheromones need a lot of time and the right environmental conditions direction of the wind to travel and not by sound. Another thing to consider about telepathy is that even humans describe similar experiences. Old couples seem to have tuned in to their partners  they can anticipate every emotion every action without any visible means of communication. Of course you can explain this by their long time experience with each other but this only partially explains it.So I would not call it telepathy as this clearly hints at stage magic and cheesy fantasy novels. But you shouldnt discard the concept behind effortless communication too easily. Before I became interested in riding I was doing martial arts. Amongst other types like Jiu Jitsu Aikido and Tae Kwon Do I studied and practiced Ninjutsu for quite a long time. In Ninjutsu you are taught all kinds of techniques for close combat with and without weapons. If you manage to reach a certain stage of knowledge your sensei will start another form of training for you While your training at the kyu pupil stage focuses on your body the later stages of dan master focus on developing your mind and consciousness. Just search for godan test on youtube its a test where your sensei will stand behind you wielding a sword mostly a bokken wooden sword or a shinai the bamboo swords used in kendo you kneel in front of him with your back turned towars him eyes closed. The goal of this test is to avoid the strike from your master he will try to hit you without any warning. If you have developed your awareness enough you will avoid his strike by simply feeling the intention to strike. I cant explain it better just watch it yourselves on youtube. Telepathy? Certainly not. But a state of extremely heightened awareness looking almost like telepathy. Ive done this test myself a few times and can only say that its possible for anybody to do this. But you need to train you need to do certain exercises for a long time to be able to pull this off.There certainly are states of mind not yet researched enough by science. Dont discard things too quickly because you cant believe in them. Martial arts tantra and psychedelic practices to name but a few all include transcendent states of mind deemed impossible and bogus to our sciencefocused society.Keep an open mind folks you never know what science will prove tomorrow...A science advanced enough always will be perceived as magic by the non scientists.

And we humans communicate things about who we are by what we wear it is a part of our ethology if you will. Why is it that the burden is on the human to become like a beast and not the other way around? At least why is this an expectation of only the human counterpart of the relationship? You cant naturally understand a being that is virtually completely unlike you and having practically an entirely different biology to yours.

7978325,0,t3_4ncs9h,Im not sure wether this is a serious attempt at discussing simply because of the way it is written but Ill try to say something about it anyway.The first thing is having zooerotic fantasies isnt necessarily a sign for zoophilia. Fantasies are absolutely wild everybody has them and most people will never share them even with their partner for the reason of being ashamed or feeling wrong. But theres a lot going on in the mind of sexual beings we are and zooeroticism is just one very natural part of it and it often manifests itself in a way you described  a touch a thought scents and sounds. Even when enjoyed in a sexual manner its not necessarily a zoosexual thing for example if the horse owner discovers that somehow being with their horse causes fantasizing and arousal if they enjoy the touch and feel of being with the animal get aroused by behavior sounds and scents and even in they pleasure themselves in the stable next to the horse that doesnt cross any line.Love comes in unlimited shades but the way this part is written which is why I dont know wether this is to be taken seriously its written as falling in love and wanting to embrace a relationship. Animals are different to humans and even  or especially  zoophiles know this. What you describe is more akin to get lost in a fantasy but even if you embrace that love on a physical non harmful level you cant really love an animal like you can an equal partner.My point is more people than are aware of it are zoophile in the truer meaning of the word  less people than are aware of it are into actual zoosexual contacts and the least people do recognise the animal as an actual equal partner because it is something different and can lead to a lot of longing pain and frustration if misunderstood.But ultimately everybody has a different experience and Im not here to judge.

8139157,0,t3_4qkisu,Quote ...when a man was hauled before the Supreme Court of Canada on multiple charges of sexual offences against his stepdaughters and one count of bestiality. ...

When that didnt work he spread peanut butter on her vagina and took photographs while the dog licked it off. He later asked her to do it again so he could make a video.Am I the only one whos more concerned with the Canadian stoopid ass fucktard abusing his stepdaughters in every thinkable and unthinkable way than with the obvious no thinking all emotional reaction of a female animal rights activist what is quite understandable for me considering the brilliant public image of zoophiles the Canadian pervo amateur pornographer spits out into society?Oh Axyzzoozoozfuzzyfurry new name but same old misguided perspective right?

8372941,0,t1_d5nm9qc,The plural of paraphilia is paraphiliae btw. Ive played the firestarter here only for one reason to get you out of your comfort zone. Seems as it didnt work and everyone just fell back into this strange  hippieesque mindset...as every time. Anyway when I was reading through the ICD another criticism of mine surprisingly was backed up by it. The ICD  defines a paraphilia as a mental or sexual disorderorientation that is the predominant or even an exclusive one. Basically youre not a phile if you engage in other forms of sexuality thus the supermarket mentality that is very common among our community  a little bit of zoo a bit of hetero some gay a bit of sm etc. is by definition in no way a philia.Now for the plushophile BS sexual fetishism is divided into two subgroups. The first is focused on inanimate objects leather plush feces etc. the second on body parts foot fetish for example. Please note that these fetishes exist besides other sexual behavior and are often used as an extension a special feature to enhance sexual sensations. Fetishes are unnormal but wont lead to mental imbalances and psychological treatment usually isnt necessary as the fetishist isnt suffering from it in any way. A philia is the exact opposite of that it usually stands alone with few exceptions. Mental suffering from a philia is common.Even the ICD does not back our plushophile as he has given proof hes interested sexually in more than just plush. So according to the ICD it is justified to contradict here. It is vital for us to use the right terms. Contrary to the ICD I define a philia as a sexual AND a simultaneous emotional affection towards a living creature. Why? Because the emotional part is important here. We all know that the usual child rapist isnt a bona fide pedophile in most of the cases and we also know that most pedophiles wont act out their urges simply out of real emotional love for kids. When I first heard about the project from Berlins Charit hospital offering non judgemental treatment for self identified pedophiles for free I was absolutely baffled how many folks actually sought help to control their urges there. In addition to the ICDs definition of a philia I assume theres a huge portion of actual care and responsibility for your object of desire that turns a simple fetish into a true philia. Im not an advocate for pedophilia at all but I cant avoid recognising that the pedos wont duck out of their responibilities as much as a huge chuck of so called zoophiles do.To sum it up for me a philia is exclusive. A philia is similarly sexual AND emotional with the small addendum that the phile is capable to feel actual emotions and love what seems to be another big issue in most individuals of our community too. Yes I tried to trigger you all with my post. But dont think I do this just for trolling. Ill refresh my alarm call we NEED to start all over the definitions the public image the way we see ourselves the way we behave. I never will support the complacent and lazy attitude that has infested our community in the last couple of years. We need to replace all that whining about the unjust and prejudiced society  the toxic tolerance thats more of indifference than actual tolerance the stupid us versus them  mentality with another perspective of our orientation. We need them the normal folks. Its them we demand tolerance from we really should get used to the idea that the world is NOT an anything goes scenario. As with animals its honest mutuality that will bring progress and change and I heavily doubt that confessing multiple philiae will make it easier for any outsider to understand us let alone tolerate us one day. Yes respect is important. But its not just respect for others or yourself. Its basically respect for your own orientation and especially for those who seemingly are our worst enemies too. I dont mind if someone gets hard on plush and stuff. But I mind if he calls it plushophilia and thus ridicules MY OUR philia. For me that is a blatant lack of respect.I dont mind if I fail to connect to other philes as this isnt my major target. You can hate me all if you like I dont care. But what I care about is connecting to those we all depend on if we want to get zoophilia tolerated the normals. Soon after I joined the zoo community in the beginning of the s I felt that we chose the wrong way in our battle. We the majority not me teamed up with all the other dubious sexual deviants rather than trying to team up with the normals. Until today fencehopping is frowned upon but Ive never seen zoos acting...just talking no acting. Until today the professional and amateur exploitation of animals with porn and access to animals for other zoos hasnt seen any real resistance from real zoophiles. We just sit and talktype...blablabla...its no surprise nobody trusts us is it?We wait for others to come and change the world for us. Were too busy with ourselves were too lazy were too afraid to question things especially our own beliefs. We fall for illusions too easily we are way too self delusional. In a desperate situation like this it sometimes takes a real asshole to do the  and get the car thats stuck in a dead end back on track.I never applied for that job. I have better things to do with my time. But maybe its my destiny who knows... P.S. Having a simple plush fetish definitely is somehow lesser than zoophilia it surely wont cause you that much problems with society your life and your own inner self. Right? ,zoophilia,d5o61jm,0,t5_2s3zx

8884464,0,t3_51y3d5,This is as good a place to ask this as any. The short answer is no this isnt common among zoos. Some people like the idea of sex with animals because its taboo or even degrading somehow. Others those who might call themselves zoo are into it for the animals themselves because they find the animals attractive or want to make them happy. Your boyfriend sounds like he fits into the former kinkster category.If he does it right making sure the animal and you are both into it and safe and giving you a safeword or other way to stop then I dont see any problem with it personally. A quick warning though when dogs mate they have a gland at the base of their penis which we call a knot thatll swell up inside you when they finish. This will tie you and the dog together for some minutes afterwards. Im told that it can feel great for a woman but if you arent prepared for it it might shock you.

Though one thing I noticed is that the case of your mare is particularly sophisticated as it compares to what has been detailed with canines in this thread. I wonder if its due to their being ostensibly more social animals or if it is correlated with their intelligence or perhaps a mix of both. Possible too is that your approach to sex was more sophisticated than that of the other respondents thus far somehow. Its a shame that this cant be studied more thoroughly as it would seem that at least in your case there is a great deal of psychosexual homogeny between human and nonhuman.You touched on it a bit with your talk about the  week hiatus but how significant do you think the emotional element of the sex was for her?

Some breeds are eager to please some stubborn some so full of energy it seems neverending....you have to study the breeds that interest you and find which ones match your lifestyle or be truly willing to change your lifestyle for the sake of your companion.Accept that theres a chance he wont be interested in sex get him as a dog accept him as a dog love him as a dog and if he becomes more embrace it and be happy.gt I am looking forward to the challenge of training a puppy from a few months of age.I suggest reading on training if you arent very familiar while not new Karen Pryors books are typically good sciencebased methods.gt Any other tips on how to train a puppy with future sex in mind would be very helpful.I would suggest not considering sex at all use positive reinforcelent where ever you can teach him to try new things encourage him to excell and use his mind challenge him to be all he can be. When hes old enough if hes interested he will let you know.gt  I live in Canada so the summers are hot but the winters are very cold as well. I wouldnt concern myself over climate too much coats and boots can make the shortest hairded breeds comfortable in the coldest weather.,zoophilia,dbev253,2,t5_2s3zx

Not to mention the s of new slang words that are created every day? gt And its weird how other people can understand my sarcasm yet out of all people you cant. I read everything literally. if you want to use sarcasm then write s or sarcasm at the end of the line. There is something called poes law. Sarcasm in plain text is impossible to differentiate from serious arguments  you could say earth is flat in a sarcastic way yet I will take that seriously because there is people who does say that in a serious way. Anything you say in a sarcastic way there is people who say it in a serious way so I cant tell if you are serious or sarcastic unless you make it clear by writing sarcasm gt What you dont even know what youre attracted to?Never been around coons to know if i can be sexually or emotionally attracted to them but from the looks they look sexy. gt Im against animal abuse too! Especially when people use them as sex toys!Animal abuse definition To cause unnecessary distress harm or death to an animal.Even if I where to use my dogs as sex toys how is that animal abuse if Im not causing them unnecessary distress harm or death?You are incorrectly using the word animal abuse as a synonym with seeingusing them as sex toysUsing animals as sex toys or seeing them as sex toys is not always the same as animal abuse. You can see animal as sex toys and use them as sex toys without ever doing animal abuse to them.  If you where intelligent enough I would had no need to explain this to you. ,zoophilia,dc5vzj6,1,t5_2s3zx

10358960,0,t1_dcfrp90,gt Yeah its a national tragedy that my Moose only did a dominance mount and not a sex mount and I didnt immediately rip my panties off.Dominance mount? I let you know that I have done  years of research about dominance mounting and I have yet to find any scientific evidence of dogs doing that. And i have seen thousands of zooporn videos or dog mating videos or dog humping videos and I have yet to see a single one where a dog is doing a dominance humpSo forgive me if I dont believe you when you claim that he humped you out of dominance. Same way I wont believe you if you claim to have telekinetic powers. I believe in scientific facts and such facts about dominance humps seems to be nonexistent.But hey maybe you have evidence that dogs can hump for dominance reasons? If so let me know. I would be happy to see such evidence.By the way Do you know what qualifies as a dominant behabior? Or you are saying he did it for dominance reason without even know what dominance is or how it is communicated by a dog?gt When he is comfortable then Ill make our relationship official he is still the same bouncy happy dog he was when I first got him.Hmmm... that behabior is the opposite of a dog that is being dominant.gt He hasnt died or become depressed just because I dont immediately use him for sex.Playing fetch taking him for walks or giving him sex is not necessarily going to kill him or get him depressed. But we can all agree that those activities are fun and improve the quality of life of the dog.gt Moose is more to me than just a sex toy and back when I was single I would just masturbate instead of doing like you and using my friends dog for sex behind her back.Your believes and harmless actions are nobody business. You dont need my validation or anyones validation.gt Like I said Im not you and I dont need your fake almost fetishized advice anymore.Nobody is accusing you of being me. And I gave the samesimilar advice that others gave you. So if you dont need the advice of zoosexuals then dont make threads asking for advice problem solved. gt Feel free to reply back all you want and continue making an ass of yourself.Arent you the one making an ass of yourself by being immature?gt Ill stick to speaking with the adults and the real trustworthy Zoophiles.Last time I checked Im an adult. And you finding me to be untrustworthy is your subjective opinion. gt If any of them turn out to be fence jumpers backstabbers or rapists Ill treat them exactly how Im treating you.Im not a fence jumper nor a backstabber nor a rapist.,zoophilia,dci8yt1,1,t5_2s3zx

I dont know which ones he bent with me.As for what I can say publicly of my whitewashing of him Ill be frank.  When I was nearly institutionalized my parents came to him for advice and help on an IM client.  There were ready to institutionalize me after a few bad meetings with a doctor who was very antizoo.  He zoobuster calmed them away from the subject and somehow convinced them to let me have a private talk with him.There are some things in that talk I still cant discuss to this day but lets just say he watched out for me that day told me how to get out of that mess and probably saved my life.I owe him for that reason.  And Ill be the first to admit I both know a lot more about him than most people for that reason but it couldnt come from a more biased source Zoobuster himself.Im not whitewashing his past.  Honestly Id be telling this reddit the whole story hook line and sinker right now but these promises to secrecy arent just softoaths.  He knows my name address everything.  I have to keep them.

10516033,0,t3_5q9aoi,It would be nice in sex ed if the subject of zoo were treated in a tolerant and nonhostile way. What would occur ideally would be for current antizoo attitudes such as the notion of all zoosex being sexual assault to be discredited and viewed as not true. Ideally people would be told that its OK if they want to have sex with a nonhuman.gtAs in it would probably spread these dumbass myths and lies about zoophilia. I agree with WarCanine that if zoo were a main part of sex ed today it would be abused and the bigotry lies and propaganda about zoo such as the alreadymentioned lie about zoosex being sexual assault in all cases and the commonlysaid wrongful notion of nonhumans not being able to consent would be spread in an outofcontrol manner as they already are elsewhere.,zoophilia,dd03sr5,1,t5_2s3zx

10604938,0,t1_dd9rv7i,I agree. I dont believe animals have the same sort of attractions that humans do though they definitely have their favorite people to interact with. That said animals in general are naturally very hedonistic. They enjoy things that make them feel good. Be it having their itchy spots scritched or having their sexual itch scratched. Horses in particular are incredibly talented at picking up on body language as well as the various microexpressions we humans give off. Most equines will go out of their way to try to communicate with their human handlers but often give up because the human is either clueless that a questionrequest is being asked or doesnt approve of certain behaviors. Zoophiles tend to be a bit more knowledgeable about their animals body language and a lot more open about allowing their critters to express their sexual desires without deterring that sort of behavior. While mares will wink for all kinds of mundane reasons when the wink is combined with other forms of nonverbal communication its a good sign shes in the mood to play. A mare who is going out of her way to flirt with you in the same manner as she would with a stallion of her own species makes for a pretty clear sign that shes interested in messing around. Its just a matter of you having the understanding of what shes asking for as well as the desire to reciprocate. ,zoophilia,dd9th5r,6,t5_2s3zx
10615661,0,t1_ddaqyso,Yes exactly...everything depends on your personal character traits rather than on your sexual orientation. I earned the tolerance with actions...I always was the one keeping an eye on the horses on New Years Eve when everyone else is getting drunk celebrating and starting fireworks. I was the one fighting through the night when a foal was expected I was the one calling the vet early in the morning when a horse had a colic I was the one finally catching a fencehopper invading our stables for about  weeks. People can be tolerant if you make this an easy as possible task for them. Your level of dedication counts. It also helps trememduously when your horse once a ill tempered known kicker and biter miraculously changes into a gentle but self confident mare with bright eyes and a shiny fur. I really believe that being forced to semi openly live our relationship immensely shaped pepoles perception of me. They saw the undoubtedly positive changes she went through quickly after she wasnt forced anymore to accept  different riders on a daily basis. I even recall my old riding instructors astonishment when she was visiting me in the small private stables I moved to. She said Thats your horse? I hardly recognise her although I worked with her for nearly two years. She looks beautiful and well muscled. Im glad she was sold to you.People always could see that my mare meant anything to me. It surely impressed them even more when I was staying with her when she had her two colics...for more than  hours straight. Finding that thin line between normal care for an animal and exaggerated anthropomorpisation of an animal is the key. Words dont mean a thing and you can rap down all the rational arguments pro zoophilia with no significant effect when you dont show that youre living your ideals. Nevermind that sheppsoldier guy man. Hes trapped in his illusion of being a persecuted minority although nobody knows whether sheppsoldier is just another online zoo with a big mouth and little actual experience. Most often the ones crying wolf the loudest are those with the least to lose...Anyway nevermind that guy. I really think our community is smart enough to correctly file his contributions under n for nonsense or b for belligerent bullshit not helping anyone at all.Fantasising about a zoo riot trying to turn us against the oh so hateful society going completely blind for all the reasonable and legit criticism ....I guess its the idea to mobilise us all so Sheppsoldier can be the glorious pro zoo fighting hero he fantasises himself into. The invincible warrior finally making fucking animals legal again. The icon. Fantasies like this may be suitable for teenagers but for adults its rather infantile to think in such basic patterns.Like a kid Sheppsoldier denies any responsibility and blames everyone else for his misery but himself. Its always the others who are to blame society bad zoos not supporting any retard wanting to fuck animals basically anyone...except himself and his likeminded. Legit criticism of the recent bestialityzoophilia scene is anti zoo propaganda per se and avoiding useless trench fights in an infantile us versus them style is proof that youre throwing fellow zoos under the bus. You know that Sheppsoldiers narrative absolutely reminds me of Carsten Thierfelder the German Anti Zoo numero uno and his steady complaints about a pro zoo conspiracy working behind the curtains to protect us animal fuckers from the authorities. How does that mix with Sheppsoldiers repetitive Youre all part of the evil big anti zoo conspiracy if youre not agreeing with me? Well one thing that can be found in both Thierfelder and Sheppsoldier is the immense level of paranoid thoughts. Theyre out to get us we must defend ourselves against the evil conspiracy stuff like that you know...  ,zoophilia,ddaxbdc,2,t5_2s3zx
10650241,0,t3_5sd1i1,hey a fellow lesbian zoo! Nice to meetcha.I wouldnt say liking male dogs is really confusing per se. Animals dont have a societal concept of gender so I do not believe your orientation applies in the case of your zoosexuality.I am a lesbian I only date human women but I have a strong preference for male dogs since consent is for me much less of a gray area and I feel more comfortable with that exchange on a personal level. I dont really see a male dog as a little man or anything because gender is simply not a factor in how I am attracted to dogs.,zoophilia,ddehnrj,4,t5_2s3zx
10679265,0,t1_ddhgydb,Well basically in January of  the Germans tried this and it resulted in the  financial crisis basically having sexual intercourse with animals had an end result in BLM Feminism Transgender movements and trump being elected. Before the trump campaign the bush administration tried to cover up the  invasion of Iraq as being in the interest of finding WMD but it was actually to try and stop the in vain motives of Saddams copycat of Nazis last ditch and effective efforts to cripple the future economy knowing very well that they were destined to lost the war and axis powers failing.

10830904,0,t1_ddwxv5o,Im not so sure that theyre discriminatory in nature. It may seem that way but theyre attacking the act not the people really. The common verbiage when discussing this kind of stuff often includes cruelty and theres evidence to back up the terminology they use. Its easy to think something that hurts you is discriminatory since your own experience is so personal as it is.

11103501,0,t1_deq4laz,Unusual perspective...sorry but this made me laugh. My mare loved having her teats sucked by me as a part of our foreplay so not so unusual perspective for me  ...but ALWAYS clean up the udder especially between the two teats. Go deep. Seriously. Use a hose with warm water and a good amount of pH neutral soap if you never cleaned her unusual perspective before. Smell and smearygreasy  and sometimes slimy consistence of the smegma collected there are horrible. Just smell your fingers after cleaning...this wont go away easily. Keep the teats clean your mare will appreciate it. You too when your face is buried in her udder.

For instance Im both depressed and have been suicidal both however are recent and due to the loss of two of my lovers mates. Neither are a reason I chose those two individuals as mates but thats the way it will look based on the studies overt preconceptions. Nor will my PTSD be related to my military experiences but to some nonexistent childhood trauma that caused my zoophilia.The study like all before it looks only to excuse not understand zoophilic and bestial behaviours because theyve already decided they are not and cannot be anywhere within the norm.As to emailing my concerns to the authors I dont email an unknown.
