5528366,0,t1_cwi9qsg,No offence taken. Like I said in the caption of the photo for the  controller it has been sitting on a shelf for nearly a year. Hence all of the dust. I thought about cleaning it up for the photo but I thought that would be funnier with the  caption.I realize Im in the minority Sony is a big company that sells alot of products and makes a ton of money so there must be alot of people who love their stuff still. Including myself I owned many Sony products in my life. All of these negative experiences came within the last  years. But I have owned many many electronic devices and have never had these kinds of problems with them. If I did I received much better support from the company who made it.Anyway I just wanted to share my experience as I think there are some important lessons for business owners to see in this.Thanks for reading!,sony,cwiaq1s,1,t5_2qr0o

8773715,0,t1_d6ysff1,I heard about overheating and also heard that the battery life may have been due to inefficient updates. Its a shame.The camera problems could arise when people just point and shoot out of the box a lot of reviewers do this on purpose. Others have said minor settings changes give great photos. Im waiting for this compact I hope it hits home. It also better have QC .,sony,d72dq3j,2,t5_2qr0o

10204702,0,t3_5lcjgz,Nothing! The D is great! The only thing better IMHO is the ZD but thats nearly double for the size.I dont want you to miss out on a great TV but its worth noting that CES was today and the ZD is remaining in place as the flagship next year. That is even though they announced an OLED the ZD is still the flagship. Best TV on the market.I have the XD s little brother but I work with televisions for a living let me know if you have any questions. ,sony,dc0rdpe,1,t5_2qr0o
