With your budget you could easily build a K capable desktop that would be way more powerful than a laptop.  Unless you need portability a desktop is almost always a better option for gaming.Also you need to click the reply button under comments for people to get notified when you reply.,GamingLaptops,d4pdekz,3,t5_2x4m3
