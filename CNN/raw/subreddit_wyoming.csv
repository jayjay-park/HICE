In my opinion the wind is not as bad there as well. Not a coal oil or gas centered town. Home to the headquarters of the National Outdoor Leadership School NOLS. Small town around k.

1395130,0,t3_2a3gcs,Welcome from across the pond  Dont know much about pinedale but I can tell you Wyoming can be nice for a few reasons.. We are one of the lowest populated states with a large portion of land so you wont have to worry about feeling crowded so to speak.. If you like the outdoors youre in for a treat! Being low in population means there are large amount of areas that you can go camping hiking boating fishing bike riding. Just about anything that tickles your fancy. Jackson is one of the prettiest areas in the country if not the world and has a world wide known destination ski area in the winter I cant really remember where pinedale is on the map but if I remember correctly your petty damn close to Jackson . And another important thing is the fact Wyoming is booming in resources. The economy in Wyoming is one of the best in the country and Wyoming is technically rich by other states standards. Not to mention in terms of living costs its a lot less expensive then the surrounding states  accept for Nebraska dont go to Nebraska. I saw that Casper was the fastest growing city in the nation at one point a couple years ago. So we have that going for us.. Lastly as someone who has lived in Wyoming my whole life Id like to think of Wyoming as a little secret to the rest of the country. I feel like Wyoming doesnt even exist to a lot of Americans. When people in the country think of Wyoming they just think of a bunch of cowboy hicks riding around on horses which although there is a ton of farmers isnt true. Its just a regular old state with regular people just living life. Also we are right next to colorado you could probably guess why I like that  To answer your other questions Id just say the biggest mistake would be getting a car that you cant drive around in the winter you dont need a truck but for sure something with x or front wheel drive at least. And you should be able to pass the driving tests very easily if youve drove  before.Hope this helps! ,wyoming,cir5scj,1,t5_2r53d

3660203,0,t3_328e8g,I grew up in Pinedale which is  some miles away. I would say be aware that everyone knows everyone. Not necessarily in a literal sense. But if someone decides that youre a jerk then I guarantee that half the county will hear about it. Theres a lot of everyone being in everyone elses business that you dont find as much in bigger places. ALSO watch out for antelope when youre going down Highway .  is especially bad during the winter. Learn how to drive on snow and ice. Actually just get used to driving in general. If you want to do any real shopping then youre going to have to drive quite a distance. For example if you want to go to Kmart youll have to drive up to Jackson which is ish miles from Big Piney. You could also go down to Salt Lake which is  or so I think. Its nice to spend a weekend there every once in a while. Also know that its gonna get cold. They dont call it The Ice Box of the Nation for nothing. I think my parents said that its gotten down to  this year in Pinedale. Otherwise I would say try to cultivate a love for the outdoors. It really is a beautiful area. Theres tons of stuff to do outside. Hunting fishing hiking skiing snowshoeing boating you name it. Going out to the bars is probably your best bet for socializing. Piney built a really nice movie theaterbowling alley a while back too. ,wyoming,cq9hlki,3,t5_2r53d

6571751,0,t3_45lwo1,I dont find riding in Yellowstone is enjoyable as the idea of it. Speeds are slow for a good reason  frequent stopping of vehicles  folks getting out walking about. Getting your binos out or camera is a pain the helmet interferes with the experience of the place... With that said riding up to Jackson is amazing  and other canyons on that side of the state makes up for the short riding season.  Absolutely stunning.  My bike doesnt have a windshield or cruise control so riding long straight roads wear me out so Im biased when it comes to that route. I will say I love riding out here more than place except maybe Germany Switzerland and Austria. Its that stunning  and wyoming takes care of their roads.,wyoming,czz2npc,2,t5_2r53d

7196351,1,t1_d1vu0ws,The energy business is having difficulty due to external circumstances. Diversification is great until the subsidy runs out. It isnt Wyoming energy that runs off other businesses. It is Wyoming itself. Look at how many times during the winter that you cant get out of or into the state due to weather. Also consider personnel. Wyoming isnt drawing from a diverse or even adaptable workforce. Tesla you say? That sounds like a fantastic future abandoned facility. Might as well build that in Jeffery City with the other defunct structures. Why would any company build a product where it is completely useless? A Tesla in Wyoming would be a good way to be stranded somewhere. ,wyoming,d1w5zxc,-1,t5_2r53d

7346932,0,t1_d2d37o7,Just a personal anecdote related to leaving your keys in your car overnight...I recently moved within town and after hauling a particularly heavy box inside I decided to go to bed and finish unloading my car in the morning. When I went outside the next day I was horrified to see that Id forgotten to close the rear door of my little SUV after that last box the night before. My vehicle wide open all night parked right on the street and nothing inside seemed to be disturbed at all.
