10044244,0,t1_dbfz06f,I am familiar with your industry. I would say it is a good sign that the owner is open to offering you a VTB. That being said it is in the perspective of Cash amp Bank financing rarely just cash plus a small VTB. Keep in mind if the owner is retiring hell want the repayment of the VTB to be short.Id say your first steps should be to polish your own business clean up your expenses and make sure your claiming all your cash deals. If you need financing from a lender in order to purchase that business at least you have the time to make your own business look good.Once you are closer to doing a deal Id start talking to the banks.You should also request more details as to the assets  equipment you will be purchasing. Year Make Model maintenance history etc that sort of thing. Do your own research as to the value of each piece but keep in mind you might also need someone to do an equipment valuation if there is a lot of high value equipment being purchased a lender might also request this be done.Finally there would need to be a thorough valuation of the business completed. Again if the business is small it might not cost much but if it is a larger business then there is going to be some cost involved. To do the valuation properly I mean.Do also look into what the insurance requirements might be from the perspective of what the clients requesting snow removal will require. From my experience these additional expenses can be huge for snow removal type activities.I hope that helps feel free to contact me. ,canadasmallbusiness,dbgsh88,2,t5_2zs6p
