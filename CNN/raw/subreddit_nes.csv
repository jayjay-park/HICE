82029,0,t3_1u0avy,I got a retron . For the most part its good but I have three complaints about it. The system has an ejct button for the SNES games which sends them flying across the room at the speed of sound but the NES games dont have an eject button and kinda have to wiggle them out. This is probably just my console but the start button doesnt work for the controller in the player two slot. Ive tried using different controllers. The player one and two ports are on opposite sides of the system meaning that you cant plug in an advantage to both ports,nes,cenrndc,1,t5_2r529

I actually found TMNT  to be harder all because of Shredder at the end.  His onehit kill move ended a few good runs for me whereas I beat Shredder in TMNT  on my first time getting to him.  I hope you were able to play Bubble Bobble with  players because thats the only way to get the good ending.  Not that its much different than the  player ending however.  ,nes,cfno4xy,3,t5_2r529

Nothing else is there. Its dark and creepy at night. GameSwap has whatever people sell them so it can be hit or miss.

5231776,0,t3_3mlvra,gt The NES has a ZIF slotTechnically this is incorrect sorry to be that guy. Systems that use vertical force to press the game into the slot Genesis SNES etc are ZIF slots. Because the NES requires you to push the cart down Force is applied to the pins on the upper part of the slot. I know the NES says its a ZIF slot but it is incorrect. And thats one of the main reasons why the old toaster has problems reading games. And why the NES was produced. I know why Nintendo made the toaster the way it is to differentiate itself from the Atari  who was partially responsible for the game crash in  but by doing so the toaster requires a bit more maintenance than an actual ZIF system.,nes,cvgmbzi,-3,t5_2r529

Unfortunately I dont have any computers with parallel ports or any idea what software Id use to control the programmers. looks like you are using an Atmel microprocessor instead of an EPROM. Why? How? Does it emulate the EPROM chip or does it do something more complex?I went through MITs NES programming course and I thought up using a modern microprocessor to expand what the game is capable of sort of like how the Super Gameboy Player expanded on the SNES. A modern microprocessor could emulate an EPROM with significantly more space by sending program jump instructions and maintaining a memory paging system. Alternatively contents of the CHR EPROM if emulated could change completely depending on the state of the game. Heck relatively advanced logic could be performed on the microprocessor leaving the actual NES CPU to manage drawing graphics and receiving input. It could open whole worlds.,nes,cztl9tr,2,t5_2r529

Using it will introduce lag that wont be present when emulating and will cause games to look like garbage as even legitimate noncheapChinese clones of the AVHDMI scale horribly versus just firing up an emulator.  You can get USB converters for original NES controllers if you dont want to pick up USB versions of the original controllers and it will all work fine with nearly all modern emulators.  You can still collect carts and hardware if you like but based on your insistence that theres not room for a  CRT I have doubts that youd have room for much of a cartridge collection anyway.,nes,d39fid9,2,t5_2r529

9525627,0,t3_5ba07a,Youre better off getting the NES Classic right now and then worrying about the rest if you find that you like it! If youre already going to pay  for a top loader and are not sure about the other games I would recommend getting the classic and going from there. You get  games Zelda Mario Castlevania  and if has the capabilities of plugging into your hdtv. There would be no need to worry about adapters or rf switches and you can try a bunch of games out for much cheaper then buying the original console and games. Once you play for a while you might like it enough or what to try some games that werent preloaded. At that point I would look at getting the original console.,nes,d9n8gy5,2,t5_2r529

9658329,0,t1_da3kyto,yes. if youre doing it with powerups try to get the shotgun by the first vendor in Hicksville it makes the second half a cake walk. Use the shotgun in the nd level and use the reward from the first level to get the machine gun. Lean on the machine gun HARD in Commanche Village. Commanche Village is a hard motherfucker separates the men from the boys. Mountains are a bitch cause enemies spawn mostly from behind but if you get aggressively close to the enemies as they spawn they tend to move away from you and you can use the width of the shotgun spread to pick them off. Try to also have the smartbomb equipped whenever possible to avoid chewing through too many lives and buy the horse from the item vendor if you can afford it. River level is easy if you have the magnum and dont die but if you get stuck behind the ball without it its a bitch. Ill let you sort out the last level by yourself. The wanted posters are hidden next to a cows skull in every level after level .  ,nes,da3lack,1,t5_2r529
