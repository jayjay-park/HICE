7298898,0,t3_4e0y67,I had   used  new in less than  weeks. If you buy new Hyperkin will take care of you if it doesnt work. I wouldnt hesitate getting mine and I think i had about the worst experience possible. I love it and it does everything i want it to.,retron5,d27u2mc,2,t5_31bes

9871489,0,t1_datvck6,Ugh yeah me too! If mine becomes unusable I probably will get a new one if I can. Ive considered the RetroUSB AVS and still kind of want it just because but the support for save states is really handy since I dont have a lot of time to play these days.,retron5,daua19c,1,t5_31bes
