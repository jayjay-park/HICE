I would assume they tend to be a healthier breed because they are working dogs and those are usually bred more for performance. I dont own a Corgi but Im hoping to adopt one in the near future. You could always look for a Corgi mix which may be healthier.I believe a lot of the issues stem from inbreeding so if you can view the dogs heritagebloodline that is probably the best you can do.,corgis,chgf2rp,2,t5_2rj37
