11782501,0,t3_680h02,I enjoyed this episode much more than last weeks even though taking down Justines husband was full of plot holes. I think the daughter is growing on me. It seems like shes less daughter and more agent. Which is fine I suppose. Overall this episode was really good even though Justines husband being a bad guy was obvious from the beginning. ,TheCatch,dgvl21j,3,t5_385co
