I personally have never had the patience to stick around in shittypaying or unpaid volunteer positions for very long  it just seems like that carrot they keep dangling of an eventual hire always stays in the future just out of reach. Watch Harlan Ellisons YouTube video Pay the Writer take a stiff drink of Scotch and consider getting a graduate degree so you can at least get a job in teaching or academic advising or something. Failing that broaden the types of jobs you apply for and start learning how to talk your way past that first interview as most college graduates dont actually end up working in the field they studied.,englishmajors,dbw2vxk,1,t5_2uicc
