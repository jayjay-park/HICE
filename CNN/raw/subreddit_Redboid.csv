I suppose the kos free area would be the building and perhaps the immediate area surrounding that. For example someone attackingn your base would be allowed to shoot you from outside if youre in your base defending it. Likewise you can defend your base and shoot them even if they arent inside the walls etc. I suppose the perimeter walls help define the area to a degree but can extend past that as above ,Redboid,d106z9a,2,t5_39f8j

I certainly know to only traverse this area by hiding in the woods but Im pretty sure Im watching some newer players get gunned down in what they believed to be nonKOS areas not necessarily by PHers also by people attacking PHers and possibly just in the crossfire.

So not really sure If I have any beef in the direction of the server these days butReducing item spawn reduces player population. Ive seen it happen on a few servers. Its a slow process but eventually it just becomes me and the usual faces left. Mul is already fucked with no loot and it seems every time I log on I have to point a new guy to a town with loot. Reducing the loot further will destroy the new player base.What I think you and Vahalla every month he brings this up are underestimating is the desire for new guys to want to join a group of faceless guys who offer them food to survive. I imagine most new guys who just joined the server want to get a feel of the place first on their own and then after a bit maybe join a like minded group theyve come to trust.

New stats will allow you to pick the gun your really like and have advantage with it depending on the choice.No more universal guns! Pistols  its probably less changed class meduim dmgmedium crit chancemedium accuracylow range. Revolvers  same things as pistols but have a bit longer range and less dmg spreaddamage done is more stable Shotguns  well..with this bad boys i was thinking a lot to make them great again presenting you new shottiesHIGH dmg high chance to hit medium crit chance the ammount of targets were nerfed from  to to make them less weapon of zed genocide ultra low scaling with aim lvl slightly increased range. SMGs  Same range as revolvers very low damage very low crit chance fast shooting speedstill no full auto LC Rifles  low caliber rifles such as ArAKMM now has their own advantages in comparsion with big brothers fast shooting speed low dmg low crit chance medium range. HC Rifles  high caliber semis is most beloved class for all veteran and begining pvpers Slow rate of fire medium dmg medium crit chance high range. Boltactions  True sniper rifles very low rate of fire high crit chance medium damage very high rangelitteraly can shoot far than you can see. Attachments  theyve been reworked and bug fixed too for example useless stocks now have their own slot to put them and they not slings anymore. now you can put pistol laser sight with tactical flashlight etc etc so pick your own attachments for your own very unique gun to match your playstyleno more x scope for cqc.
