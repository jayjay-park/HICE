10905484,0,t3_5vsmun,How about if you create  post called State of  Draconis and make it a sticky so its always at the top and easy to find. It could show there the current state warpending war and if war is over then show priorities on who to support and what to do to cause another war.Im pretty sure theres some players that are working the bgs there to cause endless wars so if everyone was on the same page it would speed this process up Im sure.People could give updates in that thread allowing you and the mods to make changes to the current state of  Draconis. That would prevent the sub becoming full of posts saying  Draconis isisnt war,17draconisED,de4tnak,4,t5_3j84g

Also turning in x systems individually gives more influence than turning in pages at a time Also turning in bounties in small increments will bring the biggest change. x k turn in is better than x m turn in. The station controlling faction also is more likely to benefit from that so make sure you only turn in bounties for your targeted faction of support. ,17draconisED,dg5nxj7,1,t5_3j84g
