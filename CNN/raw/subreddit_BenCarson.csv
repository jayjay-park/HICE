It looks like a bias on your part that you saw this. gt Second it was far to late for Carson to even apply so they would not have offered him a scholarship even if we accept all of the rest. Again following on the heels of the politico article which blatantly lied I cant take this article very seriously either. If you want credibility you admit the mistakes of the politico article but esquire sugarcoated the mistake and didnt call it out on being a lie. On top of that is the fact that the Carson campaign has produced an old ad which supports Bens story. And on top of that again is the fact that people dont keep by policies all the time. Being as reasonable as I can be its very difficult to give any credit to this bloated piece of journaloserm.gt WTF? He interprets thing in ways that make him look great. That is not something to love that is something to worry about. He changes facts to something that says Carson is great. If you are cool with him making stuff up then you are.Your claim is contradictory to the evidence that can be confirmed. Has Carson shouted about the fact that half a million people begged him to run for president? No. He couldve retired and had a happy retirement. Your entire beef with Carson is that hes running for president for some kind of selfgratifying egotrip. If now your premise has disappeared you only have your concerns about his political expertise. Which are fair. Its true that he talks about his own achievements but he gives God the credit. He gives his team the credit. He gives his mom the credit. Again all these things remove your premise. ,BenCarson,cx1miqn,-1,t5_2wruf
