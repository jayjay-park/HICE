6799180,0,t1_d0mxabr,thats an error of the local office. You can vote in the primary as long as you are  by the general election. gtWho can participate in the caucuses?gtAny person who is eligible to vote in state of Kansas and who will be  years old on Election Day November   may participate in the Kansas caucuses. These individuals must reside in the Senate District in which they wish to participate and they must be registered as a Democrat.  Voter registration and party registration is available on the day of the caucus.taken straight from If you have any friends that think they cannot vote because they are not registered tell them they can register on site. If anyone tells you that you cant register or vote record them and show them that site on your phone. Every Caucus location is open to the Press so you can record if they try and tell you that you cant do that either. It is your RIGHT to vote as an American,Kansas4Sanders,d0mz9u3,3,t5_381eq
6804060,0,t3_48y616,Honestly I think its mostly due to money and volunteers. The Democratic Party in Kansas is comparatively quite poor both in people and money. In the more rural areas even more so. Its probably hard to justify setting up caucus locations in which only  or maybe even no people show up.,Kansas4Sanders,d0nj8qu,3,t5_381eq
