It shifts but without the rough feeling you get on your own motorcycle. Trailbraking  simplified hardbraking occurs in a straight line  As you make your entry you progressively release pressure as you ask for more lean angle. The podium runners are the most precise in how they release the front brakes. What happens when you ask for too much lean angle while still on the brakes?  As for developing the skill. If you can quantify and study the feeling like a scientist. Race organizations will pay you top dollar in teaching it. Frontend feel is something intrinsic and hard to develop a sense for. Its understanding the tire at its very limit in braking turning and accelleration. Your last question would require another paragraph but top level guys use both brakes. Unless its a right hand turn then they can not really use the rear brake. Trailing the rear is good as a form of analog traction control ,motogp,cgibbfo,2,t5_2r7pg

Drive better development with the best facilities human resources and then go out and pay the most money for the best riders. However instead of a budget cap I would like to see motogp adopt a tiered development system similar to the rules other leagues use to run their draft systems. Bottom  of teams  unlimited testing no frozen development do whatever you need to do to figure shit out. Then moving upwards in certain intervals impose a few more restrictions at each level. Reassess after every year so that teams who benefited and are doing well have a few more restrictions placed on them. I dont think Honda or Yamaha would never go for a system like that. ,motogp,cgy7hwi,2,t5_2r7pg

I never thought this kind of system would be implemented to begin with but here we are. gt Hes crashed three races in a row and yesterday he rearended a rider at the end of the fastest straight of the seasonDisregard the crashes.  That has nothing to do with rear ending another rider.If a simple crash was to count against a rider Randy de Puniet would have been tossed out of MotoGP a long time ago! lolAnd that goes to my point about zerotolerance policies.  Why would you bring that up as an example?  Why is that being inconsistent?     To bring that up as implies that just because one rider takes another other there should be some type of penalty.  And thats not true.There are racing incidents that involve multiple riders where one is to blame but theyre just that.. racing incidents.Look at Iannone taking out Hayden at the previous round.

1441901,0,t3_2anxku,Before the race actually starts the riders do a warmup lap starting from the grid. After that lap they set up on the grid again. Now the real race starts when the lights go green its go time.During the warmup lap many of the riders who started on the grid with wet tires decided that they could just as well ride with slicks since most of the track was dry. This resulted in rds of the riders pitting to change bikes.Now the rules when you pit after the warmup lap state that you must set up at the pit exit line where the pit lane speed limit is no longer enforced. You are allowed to go when your lights turn green and they only turn green after everyone on the grid has left.Because so many people decided to change bikestires after that warmup lap that pit exit line got pretty crowded.Interesting note Marquez was pole position on the grid but decided not to lead the warmup lap. This resulted in him being late in to the pitlane and coincidentially in the second row at the pit exit line. This pretty much made all of the qualifying done the day previous null and void. If he had lead the warmup lap hed have been the first in the pits and the first at the pit exit line.Nevertheless he somehow made it out of the pit lane and on to the track first even though he was behind  riders and surrounded by  others.,motogp,cix0oad,2,t5_2r7pg

He controlled the entire field whilst still lapping perfectly.He has an aggression that has been absent in recent years. Remember Rossi vs Lorenzo? Rossis words on that last corner pass I have to try and I know maybe we crash.He may be a jackass and a bit of an idiot at times but thank fck hes not another Bradley Smith media trained emotionless automaton brought up to say exactly the right things to the media. He says what he thinks. I really hope he does well. I dont think well see much of him this year. My prediction hell crash a lot hell be a hazard and hell piss a lot of people off but hell learn and he will get faster and faster.

I think this is pretty well known.On the flipside Yamaha has the exact opposite issue. Their chassissuspension is top notch but they suffer from poor top end performance.Watch the two bikes side by side in a corner and you can see this very well. The Yamahas will brake much later have more lean angle and then exit much ealier.

4736810,0,t1_ctn0qjg,This has nothing to do with racing. It was a private track day at Mugello where Canepa was doing some testing. These days often have professionals and amateur enthiusiasts on their road machines on track at the same time. There are incidents between these two groups all the time at these events. The issue is with track time being so limited and professional riders being restricted to when and where they can test it leads to riders of widely disparate skill levels on circuit. Plenty of riders have been asking for this to change for years.I will not condone any kind of action like this be it intentional or otherwise and this incident is shocking. All I can say is that Nicco is far from a malicious individual.The reason why people know so little about the facts is that because this is not a race incident and under no jurisdiction of any racing board it has been investigated as a criminal matter by local police. There are only this grainy CCTV video and rider statements as evidence. Now that it has been decided that there is a charge to be answered it has been made public. During all of this time the advice of lawyers on both sides will have been to not discuss any particulars with the media should it come to court and such discussions prejudice the case.As I said cant condone this alleged behaviour but until the full story comes out at court it would be the civil thing to do to not judge or rush to any conclusions.Nicco does not deny this happened. He simply states that there was no intention to cause the accident or wilfully endanger other riders. A court not the public will decide if that is defence enough.,motogp,ctrm9lp,2,t5_2r7pg

JLo seems boring so if he wins a race by a margin he did it in a boring fashion.

5172869,0,t1_cv7rwz8,I personally dont mind Casey enjoying Valentinos failure. Casey deserves more respect than hes been given and I fully understand that he would take pleasure seeing someone fail when they expected to do better than you. He wants to beat Rossi and when Rossi was winless with the Ducati he essentially did. One thing I do have to note though. The  seconds quote is often brought up as if Jeremy said that theyd fix the Ducati understeer issues in a heartbeat. As if they already had the solution to Caseys problems with the GP. But if anyone would actually read the full quote youd see its about the softer suspension settings of the nonfactory riders. Its common knowledge Valentino likes to ride bikes with stiff suspension and stiffening up suspension is not difficult. Out of context its a horrible quote to use. Unfortunately the same goes for most of the quotes. Casey lost a lot of fights in MotoGP rarely raced more than  laps at full pace in practice and was really shaken up by Valentino when he was beaten at Laguna. Rossi and co. were outspoken but rarely wrong. ,motogp,cv9irgd,3,t5_2r7pg

It may be worth noting too that the Brembo brakes they are using this year are slightly different than previous years.There was a change in a rule that limited the pricing of the brake packages for the team and if I remember correctly one of the materials used in the caliper block was also banned.Several riders tested this years brakes during the season last year and said they pretty much have the same feel but it takes more effort on the lever to achieve the  same amount of braking.So maybe that isnt helping him either but that should be the same for everybody using Brembos.,motogp,cvojzy1,2,t5_2r7pg

5349202,0,t1_cvventv,Oh of course Id relish the idea of action packed racing all the time but the reality is it doesnt happen every time. But the difference between MotoGP and Moto is that one is a prototype series and the other is a spec series. Because the bikes are more or less the same and the fact the riders are also fairly close in skill level then you get very great racing. But the tight racing also stems from the fact the riders use a lot of slip streaming so you see them develop little packs. MotoGP is similar to F in that you have the best guys a handful maybe then the next rung bit more than a handful and so on. And thats just how the prototype game works. But for sure more looser riders like Marquez Sic Rossi etc do get our hearts going a bit more because they do take more risks but Lorenzos style is just an older one where consistancy is the key. Nonetheless I like watching Moto over Moto because the riders can rely less on slip streaming and more on really hitting their marks. With all of this said though Motegi should be a great race in MotoGP during the wet.,motogp,cvvf5s2,1,t5_2r7pg

5519396,0,t1_cwh2stb,gt The first person you always try to defeat is your teammate in motorcycle racing.This is entirely true he rides the same bike as you so you need to be faster than him if you want to pretend youre better. Its kind of important to seem better than your teammate because in case of different riding style riders may want to have a bike designed for them.The wall is allegedly a consequence of the tyre difference Michelin for Rossi Bridgestone for Lorenzo IIRC. But some people say its Rossi who asked for it not a tyre manufacturer.Anyway the problem between those two is Rossi.When Lorenzo arrived at Yamaha Rossi had just been beaten twice in the championship  and  it has never happened before.  And Lorenzo did a very good job for a rookie.So you can understand why Rossi wasnt really glad with Lorenzo coming. Lorenzo did really well and was still is  years younger than Rossi. So Rossi might have thought that Lorenzo was going to steal his pilot number  spot at Yamaha.Mugello  Rossi breaks his leg leave the place free for Lorenzo during  GPs. Lorenzo wins the championship.Feeling hes definitely not going to stay the number  pilot of the team Rossi leaves for Ducati. He doesnt win on the Ducati and comes back to Yamaha.In  for his return at Yamaha he finishes the championship th and Lorenzo nd. In  its the opposite.Rossi might still not like Lorenzo but he knows Honda isnt gonna take him and he probably doesnt want to try Ducati again the feeling might be the same at Ducati. So if he wants to have a chance to win races he has to stay at Yamaha and try to be sort of OK with Lorenzo.Lorenzo on the other hand is discrete. Being a rookie in  he didnt say or do anything bad to Rossi. In  when Rossi gave hime a hard time in Motegi Lorenzo wasnt happy. Rossi having missed  races wasnt in the title contention. Lorenzo was he needed IIRC to finish on the podium to be champion. Rossi fought hard and took victory.After that Lorenzo as others criticized Rossi for not doing well at Ducati.But since Rossi returned to Yamaha Lorenzo was nicer to Rossi. In some press conference I dont remember what PC some journalist asked him who was the best greatest rider in history Hailwood or Agostini ? Lorenzo answered he thought it was Rossi. Now for the recent events you need to know that since Lorenzo was penalized in cc  or  I think for a bad move he made a point to ride safely. Rossi does to unless he doesnt like you.So Lorenzo knows Rossi can be really fast and respects the guy. But he also knows Rossi can be not so nice when hes not happy so its probably an aspect of Rossis personality that he doesnt really like.Lorenzo knows Rossi has a contract until the end of  so he may try to keep it cool. Plus Rossi didnt make any bad move on him just on Marquez.Rossi knows Lorenzo is a real title contender and younger than him so Yamaha wont let Lorenzo go. So Rossi knows he cant make Lorenzo go away. He might wanna try to keep it cool too.That being said theyre rivals with different personalities. So there can be respect but not friendship and very little help between those two.,motogp,cwh5ij5,10,t5_2r7pg

A rider with no chance of winning the championship interfered with the race of the current championship leader making it easier for the second place rider to overtake him on points and win.This would call for some analysis and whoever was first and second in the championship the rider interfering with the champoinship would be criticised. It just happens to have involved Rossi with his large fan base so this will go on and on.Edit. Also doing nothing wrong within the limits of the rules is different from riding with maturity and in the spirit of the sport.

A tenth title is probably the most important thing to him right now and the majority of his fans wouldnt be bothered by this as they are already against the penalty. I dont think he will care what anyone else in the paddock thinks either. If he can secure it by delaying the penalty he will do it. Not saying whether that is right or wrong just trying to show his probable thinking.As for Yamaha Jarvis said the appeal was lost and probably didnt want it to go this far but I doubt he will do anything to Rossi over it.

Rossi also thought Ducati was a good option in  he knows he has nowhere else to go and wants to stay at Yamaha so he wont jump ship.Lorenzo could win this title but Rossi is still more valuable to the Yamaha brand.That said I dont think it will come to that.

In F half the field could win a championship with the fastest car probably more than that with the Mercedes this year. In Moto GP there are  bikes and maybe six riders that could ride them fast enough to have a chance of winning a championship. Jorge is the second best of that lot and the only guy whos faster is in a long term contract with Honda. The most they are going to do with Jorge is tell him to stay away from anything official and pretty please if you wouldnt mind maybe try not to tell the press that you think your team mates penalty isnt harsh enough. ,motogp,cwipm1h,20,t5_2r7pg

You will still get the feel because  or  of the throttles will open but it will not open all of them and for those instants the bike will sound like its down a cylinder or two for about ms when coming out of a corner.you will hear that when marquez is behind as he is giving full throttle to catch rossi but listen when he is in front.  You will hear the engine being much much smoother.  He is no longer requesting less than  of the programmed torque available from the computer and as such his requested torque from the throttle is greater so it will back off individual cylinders.i absolutely think he was sandbagging hard after watching this.,motogp,cwmx4zm,4,t5_2r7pg

5622061,0,t1_cwtqfvu,Sorry you are right about the FIM. It was not the FIM but race direction when Mike Webb stated that Despite what Marquez said we think he was deliberately trying to affect the pace of Valentino but could not be penalized because there was no explicit infringement to the rules.I have mentioned the misleading title of the article above but Ive seen you have answered to that already. What still seems unclear to me is why he did not try anything at the end of the race.Too risky for Lorenzo? Okay but again since when does he care for any other rider ? He didn seem so careful with Rossi at Sepang. Yet Rossi was racing for the championship too. As Ive said and as Neil Hodgson said too this is probably the very first time weve seen Mrquez being right behind the leader of the race and not even trying to pass. Marquez said he tried to overtake Lorenzo but I honestly havent seen any tentative. I never saw him changing his lines to prepare for a pass. I never saw him trying to pass on the brakes or even in the straights while Lorenzo is notoriously not the strongest on the brakes.Perhaps he was struggling to follow yes. But again he spent no less than  laps right behind Lorenzo  laps which he could have used to study how and where he could pass. The greatest gap between him and Lorenzo was something like  or  tenths of a second around lap .Maybe his tyres were indeed worn out but so were Lorenzos who admitted to struggle with his tyres by the end of the race. Still Marquez did not try to capitalize from that. While Lorenzos pace slowed down from about .. to about .. Marc contented himself with slowing down too.So yeah maybe you could consider the comment as raise your pitchforks. Still with what happened yesterday as well as with what happened in Sepang two weeks ago it is very difficult not to believe that Marquez had not decided to help Lorenzo. ,motogp,cwtyxwk,1,t5_2r7pg

Well before those guys were beating Rossi consistently it was Casey.  Do you reckon Rossis fans hated on him?  You bet!The first thing Rossi attacked Casey for was being part of the Playstation generation and backhand complimented him on how good he was at trusting the electronics.  It was complete nonsense but there you go.So for years the Rossi fans used to go on and on and on about how much Stoner relied on electronics and that Stoner could never challenge Rossi on talent alone.  It came out much later by people who could actually see that data that Caseys advantage was that he relied on the electronics much less than others not to mention that Rossi was the pioneer for electronics in the sport.How could everyone get it so wrong?  Because what Rossi says goes.Later Rossi slags off Casey to the effect Casey is always complaining and  you can probably guess what happens next  voila!  The circle jerk around Stoner was being a moaner.And pretty much everytime he opened his mouth they jumped down his throat regardless of what was said.And even though Rossi complained more about the Ducati in his two years than Casey did in his four Rossi is such an honest guy and Casey is the moaner.So if Casey does come back you can bet your arse that the Rossi fans will slag him off as they do anyone who dares to beat Rossi.But as the last few weeks has shown us the biggest moaners in this game are neither Rossi Stoner Jorge or any other rider  its the Rossi fans.,motogp,cwwfzua,70,t5_2r7pg

Here lets see the only part of the interview that mentions rain. Ill even bold it for you to see past the yellow tinted glasses gtThere were some points of the Championship that I believe were very difficult. The first one was after Argentina when I was  points behind and then probably the other one is after Misano. You arrive to a track on Wednesday and until Sunday the weather is perfect. Then just on Sunday in three races in a row it rains during the race. That is where the points are givenI was a little bit frustrated yes. But we never gave up and the Misano crash was a key moment because I realised that I just needed to focus on winning.nothing in that passage refers to bad luck. ,motogp,cx304v1,1,t5_2r7pg

6353656,0,t1_czblbph,I cant speak for Simon whom I have known for a number of years now but you are missing a few key points.Firstly the comments section of MCN was a sewer of the first order with a number of posters I would hazard a guess at it being around five or so seizing any and every opportunity to hurl abuse and slander at riders and each other threads quickly descending into the same circular RossiStoner now RossiMarquez arguments repeated ad nauseam. Even the insults were tedious repetitions of quips stolen from elsewhere of the kind which sixyearolds have started to find tiresome.  comments is indeed a lot. But when they consist of youre lying again you moron it can hardly be called lively debate.The bickering and insults were giving MCN a bad name. Remember when you comment on a website that comment reflects on the website as well as on you. Advertisers dont like to be associated with the kind of kindergarten poohflinging which the worst of MCN commenters were indulging in.What is most interesting is that the same group of posters including Wosi some Hedgehog dude and a few others whose names escape me have all been banned from a vast array of websites all for the same thing stinking up the comment threads with tedious and childish abuse. I have banned them from my website and have most if not all of them blocked on Twitter.So instead of doing the sensible thing  clubbing together to start a forum something which can be done in about five minutes at the cost of a few quid a year  that group roams the interwebz looking for other public platforms on which to spew their bile. Their own forum would be a much better solution for everyone they could engage in uncensored debate in the very loosest sense of the word with each other and fling their threats and insults without fear of being booted off again. Meanwhile those of us who run media platforms which allow the public to comment would save some time in vetting comments and banning posters. Winwin.And I certainly dont mean to single out MCN. There are a number of websites which had the same problem and most of them have come to the same conclusion winnow out the few bad apples which ruin the atmosphere for everyone else and ban them.,motogp,czbu9hf,3,t5_2r7pg

But he is the best right now.Really impressed with the Ducati bikes. Fuck they are fast as hell in the straight and both riders handled them well disregarding the crash. Marc went balls to the wall with that Honda. He needs that bike to be better. He rode the shit out of it and couldnt hold off Dovi. Disappointed for Vale. His lap times were too up and down to gain spots in the last few laps. But I am pleased to see a Yamaha Ducati and Honda on the podium. ,motogp,d1707y6,11,t5_2r7pg

I dont want to be unreasonable and start a war with you because that really isnt my intent even though Ive been involved in other shenanigans today but I feel like there are enough valid reasons to keep ufraud around despite what I would admit are some BS comments and circumstances. Yeah he could be a dick but all of my male friends are dicks at times and I call them that clink a beer with them and laugh about it. I feel like that context is missing in an online format. I dont think hes a legitimately bad dude at all. I think he likes to dick about and have fun and talk about racing.Im curious as to how you weigh that out? He said some things that werent cool I agree thats what downvotes are for right? but what about the content he did bring to the forum? Not every original submission was great by any means whose is? but he submitted a substantial amount of OC that was quality and which flourished and offered some good discussion. It generated activity and I dont think you can deny that. I am also curious about the mods criteria are for a permanent ban. I can see the value in a temporary ban even for old fraud but if I were a mod here and I do mod a large and established forum outside of reddit I would let the users hash it out which usually results in things settling. If a certain user is clearly there only to flame theyre gone. I dont think thats true of this case. Look I respect you. Youre probably the most active of the mods and I appreciate the threads you start for discussion on race weekends and whatnot but as someone who is reasonably mature and established in real life I disagree with the ban for a guy who I actually like and enjoy having around in the subreddit where I spend most of my time. Its the internet blah blah blah but its part of my life and I really enjoy rmotogp but the permanent ban doesnt seem to fit with the circumstances and has negatively affected my experiences here. ,motogp,d539idy,1,t5_2r7pg

Not all of those riders are necessarily the fastest but the dice roll of tire choice has allowed them to keep a faster pace and in the end get a ahead of someone who chose the wrong tires.

9061485,0,t1_d80ormr,gt Youre talking  years ago now. The sport has moved on  thats why margins like this today are impressive. Er not exactly. Especially not with the current Mercedes. When one of the Mercs has a penalty or an issue or messes up so its just one Merc on pole there have been many times where the gap was enormous to second place. The big deal about Sennas pole wasnt that it was . seconds the Mclaren was a beast. It was . seconds to his own teammate at Monaco where going a little too fast and making a tiny mistake means you end up in the wall. To this day its talked about as his best pole drive it was just as nuts and impressive then as it would be now. Just like how everyone was amazed and applauded Rosberg when without mechanical issues in the dry he beat Hamilton to pole by what was it  tenths? Its not how much he took pole by its how much he took pole by from his teammate.And of course this is something that needs to be taken into account in MotoGP too thats why I said riderbike combination. gtThere isnt a lot of historical precedent for it. I kind of posted a fair few examples. Of course it happens. To me its not the gaps Marc can pull out when taking pole thats impressive its how many times hes already been on pole in a short time thats incredibly impressive and shows that hes a brilliant qualifier.The fact that hes already equal with Rossi  years and Lorenzo  years after just  years is amazing.In MotoGP the numbers are a little different but hes still close to beating Lorenzo in numbers and if he sticks with Honda and his crew hell beat Rossi in a couple of years tooMarc  poles  yearsJorge  poles  yearsValentino  poles  years What the numbers also show is that he was always great at qualifying getting almost half his poles from the lower categories  compared to Valentino for example who only has  poles from those classes. In pole percentages premier class it looks like thisMarc   Jorge   Valentino   Valentino first  years Jorge first  years Hes also soundly beating them in pole percentage if we only look at their first couple of years especially interesting considering his  first win overall numbers are eerily similar to Valentinos again reinforcing that qualifying has never been Valentinos strongest suit.The main reason for the ramble is that I think assessing Marcs poles and thinking his gaps are impressive does him a disservice because it doesnt paint the full picture. That has happened for most of the aliens in the past decade the ability to get pole by a bigger margin especially at certain tracks. What makes his performance rare is more the consistency with which he puts his bike on pole even at tracks where he then struggles in the race and cant convert his pole to a win.EDIT I did the numbers breakdown for the  wins numbers after PI last year that really shows just how similar their trajectories have been so far. They even took their th win at the same track same year in MotoGP and with the same manufacturer.,motogp,d811m7j,1,t5_2r7pg

Hes been a LOT happier recently a lot more relaxed smiling all the time.  One possibility might be the removed pressure of being the golden boy with the arrival of MM.  Im more introverted myself so I can easily relate to them.And aside from this there is a lot less company line towing than in F.  Riders will still tell you where they struggle where the bike is lacking etc.  In F its always we ope to do better next weekend obviously we will see how we perform as we try different settings.

11280095,0,t3_60zc44,gtIm wondering if its as simple as the new generation of riders have come in with new techniques that rossi has not been able to match or master.Rossi has been able to adapt to the degree of the next generation just not as quickly. His biggest hurdle since returning from Ducati has been qualifying. This struggle to get the fastest lap sooner than the rest of the grid highlights my theory quite well. Whereas Marquez Lorenzo and Vinales can come out of one warm up lap and throw down a lap record Rossi has historically struggled to get the same feeling on the bike as quickly. ,motogp,dfakyyl,1,t5_2r7pg
11281015,0,t1_dfaitv3,So you tuned it last year to see Rossis decline because he barely lost the title in ? Makes sense. Dominate off the front? What Rossi are you referring to? That has never been his style. He consistently had battled through the field in races to the victory since the start of his career. He thrives on dog fights. Much the opposite of Lorenzo not to say that is better or worse Rossi has always been a Sunday rider. Hence his relatively modest qualifying statistics. If you only were to judge riders off of free practice and testing there would be no reason to race. Everyone needs to pump the brakes with the bandwagon to say Rossi is finished. ,motogp,dfaoq4j,10,t5_2r7pg

I think most accepted that hes a middle of the field rider now.Rossi is different.  He has that th title to aim at and hes getting swamped by younger riders.  Plus hes a superstar of the sport.  We probably dont want him start off on a slow but steady downward spiral in performance.Even getting third seemed like a win to him and thats despite JL getting used to the bike and MM having a pretty bad day.
