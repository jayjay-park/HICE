People forget that genuine politics were a central part of the hippiemovement. Bernie was a part of that movement. Millennials romanticize this era and want to be a part of advancing those ideals.Paying homage to his radical past amp present isnt necessarily a negative.It shows his growthfrom demonstrating to actively writing legislation...and finally a viable candidate for presidency I also believe it could engage other groups of interest. I mean Bernie is pretty vanilla...Thanks for the feedback!,Michigan4Sanders,d08tsw6,2,t5_380zw
