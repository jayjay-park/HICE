Before you say that ps pro is just one build compared to the thousands of different pc combination. A different studio called czech k. Made the original mafia and the second one. Mafia  looks in many ways better than mafia . Released about  years ago. Ran smooth as butter on day one.Im not saying pc should get all the attention and tell the consoles to fuck off. Threat all your fans with respect. Dont make the fanbase that made you to begin with feel like a second class consumer. Im fortunate enough to play the game at a decent framerate.

11342296,0,t3_61sl0e,Let me put it this way Mafia  has several frustrating issues on XBox One. Things that would normally cause me to give up on a game. Mafia  will randomly kick you back to home screen from time to time. The textures often dont load until youre close to the object this is usually evident when driving as things dont seem to be loading in fast enough to keep up with you. People andor vehicles will popin randomly like youre in the Matrix which can be frustrating when youre chasing someone and a truck pops up in front of you with no way to avoid crashing into it. Theres lighting issues which sometimes though briefly turn people into Silver Surfer. And the water graphics are often abysmal looking like p Youtube video resolution. This is maybe the part that annoys me most since the world is otherwise quite pretty to look at.HOWEVER despite all of this and more I loved the game so much! The characters are awesome. Its fun going around exacting revenge. And the postcredit ending is worth the price of admission alone.And if you need testament to how great Mafia  is it is this I cant wait to jump back into the world with the Faster Baby DLC. And theres two more story DLCs planned!I think the game had a rocky development but I also think that the devs have put a lot of heart and soul into the game and Ive every confidence that theyre going to continue to improve the issues I mentioned and put out some great postrelease story DLC. And while the issues with the XBox One version anyway are annoying for the most part theyre not too bad. Even when the game kicks you out the save system is pretty decent so at worst you need to restart a mission. Or at very worst you need to drive to the other side of the map.Things that would make this game amazing fixing the popin and textures adding a fast travel option adding multiple save file options and adding more story and things to do. I believe the DLC is going to address the story and things to do at least.  So long answer short I definitely think the game is worth the .. Id even go so far as to say the season pass or the version that has that included are worth it!,Mafia3,dfhmo88,2,t5_2vk1k
