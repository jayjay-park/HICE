I still stand by pretty much everything I wrote below. I still have the two cases in my inventory and the victim still has me blocked although he got a VAC ban in the meantime and is tradebanned and marked by SR. I am desperate to get back into the trading community on the subreddit thats also the reason for the long post. I have learned about my mistakes and hope that I can be given a second chance. Here is the full post I wrote  weeks ago with I think all you need to know about the issueHelloRecently I have been banned from participating in the subReddit because I posted about myself scamming a person who I thought was a scammer for two Wildfire Cases. The post I made can be seen here At the time of me making this mistake I thought it would be funny to ask him for two cases and then run away with them. I saw various Youtube videos in the past of people doing the same thing and since I know that users on the subReddit are getting scammed for s of dollars daily I thought it was a good idea. However it was wrong of me to do so because it basically turned me into a scammer myself. At first I thought that . wouldnt be a big deal but I realized that it is still a scam and no matter how much I took from him it is still a bad thing from me to do. Getting a habit of stealing small items from others can lead to bigger amounts over time which would only make things worse.At first I thought that my ban was a joke from a mod but when I asked about it Schmedy told me that a scam is a scam no matter the amount. Now that I have thought about it for a while I actually agree with him and I admit that I made a big mistake. Even if the guy was an actual scammer it does not make me better than him in any way. I wasnt even  sure that he was an actual scammer which is another big mistake I made.Now that I have thought about it twice Im ready to appeal for my ban here. Schmedy told me that it was required for me to return the items to the person who I thought was the scammer. I tried adding the person I took the cases from so I could give them back but he has sadly blocked me  He also does not have a trade link on his profile so I am not sure how I should give the cases back to him. If he unblocks me and adds me I will definetly give him his cases back.I realize that I made a major mistake with my actions and that I should not be proud of it whatsoever. I hope that my ban can be reconsidered and I will make sure that something like this will not ever happen again. I know that second chances are rare on the subReddit so I will not make the same mistake a second time. Next time I come across a person who I dont trust I will just remove him from my friends list like a did before.I hope I have given enough information on the matter and I hope that I can be given a second chance.Thank you for consideringMatuig I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.
