907262,0,t1_ch7deh7,Point taken!  It certainly wasnt meant to be antagonistic although grad school does make one a little ... err ... edgy. It does however express a level of frustration with much of the existing literature in  some areas of the social sciences in regards to First Nations peoples which historically silenced the voices of those being studied in the first place. I cant speak for hard sciences Im not well versed in that area at all. Please understand my comment comes from spending years with the literature in the field and my fellow nerds. So definitely not attacking academics  I LIVE for this stuff! I love anthropology fiercely and I defend it all the time. That said historically the social sciences has not had a great track record with First Nations communities.  Granted a lot of good has come out of research otherwise I wouldnt be in the field and doing what I do. If I thought it was all bad I wouldnt be working in the field right now. Anthropology has developed immensely in the last  years especially when it comes to First Nations peoples. That said up until about  years ago it wasnt so pretty. Moral quandaries publishing sacred information that was not meant to be released to the public using information provided by unreliable and unvetted sources the releasing of information that was potentially harmful to a person or a community misrepresenting culture or language researchers violating cultural codes in the field intellectual and property rights issues archaeology is notorious for bumping into issues with this all the time and even human rights abuses have all been well documented. We actually cover them in our Intro to Cultural Anth class. Of course you can argue it happens in all academics but its not an excuse. Its abhorrent. The other problem is that up until recently so many social scientists frequently came into a community took information and then left which left many First Nations communities feeling used and betrayed. Combined with their mistrust of authorities and the government this frequently turned into a shit show pardon the French. Ive seen it first hand  a community may be promised help or financial benefits by a researcher in exchange for information. The researcher takes up a lot of the communitys time and energy everyone gets excited and usually the researcher will develop a close bond with several prominent community members. Six months or a year later the researcher leaves never to be heard from again. The community feels burned the help andor money never arrive and those that were close with the researcher are now laughed at and stigmatized. This kind of shoddy research has also  resulted in the gross misrepresentation of the cultures religions and even linguistic patterns of First Nations peoples which unfortunately gets passed down into all kinds of other outlets including documentaries school curricula and the like. Not always of course and I stress that this has changed in the past  years. Its gotten so much better especially with the growing interest in indigenous methodologies and an increasing awareness of the intersection of culture politics and historical trauma. That said a large number of scholars failed to do their work they failed their communities and they failed their field.  Perhaps more disturbing there are scholars out there who continue to do so.Because we work with live human subjects anthropologists are subject to strict codes of ethics and behavior that may be a little different than say history. To burn ones research community is pretty much just a big fail. It also messes up research for years to come in that area for any future researchers. All too frequently this was  and is  caused by not listening not listening well and not hearing what we the researcher are being told. This has very little to do with data itself and more to do with actually being a good researcher. I find if youre a good researcher you can listen. You can often find out more by just listening than by asking pointed questions at least among the community I work with largely due to the culture where questioning can be seen as rude. This causes miscommunication and hence a lot of disinformation gets spread around about First Nations communities.  So yes listening better is actually paramount when working with indigenous cultures. I find that many scholars tend to be perceived as bullies in the field and there is good reason why there is such distrust among a lot of groups towards academics at least in this neck of the woods.  That takes nothing away from gathering accurate data or utilizing a scholarly approach.  An objective empirical and logically written ethnography and set of field notes is imperative and of course theres a reason why we train so hard in the area of qualitative and quantitative research as you well know from your undergrad. My statement is not taking away from that or academics at all which I love dearly. I wouldnt have spent so long in school if I didnt think academics could change the world for the better.So definitely not trying to be antagonistic but Im also very aware of the disservice a lot of anthropologists and other social scientists have historically done to First Nations people  and it still happens. And since its still happening  and I have to deal with the aftermath on an almost daily basis  I will state that there are scholars out there who need to learn how to listen better and to understand what listening means within a First Nations framework.  I appreciate the insight though and point taken.  I will definitely try to be more careful with my wording in the future as I dont want to antagonistic towards anyone. Thanks for drawing my attention to that. Definitely had waaaay too much coffee today. Cheers! EDIT I cant type for crap. Probably still typos. Ah well.  ,UnresolvedMysteries,ch7etog,5,t5_2wvvc

Its six thousand years older than the oldest known city civilization the Sumerian Ur It predates agriculture which means it should theoretically predate all construction techniques stonecutting techniques writing mathematics logistics et cetera and so forth.And yet there it is defying all of that in a show of beautifully planned and executed megalithic stone structures on a massive scale that even now has only just barely begun to be unearthed. If there was ever a site that demanded a full rewrite of the history books and a hard look at prevailing theories it is this one.

One thing most people dont understand about circumstantial evidence is that its not necessarily bad evidence. You cant base a search warrant off circumstantial evidence alone but you can certainly introduce it in court and use it as much as you want. Opposing counsel will object to it and theyll try to rebut the evidence but that doesnt matter. Once a jury hears it its in their heads. Things generally cannot be unheard once they are heard. Greysmiths best evidence is Mageau identifying Allen as the Zodiac but that is shaky at best.

1532783,0,t1_cj8dvvh,I was seeing the gang thing all over the place so I was just wondering if there was actually anything specifically fueling the idea or if it was just a possible scenario people were suggesting. I agree that three high school aged kids with limited resources none of the kids had much money on them their bank accounts are untouched Eve Ho reportedly didnt even have a passport managing to completely vanish and start a new life on their own with no assistance is incredibly unlikely. I also agree that if they did choose to leave they probably werent running from law enforcement. For one thing one of the kids had actually just returned from China to visit his dad I think?. If he was really worried about being arrested he could have just stayed there. China doesnt extradite to the US even if the kids were suspects which police have indicated they werent. This is such a strange case and the information is so limited. Its sad that the simultaneous disappearance of three young people didnt get more press than this. ,UnresolvedMysteries,cj8esu6,3,t5_2wvvc

Or would she have had to get a ride? If she had gotten a ride she was either met with foul play OR you would assume the driver would have no problem coming forward. UNLESS it was the deputy who had left around the same time as her and feared facing consequences for being negligent or had maybe sexually assaulted her and dropped her off where she was last spotted.,UnresolvedMysteries,cjc6cn9,10,t5_2wvvc

To contact the police you would have to know the police stations number in your area. And well if you dont have that handy you cant exactly google it. Contacting police in an emergency wasnt always so easy. If they had the number written somewhere in the house perhaps she was too frightened by the noise to go looking for it. Maybe she just called the doctor because she knew the number and trusted him as a personal acquaintance. So its not a huge red flag to me.,UnresolvedMysteries,ck20mgz,2,t5_2wvvc
1770270,0,t3_2erqpn,Totally forgot to add my own theory haha. I feel and have always felt like Casey is without doubt responsible for Caylees death but I do not believe it was intentional. I think she attempted to sedate Caylee probably with Chloroform and possibly other drugs such as Valium and she administered a lethal dose. I like to think that Caylee fell asleep and never woke up that she didnt suffer. I think Casey panicked and buried Caylees body probably went into shock and that is how she was out partying and getting tattooed despite having just buried her daughters body down the road. I felt so badly for the jurors in this case. Many received death threats and had to move afterwards. There should have been some kind of protection for them given how highprofile the case was. We didnt need to know their names. They made the right decision from a legal standpoint. I knew that they had to acquit her but my heart still sank when they called out those verdicts. I wanted to see that woman go away for manslaughter and culpable negligence and yet the prosecution didnt even graze those things. Their cockiness and failure to focus on anything besides the firstdegree murder charge is why that woman walked away in my opinion. Cindy and George Anthony Caseys parents and Caylees grandparents drew a lot of attention during the trial. And I have to agree that something isnt quite right there. I dont think the grandmother knew a thing but I had my suspicions about George. Im still not sure about that one to this day. Thoughts?,UnresolvedMysteries,ck2aqse,66,t5_2wvvc
1793002,0,t1_ck55jyb,Some things where I need help from the Reddit community Jestyn trained in the Royal North Shore Hospital. The nurses had their own magazine called Vindicta.   I have never been able to track down a copy.  Can people in Sydney please scour antiquarian shops? In Clelands personal notes on the case he mentioned the man had a Tootals tie. Then underneath where Clelend wrote Tootals he put Patent No.  Dec.  .    I assume this patent relates to the tie.  I have never been able to find this patent on any patent database. Perhaps Cleland accidentally missed a digit or inverted two digits or made some other transcription mistake?  Can someone with more patience than me scour the patent databases eg. Google Patents and try to find the correct version? Another line of attack is can people look in antique clothing stores and find any old ties that have patent numbers on their labels?   Can we find an antique Tootals tie with a similar patent number on it? The Somerton Man had a tartan scarf in his suitcase.  We still havent been able to exactly match the pattern to a clan.   It is a long shot that that tartan represents the Somerton Mans surname but hey we need to check this. Note that traditionally British striped ties slant from heart to sword whereas the Somerton Mans tie that he died in slants in the opposite direction which is a convention the Americans started around .   So it is likely it is an American tie pattern.   In the USA this particular tie pattern is called Old Brightonian today. The question is was that pattern really called Old Brightonian back in ? Or was it something else?   In the USA does this pattern have a significance. For Americans who are the Old Brightonians? Different fonts have names such as Times Helvetica etc.   Ive never been able to find the exact name of the special font that Tamam Shud is printed in.  Can someone in the printing industry find out and let me know?Things that people havent ask me yet  You havent asked me if the Somerton Man was left or right handed. LOL. You havent asked why he apparently has no trapezoid muscles on the plaster bustif he was so fit. You havent asked me why all his back teeth are missing for someone so welldressed fitand groomed.

So compelling as a child Id never see another kid look like that nor had I even really begun to understand death...or who would do that to kid. Both suggestions that it was a parent or a random stranger struck a real nerve in me and the fact that it wasnt solved in due course or at all for that matter planted the crimebuff seed in me forever more. Particularly the unsolved. For years it seemed to be such a huge story and no real answers ever seemed to come of it. Now Patsy is dead John is remarried amp not talking Burke is a normal young man and we still have no answers. When all the John Mark Karr stuff came out I thought maybe there was going to finally be an answer  not the one I was expecting always believed it was most likely the parents but an answer nonetheless. When that all came crashing down it rekindled my interest amp passion. Im not sure if well ever know what happened to JonBenet with  percent certainty but Ill never stop wondering amp postulating on that and many other cases.I think part of my personality is just geared towards these kinds of things too.

2501939,0,t1_cmjv1gm,I have heard a lot of people mention the check but there has never been any evidence that shows that Johns bonus was paid by check.  I would think that he possibly had direct deposit but theres been no evidence of that either.  I have always wondered why Patsy and John stuck up for each other all those years.  If one was guilty surely the other one would resent them after awhile and spill the beans.  But it occurred to me that they would one reason they would stick together for so long is that they could have been covering for Burke.  That reason would cause them to cover for each other for so long.  Its certainly possible that Burke hit her with the flashlight and that Patsy and John staged everything else to suggest an intruder.  People have asked why didnt they just call an ambulance and report it as an accident but the counter argument to that is that they may have feared that Burke would have been taken from them and institutionalized.  John had already lost a daughter and he would have then lost his two children by Patsy which were her only children.  Under this scenario she wouldnt have wanted to lose both her only children in one accident and have it ruin their whole family.The flashlight was found to have been wiped clean of prints including the batteries inside.,UnresolvedMysteries,cml53pe,2,t5_2wvvc

2624238,0,t3_2pxogi,Ok first things first if the tox screen said you had not been drinking then you were NOT Drinking no matter what the newspaper said.If you werent drinking then why did the paper say you were?Because you were involved in a collision where the responding personnel found an exploded case of beer so as a matter of procedure you were charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated until proven otherwise. Suspicion of driving while intoxicated is NOT THE SAME as driving while intoxicated.  Its the charge they use to detain you for testing.In the cases where the person is injured as you were the testing done at the hospital is usually used to determine this.  And in your case when the results came back clean the charges were quietly dropped by police but that part of the story never made the paper because it had already gone to press.The paper simply did not wait until ALL the information was in to print their story.  They did not issue an apology because news outlets are just shitty about that and if they did print a retraction its in small print on some back page of a random issue where no one will ever really see it.  Its shitty but thats just what a lot of newspapers do.Did he switch positions with you to put you in the drivers seat?Based solely on what youve posted about your injuries and his lack of them its likely that you were the one driving and heres why.  If he had been able to move around well enough to switch you into the drivers seat without the people from the other car noticing there would have been no need for the fire department to cut the roof off the vehicle to extricate you. .  The injuries youre describing are consistent with being the driver in a rotational impact.  You were hit from the right side and your head impacted either the drivers side window or the vehicles frame causing the brain injury you mentioned.  The scar on your right leg was likely caused by broken metal andor plastic components of the dashboard center console etc being pushed to the right by the force of the impact on the passenger side the force of the impact would have pushed them into your right knee. Just think about where your right knee is when you drive.A word about the memory lossThe reason you were in a coma for  days is not solely from the injury.  Its also partially due to the fact that your were likely kept in a medically induced coma to reduce stress on the brain until they could get the swelling to subside in order to minimize the damage.    Unfortunately many of the drugs used for this are not just sedatives or paralytics but also have amnesiac properties. Drugs like versed ativan or propofol which are commonly used in cases such as yours are known to cause someone to lose memory of the events that led up to the injury in addition to events after the injury. Your memory loss was most likely either caused by the brain damage you sustained the swelling that happened afterward or the treatment however youll probably never know which one.And remember the tox screen run in an ER after an accident with injury tests for benzos cocaine amphetamines barbituates marijuana opiates PCP and alcohol and if you tested negative then none of that was in your system.  Why was the other guy uninjured if his side was the one hit?Because when you were hit from the passenger side you were thrown to the left impacting the window andor the door frame with your head causing your injuries and He would have been thrown into empty space or into you.The difference is simply between being thrown into something vs. being thrown into nothing.  Why was your seat belt off?If I had to guess based solely on the information in this post I would say you were likely likely wearing your seat belt at the time of impact.  I would think that if you werent you might have sustained additional injuries to your hands sternum shoulders as well because you would likely have been thrown either forward or backward depending on exactly where the point of impact was as well as toward the drivers side on impact.As for reasons to why it would be reported as off I cannot give you an answer but I can provide a few possibilities.  Even though you have no memory of the event you may have been conscious and removed it yourself in an attempt to exit the vehicle..  You may have been unconscious and someone else may have removed it in an attempt to get you out of the vehicle and render first aid..  It may have been removed by EMSfire during the extrication process and documented incorrectly by the police.  .  The guy who wrote the report simply fucked up.  I could be completely wrong about any or all elements of what I said but I hope it helps.,UnresolvedMysteries,cn14hzz,33,t5_2wvvc

Also the link says that they were last seen jogging in Manhattan which explains why one set of keys was missing two pairs of jogging shoes were also missing. The landlord also didnt immediately disappear. He talked to the cops initially and then went MIA for two weeks. I might believe the landlord on this. It definitely seems like something happened to them when they were out jogging  perhaps a mugging gone bad. They were seen outside and their apartment doesnt appear to be staged to cover up a crime scene Sylvias mother was there in pretty short order.

3525010,0,t3_30nfvc,From uDingDongMerrilyOnHi. Regarding the DNA on the clothing do you have any details? e.g. Male or female? How many SNPs and how many STRs were detected? Is there enough DNA to narrow down a halplogroup? Is there enough to say something about ancestral origins? Is there enough DNA to track down who the person is through researching genealogical DNA connections?. What about this DNA says that it has to be the killer? If it is not the killers how else could it have gotten there? Via contact with a public toilet seat perhaps?. Can you say anything about dispersion pattern of the unknown DNA on the clothing? Is it on the inside or outside surfaces of the leggings and underpants? Or both? Is it extensive or localized? Is it from saliva sweat blood or some other medium?. There surely must be parental DNA on the clothing simply from handling the body. How does the dispersion pattern of parental DNA compare with that of the unknown DNA?. Was any of Burkes DNA found on the clothing?. Is there any evidence that the body was redressed in clothes that were not being worn during the murder? If so could the unknown DNA have come from a totally different occasion?. Did JonBenet own more than one set of underwear with days of the week printed on them? ie. was there only one set of Wednesday underpants or were there spares?. There are documented cases of accidental DNA crosscontamination during criminal investigations. Has the unknown DNA on the body been checked against the DNA of forensic lab staff and cops that may have handled the clothingbody and the pathologist and any ambulance men? Human error does occur and it needs to be checked for.,UnresolvedMysteries,cpu2r94,3,t5_2wvvc

I dont think security and maintenance are top rated. That door being left unlocked is far more probable than a conspiracy.As to the water tank lid  it would likely have to be light enough to be lifted by a single individual this is conjecture on my part. If it were a man who was in this situation I think there would less questions focusing on if he were strong enough to lift the water tank lid. Not saying its sexist but I am saying that just because it was a woman doesnt necessarily mean she isnt strong enough. And dont forget if she were in the middle of a psychotic episode she could have been in an hysterical strength state which although anecdotal is something we have all heard about in one story or another.

If I up and left and packed a change of clothes or my spare cell phone charger I can imagine that even someone closely living with me may not specifically notice certain clothes are missing or may see my cell phone charger there and not be aware I have a spare.He does have a large bag with him in the CCTV footage for just a PSP and some money so it is theoretically possible he did in fact pack a few more items than were noticed.The more I think about it the more items I can think of that I could take with me that no one would notice were gone. For instance maybe he meant to take all of the cash from his room but just forgot some. Maybe he did take some more cash with him than we know about.

3823981,0,t1_cqs3msu,gt To think there are multiple killers hunting the Bloomington Indiana bars for young girls the exact same bar on the exact same night Thursday is an awfully big coincidenceThis point breaks down in Laurens case though. She had left the bar hours before her disappearance and visited multiple other locations. Unless Messel followed her from the bar to Smallwood waited  minutes for her to leave then followed her to  North then waited an hour and a half for her to leave to go home. Messel also apparently knew Hannah beforehand. They were familiar with each other he openly talked about her with his family. Theres no indication this was the case with LS. Hannahs case seems to be most likely a crime of passion or unrequited love.The fact that these two events  years apart both revolve around Kilroys is totally understandable when you realize its basically the most popular bar in the area.

Theres a reason why young athletic men would be a very atypical victim type for a serial killer they are physically able to fight back. Honestly looking back to my early twenties I can imagine many of the guys I knew getting super drunk and doing stupid daring things. There is a mindset of invincibility in the young particularly in young men that can make them reckless. Plus as I saw pointed out in an article about one of the young drowning victims young men are less likely to be seen as needing help in getting home when intoxicated.

During the late s the water level dropped dramatically in response to pumping in the Ash Meadows area in the immediate vicinity of the cavern. After the cessation of pumping near Devils Hole the water levels recovered until about  when the water level began to decline. Pronounced changes in the water level resulted in response to the  LandersLittle Skull Mountain earthquakes and the  Hector Mine earthquake. Since December  the water level in Devils Hole has been rising and by December  the water level had risen to its highest level since .

Its investigative in that sense  for example you need to know your witness back to front.  Heres an example someone giving an alibi that the accused was at home at am because they saw him in his room with the light on.  You need to know everything you possibly can especially if theyre your witness so youre the defence and they are backing you up in saying the accused couldnt have done it.  This includes a whether they have a motive to lie e.g. relationship with the accused b how they knew it was am c how they saw into the accuseds bedroom d how they identified it was actually the accused who was there and not a pillow under the blankets or someone else  did they see hisher face? e any information as to how they might be mistaken  do they usually wear glasses and didnt have them on?  do they sleep walk?  do they have vivid dreams? etc.  The reason you need to know this is because THE WORST THING that could happen in discrediting you and that witness would be if the prosecution dragged that stuff out at trial without you having prepared the jury yourself for it.Its much the same outside of criminal law too  in other forms of legal matters.In saying that though I dont want to romanticise law too much.

The police called him the day she went missing and questioned him. All they asked on the th was when he had last seen her. He didnt at the time know he was going to have to account for his entire day until weeks later.gtHe told them he asked her for a ride two witnesses also overheard him asking. Next time he was questioned he said he didnt. On the podcast he said he said he would never ask for a ride since she would always pick up her cousin. His various statements on the ride are troubling and odd I will give you that.gtBoth Debbie and Beckys leaked police statements said Adnan would regularly get rides from Hae after school. those rides though were literally from the front to back of school for track because Adnan was apparently a lazy as hell  year old. Also witnesses said that on the th Hae turned Adnan down re a ride because she had something else to do and Debbie saw them leave in different directions. Inez Butler who may be wrong on the date also saw Hae leave in her car by herself. gtand his sudden reluctance to get the DNA tested.Thats not accurate. He went against his lawyers advice and told the IP to start working toward testing the DNA...the problem is that the IP has to write an argument to get a court to force the state to test the DNA...they cant just say test it and it will magically happen.

4292652,0,t3_3a5g6h,Little Rock AR US here ... the disappearance of John Glasgow is a big one here.  He was the financial guy for the construction company that builds all of Dillards stores.  Dillards is actually half owner of that company.  There were some suspicious emails back and forth with the head of Dillards and most around here suspect they had something to do with it.  He disappeared out of the blue and his car was eventually found at a state park near here.  His car was wiped of prints and there is only one main way to the park.  There is a gas station on that route with a video camera pointed at the road.  They checked all of the tapes and his car was never seen.  Most likely this means someone did not want his car to be seen on the tapes.  There is an excellent episode of Disappeared about it.  His body was only recently found at the park after  or so years but they have not been able to determine a cause of death.General timeline.   Disappeared episodeSnippet from the timeline about Dillards involvement Glasgows wife Melinda releases a copy of a letter her husband had written three days before he disappeared. It refers to tension between executives at CDI and Dillards Chief Financial Officer James Freeman. For Freeman to come down here and say we are dishonest hurt us to the core it reads. It goes on to say we have never been so offended in our lives. The letter suggests that Glasgow wrote intended those words for Dillards Inc. CEO William Dillard. The letter was actually addressed to William Clark CEO of CDI  Glasgow was offering an example of what he would say to Dillard. Dillards and CDI have both said Glasgow was not suspected of any wrongdoing but his letter reveals that there was tension over accounting practices. Im certainly not suggesting anybody did anything to him from Dillards Glasgow family spokesperson Chip Welch said.

4479729,0,t1_csui1tq,Ok its possible. But not only was there not evidence there was just not the kinds of behaviors or associations that one would expect to see even fleetingly in a drugs case. I am too a former addict so I know the scene. And from everything I have read on this case which is extensive I wholeheartedly agree with the investigators drugs were not a likely player in Jasons disappearance though again it is possible. There are too many things which would point away from such a thing namely the presences of money in his accountat  thats a significant amount along with unclaimed paychecks and a car which was also never claimed from the shop. Most murder victims are eventually found so why did he disappear without a trace? I think a motive of sex was more likely. I think Jason was at the wrong place and the wrong time and someone took advantage of the situation he might had been watched for a number of days and at the right time when he was alone he was lured away and taken. I do not think he was a homosexual either.  I think he was just a very shy naive young man who was perhaps too trusting at times. It very well might had been someone he knew even if not very well but enough to not feel at all alarmed and comfortable enough to get in their vehicle. For Jasons sake I REALLY hope this was not the case but something tells me it might had been a sexualmotivated abduction. In those sorts of cases the victim will often go off with their killer willingly and it is not all that unusual for the body to not be recovered or not for a long time. I think this is what happened in this case. ,UnresolvedMysteries,csvc5zt,3,t5_2wvvc

The obvious insinuation being that this is somehow evidence that Patsy wrote the note theres not much to support it. If it had gone to trial it would have gone as well as the Casey Anthony trial did because the experts dont even agree on the physical evidence of the case for example when she was bashed in the head. It sort of went to trial in the Wolf v. Ramsey civil case where Chris Wolf sued the Ramseys for mentioning him as a suspect in their book. Wolfs girlfriend noted that his handwriting was similar to the ransom note and that he acted odd on Christmas night so she turned him into the police. Wolfs DNA does not match the DNA found on JonBenet so he was investigated and cleared.

C. Hoggle was just mentally ill not necessarily homicidal or filicidal.

There is another thing I sincerely doubt that IF she killed them that they werent able to find the bodies for a year.

5161417,0,t1_cv81fs0,gteven if Russia did say what it was or investigators figured it out  with solid evidence to back everything up there would still be people disagreeing and coming up with other theories.Oh gosh yes.  Even if somehow  clear evidence appeared tomorrow that explained everything therell always be truthers.I probably should be clear that while I am convinced the avalanche theory is wrong Im not convinced that Im infallible.    And I am delighted to discuss it and hear just about any other point of view that doesnt involve time travel and yetis or someone just saying because Cracked said so and peaceing out thank you so much for not doing that.  The wikipedia entry I think is a little misleading and not completely accurate.   New snow can be prone to slab avalanches thats absolutely true.  But the tenting site and I am looking through my pile of books now to try to find a decent map I can scan in and upload because youre right most of the maps out there are wildly out of scale and total crap.  In the meantime please forgive me but here is a crappy MS Paint that shows the general layout.  The pass is just that a pass between two steep peaks the peaks are the source for the karman street vortex infrasound theory which I dont fully accept but which I think is a good one.  The campsite is in the pass on the gently rolling hills between.  It is actually on one of the flattest highest parts of the saddle of the pass this is a photo of the campsite location in winter and this which is what I think is the most helpful in visualizing the layout is a modern photo of the campsite taken in summer with the blackandwhite shot of the tent site overlaid on exactly the spot where the tent stood.  It also has a line drawn to indicate the path the party took when they fled and for most of their route they were actually gaining altitude heading upward rather than downward which seems odd if they were fleeing the threat of an avalanche.  And speaking of that blackandwhite shot of the tent as found in situ this is a clear version of it.  It shows the front pole of the tent standing as well as the rear pole one of the partys skis.  The reports of the initial discoverers of the site also both agree that the pitchpoles of the tent were still standing though the middle supported only by a line remember had sagged and collapsed under the weight of fallen atmospheric snow.  Avalanches flatten everything in their path.  Tornadoes will sometimes destroy a house and leave the house next door untouched wind force can do that.  Avalanches have a very different viscosity pattern one more like water.  Unless its an object big enough and heavy enough to break the force like a boulder everything within the clear and definite margin of an avalanches path gets flattened.  That tent didnt get flattened.  A small snow slab breaking from the hills just above their campsite and again between those hills and their tent was a goodsized trough of lower ground Igor Dyatlov had chosen a small rise with lower area surrounding it for the tentsite wouldnt travel far enough to gather devastating force especially not once it hit the trough.    And again if it did hit the tent at all it didnt do it hard enough to dislodge the tent poles.  How could it have incapacitated all nine hikers or why would it have scared them into running a mile away halfdressed to certain death?  It makes no sense.All that aside I want to apologize to you personally if I came off as abrasive at first.  I think I might have and Im sorry.  I tend to get really spun up about the trend to dismiss this incident as proven to be caused by an avalanche probably not the least because the more I have read and learned about Igor Dyatlov the more I admire him as well as the rest of the party.  They were what I and the people I hang out with aspire to be good outdoorsmen and women.  And Igor Dyatlov was a true mountaineer.   When youre out in the back country like that you think hard about who the person who leads your expedition should be because if things go wrong it is literally the difference between life and death.  The people who lead trips like this successfully and Dyatlov was successful until the end are the best of the best.  Theyre the people you look up to and learn from because they model how to do things right.  They are brave but cautious flexible but careful experienced informed calm and levelheaded and generally just really damned good at being outdoors and staying alive.   Igor Dyatlov from everything Ive read was one of them.  He was good and if hed lived I have no doubt he would have become a notable Soviet mountaineer.  To say that he would make such an amateur mistake as to camp in an avalanche path with eight other lives in his charge is something Im not going to accept without proof and the proof I see goes the other way.  But none of that is a reason to be rude and if I was I hope youll accept my apology.  No excuse for being brusque.,UnresolvedMysteries,cv85548,1,t5_2wvvc

JBR was found dead her parents believed Burke did it and they covered it up.  What I am disputing potentially is that perhaps Burke didnt do it.  Go back a few sentences.  Do you know what Patsy or John saw Burke do it?  I havent seen anything from the Burke Did It school of thought that the parents witnessed the actual crime.  What we know is that Patsy and John reacted to the death of JBR with the assumption that Burke did it.  What happened prior to their discovery is more supposition.  The Burke Did It camp does rely mostly on Burkes behavioral issues and the actions of he and his parents after JBR was discovered.

Archaeologists have used it to determine diets and migration patterns of prehistoric humans.  It makes sense to try to use isotope testing to narrow down and pinpoint locations for unidentified murder victims as well.  It works because teeth integrate the isotopes from the water people are drinking and the exact chemical composition of that water will change depending on where you are geographically.  It also takes time to integrate these isotopes and therefore you can tell if someone is new to an area if their isotopes dont match.

5406502,0,t3_3p1gtj,Awesome.. getting ready to scope second episode. points of suggestion not complaints both constructive. First when you cut your vocal tracks the background noise of that track stops with it so either clean up the vocal track OR let an ambient background track just let your mic record silence run so you dont hear the onoff of your vocal track. Second some of the pauses and musical interludes go on a bit long. Early in the first episode there is a silence so long it made me think the track froze both times i listened.When i was recording music with my band we always did a car test. Take the track and listen in your car. It gives you a good idea of errors and levels. Now on to listen to this second episode I have been excited to hear.,UnresolvedMysteries,cw2qofy,4,t5_2wvvc

5408559,0,t1_cw2pfbx,gtThis seems to suggest that the attacks began as a result of packs of wolves predating herds of livestock. If you look close it actually doesnt. For one these two animals were not killed together. Or even seen together for that matter. The witness accounts were always of one attacking animal only if Im not wrong. So either there was more than one lone mankilling animal going at it in the area and when you have more than one how can you know there arent more than two as well or at least one of these two was innocent. One thing is certain it was not a pack.Second when there was body the animals had not feed on it. Only killed. And the beast in question apparently ignored far more meaty easy to kill livestock when it had the chance instead going straight for the human. This is not typical animal behavior. Maneaters are usually old or injured animals that cant hunt the meaty but fast and strong ungulates and they eat their human prey. Accounts of the Beast on the other hand describe an animal that is agile healthy and strong.By the way livestock animals are grazers that dont feed on forests but on pastures so if people were killed in the woods it would be while moving their livestock through them rather than watching the flock over. This might just be poor choice of words on Wikis part though.The paragraph ends with a line that is actually a good argument for wolves not being involvedgtReports note that the beast seemed to only target the victims head or neck regions.This is not how wolves hunt or any members of the dog family for that matter. It is how a cat does it. Wolves make a mesh of bites on legs and the belly of their prey first before they go for the throat. It is time and energy consuming but it is safer for them. Wolves dont have the grabbing paws of cats to secure themselves when they bite and have to rely on the bite itself only. They are likelier to get injured if they go for the throat of an uninjured animal.Canids go first for the throat however when they are fighting other carnivores not hunting. Its more dangerous to them but if successful they neutralize the threat quickly. Carnivores also dont eat other carnivores that they kill unless they are starving. So if this was a canid and not something more exotic it was killing people because it saw them as enemies not prey. And it was wellfed.If a canid it makes more sense that it was a large fighting dog either escaped or used by a human agent. The theory that it was a wolfdog hybrid is an interesting one because wolfdogs are larger and more aggressive than their parents and they dont fear humans like wolves do.,UnresolvedMysteries,cw305cg,7,t5_2wvvc

She went to a nearby grocery store and never returned.Her car was found the next morning on the highway adjacent to the store. There was no sign of a struggle but the seat was adjusted for a much taller person.Danas remains were found a few months later.

5451803,0,t1_cw8h526,gt I have trouble imagining a realistic scenario that doesnt involve a lot of corruption which is a major problem but a different problem Most of these cases are handled by one detective maybe two. It just takes one person investigating on a hunch to screw over an innocent person. Ignoring exculpatory evidence because theyre too bullheaded to admit they were wrong etc. It happens every day. This subreddit is filled with these cases.A good place to start with a scenario is not with some large tangled web involving many people. Think simple. Like assault on a police officer. If a person goes to court his word against the cop everything else being equal if the cop is lying the person is likely to be convicted anyway. Our justice system isnt very just. So imagine someones relative years ago says he was at work when someone disappeared but the cop took notes that day and after the body was found  years later they investigate and determine he was not at work that was his day off. What started as an innocent mistake because he was interviewed  weeks after the disappearance now looks like a lie. The cop may also testify that he remembers the person being evasive or sweating.Heres an interesting tangentially related case that I just read about where a person who was merely ACCUSED of a violent crime not found guilty would likely have been given a harsher sentence by a judge for a different NONviolent crime he was convicted of.This is someone who has never been convicted of a violent crime. And the judge implied he would have increased the punishment and the citys mayor is defaming the suspect by referring to him as a hardened violent criminal even though hes only been convicted of selling drugs. Being suspect alone has dire amp real consequences for people.However identification of an unidentified body is reasonable. Im just not convinced that allowing police to access private databases to accomplish this is outweighs the th Amendment privacy safeguards of stillliving people.,UnresolvedMysteries,cw8iqda,1,t5_2wvvc

If it werent for the fact that he were in amazing physical condition during his prime he probably would have been caught. From what I have read it is widely theorized that ONS lived a high risk lifestyle heavy drug use or that he was horribly ill in some way. Either his condition worsened in some way or he was injured. It is pretty widely suspected that he had a bluecollar line of work. Ive seen lifeguard military his family owned a metal yard etc. At this point he either died due to illnesscomplications or he became extremely overweightweak rendering him unable to continue his home invasion. So couldve been as simple as him hurting his back or something at work leaving him bedriddenrehabilitating for a long period of time resulting in weight gain or chronic weakness. He may have recovered to where he can continue working and living normally but NOT to where he can be vaulting fences sprinting away from people with no pants on etc. Im pretty sure a police dog noticed that some of his tracks may have been DNA? was similar to that of someone on drugs or terminally ill as well.

5559814,0,t1_cwih3so,Thanks for the sources you provide regarding sexual abuse.  In response many of your points are rebuffed here under Evidence Against Prior Sexual Abuse I know it is possible for the hymen to tear whilst riding a horse or exercising vigorously.  It is because of facts like this that I have my doubts about sexual abuse.  it is certainly possible and I wouldnt write it off but there is not enough evidence at present to convince me that JBR was sexually abused.gtIt would be absolutely relevant amp off the top of my head I see  obvious reasons  it introduces the possibility that the child was unintentionally killed during a session of abuse ampor  it introduces a scenario of JBR threatening to tell of the abuse amp expose her secret in the hopes of stopping it.Your point  is valid but  makes no sense to me an abuser would know that JBRs body would be taken to a coroner who would quickly notice signs of sexual abuse.  The only way this would make sense to me would be if the abuser was someone outside of the family who potentially could get away with it if JBR was dead and unable to tell on them.Spreading feces is normal in children.  Im not saying the the majority of kids do it but in young children it is most certainly not abnormal.  Why do kids do it?  To get attention to amuse themselves out of embarrassment if theyve pooped their pants and yes to deter abusers if they are being molestered.  gtSure but there is strong evidence supporting this as a sign of abuseStrong evidence though?  No definitely not.gtWhich brings me back to my main point of this case containing evidence pointing in both directions amp allowing a reasonable deduction based on this evidence to go EITHER WAYI definitely agree with you here.  gtI honestly do not have any idea of the culprit here but believe the parentfamily COULD have done it. I also believe a stranger COULD have done it. If we ever got answers here neither would likely be surprising given the evidence thus far. It is your argument strenuously against the parents that Im disputing  not that the parents actually did it. There simply isnt sufficient evidence to state affirmatively one way or another to the exclusion of other possible causes. Of course everyone is entitled to opinion but this case entitles more than one educated conclusion.I agree with you about this too it could have been her family or it could have been an intruder and without having been there that night theres no way for anyone to know for sure at least not with the evidence we have at the moment.  I believe that the Ramseys are innocent and wanted to make this post because the majority of people on this sub do not seem to share this view so I thought there was interesting discussion to be had.  But that doesnt mean I am disregarding the possibility that one of her family members did this.  Are you really  or do you lean more one way than the other?

5798515,0,t1_cxflzac,Youre right. It just seems weird that a stranger would randomly break into someones home with the expressed purpose of beating and strangling the only adult in the apartment and taking her youngest child. My heart goes out to Ora Owens and I agree with her anger toward the police but I feel like shes holding something back. Her belief that the man at the club who offered her a drink was the one responsible make little sense. Even if he followed her home and knew where she lived why would he then attack her and take her child? Because she refused his drink offer?

5840438,0,t3_3v093d, The ransom note was written when the Ramseys were at the dinner party on the th not in the middle of the night. The intruders had hours to scope out the house and write this ransom note. The bonus amount was given to John Ramsey in January or February of  and would have been on every pay stub that year which could have been accessed in John Ramseys office. Well the rope and the duct tape were found on JonBenet and could not be sourced to anything in the home. If someone was planning on abducting a little girl its not a stretch to think that they would bring duct tape and rope with them. The Ramseys let Burke go with a trusted close family friend. Its not that complicated. On the flip side if the assumption here is that Burke killed JonBenet why the HELL would they let him out of their sight with information that would land them all in prison? They thought to write out a three page note about beheading their daughter but trusted a nineyearold coldblooded killer not to blurt out that he killed JonBenet?

I usually like The Last Podcast on the Left but lately especially in the last few episodes about Leonard Lake and Charles Ng they have gone overboard with the voices and I stopped listening. Its probably more my mood than the podcast itself since thats kinda their thing.  hours is professionally produced CBS News and they cover true crime usually after the perpetrators have already been caught and sentenced.

6289249,0,t3_41jwdz,I fell into a linkhole on this story when I came across it the other day and here are some observations from someone who lives in San Angelo People keep making assumptions about what couldcould not have happened where he ended up based on the idea that there had to have been people or structures or anything other than mesquite trees and livestock around and thats just not true. Having driven from San Angelo to Abilene by way of Bronte before I can absolutely say that if you dont fill up your gas tank before you go you could very well run out of gas along a road with no human habitations let alone an actual gas station in walking distance. Its not creepy or weird to see people pulled over on the side of the road all that land is owned by somebody whos in charge of maintaining the fence line making sure livestock stay in their designated areas etc. Considering only a handful of people own most of that land it makes sense that people would run into friends while theyre out driving around at night  something literally everyone who grew up in a small town has done at one point or another. We just go driving to see what we can see and maybe run into a friend and stop and chat. Dude was upset and had a history of substance use. Its not outside the realm of possibility that he was in an altered mental state at the time. Meth isnt so much an issue here it exists but not as bad as in places like Breckenridge TX where its causing a lot of crime but even if hed just smoked some weed to calm down postargument and went for a drive its possible he got paranoid and took off into the pasture. That pastureland is rough terrain and dangerous and there are no street lights around. Youve got old wells big chunks of oilfield equipment large animals carnivorous animals  if he did freak out after making that call and run off into the woods whether because someone was chasing him or because he thought someone was chasing him him getting injured and dying out in the pasture is a definite possibility. He was last seen wearing plain old street clothes even if it were warm out and there was a full moon for a little more visibility youd need to be a very good outdoorsman or know that land extremely well to navigate it at night without getting hurt.Based on this my theory is that he called  because he was freaked out and paranoid then he bailed out into the pasture and sadly succumbed to an injury rattlesnake bite whatever.

6484109,0,t1_czpsojc,If I may let me respond to a few points.  First I am sincerely sorry for your loss that is a tragedy that I doubt anyone who hasnt been there can truly comprehend.  About the Casey Anthony caseIf hypothetically Caylee drowned accidentally Casey may have been in a state of total panic.  I would liken it to a person who commits a hitandrun fleeing from a car accident.  Some people do that because they caused the accident andor are drunk etc.  But SOME innocent people flee because they just completely panic.Her first instinct may have been to call .  But if her father or some other trusted authority figure intervened and told her erroneously that she would be in big trouble she might have listened.Casey Anthony may NOT have been the person who disposed of Caylees body.  She may have been told that her daughter received some sort of decent burial and she actually could have the scene where the body was found months later had apparently been tampered with as well as having gone through extreme weatherflooding.There seems to be general agreement that Casey was immature for her age and unusually dependent on her parents.  That doesnt excuse but it does help explain her actionsinactions if this was an accidental death.  I would not say that Casey Anthony was fine during the the month after her daughters death.  Her statements and actions seem a mix of numbness confusion panic and denial.  People handle tragedy differently and SOME totally innocent people do respond to the death of a loved one or other disaster by drinking partying and engaging in frivolous behavior.When I first heard of this case I frankly thought Casey Anthony should get the death penalty.  I couldnt possibly understand how anyone innocent could not report their child missing immediately and make up lies about what happened.  However reading further about it has provided a very different view of this case.  I am no fan or supporter of Casey Anthony.  I do not rule out the possibility that she could be guilty.  But I now have a lot more doubt about what really happened and believe that she COULD be innocent of murder and guilty only of what she was convicted of obstructing by making false statements.,UnresolvedMysteries,czq06qo,12,t5_2wvvc

6553357,0,t1_czx57m5,I agree. In short there was a set of keys photographed by police being right under the window that was smashed potentially by the pigs head that were laying on a poof. No one recognised them and they were never collected. And IIRC police didnt even notice them at first they kind of blended with the pattern of the material.As for the crowbar there was a straight crowbar photographed leaning against a fence. The ONLY photograph that was taken of it was a photo focusing on the house but you could see it all the same. This photo had no referencing info with it for the crow bar ie no diagram of where it was taken from and no measurements  its also debatable just how tall it was as they come in different sizes. After the initial investigation it was discovered this may potentially have been a key piece of evidence because his body was found weighted down by a crowbar.... And the time between the investigation for a missing child to finding the dumped body meant that this crow bar could have been the very same one.This  Herald Sun ugh article may help you refresh on some parts.

6661080,0,t1_d08azjk,agree to disagree.  i think her injuring herself or drugging herself and wandering off or abduction is a more likely scenario.  the details make way more sense for it to be that than a botched abortion.  seems like there would be far more blood if it was a botched abortion or the husbandfather would have mentioned her pregnancy or something pointing to that.  considering accidents abductions and murders were far more common than people disappearing after a botched abortion even in  i think its silly to say those are equally likely.  i really really dont get where this abortion theory is coming from.  there is NO evidence for it.  there may have been several hundred botched abortion cases in the s but did they usually result in the mother disappearing?  it makes no sense unless there is some evidence for it.  it is far less likely than a standard abduction cause there are SO many less cases of someone disappearing after wandering off in a daze after a botched abortion than someone just being abducted even in the s.  please point me towards this evidence toward it being an abortion  as i see it that theory is so much less likely than others and shouldnt be treated as the primary theory.  it paints the victim in a negative light and that isnt cool when we have ZERO evidence of it.  i feel like i must be missing something cause i just dont see any evidence for that.  why didnt the neighbor report seeing another car in the driveway if there was a doctor there?  if it was botched selfabortion id imagine thered be WAY more blood at the scene and the people who saw her later and her neighbor would have reported a bloody appearance or something.  i just cant imagine a botched abortion with such little blood ,UnresolvedMysteries,d08b9vo,7,t5_2wvvc

I wonder if the show will touch on his later life at all because iirc he ended up coming around to believing that OJ did it. Ultimately I think he was a decent guy whose judgment was clouded because of his friendship with OJ. If he did gimmick with some evidence I wouldnt be surprised if that turned out to be a huge regret of his I dont doubt his sincerity when he says that he was torn up by what happened to Nicole.

The fact LE ignored Smartt is indicative of the corruption involved in the faux investigation.As for stories of a crawlspace if you indeed read something about a crawlspace filled with cigarette butts youve been lied to.What is known is Smartt was great friends with the corrupt sheriff and even mentioned hed lived for a time with the sheriff. Its also recently come to light that the tenant in  immediately prior to the victims the Sharps was supposedly said corrupt sheriff Doug Thomas.This was not a serial killer or a random hobo. This was Martin Smartt and others. Martin lived two buildings away. Nobody had any reason to hide in some cramped crawlspace the entire idea is ridiculous. The killers walked into the cabin because the doors were unlocked as were most cabins in Keddie. If you were familiar with Keddies upkeep the bigger question is whether the cabins had working locks on the doors in the first place.

As it stands now the diagnosis of autism is based solely on heresay if he actually never visited a doctor. If he WAS lowfunctioning as some family implied it seems less likely that he would have been able to orchestrate a run like that.After reading some of the information reposted here apparently from facebook comments left by a family member? it seems more and more likely that the father may be responsible for the death of this eldest child. Perhaps the mother sent the younger three to stay with relatives and the father reacted violently when he discovered that she had. If her first conscious thought was of Jason maybe it was because she witnessed some of her partners violence towards him before she was rendered unconscious. ,UnresolvedMysteries,d0j69ke,10,t5_2wvvc

7015235,0,t1_d1bhcv8,Interesting points about the grooming and the offender likely being known to her.  Im in the US so I dont know this case specifically but weve had many similar ones.  After reading about too many that have gone unsolved Ive come up with a bit of a theory about who we investigate and who we should be investigating.  In these cases where we think its somebody known to the victim law enforcement does their due diligence and rules out all of the possible suspects who are known to the victim and then it goes ice cold.  This happens often.  I think the failure is in determining who is known to the victim.  We need to expand the circle outwards.  When it comes to a child they are taught to obeymind adults in general...and even though we teach them to not talk to strangers it doesnt take much for an adult to become a nonstranger.  Im going to give a long example but you can summarize it and plug in different events and people and it still makes sense and hopefully gets the point across.  Here goesPicture a decent sized family reunion.  Say fifty to sixty people.  Maybe held at the picnic area at the local park.  A little girl could be there with her mom and grandma and lets say her mothers cousin is there they were so close as kids but dont see each other much now...but are happy to reconnect! and lets say the cousin has brought her boyfriend maybe theyve only dated for a few weeks whatever.  The child already knows the cousin maybe the cousin babysat her once or twice.  The child sees the cousin and her own mommy interacting as equals. The child is introduced to this adult male the cousins new BF and since this male seems to be a peer of the cousin who has acted as a guardian to the child by proxy this child sees the male as someone with the same authority over her.  He is a trusted adult not a stranger she will obey and trust him.  So say the cousin and this guy break up a week or two later...this guy is a flash in the pan and no other family members think about him at all.  But hes still living around in the neighborhood and maybe he runs into the child somewhere.  He reinstates his place as a known trusted adult in her life and possibly and after weeks or months more finds a way to ultimately abduct her. All it takes is for him to see her alone for a second and to invite her into his car.  And this could happen way after the reunion or whatever meeting took place.  When the shocked family is asked about what adults their missing little girl might know or have interacted with this brief boyfriend of moms cousin isnt even considered.I know this is a stupidly long comment but Ive had this thought often in relation to some of the stranger abductions featured here.  In some cases the stranger we are looking for isnt as much of a stranger as we think.  We just need to really widen our criteria and scrutinize every adult who has had any access at all to the child for months prior and maybe only in passing.Whew that was a lot of typing and I know this isnt the right place for this comment.  But reading a case like OP has brought up here makes me think about it.,UnresolvedMysteries,d1biww3,12,t5_2wvvc

7167428,0,t3_4do0y7,I served in Antarctica McMurdo Station four months a year each year from  so obviously I cant offer anything about this case. I can add a little general information to help set the scene so to speak.First off landing a plane at the South Pole is pretty challenging even when launching from Williams Field outside McMurdo during the best of weather. During the winter it would have to be a direct flight from New Zealand meaning the standard planes we used USN back then the LC wouldnt be able to make the flight not even enough fuel to make a round trip to McMurdo and back on a tank of gas. For midwinter air drop the USAF provides both cargo aircraft and refueling tankers to manage the drop made at McMurdo only as far as I know and even then none of the planes land in Antarctica they just drop pallets of supplies via drag chutes. So you have the logistics of even flying that far working against you before you even get to question of the weather. As you can probably guess the Antarctic winter is particularly bad even worse at the pole. I was telling a friend at lunch today how even at McMurdo mph sustained winds in the late fall werent unusual. The pole during the winter experiences even worse plus temperatures many degrees below zero meaning the fluids in a plane may freeze up if the plane is on the surface too long. Theres also a question of whether or not the station itself could provide enough light for a plane to land anyway although a plane has been landed during the winter at least once. One other thing. The South Pole station is located at an altitude of more than  feet so now you also have the issue of landing and taking off at altitude. As mentioned this was done once before I dont have the details available proving its possible to land a plane at the South Pole during the winter but its also incredibly difficult dangerous and probably impossible to justify when human life isnt at risk. A murder is tragic and terrifying at a place like the pole but barring evidence of a serial killer theres no sense risking the lives of a flight crew and potentially station personnel when the best result isnt going to save lives.Regarding the isolation hour darkness and severe conditions and how they affect people at the pole. The answer is even though everyone receives fairly extensive psychological screenings before and after deployment it can take a toll on people. Winterovers as theyre called sometimes freecycle when it comes to sleeping the body seems to work on a hour clock. According to people whove been there freecyclers tend to get kind of spacey after a while. The main form of recreation on the ice as its known is alcohol consumption and the hour darkness tends to cause depression and other problems.So you have a small group of generally young highly intelligent driven people undergoing severe isolation constant darkness little supervision and a lot of alcohol. Oh yeah. The psych screenings are thorough but if someone is needed badly enough a less than ideal screening may be overlooked I cant offer evidence to support this just knew people who claimed it or knew of cases where it happened. Did weird things happen during the winter? Well I remember we once got a request from the McMurdo winterover detachment about  people that year requesting  hacky sacks. We just shook our heads at that request and responded that hacky sacks were personal items and the winterovers should request them from family and friends for midwinter airdrop. To this day I still wonder what they planned on doing with all those hackey sacks. ,UnresolvedMysteries,d1sva7l,92,t5_2wvvc

7189105,0,t1_d1uzc6d,Your quote is interesting but it doesnt give a date or even who is being quoted so I cant really comment on it.But I can say that it is exactly true that the SGA murders razed racial harmony in Austin if only temporarily.  Dozens of newspaper articles at the time show this to be true.  For every rational evenhanded lawman there were imported detectives and thugs who used racism as their main tool of solving the murders.   The murders caused outright terror among all classes and races and the melodramatic newspaper articles stoked that fire of panic.  People wanted these murders solved and Austin descended into a police state as investigators tried to find the killers.  In that atmosphere racist ideology as a means of investigation reigned supreme and ran roughshod over those with clearer heads and an eye to actual evidence.Until the Christmas Eve murders white men were completely excluded from the suspect pool and the Houston private detectives and the Pinkertons brought in to help solve the crimes caused far more problems than they solved.  The Houston detectives led the actual lynch mob after the WashingtonVance murders. I can provide you with links to actual newspaper articles that discuss lynch mobs and fears of violence against blacks in Austin the unsettling way the case was investigated the belief that only blacks Mexicans or those of Comanche blood could have committed the crimes and on and on.  Say the word and Ill link to some of them but its time consuming and I dont want to waste time gathering data if its not something youre interested in reading.But even if you have a lot of faith in that AusChron quote there are far better contemporary sources that again prove that many in Austin were quite willing to let racist ideas take the place of rational investigation.  This does not mean that Elgin is not a righteous suspect.  Doesnt mean he wasnt the murderer.  Just that as modern folk with knowledge of better criminal investigation procedures we should be skeptical of any old case wherein  years after the fact we solve it based on our current understanding applied to old data.Here are some direct quotes from Skip Hollandsworths excellent article about the SGA gtWhen the murders began the consensus within white Austin was that no white man would have any reason to mutilate a black servant woman. As a result Lee focused his attention on black men. Because bloody footprints were often found around the bodies of the victims some black men were arrested on suspicion of murder simply because they were found not wearing shoes.Discussing how progressive Austin was and how that was disrupted by the killingsgtIn contrast to other Southern cities Austin had been accommodating toward its black population. Former governor E. M. Pease had given his onetime slaves several acres of land in West Austin those acres were later christened Clarksville the citys second black neighborhood. Although racism was a given a white servant woman in Austin could make  a week three times the amount paid to a black servant woman Austins black community was bustling. By  a few black entrepreneurs even owned businesses along mostly white Pecan Street. The most popular black saloon the Black Elephant was located there as was a black grocery.gtThe Austin killings however upended the citys race relations. An editorial in the usually progressive Statesman claimed that the perpetrator had to be a Negro afflicted by idleness and drink. Some white citizens felt justified in arguing that deep down blacks would always be savages. Innocent black men found themselves on the run from Lees hound dogs which they called nigger hounds because they believed the dogs had been trained to attack only blacks. Some resorted to the old slave trick of tying bags of asofoetidie a folk remedy that supposedly threw bloodhounds off a scent around their ankles.His article goes on to discuss how the Houston detectives were a source of great strife especially where due process was concerned. Then he discusses how after one black man was acquitted of the murders the focus on nonwhites as suspects continuedgtThe good news for Austins black residents during this awful period came in early December  when district attorney James H. Robertson the mayors brother decided to try Walter Spence the boyfriend of the first victim for murder. After a twoday trial Spence was acquitted. Yet the victory didnt last long After the Christmas Eve massacres of the two white women many of the same black suspects from a year earlier were rounded up once again along with a mentally ill Mexican American man and two suspiciouslooking white brothers found with blood on their clothes in a town north of Austin.Those two brothers? Those are the only two white men considered for these murders until the husbands of the Christmas Eve victims were investigated.Austin was progressive but the town was affected by extremely racist ideas your own quote is an example  the only way to exonerate blacks according to your quote is they arent smart enough to commit the crimes and that those racist ideas took on a decidedly nasty hue during the SGA murders.  ,UnresolvedMysteries,d1vc90l,0,t5_2wvvc

But I think the implications of this theory are really sadinteresting.iirc evidence shows that JBR was knocked unconscious and then some time later she was strangled. Strangulation was the cause of death but left unattended the head injury would eventually have killed her anyway.I think any accident theory can only really account for the head injury. You can accidentally hit a kid too hard but how do you accidentally knock a kid unconscious and then garrotte her?Whats the deal with the garrotte? Best guess seems to be that it was part of staging the botched abduction story along with the note the paintbrush handle the basement window etc. But that means that whoever staged the scene actually killed her.Im still very much jurys out on the whole case but I do lean towards family involvement and within that I lean towards Patsy hitting her too hard and then John staging the kidnapping story under the impression that JBR is already dead. I think the paintbrush handle assault supports this theory  to me it says someone wanted to break her hymen while making as little direct physical contact as possible. Part of staging the scene.

They got together with Freshour and his wife and sat down and wrote a letter to the person whom they suspected was writing them.  Then for a brief period of time the letters stopped.  Then out of nowhere Ron Gillespie received a phone call from someone that infuriated him and he took off in his truck before crashing into a tree and dying.  Then the letters picked up again.  To me it seems like whoever they initially suspected was the one responsible.  Because if this person wasnt involved they would have wrote back or reached out to them to assure them that they werent responsible for writing the letters.  I think they got spooked and stopped briefly.I did read an interesting theory here about how the person they suspected of being behind the letters was the superintendent of schools at the time son.

7538652,0,t1_d2x89qw,Peyote is a cactus and would not grow well in Idaho. It takes years to grow a button or cap that would have to be dried and eaten or made into a tea. The cactus is very small close to the ground and relatively rare even in desert climates. The Native Americans who are legally allowed to possess peyote depending on the tribe and religion do not take kindly to others looking for a good trip. Just identifying the cactus can be difficult. Mescaline peyote has a short halflife and isnt typically looked for in toxicology tests. LSD is the same way and can be detected only a day or two after ingestion. Someone new to psychedelics might have a difficult time if they had taken something like LSD and did not know it.Heroin is a possibility and the evils of those that deal in it as well as meth. Remember that couple that froze to death hallucinating extremely high on meth? They were experimenting with drugs got in too deep with meth and ended up stranded and dying from exposure. Small towns seem to have a reputation with meth and drugs in general because theres a lot of boredom.

7540773,0,t3_4ff2em,Just a few more things to add here in conclusion after a little more research into these cases. First off I should note that Bianchi was cleared of suspicion using the DNA evidence gathered from one of the Rochester murders.A very helpful source for the double initial murders is this video I found on youtubeFormer FBI profiler Roy Hazelwood concluded that the double initial murders were not the work of a serial killer obsessed with the initials of his victims name and this was probably just coincidence. Moreover he concluded that the murderer of Carman Colon was unlikely to have been involved in the other two double initial murders while Michelle Maenza and Wanda Walkowicz likely were killed by the same person. In all three murders the girls were likely familiar with their murderer.The fact that these victims knew their killers makes it unlikely that these murders are connected to any of the child slayings outside of Rochester. Nevertheless given the similarity of some of these murders these profiles created by Hazelwood might be of some use in creating a suspect profile for these other murders.The murder of Carmen Colon is very similar to the murder of Shirley Milberry. The murder of Michelle and Wanda appear to resemble the murder of Stephanie Boller although I dont have very many details on the Boller murder to say this for sure.This leaves the Beth Barr murder as the one that really stands out from the rest. Indeed as witnesses have Beth being forcibly snatched off the street by the driver of a car with out of state license plates this would seem to be one case of child murder being committed by a complete stranger. This case therefore would suggest a serial killer at work. Unlike the others who were strangled Beth was stabbed through the heart. Stabbing of course was the method of one the most most notorious serial killers Jack the Ripper.,UnresolvedMysteries,d2zcled,1,t5_2wvvc

He would have a couple of drinks and then crank call the US embassy in Moscow CIA numbers in Washington and leave rambling messages sometimes with threats of calling the Soviets.  He then call his friend in South Padre Island who was another employee with an axe to grind offering to sell secrets to the Soviets.  Determined to stop the crank calls the CIA visits him in Albuquerque where he either admitted sitting outside the Soviet embassy in Washingto n and pondered going in CIA version or the CIA threatens him with arrest his version.  Knowing the FBI was now tailing him he drove to a restaurant and jumps out of the car while his wife kept driving.  Takes a cab to the ALB airport and books a flight to NY and then Helsinki.  After sitting in the seat next to Lee Marvin on the way to NY he gets to Finland and walks into the Soviet embassy.  I got involved because of a chance meeting with him another person and an acquintance after he died.

Buckingham thought his royal blood was enough for him to be king and he was in charge of the Towers security and had his men placed there. Getting rid of Richard would open the kingship for him and he had antagonism towards the Woodvilles for making him marry an old relative of theirs who did not have royal blood when he was a boy. Margaret Beaufort was always scheming to get her son back in the country and on the throne.

7769749,0,t3_4jrw7g,I just watched the Disappeared episode and something hit me that hasnt been mentioned in any of the other theories. I have this hunch that David may have been sleeping with a married woman. I have some personal experience here  Five years ago I was carrying on an affair with a married woman. We would meet at public places Albertsons parking lot mostly and either I would get in her car or her in mine then we would leave together to wherever it was that we were sleeping with eachother. At a cheap motel most of the time. David lived in a treehouse. He probably wouldnt have a woman at his house. He locked his door and then likely got into another car parked beside his. He left with another driver and then was never seen again. I suspect something happened with whoever he was meeting. I suspect that his disappearance has nothing to do with the contract work or the bricks in his back yard. In fact I suspect that the job with the shady individuals never actually happened. This was probably not the first time that he met with the woman. He had probably met with her in the past during the hour long trips that he took. The whole thing about the barn and the construction site just doesnt make sense to me. Why would construction workers or the old man be elusive about their names? I think that is probably David trying to come up with a cover story to his friends so he doesnt have to admit having an affair with a married woman. Its a bit shameful. I know Ive been there. If I were an investigator on the case I would be looking into couples who moved away or married women that died around the same time as Davids disappearance. I suspect that if this theory is true that the woman he was involved with is either dead or has not come forward because she is scared of her husband. Now I dont know David but another theory that goes along with this one is that he might have been hiding a homosexual affair. If thats the case then whoever he was meeting with could be the suspect here. Summary I highly suspect that he was not meeting somebody for contract work but was meeting a secret romantic partner and either that person killed him or their spouse did. I know that theres not much evidence to support this but honestly theres not much evidence to support ANY theory and I havent seen this one even considered much. Its mostly just a gut feeling coinciding with my own experience. ,UnresolvedMysteries,d3pcwme,2,t5_2wvvc

There was a tip of some sort that led the Bloomington PD to investigate this mans home which just happens to be about  min north of where Lauren disappeared. He also happened to own a white pickup truck which matched the description of what was initially a vehicle of interest and was caught on CCTV when Lauren disappeared.Ive always been firmly in the camp of that she was kidnapped and murdered which I know is an unconventional theory.

7955290,0,t3_4o4o46,Well this disappearance happened in my country so naturally Im extra curious about finding the truth behind this and what I can say is that the only connection I see here is that the McCanns might have used the villa to hide the little girls body. The dogs found cadaver odor on the car they rented  days after the girls disapperance. Since they needed a place to hide the body maybe they used the car to transfer Maddies remains into the villa or out of it? and that would maybe account for the odor on the car and the theory what she was actually killed in the apartment. ,UnresolvedMysteries,d4a8zj6,2,t5_2wvvc

Anyone who could afford to leave and every one else are a lot more tense about the situation. Prostitution is on the rise as well as drug use and crimes that come with it.

8076461,0,t3_4ptj5c,If this sounds crazy its because I dont really understand physics that well but... Ive thought about the hum lately and I wondered if its infrasound. I computed the Hz of the ocean sound and it indeed seems very far below human threshold but I wouldnt discount it. I suspect its actually the effect of a higher frequency.  Per Wikipedia  Hz is considered the normal lowfrequency limit of human hearing. When pure sine waves are reproduced under ideal conditions and at very high volume a human listener will be able to identify tones as low as  Hz. Below  Hz it is possible to perceive the single cycles of the sound along with a sensation of pressure at the eardrums.The dynamic range of the auditory system decreases with decreasing frequency. This compression can be seen in the equalloudnesslevel contours and it implies that a slight increase in level can change the perceived loudness from barely audible to loud. Combined with the natural spread in thresholds within a population it may have the effect that a very lowfrequency sound which is inaudible to some people may be loud to others.One study has suggested that infrasound may cause feelings of awe or fear in humans. It also was suggested that since it is not consciously perceived it may make people feel vaguely that odd or supernatural events are taking place.Doesnt that sound like the hum to you? Its along the same line as this article in that its a low frequency sound wave however at the higher frequency its more plausible that individuals could hear it. ,UnresolvedMysteries,d4nvbp7,2,t5_2wvvc

8123499,0,t3_4qhhx0,One of my favorites tbh.I recall hearing something about the home invasions in the area but I cant seem to find any info on that. To my recollection Darlies supporters and husband pointed out that there had been several recent home invasions in the area with cut screens for entry. I dont recall hearing anyone had gotten raped or injured in these home invasions. Its possible that these were happening and they inspired the coverup story for the Routiers its also possible that Darlie presented an opportunity to a potential rapist who was building up to commit his first major crime and he decided to get the kids out of the way before going after Darlie  but thats a really unusual method for a rapist or a typical breakandenter intruder.Im guessing it was an incidental or purely fabricated part of the case since I cant seem to find any info on those. If you find anything let me know.Heres Darlie at MurderpediaThe website of Darlies supporters still going strong after all these years. Lots of good evidence there but keep in mind they are biased in Darlies favor and may not fairly present facts that work against her.The Dallas News recently did a retrospective on her considering that the murders had their th anniversary earlier this month.fwiw I believe she did it. But the ongoing discrepancy in the details is intriguing. I like it as a story but I feel bad for any mother who has to watch her child grow up without her.After reading the Dallas News segment Im wondering if maybe Darlie had been drugged that night so she would sleep more heavily than usual. What if Darin decided he wanted to get rid of three huge expenses that kept putting him in debt? What if Darin decided rather than hire someone to rob his house and commit insurance fraud it would be cheaper and more efficient to just get rid of the root of the problem?So this hypothetical thief and murderer paid to make it look like a botched robbery assured that Darlie wont fight back and confident he can overpower a couple of small children manages to get into the house with a screen cut from the inside and no footprints? idk.. and discovers Darlie is more awake than he thought she would be. He tries to cut her throat tries to stab her tries to sexually assault her? to no avail. He panics and flees the scene. again no footprints? and the sock? and leaving the knife behind? and not actually stealing anything?,UnresolvedMysteries,d4t5k4c,5,t5_2wvvc

He was also not apprehended until much later in Arizona so really that rifle could just have been about anywhere. They believed it was . or . based on the size of the hole in Gorhams skull they didnt find his body until it was just a skeleton.

8206273,0,t3_4rq9ka,There was a very similar thing going on in Zanesville years ago which is about the same distance from Columbus as Chilicothe. The timelines seem to match up. The Zanesville murders stopped and a couple years later the Chilicothe murders began. Almost all the victims are found in waterways. Cause of death is either being shot or overdosing. Im not going to be the person who says I know this is the same guy because I have no legitimate proof but it just might be. I damn well hope its the same guy or else theres more serial killers near me than I ever thought possible in smalltown Ohio. Before the murders in Zanesville sometime in  two prostitues from Akron lost their lives in a very similar manner and washed up on the banks of the Tuscarawas River. Those cases were never solved either. As someone who lives in rural NE Ohio the amount of places people could dump bodies and NEVER have them discovered is chilling.

8240376,1,t1_d57ft22,gt watched part of the video interview with his parents and it was so obvious that his father is hiding something and most of the time lying through his teethReally? Ive seen all the interviews with the parents read the one from the grandfather and read other stories elsewhere and never got that impression once. In fact this case still seems like a witch hunt to me. Ive not seen any solid evidence anywhere that so much as insinuates the parents are at fault. All Ive seen is rumors and hearsay. A PI that is very shady and not credible at all. Inconsistencies that amount to very very little. A lot of speculation and blame because the parents split up and one remarried which is incredibly common after the death or disappearance of a child regardless of how it came about. A lot of judgement based on the appearance of the parents during interviews even though its well known how unreliable that can be because people grieve in different ways and may look guilty even when theyre innocent. Too much importance placed on failed polygraphs when they are so notoriously unreliable that they arent allowed to be used as evidence in court. Thats all Ive seen. Not one single bit of credible factual information that points towards them being guilty of anything at all. Its very easy for a small child to disappear andor die in the wilderness. Until I see a shred of actual evidence they had anything to do with it Ill continue to believe they werent involved. Edit Also the sheriff seems like a crackpot to me.

8242215,0,t1_d57nn0f,I just finished reading Torso by Steven Nickel. The main focus was the Torso murders of course but it had a lot of information on Ness work in Chicago and Cleveland taking down mobsters. Interestingly the book talked about an unidentified suspect that Ness talked about fifteen years after the Torso murders that he believed was the culprit. Ness referred to the suspect by a pseudonym and never released his name while he was alive. For some reason and at some time after the book was written the suspect was identified as Francis E. Sweeney the main person of interest in modern times. I just thought that was interesting since I hadnt previously heard of Ness discussing a suspect without identifying him. I just assumed Sweeney it was common knowledge that Sweeney was a main suspect back when he was initially being investigated. ,UnresolvedMysteries,d57tz8f,3,t5_2wvvc

I think theres really no need to speculate about various drugs she could have taken secretly when her BAC was that high add in marijuana and what we all would agree is irrational behavior resulting from some mental impairment is a good enough explanation of the events.

8283491,0,t1_d5cza5f,gtMaybe the sex was consensual between Jessica and she claimed she was raped to her family so they wouldnt think less of her. The reason I suspect rape was Jessicas extremely upset reaction when she saw the bust of SM. I dont think most people would come near to fainting if they just saw a bust of an exboyfriend. gtI feel like a child that was a product of rape would be accepted more than a child conceived during a one night fling.No not at all especially not in the s. Rape victims were despised and a child conceived of rape was considered a monstrous abomination. This is actually why in the days that abortion was illegal most doctors would make an exception in the case of rape. It was because people believed that stereotypical rapists were of depraved mind and that their offspring would also be depraved. If my theory is correct I believe he came back because he heard that she had a son. Men can be very weird about sons and the early th century was not incredibly enlightened. Even today rapists will sometimes sue for custody when a child is the result of their crime. Thanks for your kind thoughts!,UnresolvedMysteries,d5czusg,17,t5_2wvvc

I believe it was an investigator in Boise who first suggested Cyanide Man might be connected to the AZ and TX priest murders. Its a workable theory but it lacks any real evidence apart from a belt perhaps placing the dead man in AZ. I find suicide by cyanide intriguing in general. I know its available if someone really wants it but in most cases it would require effort and what I see as cloistered knowledge. Anyways he was the hook for me and I plan to look into his case further as well as search MP databases. I think Reyos is innocent and the priest murders could have been revenge for past abuse or just a repressed individual striking out at his own guilt. Clearly the murders involved closeted sexual encounters and if the perpetrator was wasnt out then it would take dna to solve. I do wonder if the person who committed the murders knew both men were priests? From Reyos we learn that Father Ryan didnt always identify as one so its likely he concealed that side when meeting men for sexual encounters. I have no idea about the AZ priest but it seems likely. It does seem like an odd coincidence that Cyanide Mans fake identity hinted at revealing priests by mirroring their deception. If that makes sense  its a stretch but he purposefully chose a loaded name.,UnresolvedMysteries,d5gm8zt,1,t5_2wvvc

8333846,0,t3_4tcnor,I did not cover this in my post on fundamentalist Mormon mysteries but there is the issues of poofers within the FLDS. Usually the term refers to young girls who suddenly seem to disappear from their families it meant they got married and plural marriages are fairly secretive already with the age at marriage dropping to  and  years old under Warren Jeffs plural marriages became doubly illegal and so doubly secretive but other people have gone poof too. Fred Jessop who was the elderly bishop of the FLDS American community appeared to be removed from his leadership role by Warren Jeffs he did this to anyone who could be considered to have seniority over him in the church and may have had a better claim to the mantle of prophet...this included Fred Jessop the surviving sons of John Barlow an early FLDS prophet and Warrens own older brothers. He then was moved from place to place until he finally died of alleged congestive heart failure in . Fred Jessop had dozens of wives and about  stepchildren all but perhaps one his greatnephewstepson William E. Timpson known as William E. Jessop who Warren claimed at one point was the true heir to the prophet mantle and is now exFLDS and leading a small congregration of exFLDS were kept in the dark about his whereabouts. Edit  And as for disappearing into a cult in  a young man named Jeffery Richard Chisholm disappeared from the Los Angeles area his car was later found on the outskirts of Colorado City AZ which is where the FLDS and Centennial Park sects live. I dont think he would have joined but could he have been murdered by hostile FLDS? Maybe? ,UnresolvedMysteries,d5jaazf,2,t5_2wvvc

8349758,0,t3_4tc9lo,Not so much a mystery but a really curious examination of a somewhat mysterious car wreck Somethings Wrong with Aunt Diane.Diane was basically by all appearances this model mother wife and worker. She had a great job gorgeous family all was perfect. Then one day she drives her car the wrong way down the  highway and smashes her car into another one killing eight people including herself. One of her kids survived her other children and her nieces as well as the everyone in the other car all died. Everyone assumed horrible accident until it was discovered she was high and drunk behind the wheel. Her husband and sister in law who now car for the surviving child spend the documentary trying to prove she might have had a medical emergency of some kind which led her to a confused state andor gave her a pressing need to self medicate with the booze or the weed then once shed had a little of either she lost more judgement and kept consuming. Other speculation is it was a suicide perhaps even a very sudden onset of those feelings the need to die etc and she just followed it. No one will ever know but her but its a really curious watch because you want so badly for there to be a reason it was some horrible accident but....maybe it wasnt. ,UnresolvedMysteries,d5l9u32,2,t5_2wvvc

Most women choose more peaceful methods of suicide  total generalization of course but statistics bear it out.Another thing while it is suspicious happenstance that he was looking up Asian bondage porn the day his sister in law of Asian descent died in a rather bondaged fashion...I dont put a lot of stock into that. When a man gets sucked into the internet porno vortex hes gonna end up looking at a lot of stuff.

8366303,0,t1_d5n9s1b,I dont completely agree with you.  You might be right but it more has to do with oversight.  There just isnt that much.  Like banks and other corporations flock to Delaware to incorporate because of the lax financial laws troubled teen programs tend to flock to low regulation states as well.  Thats why the cluster in states like Maine Utah easily the worst offender Oregon and Wyoming.  Maybe everyone is kinder and gentler but without real regulation which has been brought to Congress numerous times supported by horrifying testimony has never been able to pass.  This is despite the numerous deaths.  One of the most disturbing articles ever written is about a kid named Aaron Bacon.  He was sent to Northstar in Escalante Utah.  I actually happened to be sent to another program in Escalante just a year later.  The now very famous nonfiction writer John Krakauer wrote an article about it for Outside magazine called Loving them to Death  I recommend reading it.  While this is in  another program I would later go to yes I was sent to more than one program called the Catherine Freer wilderness Program closed down in  after two deaths in the same year.  Another disturbing trend is that big business is getting into the troubled teen industry via subsidiaries.  That other program I mentioned in Utah is called Turn About Ranch.  Its the only one that I went to that still exists to this day.  At the time I was there it was still run by its founder.  Currently it is a subsidiary of company owned by Mitt Romneys Bain Capital.  I suspect that similar to the prison system some corporations realize that they can easily turn a profit by cutting costs in programs that cost a ton and barely provide for the welfare of their charges anyway.  Just providing a little less treatment or food or whatever could spell big profits. When Skakel was there it was a worse than what I experienced.  Sometimes on support boards there are arguments among generations about who had it the worst.  The truth is living in that place for two years was nightmare fuel.  There was no way to not have it stain your soul.  A lot of people I was there with thought I was a fucking prick and a sell out because didnt act out and worked my way to the top rapidly.  I spent most of my time there running security and whether they realized it or not I cracked down severely on small infractions hoping to spare kids large infractions.  But heres the thing I may not have been the one beaten on but I was the one sent to do all the dirty work.  I made a choice that I wanted out at all costs and the only way out was up.  In committing to that choice I made a faustian bargain that still haunts me today.  Every time I hear of a peer killing themselves or ODing or dying in some tragic way like one of my peers who died in a murder suicide a small voice inside my head starts to ask if I had some even small part in it.  The whole program primed me to have that response.  It primed me to always feel like some junkie criminal one step away from jail always seeking redemption.  It primed me to feel like a broken human being always trying to prove to the world that I had some value.  It took me years to learn to cope with those impulses but they never go away.  When I first ran security there was one person who outranked me.  As such he had the responsibility of writing schedules although I had to approve the security portion.  He would schedule himself on night post so that he could molest a kid.  The kid in casual conversation said something to me about some strange thing this guy had said.  It just never registered with me at the time.  I was  slept maybe  hours a night and was constantly running from place to place putting out fires.  I was the enforcer when a kid acted out the one who was charged with keeping people in line at every level and the person who was blamed if anything went wrong even if I was sleeping.  I was once woken up just to be yelled at about dishes not going to the right place but had been on the night post the night before and so was taking comp sleep.  So I was literally asleep when this happened and was still yelled at.  At the time I was also trying to get into college taking multiple college classes because I had basically finished the entire shitty school curriculum at  and they had nothing to offer me and trying to deal with the issues that got me there in the first place.  So this one guy who outranked me was about to graduate when he decided to cop to his guilt.  He admitted he was using the schedule to put him in a position to molest that kid while he was sleeping.  All fucking pandamonium broke loose.  The lead director basically knocked all of the top level down in positions but left me to deal with it.  Then she came up to me and said How could you have let this happen?  I feel horrible for what happened but I was also basically being told it was my fault that that staff who had known this guy was a pedophile and had not shared that information with me had utilized the position they promoted him to to molest a young boy.  It was my fault because I could not make the logical leap based on the kid saying to me once in passing while taking trash to the dumpster that he had said strange things to him.  I gave him advice based on what he was saying.  Had the kid said yeah I think hes trying to molest me I would taken that very seriously and immediately acted to protect him.  Instead at  I was being blamed for not reading between the lines in my deliriously tired state.  That kind of thing haunts me.  There is no place in this world for any of these types of places.  They are dangerous but they still exist because they profitable cheap to set up and if they get closed down can just move to another state. ,UnresolvedMysteries,d5nc80b,3,t5_2wvvc

Our town wasnt large but it was on a major drug route so it had a very active drug scene stemming from that. For reasons I cant exactly explain these violent gang members adored me and would help out members of my family and all sorts  but I digress. Basically a woman from my hometown Llangollen disappeared and theres some substantial suspicion that her husband killed her and hid the body but nothing solid enough to convict. Every now and again rumors go around that she saw something she shouldnt have and the Russians took care of her. Now this is demonstrably bullshit but it keeps cropping up and one day I asked one of the Russian guys about it. He told me theyd started the rumor or they were at least spreading it because if people thought you were that dangerous then theyd be less likely to mess you around. I wonder if he did a similar thing  told people youre gonna end up like Damien or something as a threat implying his involvement? gtthe other who said he had never heard of Damien yet Damiens friends said he was one of the ones they brought drugs from.I used to be a runner and I made daily deliveries to many people.

8422072,0,t1_d5uakwu,Yes I find it very comforting that it was so important to tying the case together. I was feeling rather outraged that this was done to him frankly. To have to sit in court and testify to your mother killing your sister is horrible and will haunt him for life. Thats a tremendous immense burden to place upon a child.BUT not so tremendous as killing his sister in front of him. And for him to have had to see that and then go back into that home which would have happened if shed been found not guilty would have been a far far worse thing to live with for the rest of his life.I believe the whole a life hangs in the balance and her life is in his tiny hands was for dramatic purposes intended to do exactly what it did... sensationalize the whole thing.Without his testimony yes the bruises and other things were missed. But he DID speak up and because of that these other things got the attention and second look that they rightfully deserved.I was outraged that the poor family was potentially subjected to prejudice based on their social status of poverty. I no longer believe that. Its very comforting to know that what they put him through really was necessaryand it may well have saved his life. Imagine what it would have been like if this woman did kill Alex and then she killed Adrianna... I wonder what would have accidentally befallen AJ at some point.I agree the jury seemed confident.To explain a little bit more sometimes juries are wrong but sometimes they are right too... and there wasnt enough information included in the opening post to truly understand this case. It was a great writeup but I wonder if an unintended bias came through via the omission of the facial bruising.

Oswald shoots the president but doesnt kill him and in the panic to get away the SS agent George Hickey picks up his AR as the car lurches forward and he accidentally fires the fatal shot that kills Kennedy.

Finally I was so irritated I got up to follow the noise and realized it was coming from my book shelf. I looked really close and in the middle of all my books was the book Lasher and it was just shaking. None of the other books were moving only that one and it was sandwhiched between a bunch of them...I reached out and touched it and it just stopped. Totally freaked out. Still have no idea what would cause it to do that.Whats even more freaky is last week I was woken up by THE SAME tapping noise...it wouldnt stop so I got up to see where it was coming from and when I walked over to my dresser it just stopped. So I turned around and took a step toward the bathroom and it started and when I turned around it stopped. .. so I went to the bathroom and came back and it was still going and I realized it was coming from this cardboard poster this kid made me.

It looks as if he was in the middle of getting his hair cut when he died. There was hair on his body cut hair and one person thinks that is was long enough for him to have been mistaken for a girl. I think that he probably wouldnt allow his head or hair to be touched and someone was trying to work on him. He showed that he had been abused for some time so the person cutting his hair was probably the main care giver AND his abuser. The little boy acts up and the adult loses hisher temper and hits him harder than they realized.

8865145,0,t1_d7czs9h,Maybe not concrete but they certainly had a tremendous amount of circumstantial evidence. He said the same thing to these kids that he said to the other. Jared narrowed the lineup down to him and one other guy. He drove the same car Jared described sans a luggage rack. He matched the description perfectly. He lived a block from  of the assaults. And they knew all of that before Jacob was abducted. He should have been at minimum under constant surveillance. This should not have happened. But it did. And within minutes of that call coming in reporting the abduction they should have had a crew looking for him. His car. Searching the area he lived in. It was exactly the same details. And this isnt New York City. This is rural small town Minnesota. The police department in St. Joseph and every other surrounding city should have been on HIGH ALERT.And even if I forgive all of that I still cant forgive the shit they ignored after the fact.He had suspicious photographs that they caught him lying about during the  search warrant. His tire prints matched. His shoe prints matched. he fit the description. Why didnt they search the area around his home?! WHY WAS THERE NO SURVEILLANCE? He went back to the gravel pit a year later and saw Jacobs jacket. Should we believe that was the first time he revisited the scene? Doubtful. Again he should have been being monitored. Tracked his movements at least.And then in  there were more reports in the same small town of a man in a car following boys on their morning paper routes. They did surveillance and saw the car and traced the plates to him. They never even questioned him about it. That is fucking insane to me.Sorry thats just too much oversight.

Jays insistence that Adnan is guilty in some way after all of these years Sarah Koenig talks to him and he apparently shakes his head in disbelief at Adnans claim of innocence in a Serial episode still makes me believe that he knows something about the murder though... Im still confused on Jay though I believe much much less that hes involved now.I think its baffling that Don was never investigated more thoroughly. Whether the police think he did it or not or if the public speculated it seems SO much more reasonable that he would be responsible initially. They were dating for like what a month? Not too much time at all... Again the BPD may have their reasonings for believing that Adnan did it or that Don didnt do it later on which I hope would be more than those BS time cards that his mom signed off on but its irresponsible to not have seriously considered him in the beginning imo ,UnresolvedMysteries,d7f99hv,2,t5_2wvvc

8923578,0,t1_d7kgj22,I cant speak for Amanda but I am guessing she was scared as fuck and the police had told her they had proof Lumumba had killed her roommate and at that time Knox believed the police. Astonishingly more than  out of  people wrongfully convicted but later exonerated by DNA evidence made a false confession or incriminating statement.If one out of four people say they did it when they know they didnt then I imagine the ratio has to be higher for people who falsely accuse other people of a crime they have no idea about. The police told Knox that they had proof Lumumba did it. It turns out the black hair they retrieved that they thought was from Lumumba was actually from Guede. Knox believed the police because she was young and very naive. So as far as Knox was concerned Lumumba was guilty. Should she have retracted her entire statement? Of course! I believe she will feel guilt over that for the rest of her life. But none of this means she had anything to do with the murder of Meredith!As a matter of fact due to the fact the police believed both Knox and Lumumba were the culprits when one is exonerated then both have to be innocent. ,UnresolvedMysteries,d7khehw,5,t5_2wvvc

9020995,0,t3_52th7y,I think it was an accidental death of JBR. Burke was jealous of JBR he didnt like being ignored and the attention that JBR was getting especially with the pageantry and the time that is needed and devoted. All the dresses and rehearsals that took his mother away from him. If hes spreading feces that is a primal function of marking your territory. Here comes Christmas and if youre a jealous child you dont want your sister to get anything. Even though youre also showered with gifts. That increases the rage factor. The family goes to a Christmas party and Im sure JBR is getting all this attention about her dress and how pretty she looks at this party. Rage factor increased. They get home Burke wants some pineapple and milk. Hes probably made the effort to make it himself. JBR wakes up comes down sees it on the table and sneaks some. This is the tipping point for Burke. He either had the flashlight with him or it was near by. Hes so mad at her. He hits her with the flashlight not knowing how dangerous it was. He uses the train track to poke her to see if shes faking it. Or he could poked her earlier in the day when he was playing. He eventually has to tell his motherparents what has happened. The mother having some Munchausen syndrome How could she not having been a pageant girl and living vicariously through her daughter. She decides to make a  page short story about a kidnapping and ransom to protect her son. She then has the father make it look like a kidnapping. Now the mother is showered with attention. Who does she call after  her friends early in the morning. Isnt finding your daughter a higher priority that what the F your friends think?

He misstates information about cases casts all type of shade at search and rescue and government workers will not acknowledge well documented syndromes such as paradoxical undressing really over exagerrates the effectiveness of wilderness searches in finding lost people on and on. He also says just weird stuff. One of his patterns is that people tend to disappear near bodies of water. One of his big examples is Yosemite  because its near the Pacific Ocean. I cant tell you how boggled my brain still is by this statement which i heard over a year ago......Yosemite is hundreds of miles the Great Valley and a couple mountain ranges away from the ocean. At the same time the park is full of streams rivers lakes ponds........He is very well spoken and knows his facts. But he makes no sense its like he lives in a parallel universe. He also makes people needlessly scared of enjoying the outdoors and needlessly angry at the big government conspiracy.If you want his book shop around as theres people out there over charging.

Its that Lovecraft was one of the earliest scifi authors to write about ancient beings coming from another planet and influence ancient human history. He wasnt the only one doing so but he WAS the one who had writer friends and fans who started up a shared universe which gained popularity and he just happened to be writing at the same time as Spiritualism was gaining popularity in the US. And because his books were such a cultural touchstone they ended up influencing a lot of scifi that followed and that mix of scifi very clearly influenced von Daniken and his ilk because beliefs like Spiritualism had latched on to similar ideas and spouted them as fact not speculative fiction.,UnresolvedMysteries,d80c8ai,10,t5_2wvvc

9071727,0,t1_d824ja1, You are verging on being intentionally obtuse. There is no evidence that anyone other than the family was there. No finger prints or DNA. The murder weapon was from the house the pen that wrote the ransom letter was from the house and the paper used in the ransom letter was from the house. There is also the fact that NO ONE in the history of kidnappings has ever written a ransom note on the spot. You cannot assume an intruder with out evidence suggesting there was one. I cant state this more simply everything found has its origins in the house no where else. So the fact that the mag lite matches up exactly to the hole in Jonbenets head isnt proof enough. Even if it wasnt your suggestion of the baseball bat is irrelevant. It wouldnt alter the facts of the case. And where was the evidence of sexual assault? A broken hymen isnt necessarily proof of penetration. It happens all the time from casual play. And the DNA found in the panties could have easily been there from the manufacturer. Testing of one fresh from the store showed DNA as well. There is no real proof of a sexual assault heir go no rapist. The ransom note served no purpose if it was an rapist. If it was a rapistmurder it was a work of fiction. It wouldnt have stopped or slowed the investigation since he left the body on the property. If a rapistmurder had gone through such an elaborate ruse it would have made more sense to take the body. Leaving it only removed any value the ransom note might have had. Lets assume it was a classic kidnapping for money. Why kill her then? Kind of ruins the point and just how hard would it to kidnap a  year old girl? And again if he had just taken the body he still might have continued with the kidnapping since no one would have known she was dead. The only purpose the ransom served was as part of a staged crime scene that the Ramsey failed in finishing. The grand jury is a tool by which a DA can file charges. A DA can get a grand jury to file charges against a hamburger since all their information comes from the DA. Why in the hell would a DA not file charges when the grand jury said to? Why did the chief investigator resign when the DA shut down the investigation? This being the DA that said they were under the umbrella of suspicion. And what is the evidence that the judge ruled on? And the Ramseys did refuse a full search of the house by police initially. It was John who discovered the body not the police.I go where the evidence suggests. Assuming an intruder is that an assumption. If this was a case where a husband finds his wife dead after returning home almost as a rule he is a suspect. This case is no different. We either have a kidnapperrapistmurderer sneak into a house with out leaving any evidence write a  page ransom note on the spot using tools from the house murder Jonbenet with out anyone hearing it and escape with out disturbing anyone. Or Jonbenet was murdered by her brother who as a  year old didnt understand the consequences of his actions who had struck her with a golf club in the past and whose parents foolishly tried to hide with a poorly conceived kidnapping scenario. No which of these scenarios makes more sense? The one that requires a Ninja or the one that was agreed on by a room full of FBI agents and two of the most important forensic scientists on the planet.,UnresolvedMysteries,d829wa4,-1,t5_2wvvc

He interrogated Preston and basically halfleveled charges against him that effectively ban him from ever coming back to Italy.

He lives a decent life he comes from a rich family he studied in college he lives happily the rest of his life.Do you know whose life was ruined? Jonbenets. Nobody convicted Burke for anything. Its just there are various things that do not add up. Shouldnt these things be brought up? If every evidence points inside the Ramsey household and not outside and you are really very wrong if you believe that there is no actual evidence if you dont consider documentaries a good source of information you can try the Jonbenet Encyclopedia system which consists of most of the case files data should one not pursue more persuasive answers from the only people in the picture who happen to be the immediate family? When there are pineapple bowls magically appearing on kitchen tables when there are ransom notes magically written within the household when there are items that belong to the family like the flashlight or their photo album and after Jonbenets death they seem to not recognize them anymore shouldnt all these things make one assume that if not the family has to do anything with Jonbenets death which is a perfectly logical conlussion one could make due to the lack of direct evidenece they show at least a great level of confussion about the state of their household and the events of that Christmas night?,UnresolvedMysteries,d8c4ryo,1,t5_2wvvc

Thats a seriously wellwritten comment!  Well done.  gt while they certainly knew that killing was a grave wrong they may have had no sense of how much worse this was than their usual crimes just how much trouble they were facing if caught.I got this impression with Fred West as well who was a bit of a childlike simpleton at times.  He was so completely surrounded by other vicious perverts Roses father his own brother Rose herself some of Roses clients perhaps his own parents and was punished so lightly for the rapes  and molestations he committed before and during the murder spree that I really think he came to believe that he was a reasonably normal man and wasnt doing anything particularly extreme or unusual  that sexual assault was no worse than buying tyres on the black market or stealing materials from a building site.  He knew that murder was wrong and hed be jailed for it but he seems to have sincerely convinced himself that it wasnt really that wrong.The casual way he confesses is horrendous to hear on the police tapes.

9204827,0,t1_d8ip5mv,Have to say if I was panicked about my child being missing I cannot guarantee Id be able to recall every little conversation or offhand comment I may or may not have made in the past few daysweeks. Youre not likely to see any coverage of that because people forget conversations in nonstressful times. Add in the stress of your kid being missing and likely very hurt and the chance of forgetting is likely even higher.My father would call home to check on my sister and I shortly after getting to work when we first started staying home alone and not going to a sitter for the day. Hed call later as it became more commonplace for us to be home alone but the first few times were definitely fairly early calls. I imagine if we were home alone when there was a storm with reports of tornados touching down going over head we lived far enough inland for hurricanes to be wildly unlikely hed have called more often again. And I have no doubt that if we didnt answer the neighbors would be called to check on us and hed likely have headed home as well.Not ruling out the mom as a possibility just saying that not remembering mentioning something to someone and calling home after only an hour at work to check on your kid on the first day theyre home alone during a hurricane are really poor reasons to consider her a suspect.,UnresolvedMysteries,d8is3zf,99,t5_2wvvc

9297992,0,t1_d8uhech,gt Let me preface by saying I was  in  and grew up  min from Springfield. So keep that in mind. I never once found it weird their friends went into the empty unlocked house. For one thing it was a different time in a pretty safe area. Locking doors was for the rich and the paranoid. Me and my high school friends were constantly letting ourselves into each others houses and I spent plenty of time alone in friends houses. Expanding on that Stacy and Suzi had plans set it was totally reasonable for their friends to let themselves in and wait for Suzi and Stacy to come back. No cellphones you made plans with times and if you couldnt reach your friend on the landline it was normal to just drive over assuming theyd be there when you arrived. If they werent home and the door unlocked it was pretty reasonable for them to go in and wait. Even cleaning up the porch light wasnt all that weird for the friends to do I often pitched in at friends houses with choresetc and wouldnt have needed to be asked. Especially if it involved broken glass! The house didnt look like a crime scene to the untrained eye the last thing they would have thought were the women were abducted. So to me the friends and families going through the house was just bad luck.Im about a decade older here and completely agree with what youve stated. We didnt have cell phones youd just go over to peoples houses and it was considered very polite and helpful to clean stuff up.Especially broken glass!,UnresolvedMysteries,d8ul5cj,5,t5_2wvvc

Geneva Pittman who was BBs niece claimed to know from records in the family bible that BB was born in  as Oliver Roberts which would have made him about  at the time the Kid was presumed to be killed. Oliver Roberts was recorded in the census numerous times at the right age for the year the census was taken presuming the  date of birth. There is also Deluvina Maxwell who was a friend of Billys in Fort Sumner and helped prepare his body for burial. She remained bitter towards Pat Garret until his death.Finally some of Brushys statements match up better with dime novels than with documented history. For example the story of Billy and Brushy swearing revenge during John Tunstalls funeral is straight out of The Saga of Billy the Kid which was published in . Billy wasnt there he was being held by Sheriff Brady and apparently quite pissed off about missing the funeral among many other things.

Overall its an interesting nonfiction book about how and why some people choose to disappear.  She does say that attempting to disappear now is extremely difficult as opposed to before the Internet along with the more stringent requirements to prove your identity for a new ID.She uses examples of those who tried to fake their own deaths and failed and she also goes through the motions to fake her own death as an experiment not a reality and succeeds up to a point she never followed through of course using the fake documents she acquired in the Philippines.Edit Oh one more thing she says it is not against the law to disappear.  It is against the law to use your disappearance or faked death for monetary gain insurance fraud for example.  You can disappear you just cant do anything illegal to make that happen or to assume someone elses identity like Hoagland did. So bon voyage!,UnresolvedMysteries,d9dnsae,7,t5_2wvvc
9450811,0,t3_5a5clz,I cant remember his name but there was a Canadian man that fled to the US flew around the country drove around the country some more and was found murdered outside his hotel room with his pants yanked off. I just read it on one of those Cracked lists looking for it now. Edit Blair Adamsfrom link On a gray July morning in  strangers found a dead man beaten and halfnaked in a parking lot in Knoxville Tennessee.  Scattered around his body was German Canadian and U.S. currency totaling nearly .  The contents of the mans wallet identified him as yearold Blair Adams of Surrey British Columbia.  Lieutenant Jim Jones was the Chief of Detectives for the Knox County Sheriffs Department at the time Blairs body was discoveredEvery aspect of this case is mysterious theres no explanation for it.Why did Blair go to Tennessee?No one knows why Blair Adams left his home in British Columbia or how he ended up in Knoxville Tennessee.  Could he have been running away from a killer or just running away from himself?Before his mysterious death Blair was a foreman with a construction company in Surrey British Columbia.  Those who knew him say he liked his work and did it well.  However in the summer of  Blairs cheery demeanor began to change.  According to his mother Sandra Edwards Blair began having wild mood swingsSomething was obviously very much the matter.  He hadnt been sleeping well.  Something was wrong.  I asked him numerous times what was wrong.  And he said I dont think I should tell you about it.  And to this day I dont know what it is.Blairs strange behavior came to a head on Friday July  .  He withdrew his savings and emptied his safe deposit box of more than  in cash and thousands more in jewelry gold and platinum.  It was the first stop on his deadend run to Tennessee.The next stop was the CanadianAmerican border.  On Sunday Blair tried to enter the United States.  But as an unmarried young man carrying a large amount of cash Blair fit the profile of a drug trafficker.  He was refused entry.  The next day Blair showed up at his job.  But he wasnt there to work.  He asked his boss for his check and quit.Blairs erratic behavior continued.  That afternoon he spent  on a round trip airline ticket to Frankfurt Germany.  His flight would leave the following day but just hours after buying the ticket Blair was again desperate to get into the United States.  He showed up at a friends house in a panic terrified that someone was trying to kill him.  But his friend was unable to take him over the border.Then on Tuesday instead of leaving for Germany Blair turned in his tickets rented a car and headed back to the border.  This time he managed to slip through.  He ended up in Seattle where according to Lieutenant Jones he bought a oneway ticket to Washington D.C.He paid about  for a oneway ticket when he couldve purchased a roundtrip ticket for approximately  or .  So it wouldve been half the price for a roundtrip ticket as he paid for a oneway ticket.  It just seemed very unusual.Blair arrived in D.C. early Wednesday morning and headed to Knoxville more than  miles southwest.  Perry Moyers a detective for the Knox County Sheriffs Department was one of the many perplexed investigators working on the case I mean why go to D.C. to turn around and come back to Knoxville?  He had no reason to be in east Tennessee.  He had no reason to be in Knoxville.  He knew no one in east Tennessee or the eastern United States.Blair was first seen at a gas station in Knoxville around  that afternoon. He complained to the gas station attendant that his car wouldnt start.  The attendant told him he had the wrong keys.  However the rental car company was already closed for the day.  Blair was stranded in Knoxville until the morning.  Luckily he was able to hitch a ride to a nearby hotel.Ticca Hartsfield an employee at the hotel remembered Blair vividlyThe best way to describe him would be paranoid.  He just was very nervous agitated expecting someone to come in on him even though there wasnt anybody there.  I dont know who he was looking for but he was waiting for somebody to walk in for him.The hotels security camera showed that in the space of an hour Blair went in and out of the lobby five times before finally paying for the room.After checking in Blair pocketed the key to his room.  But instead of going to his room he marched out the front door and never came back.  It was  PM the last time Blair Adams was known to be alive.Twelve hours later Blairs body was found in a parking lot about a half mile from his hotel.  He was naked from the waist down. Lieutenant Jones recalled the gruesome sceneHis pants were removed in a way not like someone would take their own pants off but in a way that someone else would remove your pants from you.  His socks were turned inside out.  His shoes were off and his shirt was ripped open.Scattered around Blairs body was  in American Canadian and German currency.  A small pack held another  worth of gold and jewelry.According to the autopsy report Blair had sustained many cuts and abrasions. Police believed some of the wounds came from fending off an attack.  Blair was ultimately killed by a violent blow that ruptured his stomach.Although Blair thought his life was in danger authorities believed the threat was imaginary and that Blairs journey was an escape from his own delusions.  Either way Blair Adams wound up dead just as he had feared.,UnresolvedMysteries,d9dygjj,85,t5_2wvvc

The likelihood that anyone who knows the truth is still alive and going to talk drops with each passing year.If he was neglected and abused few people may even have known he existed and all it would take is an itinerant family or a sudden move for no one but his killer to even realize he was missing in the first place.Doing research on my own family history I realized through public records that I had a great uncle who died as a child not mysteriously just sadly. His father died young and his mother and siblings never spoke of him to anyone else so it only took one generation for his memory to disappear his eventual nephews and greatnephews and nieces had no idea he had ever existed.And that was without anyone intentionally hiding his existence just an example of what can happen easily when someone dies as a small child with few connections outside their own family.,UnresolvedMysteries,d9ivntw,18,t5_2wvvc

9691802,0,t3_5dr3hj,I would look at how the family was able to remain wealthy. After World War I Germany suffered heavy financial problems so the fact that this family who were farmers were quite wealthy raises several questions in my eyes. Farming is very difficult because you rely on the weather for crops and if you have poor weather it just causes money to disappear so unless the Grubers managed to have a series of successful harvests that resulted in money being left after taxation the money needs to be investigated. My theory is that the Grubers were being punished by someone the patriarch wronged or else family members of the person Andreas Gruber wronged perhaps Andreas Gruber gained his money in illicit ways. Im not really knowledgeable about the taxation system in s Germany so if anyone knows it better please help. Also this is just a theory. It may or may not be true but to elaborate on my theory the reason why I believe the money was never touched is because the killers viewed it as blood money.  Also could the mysterious newspaper have been in low German? Until Prussia created the German Empire the area that makes up Germany was composed of independent sovereign states that spoke different dialects of German. Bavaria which is were the Grubers lived uses high German which is extremely similar to Austrian while regions north of Bavaria Brandeberg for example uses low German. As my dad says high and low German are quite different from one another so the paper could have been printed in northern Germany.,UnresolvedMysteries,da7pxrg,2,t5_2wvvc

The popular idea that heavy drinkers arent much affected by alcohol is mostly false theyre better at concealing the effects through practice but they arent exceptions to human biology.

Ive both taken and administered Ambien to others many times and while it can cause strange behavior especially in the early stages its more likely to make someone either go to sleep or if they didnt know they had taken it worriedly report to others that they were feeling very strange. Not immediately down half a bottle of vodka and toke up then take the kids for a drive.We know she did drink an enormous amount of alcohol and use weed before or while driving.

9773978,0,t1_dahsajt,Definitely some food for thought. Ive heard the link between young girls and elderly before. Further research in to Gene suggests his first victims were pregnant teenagers but I couldnt find specific ages. I guess this narrows the perceived age gap between victim types. Id like to know more about the crimes Gene was convicted of. Something seems so off about the fact that he only served  years in prison for the abduction and rape of two teenage mothers. The sexual assault on the three young girls seems to have been pretty violent and I would have hoped that if he had shown the same degree of violence in his previous crime he would have served more than three years. Were the victims known to him or random? Was it a one off or prolonged abuse? So far the only evidence I can find that directly seems to tie Gene to the crime scene are the photos found in the nearby cave which from what I can gather depicts adult women but I dont have confirmation of the ages.In regards to BundyI know there is circumstantial evidence linking him to the murder of an  year old which if correct would have been his first murder at the age of  which would explain the deviation in his fixed typeThere was also the murder of  year old Kimberly Leach his last victim and widely considered to be a major break in his pattern and cited as a sign he had completely lost any remnants of control he showed in his previous crimes. She still physically matched his victim type but was younger then his previous victims. From pictures Ive seen of Kimberly she could easily pass for over  and I dont feel its a massive change in victim type. In Bundys later interviews he seems disturbed and is unable to talk about the killing of Kimberly. Although other sources seem to claim hes said he killed Kimberly in self defence I cant find any reputable link to confirm that claim. years is one of those odd ages personally I started puberty at  and was pretty developed by  I could easily have passed for older where as other  year olds are still prepubescent and physically resemble children. I understand your points about serial killers rapists who deviate from victim type being extremely possible but often the deviation is due to a complete loss of control or a murder of circumstance the victim sees or hears something that they shouldnt.

9784846,0,t1_daj3lxx,Thank you for taking the time to read all of the sources and discuss with me  It is sad that there is so little information available about Jerry. I think this in and of itself can tell us a few things. First it may simply tell us that Jerry was a young man of color who also happened to be a fugitive. He is not type of victim society is known for remembering  especially over twenty years ago. Or it could tell us the police have information about the crimes Jerry supposedly committed and his murder but are not releasing them to the press due to the investigation. Im not sure this explains why so little is available about his actual personal life though.  I have found that many families claim this about the family members who go missing. I have always interpreted this as meaning that their missing family member would not travel or leave town i.e. run away from their life without letting someone know. I do not think it literally means they wont go the next town over  its just the familys way of saying they dont think the person would abandon their life. I think many families may be biased and say this because they dont fully understand whats going on in their family members life or cannot cope with the fact that they may be missing. But I have read cases where people say their family member had ducked out of town unannounced before so maybe some families do have good insight about this.  I think this is a good assessment. I think the short pause may be due to the murderers shock. I dont think he ever planned the double homicide but things got out of control quickly and he acted without thinking. Due to the public nature of the cemetery it doesnt seem like a good place to murder someone so I dont think it was planned yet there seemed to be plenty of crimes that occurred there so maybe Im wrong. Yet I feel quickly mugging someone in broad daylight is much less dangerous than murdering them.The following points assume the double homicide was committed by the person who committed the following crimes ... while it makes sense on one hand on the other the cemetery has a long history of criminal activity so who knows ... The murderer may have been a copy cat killer or someone who another criminal gang involvement? took under his wing ... First I thought this was a very sad incident and that the man who was cornered sounded like a badass. Actually this case happened on   almost a year after the double homicide. This still makes me wonder though. Did the perpetrator decide to stop carrying a gun after the double homicide? I wonder if the previous incident with the double homicide made him so shaky that the widowers actions really scared him. In the incident that occurred later that day he only shoves the person  it doesnt sound like the threat of a gun was involved.  This is possible. Forgive the shitty link but according to this article   the FBI started keeping criminal DNA on file to help identify future criminals. This begs the question when did Jerry commit his first offense? Some people can stay under the radar for years especially if it is for a less serious crime. So would they have his DNA on file? It isnt available in NamUs. I did consider the possibility that Jerry as one of the two stockythin men but I dont think he fits the profile very well. I didnt find anything about Jerry using substances. Was that an impression you got or did you find a source? I honestly wouldnt be surprised though. My guess is that Jerry may have been surrounded by people who participated in criminal activity and may have participated as well. Drugs definitely go hand and hand with that though!I absolutely agree with the timeline. I feel like the crime occurred in broad daylight and the perpetrators if Jerry wasnt one of them would have known that day if he was there. I dont think that the discovered that later and killed him. Is it possible that Jerry was at the crime scene and was supposed to assist the murderer perhaps they had worked together in the past? Did Jerry back down or run away during the crime or the shooting and the murderer decide to retaliate out of anger and to protect himself from criminal chargers?  Did Jerry overhear something he wasnt supposed to? Did Jerry think turning the murderers into the police would affect his own charges or did the murderers think he thought this?  I personally dont think Jerry committed the acts but could believe that he was supposed to or that he was supposed to drive the getaway car or something. I do think with cases like these lots of supposition is natural. Its so funny on one hand it seems we know nothing about Jerry  on the other it seems we know more than we would in other cases where a random body is found. Yet it is still very mysterious! I live close to West Haven and its crazy to me SO MANY crimes happen at that cemetery. I have to admit I live close to the town and only go every month or two to visit a friend take my cats to the vet and do some specialty shopping for anyone reading this in the area check out Curious Goods it rocks! so I am not an expert. West Haven has never seemed like a great town to me. The downtown area is pretty run down it has a trashy reputation. But I wouldnt have expected so many crimes to happen at one cemetery there! It blows my mind.Please dont apologize. I find that longer posts on this forum are rare and not all cases have the rabbit hole effect. I really appreciated you took so much time to read more about the case!I also edited in that you found some sources he was  ... I missed them!

If he was awarded an Expert Infantryman Badge he would have had an Infantry MOS and likely had One Station Unit Training at Ft Benning GA which is  weeks . months and probably finished mid September .

Reading about how the government whose support likely couldve prevented hundreds of thousands of deaths basically didnt give a shit and some of the leading scientists who actively sabotaged the research in favor of their egos  I almost threw the book across the room many many times. Yeah the days before ARVs were horrible. Entire neighborhoods were just wiped out. An entire generation of incredible talent. We Were Here is an amazing documentary about the early days of the crisis in San Francisco and the devastating impact it had told by those that lived through it. Its incredibly powerful and really shows the absolute fear and uncertainty they lived with every single day. One of the more unknown stories of the epidemic it covers is the role women  the lesbian community in particular  played caring and fighting for those infected.  gtIm very sorry about your father.Thank you. I was pretty young when he passed almost  and despite him passing away from the disease I was unaware of a lot of it until I was a bit older.

This was back when it was a death sentence and I remember thinking why anyone would EVER have sex and risk dying I was like  or  at the time lol.

She looked very relaxed as if she were sleeping when her body was found. A typical cold water drowning would be eyes open mouth open hands and arms in a very clawed state according to Gordon Childress SAR who found Debbie.     The idea that Debbie accidentally drowned is ridiculous. The pond is three feet deep until about five feet from the shore. How could someone fall into the middle of a pond?     The voice message is strange. It should be taken more seriously.     The volunteers at the hospital should be looked at more closely. One did have an alibi but how closely was that investigated?

One time I was drinking and got into a cab to literally go in a straight line to drop me off in front of a friends. It wasnt until half way through the cab drive I realized the cabby was going in circles of course  since the meter was running!.Given the altercation he had that night I am inclined to believe that something sinister happened involving that group he had an altercation with. I wish it was known what the altercation was about  if it was a hey you bumped into me type then I would dismiss it. However if it was a longer standing feud involving friendshipsrelationships then I definitely think it could have gone further. Im not familiar with this area but were the woods close? Have the woodsriver been searched? Due to the disorganized state of all his belongings I think foul play could be a possibility. I think we could rule out him being run over given there was no such scene. I pray his family can find him alive. ,UnresolvedMysteries,dc6f70r,10,t5_2wvvc

I saw higher up on the thread someone saying maybe she was just randomly dialing numbers to try to get help or buttdialed. But what are the odds that  random number dialing will yield two actual numbers? The area codes she dialed could have been the same one as her own phone but its not unlikely that a randomly dialed number will not connect to an actual phone. And if it was a buttdial how did she manage to dial not one but two local and connected random numbers? Im not sure that these calls should be discounted so quickly  not that the people who own the phones are involved in any way but who WAS she trying to call? ,UnresolvedMysteries,dc7a00p,6,t5_2wvvc
10264483,0,t1_dc5tmri,Im going to have to disagree with you on Hodels book.  I found it very compelling. He admits that the photo in his late fathers possession was not Elizabeth Short. But that picture is what got him interested in investigating why his father had all of these photos of women with their eyes closed. Which lead him toward his father being the possible murderer of Elizabeth Short. Hodel was a retired yr LAPD homicide detective Not just some guy with dad issues! Turns out his dad Dr. Hodel who was a venereal disease doctor in Los Angeles he was also a child prodigy in music and published a strange sexualized fantasy newspaper as a teenager  an interesting character was the LAPDs TOP SUSPECT in the Short murder to the point that they had  phone surveillance on his phone. But the doctor fled the country before an arrest could be made. He was also incriminated in an incest case involving his daughter Tamar.There were a number of other murders in Los Angeles Hodel calls the lone woman murders and he makes a good case that there was a serial killer on the loose which could have been his father. Dr. Hodel had strong ties with surrealist artists which his son believes tied into the very strange desecration and posing of her body. Theres an entire book about murder as fine art that ties in. Black Dalia Avenger is my favorite true crime book and I highly recommend it to true crime aficionados. both as a personal story about a retired detective investigating his father the cases he investigates and LA in the noir era.

10290901,0,t1_dcahtpp,Its very possible.Unfortunately radar is not infallible. There are two types of radar. Primary and secondary. Primary radar is the radar you have already heard of. It sends out a pulse of radio waves and listens for them hitting objects and bouncing back to the receiver.Secondary radar isnt really radar as such. The majority of planes carry something called a transponder. This transmits three important bits of information. Its identifier such as the flight or tail number a Status code its altitude and in some cases its position. This augements the information gleaned from primary radar to get high accuracy positions for ATC.Most planes Even military ones have transponders. And unless there is a good reason for not using one Military aircraft on active operations usually though even they will use some form of transponder practically all planes transmit this information.Now if the transponder information is not available primary radar can be inaccurate sometimes. It can sometimes even fail to detect things completely. Its particularly innacurate in the elevation spectrum so judging height can have a margin of error. This means that sometimes detection can be hit and miss though it tends to be less common the higher you go.,UnresolvedMysteries,dcaj2jb,2,t5_2wvvc

10312476,0,t3_5nmcb2,I think with this case its important to keep in mind that these people werent using the ultralight ultra technical equipment that you might associate with mountaineering these days. I used to be Team Avalanche and Im pretty sure I made a lot of post as such around here. After looking into the actual mountains Im not so sure I buy the avalanche theory as much as I used to. The mountains arent particularly high they appear to me to be on the shallow end of a risky slope and these people were below the treeline. Just to reiterate they were not on a vast glacier surrounded by soaring peaks and windswept ridges. They were in the trees on a rather unremarkable mountain. Without looking at the snow and weather conditions its hard to say exactly what the avalanche risk was. But I think its fair to say that their location would be a less likely spot for a serious avalanche. I think there are some inconsistencies with the avalanche theory the first being that these were experienced individuals who should therefore have some knowledge of avalanche safety. If we consider that the may have taken action because they believed they heard an avalanche and they are fing loud they would have figured out very quickly that there was nothing wrong and they could have gone back and retrieved most of their gear. But they didnt. The more I think about it the less likely it seems unlikely to me that they would end up in as much trouble as they did in the time it would take to get out of their tent and look up the slope. The major supporters of the avalanche theory suggest that there was an avalanche because the tent was flattened and tracks were covered up. Thats...not a great conclusion. It took almost a month to find the group. In winter. Thats plenty of time for snowfall to accumulate and cover everything up. The theory about a slab falling on the tent is also a bit of a reach in my opinion. Youd have to be pretty freaking incompetent to pitch a tent under a hanging snow cornice.I think that the stove malfunction theory deserves a second look. It takes the fewest logical leaps in my opinion at least. The stove malfunctions. They leave their tent they arent wearing a lot of clothing because theyre in their sleeping bags and they cant go back to their tent. ,UnresolvedMysteries,dccz4ge,21,t5_2wvvc

10360198,0,t3_5o4xxn,I have my kindergarten class photo taken in  and there are girls in the photo wearing those same corded turtlenecks and dungaree overalls.  So its possible the photo is as old as the early s and as recent as the late s.  By the early s I was a teen and most young kids werent dressing in turtlenecks any longer.Ive done genealogy for nearly  years now and in studying older images Ive learned to pay just as much if not more attention to what is in the background of the photo if youre trying to place it in a timeframe.  So what stands out to me re judging the age of this photo is not the little girl but the background.  Clothes can be passed down or found in thrift shops or whathaveyou but the colors and patterns on those rolldown backdrops photographers used for those go to JC Penneys and get your kids photo taken! things were usually with the times.Id like to see a bigger image of the backdrop.  Was it one used by an actual photographer because you could go to a shop to get it done back then was it a school photo because if so shed be  not ish or was it the JC PenneySearstype route where you got a for sort of deal?

10398971,0,t1_dcmqypl,Thats a very good point. Now that you mention it I do recall reading about the beach not being necessarily a camping ground for people although it happened more often than not due to transients passing through. Im curious on what time the murders actually occurred and if it was a simple act of impulse or deliberately planned. Because if the murders was due to a mishap of thinking Jason and Lindsay were transients I can see that angle especially if the murderer goes to the beach late in the night and picks his poison of whos there. But if it was planned beforehand I wonder if the killer knew that Jason and Lindsays car was just up the hill a ways. I do think its highly possible that the murderer considered them homeless people of some notion but its their belongings that make me think otherwise  car keys etc etc. Another thing though ... ultimately this person killed a couple. Perhaps thats hishers thing? It certainly was with Joseph Henry Burgess albeit religious zealot.

Maitland did press charges and these street people dont believe in calling the cops. Disagreements should be handled on the streets according to their code. I think they may have also thought that since Maitland pressed charges that she may decide to give information to the police about the dealings in the area. In their diluted minds they figured if they killed her then the case would be dropped and they would eliminate her talking to the police further about the drug dealersusers. After she disappeared the case was dropped so mission accomplished.

Perhaps more likely since LE have already discounted the latter.I mean suicide is a possibility that never really seems to be considered that seriously with this case.

I only mentioned his name due to his presence being apart of the LISK investigation and the interesting coincidences.I do find this murder quite fascinating though. Lets assume for a minute that Tinas murderer is LISK. I think it makes sense to some degree especially given the circumstances of the time period in . If he was operating at this time the internet wasnt available so he definitely had to get acquainted face to face especially if this was one of his first victims which might explain the numerous sacks of body parts. He then later adapted to his craft and started being more cautious on his dumping grounds and how he disposed the bodies. We do know that one particular victim allegedly spent many times with her murderer allegedly gaining her trust and portrayed a sense of comforbality and harmless behavior so much so that the victim didnt even bring her cellphone with her which was unusual for her. That could tie into how he murdered Tina going on many dates and showing an interest in her.Heck Jessica Taylors torso was found in  I believe and then her skull and other parts years later. Again though I cant say one way or another on Tinas death. Nonetheless the similarities are quite appealing how she was murdereddismembered the location of her remains being found which would ultimately be the dumping grounds for later victims and then of course the residence.

It was all varying shades of military and the lack of an actual interview with SK really hurt the presentation. It was hard in my opinion to find a person in the story to connect to. Bo seemed like a pompous ass with a lust for heroism his friends at home all seemed to hold that opinion and the military personnel all acted like military personnel.

10601687,0,t1_dd9cxsq,Actually what I have said is that I believe the medical evidence that the children were sexually molested. There were no recovered memories involved in the McMartin case. Ive also stated that while you may not believe in Satan and I may not believe in Satan that doesnt stop child molesters from using Satanic imagery to frighten children and confuse investigations.There is a current case now in Pa. where a ring of pedophiles used animal costumes. One of the most savage pedophiles in British history used Satanic imagery. Jimmy Saville.Also your disbelief in Satan doesnt preclude those who do believe in Satan from committing horrible crimes. A satanic practitioner in Wale is in prison right now for sexually molesting children as part of his cult.

10615469,0,t3_5rnkhj,We had a local murder about  yrs ago. Well everyone knew it was murder but police ruled it a suicideaccident. A well known mean town drunk borrowed his daughters car. He went to the bar later that night another well known town drunk harmless but she was usually at the bar drunk most nights a woman was seen leaving the bar with him after asking for a ride home. The next morning her body was found on a back road with an axe in her back. Later that day the daughter retrieved her car and found her dads clothes with what appeared to be blood on them in her backseat. Her dad had left town sometimes earlier that morning so when she heard about the woman being found she went to the police. Who informed her the woman had either committed suicide or had died accidentally and to go ahead and throw her fathers clothes out. Sadly this is common up here. So much so when a headless handless body was found along a river between us and a neighboring state everyone breathed a sigh of relief the body washed up on the opposite shore and would not be investigated by our cops otherwise they would claim the person cut their heads off then their hands and threw themselves into the river either intentionally or accidently. Heck about  yrs before my husband and his mom were on way to work and saw a car on fire on side of road this was around  am. They were just down the road from work middle of nowhere and a semi truck had just pulled over as well first  on scene. My husband had his mom drive to work to call it in no cellphones yet and he stayed with vehicle. Her knew the semi truck driver who had a really bad leg so he used his fire extinguisher to put the fire out while driver waved traffic around. Hubby ran to back of vehicle where fire appeared to be to spray the gas tank to try to keep it from exploding while doing so he noticed a gas can in back seat but the doors were locked so couldnt open them.. he was bending down spraying under vehicle when he tripped over a body that was partially on fire. He turned extinguisher on her by then a couple other semi trucks had stopped and some co workers had shown up with extinguishers as well. My husband used  of them on the body trying to put it out but it kept flaming back up lower half of body.. then fire department and police showed up and made everyone leave without taking any statements. My husband went to a gas station down the road to get something to drink before heading to work and cashier asked about it when husband described the make and color of car the woman was shocked.. she had been working overnight and a male and female had stopped for gas maybe  minutes before my husband found the car. The husband also filled up a gas can while the woman waited in car. My husband had her call police to report it. A few days later in the paper it stated it had been an accident the female traveling alone had been putting gas in her vehicle must have accidently spilled gas on herself while smoking a cigarette. My husband called the police right away to say that couldnt right he was first one on scene and had tried the doors they were locked the gas can was in back seat and the cashier had seen a man with her that they had fill their tank AND the gas can maybe  minutes earlier about  minutes from where the car was found. Police told him he must have confused the details andor traumatized from driving past the scene said very snottily btw because the fire department were the ones who discovered the vehicle and no civilians had been on scene. WTF lol. But thats our area for decades.. it has gotten better but for a very long time if you wanted to kill someone this was the place to do it cops would find a way to say you did it yourself or it happened accidently never ever murder. ,UnresolvedMysteries,ddawlpl,3,t5_2wvvc

The road was quite narrow with shallow ditches on either side for most of the trip. Woods and horse pastures surrounded the road along with some houses sprinkled here and there. About . miles in a man appears on the other side of the road out of fucking nowhere. He stopped me and asked me to help him change his car tire down the hill. It didnt sit right with me because  he seemed to appear randomly from the woods  going down the hill into town to ask the mechanic for help would have made WAY more sense if his car was truly broken down and  why ask a fifth grader for help on a car? So I sped down the hill towards the library as he tried to cross the road towards me. I never saw a brokendown car. ,UnresolvedMysteries,ddbzg1n,26,t5_2wvvc

Once the subject is given the opportunity to frame the narrative through his perspectivewhich is invariably biased objectivity is lost. Documentary becomes film or news or whatever you choose to call it.The documentary that this thread is about is becomes a work of fiction when the filmmaker becomes immersed in the story and comes to a conclusion.This should have been open ended to allow the viewer to draw their own conclusions. ,UnresolvedMysteries,ddec57i,-2,t5_2wvvc

Here is what his sister says on the Facebook pagegt As stated before here are THE FACTSgt gt The last confirmed sighting was around midnight Friday night  at our home in Shoreline by family.gt gt Michael does not have his ID debit cards or wallet with him.gt gt His phone has been offinactive since Friday night also around midnight.To me that sounds like he took his phone with him but turned it off. But then under that October  post I quoted above they uploaded a flyer that says he left his ID wallet cell phone and money at home. However the family didnt make the flyer  it was made by some other organization. So maybe they got the facts wrong on the flyer and the family didnt think it was worth correcting?So the phone thing is still unclear. But they never talk about a car or a bike missing or being found so it seems like he walked somewhere or someone picked him up in a car?I know this is pure speculation but I kind of wonder whether he didnt actually mean to go out. It doesnt sound like anyone really paid attention when he left no one asked where he was going or if he needed a ride. He was living at home so his parents were probably in bed and his siblings were probably doing their own thing.So maybe it was situation where someone was swinging by to drop something off or maybe he walked outside to greet a girl or a friend who he was going to sneak back inside. So he left all his stuff inside because he wasnt actually intending to leave. Then something bad and unexpected happened. ,UnresolvedMysteries,deco5bz,5,t5_2wvvc

10982394,0,t1_decmb88,I upvoted your post. I get where youre coming from. Youre fighting a good fight here. I had some thoughts however as I read your post and I think I want to play devils advocate for a moment. I was most struck by this part of your postgt Im left baffled by the point of this post. What exactly is the mystery here? There are actual unsolved murders out there actual unresolved cases of missing people and genuine mysteries worth discussing on this sub.I agree our time here is probably best spent discussing what you call genuine mysteries. I would also like to point out however that this is a sub that IIRC had a thread that discussed in excruciating detail JonBenet Ramseys underwearchanging habits. Note to the JBR nuts Yes  against my better judgment Ive mentioned JBR. And I swear to God if any of you try to hijack this reply I will destroy you. I dont care about getting banned not for that. This is neither the time nor the place. I realize that JBR is a genuine mystery. Couldnt one say however with all of the ink already spilled on that case all of the investigation the countless books articles and documentaries that maybe posts dedicated to the undies of a long dead sixyearold are unacceptable as well? Maybe we should also leave that whole case well enough alone? Im not sure you are totally right to discourage someone from discussing the finer points and unresolved elements of any case given the kinds of issues discussed here on a regular basis. Theyre often pointless exercises that will do nothing to further the resolution of a case or involve cases that are realistically beyond resolution at this point. And theyre often mindblowingly offensive to the families of the victims. Many posters here regularly accuse Burke Ramsey of murder. After Burkes interview on Dr. Phil there was a ton of debate as to whether or not he was autistic. So if this poster is to be discouraged from discussing an issue that he or she finds interesting and one that is genuinely in question moot though it may be at this point then what is acceptable to discuss here? Im honestly not trying to be mean. Like I said I get where youre coming from. I think this brings up some interesting questions though that maybe we should be asking ourselves and not just about this particular post.,UnresolvedMysteries,dectis4,9,t5_2wvvc

Im not sure who you could reach out to except maybe any journalists local to where the body was found esp those who initially reported its discovery  sometimes the only thing that spurs LE to action is getting an uncomfortable light shown on investigative shortcomings by a persistent reporter.

11031869,0,t1_dei8arb,True uncomfortable story I met an elder abuser she was long time friends with an older woman whose cancer came out of remission  years after being diagnosed. I was paid to watch the cancer patient for several days because they terminated the employment of longtime friend turned elder abuserthief. Among other things the old friend would get the patient to sign blank checks when the patient was doped up on morphine. I had the misfortune of meeting the thief because the patient insisted on maintaining a social friendship with the thief. I drove the patient over to visit with her. I wisely did not drink the tea offered by the thief on this visit. Keep in mind the patient was a very stubborn woman amp didnt care about money because she was looking at a few weeks of life left. My main job was to keep her happy. More drama happened the cops were called amp the immediate family had to take over all the care needed by the patient because the thief KEPT TRYING to reconnect in a way that would have enabled more financial gain. Nothing violent was ever done to the patient but she was taken advantage of due to the cancer amp the meds making her not as sharpcoherent as usual. amp Yes this was a long time friend of hers that did this.,UnresolvedMysteries,deifqzs,15,t5_2wvvc

11040648,0,t3_5wk4ic,Hi! I am Stephanie.  Gloria Jeans daughter.  I came across this a few minutes ago and wanted to thank you for keeping this inquiry open.  Where the vehicle was found and whether an investigation was done has always been a thorn for me.  The car was given to a cousin whose father told her that someone found the car in Florida....while Glorias sister and my grandmother claimed the car was found in Atlanta although they didnt know where.  My grandfather never spoke of this case with me directly. Ever since I was a kid all communication was left up to my grandmother. In terms of the party while I do not have any proof I think the party was in East Point Georgia.  I also think the party was at Glorias second husbands mothers house.  It was her daughter who mentioned to someone that Gloria was seen leaving a party with three men.  I dont think Gloria actually made it into the party.  Heaven knows why she would show up at her motherinlaws with three men.  I found Glorias second husbands brother a few years ago.  After I called him he spoke with his mother who said that the last time she saw Gloria Gloria showed up at her house with three men.  She the mother Hazel became upset with Gloria and asked her whether SHE was going to tell her son Glorias second husband or if Gloria was going to tell him.  According to Hazel Gloria said that SHE would tell the second husband.  Hazel has since passed away. My theory is that Hazels daughter overheard all of this or might have been standing at the door when the conversation happened.   ,UnresolvedMysteries,dejfs0c,15,t5_2wvvc

11071302,0,t3_5xwor3,The evidence against Jeffrey MacDonald is overwhelming and I have no doubt he is guilty as hell. Yet the notion that he is a persecuted innocent remains weirdly persistent.For instance there was a recent episode of the People magazine true crime show on ID that dealt with the case and it was a disgrace. It exonerated MacDonald but the only people interviewed were MacDonald supporters. MacDonald critics were left out and the mountain of evidence against him went unmentioned.I greatly admire Errol Morris as a filmmaker and am disappointed to see hes become such a MacDonald fanboy. Morris has said that one of the main reasons he thinks MacDonald is innocent is that MacDonald had no motive. But countless men the world over have done exactly what MacDonald did some for even fewer apparent reasons which in MacDonalds case include amphetamine psychosis and the desire to pursue a swinging bachelor lifestyle. The problem with Morris that he is so hyperrational that he has no understanding of the irrational impulses at work in these murders and many others.I also believe that a lot of MacDonalds support has to do with him being a professional class white guy. If he was poor and black no one would ever have heard of him keep in mind that black people are seven times more likely to be falsely convicted of murder than white people.Lots of strong evidence for MacDonalds guilt have already been brought up in this discussion. If youd like to read more I suggest the followingthe Joe McGinnis book Fatal Vision which is available for free on openlibrary.orga  Columbia Journalism Review piece that dismantles Errol Morriss proMacDonald apologia anda  Washington Post piece that focuses on the man who who prosecuted MacDonald and that also makes a devastating antiMacDonald case.,UnresolvedMysteries,demx6z4,11,t5_2wvvc

He would find the guns and leave ropes behind in hidden locations and take their ammo. He might have used vacant homes for sale in neighborhoods as his base of operation there. He could also get phone numbers matched to addresses with reverse look up phone books. These books give you the phone number when you look up an address. He had to have a job that allowed him to be up late at night into the early morning. Construction would be a problem if he worked that full time since construction jobs usually started at  or  A.M. which cut close to his times for the crimes. This would not have been a problem if he worked only a few days a week. I lived in California at this time and had my real estate license.

11075923,0,t3_5y23p1,Cases like this one are especially frustrating for people like yourself who knew her but likely arent privy to as much information as her family.In my opinion this one is going to end up one of two ways she was either murdered or overdosed.If it was murder Im betting the police have a pretty good idea about what happened and thats why you dont have any information. Theyre building their case and you likely wont hear much else unless they identify a suspectarrest someone or they hit a wall and need the publics help.If she overdosed or had some type of accident you might never hear another word from the police or media. If you hear anything it will be from family or close friends.Im leaning towards this being an overdose or something like it. Probably not a suicide though. When someone is murdered the family and friends often scream for justice while mourning the loss. Theyre out there putting pressure on police and the media to find the killer. If its anything else especially something like an overdose then the family and friends generally just mourn.I think the fact that the police called it a suspicious death points to them trying to determine whether it was intentional or not and I would bet that theyll ultimately find out that her death was some type of accident like an overdose.,UnresolvedMysteries,deng284,3,t5_2wvvc

However he went back in without her causing her to become frustratedangry and to decide to drive home without him.  Could she have been impaired by alcohol? This could explain the possiblity of dinging another car on the way out of the parking lot and a subsequent accident on the way home.  Also The Doe Network has the husband leaving her in the car while he settles the bill and the Charley Project has him leaving her while he finished his meal.

Daly a coworker was surprised at his view saying that she thought homosexuality was wrong and that in conservative Zimbabwe where they worked most straight men would like to shoot gay men.

11267622,0,t3_60qq9x,They asked him pointedly Where can we find Hailey? He said somewhere in Scurry County said Guinn. They asked him Who should we be looking at in this? And he said You should be looking at us  meaning Shawn and Billie.Scurry County is about  miles north of where Hailey was last seen.This is an important part of the article because he tells the police where her body remains could be found... but thats only something the killer would know? And when they had a break in the case a jogger was the one that found some remains a skull and a tooth and later the dental records were matched to Hailey. Its a little odd to me that Shawn the suspect mothers on and off again boyfriend wasnt arrested and linked to the murder. Of course there has to be hard evidence against him DNA. But the question remains if hes not the killer how did he know where her body was? And did the police even check scurry county after he said they would find her remains there? The mother at first seemed a little suspicious considering they threw a New Years Eve party  days after her daughters disappearance and she wasnt involved in her daughters searches but then it becomes clear why she didnt want to partake in them. Searching for her daughter meant looking for a body and she didnt want to think of her daughter dead she wanted her home and alive. Another interesting fact is that Shawn the boyfriend quit his job around  am and left the premises around  am where he was seen going to Billies home. Thats the mother. When the mother was under the impression that she would be home for  hours by herself and that her dad lived across the street and figured she would just go over there. The only other question I have is if the father lived across the street and there was a murder or a kidnapping how didnt her father suspect anything? I understand that he could have been sleeping and maybe he was a deep sleeper or he was watching tv but you would think that she would scream. Unless of course she trusted Shawn Hailey that being and he took her somewhere and killed her there and somehow got rid of her  or most of her remains.  Either way theres so many questions that are unanswered and so many holes the police could be digging into. ,UnresolvedMysteries,df962hp,2,t5_2wvvc

And no saying manic episode and psychosis are not two separate diagnoses  manic episodes often come with psychosis but many people do not realize that it does. Sure were a bunch of amateurs on the internet but if youre going to say that no amateurs should be making any sort of conclusions what are you even doing on this sub which is all about armchair investigations? People on this sub have looked at the publicly available evidence and come to reasonable conclusions. They have not been jumped to. Jumping to conclusions is saying for instance that Johnny Gosch was taken into sexual slavery and peddled as a child prostitute to the White House without evidence or that one photo that has not be conclusively identified proves that Tara Calico was abducted by a predator. This woman was diagnosed bipolar was on some pretty heavyduty medications including ones that are used as antipsychotics and demonstrates behaviors that are not inconsistent with a severe manic episode is examining available evidence and coming to the most likely explanation for the scenario. ,UnresolvedMysteries,dfe8tiy,2,t5_2wvvc

While not as prevalent as water sportsrecreation drowning accidental immersion is not an uncommon way for males to drown especially in the early s age range. Also alcohol is not always necessary for accidental immersion drownings but it seems to exacerbate the situation. I dont know much about Boston but a quick gander at a map shows a lot of historical and entertainment things in the neighborhood of where those drownings occur which almost certainly plays a role in the situation. Id imagine like anywhere else in the world tourists are more likely to run into trouble than locals which may account for the proportion that are from out of state.,UnresolvedMysteries,dfup2rq,30,t5_2wvvc

11574854,0,t3_655dzx,The Molly Young case is full of conflicting information. There are claims that the cops arrived before the  call but the family states the cops lied and did no canvassing. Also the Carbondale Police handed the case off immediately to the State Police who seem to have forwarded the case to another entity at some point. If they were going to attempt a cover up wouldnt they want to keep the case in house? Also the multiple suicide notes found on her computer suicidal threats she texted the inhabitants of the apartment and farewell messages to friends and family seem to point to suicide as the obvious answer. I also believe I read there was a handwritten suicide note as well.The Pravin Verughese is fairly cut and dry. He had two Four Lokos which are apparently the equivalent to four or five beers two shots of rum and two beers before midnight assuming he didnt start drinking at three in the afternoon he was most likely very drunk. The guy he caught a ride with got in an argument with him eventually leading to the guy pulling over with his blinkers on and ejecting Pravin from the car leading to an altercation in which the guy admits popping Pravin in the head at which time a State Trooper pulled up due to the car on a busy road being pulled over with its blinkers on and Pravin panicked and ran into the woods. The guy giving Pravin a ride lied to the police and said Pravin tried to rob him in an attempt to avoid a DUI. I doubt the cop knew Pravin was drunk and Pravin chose to run into the woods and he paid for that choice. Pravins autopsy was reviewed by two out of state coroners and the independent coroner runs a business where he seeks to provide closure and advocate for families and this independent coroner freely admits he never obtained access to the full autopsy report and couldnt make a definitive conclusion.,UnresolvedMysteries,dg80ktc,13,t5_2wvvc

11590884,0,t3_65cbf5,As a local this murder strikes me as such a real mystery.  Ostensibly it is easy to kind of explain it away as a robbery gone wrong The area has been heavily gentrified and transformed within the past ten years. Previously it definitely had a LOT of crime.  I know the gang initiation theory was quickly dismissed in this thread as an urban legend but Charlotte definitely has gangs and gang violence. I dont know that murder as a gang initiation makes sense but the shooting could potentially be gang related in some way.   There have been other shootings in the area for sure.  The factors surrounding the murder are ideal for an attempted robbery especially considering the time of night and the fact that Ketie was a small young female walking alone.Given the formidable lack of evidence I really hope that this murder doesnt go unsolved. Its quite striking how much Keties story has virtually disappeared from local headlines. But I get the feeling that all effort aside theres just not much to report further.And though it may be easily explainable as a botched robbery I cant quite shake the feeling that there is more to it.   Even though there are still shootings in the area sometimes the motive is usually quickly determined. Violence in Plaza Midwood nowadays is usually the result of a robbery or a drunken altercation. In most robberies at least in this area the victim is still robbed whether they are shot or not.  This may be just me but I find the location of the robbery if it were a robberymurder so weird. First of all it was near a business but the area is basically just city suburbs. And its the type of housing that midtwenty somethings are always out smoking a cigarette on the front porch of... Why rob someone who is basically in front of a line of houses? They could be right by their own house for all you know... If they get away they can bang on a door and have assistance in literal seconds.  Theres also a lot of family homes in the area. And bars just blocks away. But no one heard shots or saw anything or anyone suspicious? Ive walked that area late at night frequently and Im a young small girl also Ive never felt unsafe or threatened. Also like I said before there are usually other young people out on porches and walking home from the bars.  Also perhaps this is just because Im not an evil person but why even shoot her if it were a robbery to begin with? I dont think she seemed like the type that would fight back. And even if she did its not like she had a gun or mace or anything threatening that would allow her to definitely get the drop on the robber.  It seems more likely that the assailant would be noticed or captured if they shot an unsilenced gun in that area than if they just gave up and ran off during a botched robbery.If it were a robbery I think it had to have been similar to this one which happened a few months afterwards. I think the assailant must have almost immediately shot her and then something happened to spook them  maybe it looked like someone was walkingdriving down the street towards them or a house light turned on and the assailant fled. In fact when those people were arrested I was a bit convinced theyd also find the murder weapon used on Ketie but it doesnt seem like there were any real connections to be made. Regardless considering the lack of evidence my hope is that they find the gun and can definitely tie it back to the crime. Apart from this I think only a confession or a witnessaccomplice coming forward would solve it.Its so incredibly tragic I feel for her family so much. I have a mysterytrue crime blog and have her on my list to cover. Deep down I think Id been hoping to no avail that it would be solved before I got to her though.     ,UnresolvedMysteries,dg9u2am,7,t5_2wvvc

11598002,0,t3_65ewrf,Ive read a lot about the case and pretty much the general censuses between divers and cops is that he DID die in the cave but either people moved the copy to avoid legal ramifications or he was just washed out to sea by the tide. I dont think anyone seriously thinks he just left mysteriously and with zero evidence. The ownersworkers of the cave were up to a LOT of shady shit and moving a body is definitely something they would have done especially if they let him in knowing he didnt have certs to do it something theyve admitted theyd done in the past. Legally that would open them up to manslaughter charges and civil suits.The father hired a PI who apparently did a much deeper investigation of the father and hes hinted at all kinds of shit that hell release real soon. Who knows if any of that is true but its pretty clear he thinks there was some kind of foul play involved and his son is no longer alive.

11714103,0,t3_674s1u,I mean arguably there are lots of examples of the government not putting forth resources to solve a crime in the sense that local law enforcement is the government  the many bogus confessions of Henry Lee Lucas who had a habit of confessing to almost any murder file stuck in front of him comes to mind. Obviously in that case law enforcement was complicit in focusing on closing cases by having him confess just so the case wouldbe closed and they were not working to find the actual killer. There are also TONS of examples in the deep South during the civil rights era of law enforcement both local and state working with perpetrators of violent crimes  either to help cover up the crime or members of law enforcement actively participating in crimes.  But as others have pointed out your title wording kind of implies your asking for examples of the federalUS government beyond just law enforcement doing something to actually cover up or actively perpetuate a crime. Is there some example youre thinking of that youre wanting comparable cases for? Because that screams conspiracy theory and I think they have their own sub.

11718745,0,t1_dgnvjwj,I dont believe she did and even if she probably would not have done it this way. This is all my opinion and could be totally false but this is what I took away when I saw it over one year ago she was a closed off person nobody seemed to really know what was going in inside her I think. Thats why I think she wouldnt commit suicide in that way she probably would not have wanted that kind of attention to her death and I doubt she would have taken kids into it. If she would have made it so public I also think she would have wanted others to know why she did it and she didnt leave a letter note or anything. So from that I conclude it was an accident possibly extreme neglect on her part but not really intending to commit suicide while she was sober maybe it was a spur of the moment thing after she was wasted. In no way I doubt the analysis of the BAC but somehow I doubt she was a severe high functioning alcoholic. There were no people in the doc even hinting at it and usually at least some suspicion is there but nobody digs deeper. But who knows maybe they were afraid to mention it on camera or it was omitted in the doc. Concluding from the doc that she was a high functioning alcoholic and thats it just from the doc seems strange to me tbh. ,UnresolvedMysteries,dgock37,10,t5_2wvvc

11745754,0,t1_dgquq3i,I agree. I really dont think Madeleine could have gotten out of that apartment by herself without leaving any signs... ampnbspI have a yearold daughter and my inlaws have a patio door thats very similar to the one in A. Sliding patio doors without a handle on the outside those thin flimsy vertical blinds and sliding curtains. My daughter slid the patio door opened once with the blinds and curtains shut the McCanns said their blinds and curtains were both closed and those things were mangled all to hell. I mean you have the glass door on one side and the curtain on the other side and in between theres a toddler using her whole body to slide the door open... and all these thin strips of plastic dangling around her as shes doing this. This is just anecdotal because I dont know that they were the exact same blinds but they were very similar just looking at the pictures from inside A. ampnbspThe door didnt have a handle on the outside this is why it wasnt locked there wasnt a lock on the outside. Theyre more like balcony doors and werent to be used as an exit. Weird that such a fancy resort had those kind of doors on a first floor apartment if Madeleine had closed it Id think thered be little hand prints on the glass from her trying to close the door.ampnbsp Then there the child safety lock on the gate. Now everyone knows a toddler can unlock a child safety lock of they really want to... but Ive never heard of a toddler sticking around to to lock it back. Judging by the setup regular metal gate with a child safety lock installed on both sides of the gate that gate had to be manually locked back rather than just swinging it shut. ampnbspAlso no lights were turned on I dont know any yearold who will turn the lights back off... at night especially if they were alone scared and looking for their parents ampnbspShe didnt take the stuffed animal she slept with. This depends on the kid... but in my experience if they sleep with a stuffed animal all the time they usually take it with them when they get out of bed and are scaredalone. Its a security thing. ampnbspPlus if Madeleine left on her own and was met with some sort of foul play or accident after she left the apartment then why was the window and shutter opened? No way Madeleine did that. No other explanation for the window... It was either staged or as I believe was an exit route used by the kidnapper because it was either dark and empty alley or welllight public street full of people. ,UnresolvedMysteries,dgreswi,17,t5_2wvvc

11761006,0,t3_67pre7,Ive read a lot about this case. My gut feeling is that this was a drug induced issue. I know they tested negative for drugs BUT only for the drugs that they were trying to identify. Think of it this way if I am tested for cannabis cocaine and LSD I will have a negative test even if I was stoned out of my mind on methamphetamine. The same happens with performanceenhancing drugs  a clean test does not mean the individual is clean. It means they may be taking something not tested for which is why samples are held for years to retest when tests datch up with drug development. A negative test may simply mean that what they were on was not tested for. Just a thought thats all.,UnresolvedMysteries,dgt51d2,6,t5_2wvvc

11781812,0,t1_dgu2ohr,Your missing one key point. There are no others ways! That bar is on a nd floor the only way to get to it is going through the doors on the st floor and going up an escalator. When you get up the escalator theres a landing and you go right to get to Ugly Tuna or left is a movie theater. To leave there would literally only be  ways the way he got in the construction site at the time or jumping off the balcony to the street below. Campus Gateway is crowded especially on weekends theres no way he jumped the balcony and no one would have noticed. Leaving through the construction site has pretty much been ruled out I think but not impossible I guess. So that leaves only one exit. Sure he could have changed clothes or worn a hat. But where would he get a change of clothes from? He didnt go in with a bag. And youd think the people he was with that night would have known if he had a hat or a bag in his possession.Source for about the bar live in Columbus have been to said bar,UnresolvedMysteries,dgvi8nd,2,t5_2wvvc
