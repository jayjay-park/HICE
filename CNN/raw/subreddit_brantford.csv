42462,0,t3_1uigyo,I grew up in a really bad i.e. poor and crimedrugfilled area of Scarborough. I now live in downtown Brantford. Its not that bad here. Could it be better? Of course. But the problem doesnt stem from an insufficiently revitalized downtown but from various socioeconomic factors especially poverty which is worldwide problem. ,brantford,cej9ka6,2,t5_2rrbm

9605345,0,t1_d9wqqo9,Well Im not sure what dispensaries youve been to but comparing Vancouver dispensaries to LPs is pretty laughable we have way better selection way better and fresher buds and dont have to mail order. Considering the same companies operate in Toronto Id have to wonder if its the same or not and from what Ive heard from anyone in the industry dispensary bud is better and often times cleaner lots of organic strains to choose from at good dispensaries LPs all have to irradiate their bud.Ive designed packaging for both and had plenty of samples to compare and Ive never had an LP impress me as much as an independent. What makes you so strongly disagree?,brantford,d9x2093,1,t5_2rrbm
