8003782,0,t3_4oq1wz,Im currently running a very successful SWN campaign and creating a ton of content for it. I love the system and lore. I hope to begin presenting planetary and faction guides soon. This Game definitely needs more love. I have all the printed guides and want to contribute in any way I can. Writing content has become all consuming for me at the moment. In a few more weeks I should have enough lore for my system fleshed out and would love to run some occasional sessions for new players on roll. My primary campaign is my main focus but we only play every two weeks. I can likely squeeze in a few games on the off weeks. I dont have the time to run a full nd campaign but absolutely want to bring in new players and see this community grow. ,StarsWithoutNumber,d4fp8ni,2,t5_31kvf
