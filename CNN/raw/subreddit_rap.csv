1286659,0,t3_28tiz5,To me JayZ is a boring artist Id say ACDC of rap. He definitely is on some great songs and then theres  otis gotta have it and some others but other than that bleh.Hes got good lyrics but rap is music as well and an artist needs to be interesting to listen to. At times Jay does some things with his voice but on most of his songs hes average to listen to. To me its about the sound of the words and using voice in interesting ways as much as about the instrumentals. A song can be great with boring beats and great rapping or great instrumentals and boring rapping but that is quite a rare case.Twinz  Big Pun To me this song has quite a boring beat but Big Pun and Fat Joe make the song with interesting use of their voices.JayZ and Nas both have a lot of great songs but they use their voice in a very monotone manners. But still Jay has been putting out some very good songs lately that are a pleasure to the ear.Artists that are interesting based on their use of voice based on more than one song Kendrick Schoolboy Q Drake Nitty Scott Angel Haze Gavlyn Janelle Monae The white guy from Ces Cru Atmosphere  Azelia Banks Qtip Aesop Rock.,rap,cied5z7,1,t5_2qhas

2450119,0,t3_2nk39c,I dont know any of these qualify as deep but... Things Done Changed by Notorious BIG is lamenting what he sees as a rise in violence in urban black communities which he describes as a sign of societal decay. Similarly Hood Mentality by Ice Cube covers moreorless the same idea. If you dont want to change that hood mentalityhow the fuck are we supposed to change our reality. He thinks that culturally engrained attitudes are holding back black urban culture. P.I.M.P. by  Cent is meant to show that theres more to a position of power than the mere appearance of power. He explains that he doesnt need no Cadillac no perm or any of the other usual trappings of a pimp to actually be in action a pimp. Fuck Shit Stack by Reggie Watts is a sendup of tropes in rap videos. Everything from cartoon character egos to overuse of coarse language to I like womenI like womenI like the concept of a womanI lake to take that concept and reduce it to an objectand take those objects and put em in my videosmake em shake their jiggly bits sos sic they looks like hos.Ill also add in that you should go give a listen to an artist named Scroobius Pip. Hes big in the UK right now and pretty much all of his music comes from an impassioned place. Hes both a rapper and a spoken word poet so he does have some crossover in influence and hell perform the same texts in both ways. Id recommend starting with the album Distraction Pieces and going from there. It covers everything from the dangers of living a socially isolationist life to how sometimes life gets in the way of your good intentions to the war in Iraq to the decline of quality in the journalism world.,rap,cmeje21,1,t5_2qhas

9501992,0,t1_d9kazkj,Well as I stated before deadmau is a very talented producer. He knows how to eq things very well and compress and pan and all of those things. He knows music theory and the works. However imo his songs are complete garbage. So even though the production quality is very high the music is not good in my opinion. Much like the business man can be great at accounting marketing finance promotions etc. but still have the end result be a shitty product. The fundamental flaw in your argument is that someones objective skill at something determines the subjective value of the end product. The process and end product are mutually exclusive in most things whether you would like to believe so or not. If that were the case only painters like Picasso would be in museums. You wouldnt have huge exhibits dedicated to different colored circles on a piece of paper. You either get it or its over your head. Its appearing to be the latter though ,rap,d9kbn5v,1,t5_2qhas
