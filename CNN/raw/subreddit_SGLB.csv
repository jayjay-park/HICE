89715,0,t1_ceoi3xs,Right. Im not thrilled to see the already huge number of outstanding shares expanded more but I have been waiting for signs that they are adding more scientists programmers and engineers to their payroll in order to push more aggressively for product completion and commercialization. Any news of growth is good news to me. Still I hope this is the last time they have to release new shares in order to raise revenue. M cash on hand should be more than enough to get them through commercialization. If not Ill start to consider jumping ship.,SGLB,ceon5lq,3,t5_2za3i
135970,0,t3_1vmew6,I think from here on out youll see it generally rise but you might be able to get in on a dip.  Theres still uncertainty but I think Fridays jump was a bit of an indication of the future direction...,SGLB,cetx0rl,4,t5_2za3i
163542,0,t1_cex13qv,Im not even sure I understand enough myself to explain in more detail. It could be that for a brief moment in time there were no outstanding sell orders. Lets say that during this moment somebody makes a limit order to sell K shares but some glitch causes the limit to be entered as. instead of .. At this moment somebody else enters a buy order for a similarly large amount of shares with a limit higher than .. The order gets filled for a little over a penny a share and then one person does the hardest facepalm theyve ever done while another person simultaneously dances naked in her bedroom showering herself with champagne. Thats how I imagine it happening anyway.,SGLB,cex25zp,6,t5_2za3i
185444,0,t1_cezjpi0,Yes this seems a likely scenario. Out of curiosity how large is your position in SGLB right now? ,SGLB,cezk5wt,1,t5_2za3i

605471,0,t1_cg8oa9s,I dont think it should come as a surprise to anyone that a company like this would make a prime target for pumpers. I didnt at all mean to imply that this is not a solid company with a great product and future ahead of it. Ive been long on this stock for a while. I just know that theres a difference between real news and positive press. My hope is that the pumpers are being smart and have timed this promotion to coincide with positive news. There are several possible catalysts in the near future so my sense is that this is exactly what is going on. I hear people talking about selling now and buying back in at .  .. I dont think I know enough to play that way. How can people be sure itll dip that low again? I know several people who were waiting for it to drop to . before buying and missed out. What if financials a new contract or positive results from fuel nozzle testing are released while Im out of position and I miss the spike or worse miss the buyout from GE. I believe in this company and I think it would be nice to get a tax break on the long term hold. Im holding long. ,SGLB,cg93fx6,2,t5_2za3i
1233457,1,t3_2881zu,It is and always has been hype. It was a great buy and hold stock last year before it started getting press from Gary Anderson but any hope that is will be worth . anytime in the near future is a pipe dream.,SGLB,ci8dq3o,-4,t5_2za3i
1896000,0,t3_2g9kno,Welcome to the fold amigo! Youll find many a friendly face who are long term holders and believe there is a strong upside to SGLB!,SGLB,ckhnpos,2,t5_2za3i
2484052,0,t1_cmihdtd,In the end has anything materially changed besides them progressing towards a  rampup?No?Well then this is still the same thing you signed up for. No one was going to get rich overnight.RELAX,SGLB,cmisy0y,10,t5_2za3i
7328205,0,t3_4flen2,About  years ago when I was holding SGLB my brokerage fucked up and had the price listed as x higher. Logged in to see my account valued at over . million... I prevented myself from getting excited because I knew it must have just been a glitch but there was a small part of me thinking that some crazy buy out had taken place.,SGLB,d2b60x3,1,t5_2za3i
9676509,0,t1_da21ixh,Its just more of the same bullshit from cola. The dude doesnt know how to run a company... They hired a CFO and he wasnt even on the call to answer BASIC questions like what was last years revenue. EVEN Cola should know that.The fact that they delayed earnings just to say someone new is evaluating them and nothing else was a kick in the teeth. Its the same BS theyve been touting for years. Noone cares who is evaluating their SW any more. None of it has resulted in any sales. GE obviously passed their lockstep talk has silently drifted into the night. They have no money no sales and are likely gonna have to dilute big time just to stay afloat. But at least his wife still makes her k as a fucking secretary for the company.  I cashed out and took my  loss. ,SGLB,da5u00c,3,t5_2za3i
