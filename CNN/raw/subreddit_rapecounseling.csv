608032,0,t3_20pta5,Its okay to be mad because its not fair.  But you can and you will work through those negative feelings.  You are not at fault you can recover it just takes time.  You are allowed to be mad as long as you want but remember carrying guilt and anger only harm you so havent you been through enough.  expressing these feelings is the first step so you are already on your way.,rapecounseling,cg9dwnm,1,t5_2rfx0
610211,0,t3_214uzn,This may come off as a little brash perhaps but are you sure she was indeed raped and isnt just using that to have you jump up to defend her? I just find it very strange that she would get in a car with him the next morning to come to you to talk about that.This is  years ago you said? Did she see anybody it? Did you try to get her to speak to the police at the time?,rapecounseling,cg9mtc4,1,t5_2rfx0
781852,0,t1_cgt4r9h,He should have known from the multiple times she said no and to fuck off during the entire course of him trying to get her to fool around with him. He literally followed her into the kitchen after she told him to fuck off to leave her alone and started stripping her without her consent. That action alone says that he doesnt care what she says hes going to have sex with her. And no her saying fine just get it over with isnt odd. It was likely her way of ensuring that something more violent didnt happen because he was going to continue regardless.As for your numbered questions if you dont believe her then why would the cops believe her? Lots of times I would even say a majority of the time police officers dont believe those who try and report a rape because the rape wasnt violent enough. So going to the police or friends isnt the safest option when youre still dealing with the after affects of being assaulted. Youre victim blaming rather hardcore currently when you should be supporting her and her story. Its incredibly easy to sit there and be critical from a safe place because you arent in danger. You arent the one being assaulted and raped. Stop asking why she didnt do X Y and Z and instead ask why the fuck that guy didnt stop when she said no the first three or four times. Stop focusing on what she did and focus on what her rapist did. Her actions did not cause him to assault her his actions did that. Dont try and render her story her feelings and her actions as invalid. She was raped and should be supported not put in a superoverlycritical pedestal where she is constantly told that she must have described it wrong.,rapecounseling,cgt5f7l,3,t5_2rfx0

I dont know you and your brothers relationship but if the entire rest of the family is there and you come to his graduation party I think hed be understanding. Being with the teacher that much that could be a nightmare. No matter what though if you go and start having a panic attack dont feel obligated to stay. Get out of that situation at that point youd only be hurting yourself by staying.

1054505,0,t3_266dn7,First of all I feel for you on many levels. I too was raped by someone that I trusted and Ive been recovering for the last  months. My best advice is to get a therapist. I was so certain I could cope on my own. I was strong enough. I didnt need help. Guess what? I was wrong. This isnt something you can make sense of on your own because it doesnt make sense. You need that neutral third party that you feel safe with that you can spew your word vomit to and will sit and muddle through it with you. As far as the rape consuming your life. It has taken me until very recently to realize that the woman I was before this event is dead. My whole life has changed. How I view men how I view myself how I dress how I lock my house what I carry with me in my purse...Im no longer that person I was before this trauma. However that does not mean that I am broken. Trauma is like death. There are stages to acceptance. There are days where I still am so depressed and hurt and angry that I can barely manage to get out of bed. There are far less of those days now  months later than there were in the months immediately following. My irrational emotions are not irrational. Trauma happened to me. It is okay to not be okay but stand up and seek out additional help in order to move through the trauma and back into the light. Moving through the trauma is the hardest part. The anxiety and depression and anger. Its excruciating. However it is manageable with therapy and medication. If you ever need an ear PM me. No one should ever have to go through this alone. ,rapecounseling,cho5hfv,3,t5_2rfx0

He offered me ketamine and said it would feel like coke or meth. It doesnt btw. I remembered him being inside me and doing other things to my body but he claimed that we never had sex and that nothing happened sexually. Before more memories came back and before I remembered taking the actual drug willingly I had confronted him saying I thought it was weird that I blacked out from such lil alcohol and he just said theres a first time for everything He never brought up that he offered me Ketamine and thats the reason my memory is so shakey.

1391508,0,t3_28z5v6,First i would like to say that Im very sorry for the things that have happened to you and that are still happening to you typically the best thing for you to do would be to tell someone you trust dearly and of course tell the police. As someone who was also raped at very young ages    i know that as you get older you truly realize what happened and you will think about it more until it consumes your mind but you will be able to get over it with the help from the right people.If this shit is still happening keep trying your absolute best to stop it and to overcome it.

Your boyfriend sounds wonderful if hes stuck with you through thick and thin I can only imagine hell be there for you if you tell him. Which I think you should do when you feel ready. This will help his understanding of you  making sure he takes nothing personally and can support you whenever you want supporting.

2243165,0,t3_2kncus,Its all about being patient and taking time. My wife was sexuallyphysically abused by the ex immediately prior to me and it was and still is a struggle. There are things that trigger her things she cant do and things she doesnt want to do. Ive been patient with that and I just constantly make sure she knows shes supported and that her past is an important part of her and that I love her regardless.  It takes time to process everything. To recognize that some things are triggers why they trigger and then figuring out if you can or how to outgrow them.So dont rush it. Try not to get frustrated. DO NOT get pressured into rushing it  any guy worth your time is going to move at the pace you need to move at. No exceptions you deserve the respect of a loving relationship. Scars fade but wounds wont heal if you constantly tear them back open. Its going to have its moments of frustration confusion and possibly depression. But its also going to teach you about yourself and others and give amazing joy and butterflies in your stomach. And eventually you learn to let go of your past and enjoy the beautiful person you are that the people around you love so much. And its so worth it. So be confused or frustrated or mad or scared  but dont run away from it. Ease into it. Feel a little pain at a time work through it and find someone worth living for. ,rapecounseling,cloyjib,1,t5_2rfx0

2955268,0,t3_2twc2s,Im sorry this happened to you.While I am in Germany and have some experiences with the police I can only second folgaluna A local rape crisis center is a very good starting point. They are often called Frauennotruf or Frauenhaus or Frauentelefon. There is a national contact phone email chat at www.Hilfetelefon.de this is a government institution I am unsure if they can provide strict confidentiality.A Frauennotruf will likely explain what to expect can connect you to a lawyer they trust probably at no cost for you and knows the police officers that handle this kind oft crimes.This is oversimplified but in comparison to the US Germany has less draconic punishments but also trial by judge not by jury and my general impression is that you are a bit better off here.Also your country may have parallel jurisdiction. Germany does not extradite German nationals but most countriea do and a pending criminal investigation abroad can be quite threatning. You may still consider this.Mention facebook when you report to the police messages could still be in his facebook account. Also mention the threats to your family.Im already proud of you.,rapecounseling,co41131,1,t5_2rfx0

3016949,0,t3_2uq0nt,Hi OP.Usually Im happy to comment on posts but this one was heavier than most.Im a  year old guy and Ive never been raped so if you want to stop reading now thats ok.Your story breaks my heart. Even knowing there was a happy ending that doesnt even sound right but I dont know what else to say it was still so hard to read. I cant imagine typing it or living through it.Im so glad that this person cant hurt you anymore and that you finally have people who care about you. Even though the messages hurt you again Im glad that you used them to start the process of getting this guy locked up.No matter what anyone says or what you think you did not deserve any of this. You were not asking for this and it wasnt and wont ever be right. I am a listener on the website  cups of tea. I talk to all kinds of people dealing with all kinds of things. I have had more than one rape victim tell me that they think they deserve it or that theyve tried to block it out but it keeps getting worse. I do hope that you find a way to heal.I havent dealt with half of the stuff you have but a year and a half ago I was severely depressed and wanted to end my own life. I spent about  months in various hospitals and learned a lot but the thing that helped me more than anything was love. Real unconditional nevergoingtohurtyou love. Knowing that I was loved allowed me to love myself and I started to heal.I dont want to go back to where I was and I dont want to forget what took me so long to learn. I want to use what I dealt with to help others. This is why I post on places like this and why I started using  cups of tea. I actually found it in its own sub here on Reddit so it cant be too bad. On  cups you can either request to be listened to or volunteer as a listener. I volunteered and now I can listen to anyone who puts in a general request. I even have a referral link so that people can come directly to me. Here it isBeing on this website helps me to give help to others like it was given to me. I read a quote once that said that it is impossible to help someone else without also helping yourself. I cant find it right now but if I do Ill post the source.As you heal I would ask you to consider something like  cups or a support group where you can talk to someone else in real time either to get help or help others. You have so much strength! You amaze me. There was a time when I would have considered you weak or looked at you with pity. That was before I needed help to even get up out of bed in the morning. That time changed me and I am thankful.To recap Im glad youre on the way to resolution. This is a big step and I thank you for sharing it. Dont underestimate the power of real love to heal the hurts that you have so unjustly endured.I talk to two women on cups who have been raped and I know they are not the only ones. There are so many people who can benefit from hearing about your strength. I did and Ive never dealt with this at all.Thank you for sharing. I greatly appreciate it.All comments are welcome. I want to hear what you have to say.,rapecounseling,coapdqb,5,t5_2rfx0

3040882,0,t3_2uyoa4,I dont remember the large majority of either of my assaults one I repressed and only a few little pieces came back the other I was asleep for aside from maybe a minute. Ive also been dealing with it for around five years and only now do I truly believe that everyone is right it is better to not remember. The problem is accepting that. I know there will always be this very very tiny bit of me that will always wonder what happened but most of me is so thankful that I dont have flashbacks I dont have images of their faces seared into my mind forever. You need to desensitize yourself to the details you do know by talking about them which it seems like you have and somehow make peace with the mystery. Eventually youll learn to take solace in the fact that you cant replay your assault over and over like a movie in your mind not remembering when it comes to trauma can be a blessing but only of you find a way to accept it.

3496804,0,t3_309vsm,So just my two cents... Once I answered an ad on craigslist for a paid photoshoot. Now Ive been a model and been involved in the modeling world before not hugely professional by any means but enough to know better than to reply to a craigslist ad. In my defense the man sounded fairly professional so I bought it. Sent pictures some tastefully nude face shot real name real phone number email... yea. Big fail. I realized it was a mistake when he asked for a pussy pic. No professional would use that wording OR ask for that sort of thing. A real photographer would use modelmayhem but thats besides the point. So I ambushed him. I used a fake email fake face pic fake number and got his number then got his pic then got his name. Then I threatened to post flyers around town exposing him. He cracked pretty easy. We spoke on the phone he cried to me told me his story. We met were friends and confidantes for each other. Now if Id just posted a warning on craigslist before i knew his personal info hed know hed been found out and would make sure he stayed anonymous. If he reads this sub he will see this thread and either just be more careful or move on somewhere else.  I think you should take this thread down and the women on here should stand up for themselves if someone ever does something like that. ,rapecounseling,cpqv06w,5,t5_2rfx0

Because it sounds like hes stalking her and theres really only one solution to that that I can see.  Its hard for me to imagine that whatever would happen if she went to the police would be more destructive to her than the fear and distress that shes already experiencing.  But thats beside the point because shes not asking reddit for advice.  You already know what she needs to do and you dont want to put more pressure on her so it sounds like youre doing all you can by supporting her.,rapecounseling,cqebgn2,2,t5_2rfx0

5056890,0,t3_3k7iwj,I think kids can experiment sexually in a consensual way. I also believe that it is possible for a child to harm another child sexually even if they dont fully understand what they are doing.As far as I am concerned what matters is how you feel about it and the impact it is having on your life. Going over and over whether it was abuse or not doesnt usually help. If it upsets you it upsets you and you may need professional help to deal with it.The fact you are having panic attacks is a clear sign that something is not right. They are not something anyone should have to live with.The only thing I can recommend is seeking a counsellor ideally one with experience of child psychology and child sexual abuse.They should be able to work through your issues with what happened between you and your friend in a nonjudgemental fashion. This might just help you with your sexual and relationship problem. If thats not the root of the problem then a good counsellor should be able to assist you in finding out what is. Therapy is rarely a cure but I know of very very few cases where therapy did not at least help.For your depression in addition to counselling I can personally recommend speaking to a doctor about it. I have found antidepressants very helpful personally and antianxiety medication but I understand this is not for everyone. Depression like the panic attacks is not something anyone should have to live with.I wish you all the best.As a note I am not a professional I am a victim of sexual violence myself and I am a student counsellor.

5203674,0,t3_3m9laz,Hi njpernvevmwvThese are really common feelings for abuse survivors. The selfdoubt questioning if it happened how much happened were parts of itall of it my fault?  Its one the most awful and lingering effects that a users leave us with. One way I use to help solidify the reality what you know to be true is to record it. Either writing it down just like youve done a bit here or voice recording.  Stating your truth what happened what you recall in as much or little detail as you need. Then its there for you to reread or rehear during those times you question yourself. Ive had some clients do it like a letter to their future doubting self to hold them up during those times. Journaling in general is a very effective therapy tool. Another way is to have supportive allies in your corner. It could be your therapist best friend family even a forum like this. Anywhere youve told your experiences to people who have your back and can remind you of how bad it was. Those are a couple ideas. What do you think?All my best!,rapecounseling,cvd8i03,3,t5_2rfx0

Think about it most counselors dont counsel their own family members. Theres a reason for that. You dont want your relationship to turn into a counselorclient relationship at the cost of your boyfriendor girlfriend I dont know your gendergirlfriend relationship. If you want advice on how to be supportive you can check out RAINN.org. Im pretty sure they have resources for how best to support a loved one. Many colleges also have information booklets on how to support a friend that can be found online. In general from what Ive read the most important things to reiterate are  I believe you   Its not  your fault and  your feelings and reactions are normal and understandable. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by what your girlfriend is going through you could consider getting counseling yourself. Counseling would give you a place to vent your emotions and also to maybe learn more strategies for how to help your girlfriend. If you go to counseling it also might normalize counseling for your girlfriend and make counseling seem more approachable. I wish you all the best!,rapecounseling,cvn4sk5,3,t5_2rfx0

Which really is much better! Why be old you when you can be an even better you than that! Trying to go back in time is just setting yourself up for disappointment and unnecessary self frustration.

There are other ways to gain closure that dont depend on your attacker.Chances are if you confront him in person he will re victimize you or humiliate you. If you want an apology or want him to know your side of the story he will disappoint you. My point being seek therapy. Seek a counselor who can show you how to get closure without someone else being involved. Get help because even though its been a year there is not specific time line to healing. Take your time.,rapecounseling,cwds22v,2,t5_2rfx0

5539654,0,t3_3qzsh4,Hey I am a survivor as well and Ive been in relationships and Im currently dating some people.Ive always found it helpful and important to tell my SO about my past pretty early on the the relationship. Its definitely a difficult conversation to have I usually start it of with something like I have something really important to tell you. Can you just listen for a bit? Ive never had things go badly because I told someone. If he really cares about you he wont freak out and he will want to support you. Talking about it has always improved my relationships its really helpful for me to have that openness. I think it will be really helpful for you because you can try and work on your issues with sex together rather than feeling so alone with your feelings. Have you sought out counselling or therapy yet? Professional help will be the best thing to help you overcome your feelings of disgust or guilt and work towards having a healthy sex life. ,rapecounseling,cwjqmiz,3,t5_2rfx0
5580561,0,t1_cwoijtb,This is absolutely true.  Like uJaronK mentioned Ive worked with clients to identify the root of need or feeling that gets met with the socalled destructive behavior.  Then work on linking that feeling or sensation to something you can feel better about.Sometimes its about examining a value we think we have thats getting in the way of experiencing that feeling.  For example believing that casual or anonymous sex is wrong.  Some women will want to experience healthy fun sex where they feel wanted and in control but stop themselves because they hold onto the idea that its wrong to want that.  So they revert to the compulsion because it can then be rationalized as that damaged part of me instead of making a direct choice.Im talking about a somewhat complicated idea so I hope its coming across well.  If not let me know and I can help you understand what Im saying.Either way knowing more about what you are looking for the attention you shouldnt have will help you to figure out a way to get it that you can feel good about.All my best!,rapecounseling,cwotjqz,1,t5_2rfx0

You could let your two friends know that you dont want your assault to be shared with everyone that you will decide who to tell.

6332731,0,t1_cz9g3rf,I guess I just feel a sense of...guilt? Like Im  sure this asshole is walking around and feels like everything we did was consensual because I DID eventually go with it... and hes going to walk around with that misconception for the rest of his life and he probably went on to pressure other girls too and I feel like if he did its my fault.  I wonder if he even knows I was scared if he thinks I just gave into my innermost desires.  I keep reading a lot about verbal consent being important and Im sure I gave verbal consent while I was dating him at least a few times but is there a difference between Ugh okay fine whatever and Yes? I keep feeling strangled by this sense of I fucked up and Im blaming him.  I still had a choice in the end but... he really made me feel like I didnt but is that on him or on me?  Like I remember he used to be obsessed w trying to give me oral sex and I was always able to stop him before he got very far by like hitting his shoulders and physically pulling him back up over and over so maybe if Id just fought harder the other times... Im sorry Im talking in circles.  Ive just been mulling over this shit for awhile now with no where to talk about it so it all comes out in a jumble.I feel like I WANT to talk to someone about it but I also feel...unworthy I guess? Like everyone keeps saying Guys pressure girls into doing stuff its just part of growing up he didnt do anything any other guy wouldnt do as long as he didnt hold you down its the normal teenage experience. so I feel like Id be wasting their time.,rapecounseling,cz9gn72,1,t5_2rfx0

6686581,0,t3_475n8j,Thanks for having the courage to reach out and share your story! You arent alone. If there isnt anyone you feel comfortable talking to in your family or among your friends you can contact trained responders at RAINN.org or in.org. Both have online chat systems and RAINN has a phone hotline. in is specifically designed for men who had unwanted sexual experiences in childhood and it has a lot of resources you may find helpful in addition to the hotline such as book suggestions and testimonies from other survivors. malesurvivor.org has a network of chatrooms and stuff for men whove been abused or assaulted to connect with one another. I also would encourage you to seek out therapy. I know right now it feels like it wouldnt help but that feeling of hopelessness? I feel like thats a sign that you could really benefit from therapy. A counselor may be able to help you regain a sense of power and control and help you develop a plan that will make a difference. What happened was NOT your fault. Its not uncommon for kids or adults to blame themselves or to feel like they should have stopped it but just because its a common feeling does NOT mean its true. Freezing is the most common reaction to violation. Besides it was NEVER up to you to stop them it was always up to THEM to stop hurting you. Another thing I feel thats worth mentioning is that many survivors especially men may feel confused or guilty about their bodys response to abuse. Remember that sexual arousal is preprogrammed evolutionary response. It doesnt mean you wanted it. Feeling physical pleasure doesnt mean you enjoyed it. Its how our bodies are designed to work. It doesnt make what happened your fault. I wish you all the best!,rapecounseling,d0ay8pf,2,t5_2rfx0
6712374,0,t1_d0d2348,Thank you so so much for replying to my post. I was raped last year so the chance of it going further than just informational purposes is slim Im ok with that...unless of course he has a record. They do a restraining order automatically? The biggest thing for me is that I just want them to know who he is. I met him from a dating site. He is on another but with completely different information.  I just get a horrible feeling that he is going to do this again. I dont know what his name even is. He told me it was x and the other site says z. But because he is on match.com and you have to pay after a few days of use Im thinking they can find him. I got him blocked from the first site but as far as evidence goes unless they can get it out if the carpet I scrubbed doubtful it is my word against his. I dont want to go to court because Im aware of how it usually goes.

7389098,0,t1_d2hqa4f,Thank you so much for writing back to me and not making fun of me. I have to see the therapist lady  times a week right now bc of me trying to hurt myself so badly. Its just Im so shy to talk to her in person and she already asked me if this kinda stuff had ever happened to me and I shook my head no and I really hate lying to people I was just too nervous to tell her I guess. But now if I tell her shell know I was lying and probably not want to help me anymore. ampnbspI think telling my mom now would be a really cruel thing to do to her. It would be like taking away all the good memories shes got of dad and its to late to stop what happened to me. Im always going to have to live with the mistakes I made but she never even has to know which is a nicer way to live I think.ampnbspIts really kind of you to tell me its not my fault. And I truthfully didnt realize how terrible I was making things for me and my family. But the truth is that I should of known better even if I was reallyreally young. Bc most kids can just know not to do that kind of thing... Like I know I cant remember when it started but I know Ive always had really bad dreams and I would have to go sleep in my mom and dads room or I couldnt fall asleep. Bc my parents were on call at the hospital  nights a week a lot of the time it would just be one of them. I really think I should of known better bc pretty much everyone know its different for a girl and guy to do that and I should of been more careful.

7604765,0,t3_4jh4m1,I agree with you! It sucks that our legal system doesnt work for survivors of sexual violence. There are far too many misconceptions about this crime. It seems that no case represents a good rape. How could they when people still believe that strangers are the perpetrators and somehow survivors should behave differently? There are far too many abusers who go on to sexually violate multiple people adversely affecting their lives and the lives of their loved ones.However we survivors are not the only ones who have to do the work of getting better. If society is going to see a turn around in convictions and incidents of sexual violence we all have to do the work of getter better at supporting victimssurvivors and eliminating  rape culture.People need to intervene when they see a situation where someone may be taken advantage of. People need to believe and support survivors the first time they come forward with their experience of abuse. Officers need to be trained to be compassionate and believe the survivors who come in with a report of sexual violence. Legislators need to make changes to how these cases proceed through court. Survivors need to be assigned a lawyer who represents their needs amp concerns in court. Judges need to be educated about the damage that is done to not only survivors but their families as well. Sentencing for sexual crimes needs to be more meaningful and include educationtreatment for the offender. Im sure there are a lot of other things Ive missed like not sexualizing women in music videos beer commercials and movies.We all can do something to make a change for the better.You did nothing wrong. I hope that you can find the support and assistance to heal and recover.Take care of you!,rapecounseling,d36mez4,3,t5_2rfx0

8119684,0,t3_4qg60q,It takes a lot of courage to take that first step. You are very brave and doing the right thing in order to heal from your experience.If you feel that you are being judged or if this therapist says something inappropriate then you need to ask for a referral to another therapist. Therapists are not there to judge you their role is to assist you in healing. You need to take care of yourself during this process.The therapists I spoke to both told me to correct them if I felt they had something inappropriate. They were both very respectful and kind.Sexual assault and rape are  the fault of the abuser. That person chooses their behavior and is responsible for their actions.It is not unusual for a survivor to become more sexually active after such an assault. This crime is not about sex. Its about taking power and control away from someone.  As a result you were trying to take back control over your own body.Your thoughts afterward are very normal. Its not unusual to question what happened to you and why it happened. Please know that you are not making a big deal out of nothing. What happened is not okay and your feelings are valid. You did nothing to deserve to be treated this way.I hope that you find your current therapist to be supportive kind and helpful.Be gentle with yourself!,rapecounseling,d4sq4f6,2,t5_2rfx0

In high school I battled depression that got me kicked out of school once and they tried to get me a therapist but we couldnt afford it.

You dont judge your friend for whatever they decide. Unconditional support. Not every victim wants to report. And thats OK. Your friend didnt have control of what happened to them help them make up for it by letting them make whatever decisions they need. You obviously care a lot.

This is not unusual for survivors since rape is about taking power and control away from another person sex is just the tool that is used. You are trying to feel a sense of  control over your sexuality. Its good that you are talking about this with a therapist.

9082668,0,t3_54n42l,Ok Im going to play devils advocate it may come off as rude but its something that I kind of wish someone told me when I was in my delusion about wanting my emotional scars to be physical. Basically just try and think about how the person who abused you is winning. If you continue to gain weight not only did they violate you and cause you to loose people close to you but they have altered how you look as well. You deserve to be hot. Whether that is plus size hot because thats how you feel comfortable or skinny gym hot. Either way it seems like you gaining weight is just a reminder that every time you look in the mirror and feel gross you are also remembering what happened to you. Yes your friend bothering you is dumb and honestly she should stop because if you go to the gym it will be on your own terms.  What Im just trying to say is maybe put that anger and effort into something to better yourself and make yourself forget what happened. When I was initially abused I cut and dyed my hair because I needed drastic change.  I would hit my head until I got headaches and I wore the same baggy clothes for days. When my PTSD got bad years later I cut wanting the physical scars that didnt go away to show themselves on my skin. I starved myself wanting to look as empty as I felt. Now here I am about to dye my hair again because I need to change. Im trying to eat more and gain some weight back and maybe some muscle. Im just not going to let him win. Im not going to continuously destroy my body because I feel like it isnt mine anymore since he violated it. Tell your friend that you need time and that her nagging to go to the gym isnt going to motivate you but only validate that you are just as gross outside as you feel inside. Also Im really sorry about what happened. You losing friends and your love. Trust me I understand completely how devastating that is. I wish that didnt happen but it does and you will rebuild. But you can mope and gain weight and do what ever it takes for now to mourn but just realize that eventually youll have to pick yourself back up because you are worth great things.,rapecounseling,d83l7s5,3,t5_2rfx0

Completely cut the old guy off STAT if he calls you or contacts you call the fking police Go to counseling yourself and work out some of these demons and possibly arrange for couples counseling with your NEW guy so he can absorb all the shit you went through with the old guy. Also part of the counseling should probably focus on why you would not have more selfesteem and kick the old guy to the curb at the first sign of trouble. You deserve better the old guy sounds like a truly horrible and irredeemable person. Do NOT accept any more contact from him ever. He emotionally manipulates you and you have to be a lot stronger and just tell yourself you just do not have room for anyone in your life who doesnt treat you well period.,rapecounseling,d8air7v,1,t5_2rfx0
9162240,0,t3_55r7nd,This might be a good time to turn your feelings outward. Activate righteous anger mode! Because seriously fuck your roommate. She has no fucking clue what you went through but she decided to throw your friendship under the bus in favor of her friendship with him. Now shes not a friend shes just someone that you have to communicate with occasionally in order to get household stuff done. There are a surprising number of people out there who would be understanding and supportive. She is far from your only chance at friendship. Shes just a jerk that you happen to live with... ,rapecounseling,d8ddq6g,4,t5_2rfx0
9225692,0,t1_d8lemsj,Oh yes.  The need the desire to be validated to have our reality confirmed by people who care about us whose opinion we respect is a huge part of healing from sexual assault trauma.  Even from the assaulter themselves.  I have spoken with countless women who said that more than anything including the perpetrator being held legally accountable that they wanted acknowledgement and a genuine apology for what he did.  Its amazing how healing it can be for the perpetrator to simply admit what he did and that it was wrong.,rapecounseling,d8lfa8e,1,t5_2rfx0
9337174,0,t3_58dk4o,Your gf has a lot of trust in you and I can imagine it took a lot of courage to tell you about her experience. You might suggest that she call a local support line to ask about sexual trauma services in your community. Or you could do that and let her know what services there are. If you live in the U.S. you can go to RAINN.org enter your zip code and receive a list of therapists many of them offer services free.Its important to allow your gf to decide when she is ready to contact a therapist to ask for assistance. She needs to be in control of what steps are taken in regards to her healing. It takes a lot of courage and trust to reach out to others for support and then talk about such an intimate crime. It is possible for her to heal with the right therapist and time.You might look at  for further information about supporting her.,rapecounseling,d8zjzvo,3,t5_2rfx0
9344514,0,t1_d8yjw4e,From your other replies I see that you replied to him. Sometimes it helps to get some closure but dont engage if he replies to you. You cant reason with or understand people who willing chose to hurt someone in a way like this. Youre probably never going to get him to admit or understand that he did something wrong and he will use every opportunity to engage with you to try to manipulate you. The best victory you can have is ignoring him. Considering that he keeps trying to engage with you ignoring him is what will get back at him the most. He wants a response dont give him one. When I broke up with my abusive ex he literally just ignored the breakup and kept acting like we were dating still showing up at my house and all. It took me blocking him on every platform and just pretending that I didnt hear him when he spoke to me for him to eventually get the point.,rapecounseling,d90hfp4,1,t5_2rfx0

They may help you to process this healthily.,rapecounseling,d9f7yd5,2,t5_2rfx0
9693260,0,t1_da7rwe5,I completely understand. It takes a lot of effort to open up to someone and sometimes its more than theyre expecting. Im the same wayI met my boyfriend six months after it happened and I wouldnt be here without him. My problem is the opposite. I have him but I dont really have friends. I mean I have people I could call if I got hurt and who I know care about me but Im not really close to anyone where I physically live. And Im sorry to say this but the crying hasnt gone away. I was just on the phone and started crying out of nowhere. Ive read a lot about rape and PTSD and a lot of people dont know why theyre upset when they get upset and just cry. I seem to do that a lot but starting antidepressants helped some. Im not glad youre going through this but Im glad Im not alone. I hope you find someone or something new who makes you happy because life after being raped is hard. Ive completely lost interest in almost everything I love and dont know what to do about it. I wish I could just forget it all. ,rapecounseling,da7wew4,1,t5_2rfx0

10532411,0,t3_5qtfdi,First I want to say that What happened was not your fault and you did not deserve any of it. Also it is very unfortunate but the fact that you could not remember what happened for many years fits perfectly with childrens response to trauma. Those types of traumatic memories are often blocked out entirely for years until they resurface this can happen multiple times. It sounds like you are looking for a so what do I do now? type of answer. It is entirely up to you. They took your power when you were young and now you can take it back. I think telling your mother is a great idea because you have had to deal with this on your own. You deserve to have someone to help you heal from this trauma. If there are other family members or friends that you trust they may be good people to confide in as well.If you are interested in getting more help then the RAINN hotline is a good resource as well as their directory of local sexual assault service providers centers.rainn.org. One book that is for people who were sexually abused as children is the Courage to Heal Guide A Guide for Women Survivors of Sexual Abuse by Ellen Bass. I know of some others that may help but that one is the most applicable. I hope something I said helps. It sounds like what you are going through is really tough and confusing now but even just the fact that you posted here shows that you want to heal. Best of luck with your healing.,rapecounseling,dd1yr7o,2,t5_2rfx0
10629924,0,t3_5s2cmp,If you dont think you can trust someone in real life why not share it anonymously somewhere on online? It helped me. Ive only ever told two people about it irl.  You dont have to share it if you do not want to. Sharing will definitely help her to help you and it could also be a step towards recovering from it. There is this method of therapy for PTSD whereby the victim recalls the entire event in present tense i.e. live it again. Im not suggesting you try that or that your therapist is trying that but it just shows the possible therapeutic value of telling your story.  Just tell her you dont remember. The mind has a way of blocking out memories that are too traumatic.  Legally she is not obligated to tell your parents. According to most ethical codes she is not obligated to tell your parents either. ,rapecounseling,ddce9b8,3,t5_2rfx0
10788672,0,t3_5u4rnn,I understand what youre feeling and Im so sorry. Something like that happened to me. I wanted a hook up of some sort but didnt want sex. Needless to say it happened anyway. Woke up to it happening after I clearly remember saying no and asking for it all to be done due to some red flags and the discomfort he was causing me to feel. I passed out and he decided to do whatever the hell he wanted to do simply because I couldnt say no again and physically stop him. I too was called a plethora of terrible things when I was finally conscious enough and able to kick him off of me and make him leave. Its disgusting behavior and its unacceptable. What happened to both you and I is rape. You were assaulted and it is NOT your fault. You didnt ask for it. Wanting affection kisses and companionship is absolutely NOT equal to wanting forced sex. Expressing interest in making out or doing any sort of sexual activity that isnt explicitly sex DOES NOT give anyone a right to have sex with you. Sex isnt even sex unless both parties mutually enjoy it and want it. Its a two person effort. This one sided participation and use of force and violence is rape. What he did is the result of men deciding that they have a right to our bodies that overpowers our own right to our own bodies. Rape is about power and entitlement. There is nothing you could have done to stop his behavior. The flaw is in the culture that boys are raised in. Please dont feel like you did anything wrong and definitely dont let yourself believe the terrible things he said to you because they simply arent true. Dont feel ashamed and dont be afraid to seek any help that feels suitable to you. I know its easier said than done but there are people out there who can help and who believe you and who genuinely care. ,rapecounseling,ddsrwfn,1,t5_2rfx0

Im in therapy now but I think Ive made all the progress I can with her but its free and I cant afford anything else so I gotta stick with it. I can definitely relate about being detached hating yourself and not understanding why people like me. The only thing Ive found that helps is to imagine I was someone else what I would say if someone told me theyre struggling with the same things I experience. Id tell them that if people love you it should be cherished that theyve found something in you worth loving and bringing to the light even if theres pain and hurt there too. ,rapecounseling,dfeiq0a,1,t5_2rfx0
11339807,0,t3_61o38u,Yes this is prosecutable certainly as statuatory rape if not forcible. Raping a woman under the influence is universally recognized as illegal now.  But it really depends on how your case is handled if the D.A. accepts it if it goes to trial etc. Its possible they could force a plea deal with your rapist. As far as testifying the court or your attorney can order them to do so but they will look at if it will help your case or not. I encourage you to pursue this if it will help in your recovery. But please dont mix up legal remedies with your growth and recovery. I work with many women who pin their validation of what happened to their case rather than to what they know to have happened. Your truth is valid. Whether or not he gets justice for hurting you it takes nothing away from the fact that he did. Keep writing and talking. Thats your path to healing. All my best!,rapecounseling,dfhcild,2,t5_2rfx0

11366400,0,t3_626ob0,Its definitely considered rape.The fact you were asleep means you could not give consent this makes it sexual assaultrape.Often in a moment of fear we tend to freeze. Its not just fight or flight. Its a form of survival mode especially with scenarios like this where we are shit scared and confused. Please dont blame yourself.A family friend forced oral on me when I was really young and I just froze went along with it went completely numb and repressed it until I was . What you went through was really wrong and you may feel like you have gone along but you were coerced and didnt give consent. ,rapecounseling,dfkcye1,3,t5_2rfx0
11398887,0,t3_62mpbw,I am too. I am aware of it. It creates an inner conflict. I just try and treat everyone with respect as well as caution. Looking at the bigger picture everyone everywhere is prejudice due to thier own experiences. And its natural i think. If something hurts us our minds and bodies try and protect us from it happening again. I personally hate big guys hate military men its a constant fight in my own head to remember they are not all bad. In fact most are decent.

11788058,0,t3_685mv9,I cant say that Ive had any experience with this sort of situation.I sounds like your abusive dad has the situation well under control. You are unfortunately portrayed as the selfish unforgiving daughter who is distressed and he is the kind and loving dad who misses his daughter. After all he has a lot to lose if you are believed.It seems that other members of your family think that what happened to you was minor and maybe not sexual. Who knows what your dad has said to them.There is only so much you can do when people are unwilling to listen and are being manipulated. I think that you have done all you can at this point. Other people in the family are aware of your dads sexually abusive behavior and the onus is on them to intervene if his girlfriends daughter is being targeted for abuse.I suggest that you find a trauma therapist who you are comfortable working with and begin your journey of healing and recovery. Maybe a trained therapist can give you advice about how you might help this girl.Take good care of yourself.,rapecounseling,dgw7s2q,3,t5_2rfx0
