1601727,0,t3_2cll64,Im pretty sure the best thing to come out of this episode are all the vampire pregnancy comments. D But I do like how the JaneFrank situation is being adapted so far. There was one part of the episode where the framing of Emma and Annie was a little off and the full doorway was in view. I was waiting for Alex to walk by behind them. ,EmmaApproved,cjh2euh,5,t5_2y33x
