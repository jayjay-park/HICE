2224700,0,t3_2kk30z,So I just watched those three other links and I gotta say I really do think LA has had it the best so far for the choirs. Milans was a little too formal a little too operatic. Amsterdams was good but no percussion. Are we the only city to have gotten percussion so far?I think this is my favorite song on the album.,DamienRice,clmm2wa,1,t5_2wzzr
