Jacobsgt  From the bestselling author of The KnowItAll comes a fascinating and timely exploration of religion and the Bible.Raised in a secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers to play a tenstring harp to stone adulterers.The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound reverent and irreverent personal and universal and will make you see historys most influential book with new eyes.Jacobss quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica for The KnowItAll. His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer tends sheep in the Israeli desert battles idolatry and tells the absolute truth in all situations  much to his wifes chagrin.Throughout the book Jacobs also embeds himself in a crosssection of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentuckybased creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovahs Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twentyfirstcentury brain.Jacobss extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and challenges. A book that will charm readers both secular and religious The Year of Living Biblically is part Cliff Notes to the Bible part memoir and part look into worlds unimaginable.
