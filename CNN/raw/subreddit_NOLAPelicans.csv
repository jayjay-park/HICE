133222,0,t3_1vlxjq,This was click bait guys. The article clearly states the only protected players are AD and Jrue. That is to say there is no deal that is worth enough to trade those two. Is that the same for anyone else? Nope. The Pels have been actively trying to trade EG for some time. This is no surprise. Frankly I think they want cap room from a trade given the injuries. I dont think they want players coming back. Tough deal to make. As for Tyreke I think it would take a monster deal for us to ship him out. Is such a deal out there? Probably not but if one came up theyd trade him. I think the title overstates the situation with looking to trade. I think they are trying to free up some money and get away from the log jam at guard. They maybe taking calls on Tyreke but I dont think he is on the trade block. ,NOLAPelicans,cetlqp4,4,t5_2vppf

Until today I had only heard the lakers who were the worst heat second worst and then atl bos and SA all were pretty biased. However today Im watching my first Pelicans broadcast and your guys seem great. They dont seem to be heavily affected by who scores or who the fouls are on and actually gives unbiased responses to the game. They also seem to actually know things that arent common knowledge about the rockets which was also surprising. It has made the broadcast much more enjoyable regardless of the fact that the rockets are clearly not putting out much of an effort and Im embarrassed by their first half.,NOLAPelicans,cncqwf9,13,t5_2vppf

2846645,0,t1_cnrnmnj,Here is the thing. Asik in the staring lineup obviously works. Its one of the best lineups in the league. But this team is so damn inconsistent mysterious its tough to remember what works and what doesnt. All that to me either points to youth or coaching and truthfully its a bit of both.Now with this trade you get a premier offensive center in Brook who can also protect the rim. He offers spacing and fits well next to AD. You sacrifice rebounding  but Brook is a great box outer and his teams for the vast majority have been better rebounders than their opponents while he is on the floor. He has a player option so worst case he opts out  or he opts out this year. Eiherway cap space. Jack gives us familiarity with Montys system and a back up point. Plus Brook is BFFS with Ryan. Starting line looks like BrookADDanteGordonJrue with JackQponBabbitAndersonAjinca. I think I like that. But its a dreamland and it wont happen.,NOLAPelicans,cnrnvjr,4,t5_2vppf

4319635,0,t3_3acb35,No because Rudy Gay is another version of Jrue and Tyreke. Getting the th best player at every position isnt the way to build around Davis we need to get another stud somehow. Gordon may actually have some trade value if he starts off hot but Gay isnt ever going to have real trade value. Locking up cap space long term for a medium player is how we lose AD.Course maybe Im wrong and Rudy Gay comes over and scores  PPG and leads us to the finals.

Jay Hook just got a summer league invite and with Curry already on the summer league roster its getting harder to see Cook get an invite.Also I dont see everyones problem with selling the pick k could easily fund all the contracts to summer league guys or a minimum or unguarenteed deal next year.

11668972,0,t1_dgimp5x,Dude...We have zero assets.  ??Tradeable assets regardless of Jrues decision  up to  first round draft picks and  pick swaps and  second round draft picks over the next five years about . mil in unguaranteed contracts and about  mil in expiring contracts  if you count Diallo but hes too good to just cut after next year.And if Jrue opts out youve also immediately got about  mil in cap space w the ability to get to max cap room if needed.  Cutting Toupane Cook and Crawford gets us to . which would be a pretty decent free agent on its own or allow us to do a crazy trade like Qpons expiring  some set of draft assets for a guy making  mil or less  Bledsoe anyone?  Or dream big about Butler or PG.  I wouldnt mind gambling every asset weve got on one of those guys.  And if by some stroke of voodoo miracle CP or Hayward or somebody like that wants in we can get to max cap space in several ways with those picks such as by dumping Qpon Asik and Ajinca most likely for the cost of a first and a couple seconds.  If there are no takers for Asik we can still get to max space by stretching Asik and including Fraziers expiring in the dump. Id like to keep Jrue but if we or he decide really early in the process that he wont be here next year we have a ton of flexibility in building the roster due to having all our picks available. Getting enough cap space to sign several quality free agents for depth is a possibility. Getting enough cap space for an elite max contract free agent is a possibility. And a blockbuster trade for a superstar is also possible.If you keep Jrue then you can get one MLE type guy in FA and salary matching for a blockbuster trade for a superstar gets a lot harder.TLDR Losing Jrue gives us more flexibility which could be a good thing or at least not a worse outcome than keeping Jrue but maybe not if we strike out on all our options or are paralyzed by indecision about which option to pursue.,NOLAPelicans,dgiozbb,2,t5_2vppf
11669332,0,t1_dgiq59j,We dont just have one first round pick man.  Actually read the comment I started with.The cap explosion has leveled off and a ton of teams have already spent the resulting cap space.  The value of expirings and unguaranteeds will be making a come back as teams start feeling buyers remorse.  Arguably the worst assets in the league is silly.  The Nets exist.   Also if you read my comment I limited my statement to the subset of good teams.  Name me a playoff team with better assets outside of star players.,NOLAPelicans,dgiqgaf,-1,t5_2vppf
