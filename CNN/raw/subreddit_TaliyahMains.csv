8264238,0,t3_4smqx0,I just hate one thing about the new W if you die when youre activating it the spell wont go off. And thats absurd considered the semantic of the spell itself Taliyah is summoning a piece of rock from the terrain and thats not strictly correlated with Taliyah being alive or not.

8718974,0,t1_d6vf7mt,There is no diversity allowed in LOL. You should play in THE WAY THE DESIGNER WANTS YOU TO PLAY.

But I figure if youre stripping her of her main tool to aid in getting ahead theres no reason to nerf further without seeing how it affects the game. Its all speculation Riot could be right to do this but rather than take it step by stepmethodically they do heavy handed nerfs sometimes which could be justified or over the top. Idk.

Protobelt can and has saved my life on multiple occasions but there are also situations where zhonyas is better ex zed.

10029737,0,t3_5jbocs,Fizz Enthusiast wrote on  UTC Musings on Fun and ClunkinessgtSo fun has been a hot button topic over the last few days I thought Id give my opinion on what fun is and preserving fun after reworks.   gt  gtGenerally speaking when Fizz could WQ and just instantly kill people that was fun and as a Fizz Enthusiast that was some of the most fun Ive had in League of Legends. Unfortunately that has consequences.   gt  gtIf playing Fizz like that is a  and assuming everyone else on your team is having  amounts of fun. If Fizz having  fun is causing everyone on the enemy team to have  fun then your holistic fun is .   gt  gtNow imagine if Fizz post rework is  fun but everyone on the enemy team is having  fun then youre having more fun . Obviously a very contrived and marginal example but that is the holistic benefit of doing a game health driven rework. In this case if the thing we were trying to fix was both unfair and fun its going to be very difficult but still possible to replace that thing for the Fizz player to give them  fun  the rework has to be exceptional in that doing a fair thing can produce that extra  of fun.   gt  gtFor this reason reworking popular champions is always going to be difficult  if theyre popular and need a rework they are almost certainly doing something thats unfair and youll have to add something exceptional to make them equally fun. If they are less popular mains will almost always have more fun after the rework because their gameplay was probably just bad and unfun to begin with and anything will be better  eg. Taric.   gt  gtThis is one of the reasons why I personally think the Katarina rework was good some of it still needs ironing out but I believe it can be solved because the daggers system added that  fun back for Katarina while increasing fun and play against for the opponent.   gt  gtNow to the clunky argument this is more of a theoretical discussion so bear with me.   gt  gtThe reason why clunkiness exists is because we cant have  Lucians. If we keep making Lucians and Yasuos who are extremely smooth everyone will only play Lucian and Yasuo and every other champion will feel clunky and bad by comparison. Lucian and Yasuo are both amazing and unique designs but their mere existence can cause us problems.   gt  gtDo you remember the time  months ago where there was a Yasuo and Lucian on both teams in every game in blind pick no bans? Because I surely do and it was horrible  not because Lucian is awful to play against  hes pretty fair but just because there was no variety in the games. The bad thing about that situation was that Lucian wasnt even powerful by any objective measure he had a sub  winrate and subsequently drew relatively few bans. People eventually just started banning him because they were so sick of seeing him in every game. Some of my friends who only play normals even stopped playing as a result.   gt  gtIf Jinx and Lucian are the same strength who would want to play Jinx who is slow and has no escapes when they can play Lucian or Ezreal or any of the nonclunky characters? The thematic or alternate gameplay hook has to be really strong to overcome this for Jinx to get played and luckily it is. This is why designers get triggered by people complaining things are clunky because they know clunky  sustainable. Imagine if Jinx our most popular marksman by thematics and gameplay was also the least clunky character. You would see Jinx in every single game.   gt  gtImagine if the game had no cast times on all of our champions of course that would make every character more fun to play and less clunky but suddenly half the roster becomes unplayable because they have no dash so they cant dodge any abilities. Lucian suddenly becomes picked every game because hes the only character with an instant dash that can dodge Malphite ultimate or skillshots without flash or maybe tanks and AP mages become the only things that are playable because even Lucian cant dodge the damage that Annie can shit out in . seconds flat with no cast time on QW or R  she wouldnt even have to aim.   gt  gtAs a lot of people know Dota has turn speed. Turn speed is clunky as hell but you know what? In TI  heroes got picked. The very first thing that would go out the door if turn speed got removed is hero diversity because Garen and melees can actually be played in high ELO in Dota to great effect  in part because their ranged carries cannot fluidly auto attack and move at the same time. There is a movement cost to be paid every time Drow Ranger attacks.   gt  gtAnd even after having played Dota for so many years of my life I simply cant go back to it without craving the smoothness of League again.   gt  gtMy worry is that having clunkless champions is just not sustainable and the game will eventually die or become a shell of its former self. Maybe this is a pessimistic outlook and maybe theres a way to make every champion not clunky without alienating half the roster but I dont want us to take that risk without knowing exactly what were doing and see the game I love die.   gt  gtSo yes just general musings. As always leave comments.  gt  gtEDIT Of course where optimal wed like to add gameplay without clunkiness. Cast times and projectile speeds are a way that we can add gameplay without making the character feel overly clunky and unresponsive.   gt  gtCamille is a good example of where we can have a lot of gameplay without having the kit feel unresponsive using travel times and lockouts on Q that feel natural and Jag did a good job on those.

Taliyah should have some frames in which she is able to ride the wall before falling down.Missing a W and losing the fight...provoking an triple our double death... thats the stuff of disgrace.Blocking teammates because of wonky wall and then pressing R like mad to try to dissolve it but the wall do not respond.

11334425,0,t3_61m4d7,Theres actually an Ashe support build going around right now that focuses on the same idea building Ardent Censor and using SBP mastery. Her W is obviously a lot easier to hit everyone with than our E and her autos slow thanks to her passive but its the same idea slow everyone and everything heal your team and buff your teams AP AS on hit. Its less about the heal especially because you are ranged so its halved than it is about the buffs from Ardent. Of course also with Ashe they are building Runaans so also apply it to  people clumped up with her autos but if you could apply your Q after Rylais maybe it could work. You also have to keep in mind that Taliyah always does build pretty tanky for an AP mage i.e. Rylais and Liandrys. If you picked up those a Ruby SS Redemption and some shoes youd be a full build still do an ok amount of damage and have a lot of support with peels and heals. Id even say swap out the Liandrys for a Locket depending on the game basically if they have no tank. Definitely worth a try just keep in mind you probably wont be the Zyra or Brand type APC support without more AP items so if your team isnt doing well or just not very good in general I think it will be harder to carry than building full AP or just going a healing support like Soraka or Sona. Good luck let us know how it goes!,TaliyahMains,dfgqjy6,1,t5_3ee2q
