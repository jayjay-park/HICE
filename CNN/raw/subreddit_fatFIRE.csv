11469455,0,t3_63k410,I do but if anything its going to lead to slower fatFIRE.I buy blue chip resi cash flow is enough to cover costs and naturally leads to making  over time but its nothing to write home about would need tens of millions in property to fatFIRE. The real gains are in the asset appreciation. Which is far more tax advantaged to me becauseA You only pay it at time of sale rather than every financial year IF you sell vs borrow against the assetB In my country we get a  discount on capital gains profit made on asset tax if we hold it for more than  months... which I obviously do.If I wanted to fatFIRE faster Id just sink it all into far more liquid investments with better regular cash flow but easy access to cheap leverage in a stable asset class is too lucrative to pass up. Its also an asset class that banks love lending against  really easy to offset cash against.Long term I dont really know what Ill do with it yet. Ill probably hold onto my properties until Ive had kids and those kids have grown into their own careers. If the local market is now bullshit and they are priced out forever Ill help them get into the market at a discount ill still make em work for it if not maybe Ill cash out and buy toys or just sit on them letting the asset appreciate and using the cash flow to provide a leanFIRE equivalent and the rest of my portfolio to make it FATer,fatFIRE,dfw226z,2,t5_3hqta
