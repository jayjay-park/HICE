4878514,0,t3_3hpbf6,The biggest thing determining cost is where you live.Once youre there assuming you have a bike and almost any will do after the entry fee the only real cost is the vast amounts of food youll need along the way.The time caps are set such that barring a disaster almost anyone can complete with some modest preparation. The biggest thing you need is the will and determination to carry on. These things are not easy and you need to want it. ,randonneuring,cu9h3bi,4,t5_2scm2
