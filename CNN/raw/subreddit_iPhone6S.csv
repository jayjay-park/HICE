6756981,0,t1_d0eu23w,Thank you for helping. I tried that. When I get to gtKeyboards I have three options English Emoji and Blink the one I downloaded. If I tap on Blink it goes to another screen where I choose whether or not to allow it full access. On gtKeyboards I can also Edit which only allows me to remove keyboards and I can Add New Keyboards. There is no option to Set New Keyboard. Thoughts?,iPhone6S,d0i88ia,2,t5_2upb5
