The Commando passive is chosen due to its buffs to Sniper Rifles Assassinate abilities and its generally buffs to weapon damage overall.Earlygame Assault Rifles have terrible accuracy ratings which is why  points in Pistols is recommended.  Later game Assault Rifles plus having  points in the weapons talent have massively improved accuracy.  Assault Rifless Overkill ability simply reduces the rate at which the rifles overheat.  This same effect can also be achieved via Frictionless Materials weapon mods installed in your Assault Rifle of choice.  This is why Overkill is left at Basic for now.  Once this build is complete though additional talent points earned from leveling past  can be added to either Assault Rifles or Pistols whichever is the players backup weapon of choice. Bonus talent Master Lift adds a little bit of control and is great at raising enemies hiding in cover up in the air to be sniped.  It can also lift Geth Colossi but only have Master rank.,MassEffectBuilds,dc32z1e,1,t5_3ice5
