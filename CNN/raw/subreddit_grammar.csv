1094531,0,t3_26ndjb,I think youve gotten some bad advice.What were talking about here is broadly the topic of the participle which is that you get when you turn a verb into an adjective. Here were specifically talking about the present participle. Consider the following very simple sentencegt The man is my uncle.Now consider this almostassimple sentencegt The tall man is my uncle.The only difference between the two is that in the second sentence we added the word tall to serve as an adjective describing the noun man. Now consider this just as simple sentencegt The sitting man is my uncle.Sit is obviously a verb in the present tense and sitting is the progressive form of that verb. But here were using sitting as an adjective to describe man in exactly the same way we used tall. This is a participle. Now watchgt The sitting man was my uncle.All weve done here is to change the tense of the verb from present to past. This had no effect on the adjective obviously. If the man was sitting when the sentence was in the present tense then he was still sitting when the sentence was in the past tense. We can illustrate this a bit more clearly by making the sentence slightly more complicatedgt I see that the sitting man is my uncle.Here was have a sentence of the form I see X where X the direct object of the verb see is a subordinate clause beginning with the subordinating conjunction that. Everything that follows that is the same as the sentence wed been playing with before weve just transformed it into a clause instead of a standalone sentence.Now it is a rule of English that the verb of a subordinate clause must agree with the verb of the containing sentence in tense. So here both the verbs see and is  are in the present tense. But we can easily change them to be in the past tense.gt I saw that the sitting man was my uncle.They still agree so this sentence remains grammatical. Again the adjective sitting despite its origin as a verb does not change.If we changed the tense of just one of the two verb in the sentence like sogt I see that the sitting man was my uncle.then we would not have a grammatical sentence. That is unless we were writing about an exuncle which is a topic that doesnt make very much sense really.So tense agreement is a matter for the verbs and not for the adjectives. Adjectives manufactured from verbs that is to say participles do not need to agree in tense with verbs. A present participle fits perfectly well into a sentence in the past tense because its serving as an adjective and not as a verb.,grammar,chspags,8,t5_2qhwy

But they are both complete statements and if separated only by a comma they constitute a runon sentence.Do not be fooled or influenced by the recent and very regrettable habit of many people doing this.

Both of those words are singular but mean many. Now as far as using the word as mentioned here e.g. Shes good people you should know that this is idiomatic. Its slang. You should never use this form in a formal way and in fact I imagine the reason this phrase came about was through the idea that one person is part of an unmentioned set of good people. This is just conjecture but it makes sense to me. Great question.,grammar,cr1vovo,-2,t5_2qhwy

4015538,0,t3_36ej9h,Actually there are two important rules when it comes to pronouns and their antecedents the one you mentioned Does every pronoun agree with its antecedent in number and gender? and the other one MentemMeumAmisi mentioned Are pronoun references clear?. I can understand your frustration. You cant begin to guess how many times even with the rules and examples plus the exercises I fell short in clearly understanding what I was trying to learn and use. Its no wonder there are style and usage books galore out there.What really makes this sentence ambiguous is that you have both an adverb prepositional phrase and an adverbial subordinate clause modifying the same verb put. One asks Where? and the other begs Why? However most readers are not experts in grammar and diagramming sentences. They wouldnt understand even if I showed them in a diagram constructed strictly to the rules of how pie would be impossible to be the antecedent and subject in the subordinate clause partially because a phrase or a clause acts as ONE word. How are they to know that the sentence is really two sentences being combined? That if they read them separate one after the other the antecedent would be clear? Combine short choppy sentences into a complex sentence. Put one idea into a subordinate clause. Warriners English Grammar and Composition Third Course Liberty Edition  page  f.So if anything move the misplaced modifying clause or both clause and phrase Because it adds texture we put an apple in the pie.  In the pie we put an apple because it adds texture. Or rewrite it by adding words like MentemMeumAmisi suggested. Maybe even abandon the clause altogether To add texture we put an apple in the pie. For texture we put an apple in the pie. or We put an apple in the pie for texture.

It seems like people have been saying for decades that whom is about to disappear. Its still going strong in formal written English but when was the last time it was common in informal spoken English? Another possibility is that the usage of whom in informal English already died off a long time ago and the only thing thats changing is the proportion of English thats formal  so on average whom is rarer but really the language is just more and more heterogeneous.Via Wikipediagt By  the whowhom distinction was identified as having slipped so badly that it is almost totally uninformative.

And the corruption has not been made nearly enough for the phrase to become idiomatic as could care less has even if its not literally as logical as couldnt care less.But Im also seeing some uses of the phrase testament of time not as the complement of stand but as a standalone title or complement of be.

We dont use past perfect a lot and when we do its when the timing of the events is really relevant to the meaning of the conversation.We went to McDonalds but they wouldnt serve us because they had just closed.  In that example the fact that the store closed before they got there is very relevant so we might use it there.  But in another situation Hey should we order a pizza?  No they have already closed.

8284468,0,t3_4sxktg,Ending a sentence with a preposition is not incorrect. But if you really want to avoid it its almost always possible to rephrase the sentence though doing so tends to sound less naturalidiomatic or more formal than otherwise. Really the only good reason I can think of for doing this is if you need to translate a sentence into a language where stranded prepositions actually are ungrammatical e.g. Spanish Italian French etc.  though in informal French sometimes it is grammatical to end with a preposition.Anyhow to rephrase the sentence this way you generally just need to move the preposition to immediately before the relative clause and when applicable you need to replace that with an appropriate relative pronoun which who whom etc. This is the house that I live in.  This is the house in which I live. Shes the one whomthat I spoke with.  Shes the one with whom I spoke.There may of course be other ways to rephrase a given sentence but this way is probably the most straight forward. Youll also want to be careful not to confuse prepositions and phrasal verb particles This is something that youll just need to look up.  This is something up which youll just need to look.

8418799,0,t3_4uy5df,Hey lets look at the entry for bringtake in MerriamWebsters Dictionary of English Usagebringtakegt bring  . Bring take. Although one would imagine that most native speakers of English have mastered the directional complexities of bring and take by the time they are old enough to read a surprisingly large number of usage commentators have felt it incumbent upon themselves to explain this subtlety to adults. The basic point they make is this bring implies movement toward the speaker and take implies movement away. It is a point well made and it holds for all cases to which it applies. It does not alas apply to all cases of actual use of these verbs and hence the commentators despairgt Harper   says The distinction between bring and take is one that today is honored in the breach almost as often as in the observance. The problem however is not one of usage it is one of oversimplification on the part of the prescribers.skip a bit ...gt Let us suppose that the editor and his wife are about to go to an outdoor concert at the park. They have folding chairs and perhaps picnic things to take. The editors wife sees some cumulus clouds in the western sky. Dont forget to bring the umbrella she tells the editor as they prepare to leave. The use of bring here instead of take suggests that the editors wife is already thinking of being at the concert and possibly needing theumbrella. The notion of direction exists entirely in her head it does not refer to her immediate external surroundings. The direction implicit in bring or take in this instance is irrelevant to both the editor and to any third party who may overhear. The message is to make sure the umbrella is at the park in case of rain.gt Shakespeare provides a similar example. In Much Ado About Nothing act  scene  the constable Dogberry has gone before a magistrate with news of the capture of a couple of suspicious characters whom he would like the magistrate to examine the magistrate is in haste to be elsewhere and tells Dogberry to examine the men himself. As the magistrate leaves Dogberry says to his partner Vergesgtgt Go good partner go get you to Francis Seacoal bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail. Like the editors wife above Dogberry is thinking ahead.and skipping some more including more from Billy ...gt The notion of direction is irrelevant to the reader in each of these cases. Yet Theodore Bernstein criticized the second in his Winners amp Sinners and a correspondent sent the third into us believing it to be an error. Neither one is an error. It is pointless to try to imposeones own point of view on something that has been written from a different point of view. And in the two newspaper examples the reporters may well have been paraphrasing an original statement distancing the reader even further from the point of view of the original user of bring. Harper   considers this use of bring a debasement of our language. If it is such the process of debasement has been going on for nearly years if not longer.And then some interestig dialectical stuff based in Americagt There is a related use of bring in which the subject and object are both persons. It means approximately to cause to come or go along with to escort accompany. It too is common in Shakespeares playsgtgt ... in the morn Ill bring you to your ship The Tempest gtgt I will bring thee where Mistress Anne Page is The Merry Wives of Windsor gtgt Will you go to them? I will bring you thither Romeo and Juliet gt The OED marks this sense Obs. exc. dial. It has survived in the U.S.gt U.S. survival seems to be chiefly dialectal the Dictionary of American Regional English lists examples from several geographical areas chiefly in relation to going or returning from a social event such as a dance. The use is not directional someone can be brought to the dance and brought home afterward. It is perhaps permanently fixed in the country expression slightly altered heregtgt Ive got to dance with the ones what brung me  Representative Philip Gramm quoted in People  Jan. gt The American dialectal survival is probably another one of those older English usages that came over to this continent with early settlers and stayed in use here after falling into general disuse in Great Britain. For another such survival see LOAN LEND.and their conclusiongt Conclusion a native speaker of English will hardly ever misuse bring or take the problem exists in the minds of the usage commentators who have formulated incomplete rules for the use of bring. The nonnative speaker can easily follow the commentators simple rules. But bring and take are used in a great many idiomatic phrasesbring to bear take to task bring to mindin which the verbs are never interchanged. The nonnative speaker will find no guidance to these in our usage writers he or she must have recourse to a good dictionary.I quoted all this at length because frankly I think they did a terrific job of explaining the phenomenon.

8627918,0,t3_4y15r8,This passage is talking about things that happened at two different times the time of narration and some while before the time of narration. GRRM uses the standard narrative past tense to describe what happens at the time of narration and the past perfect to describe what happened beforehand.  But here is perhaps a more intuitive way of looking at it. Imagine that you pop into the feast at exactly the moment thats being described. You ask Jon Snow Whats going on? And he saysgtI am finding that I have a mans thirst. The youths around me urge me on every time I drain a glass. The procession has passed by my bench and I have gotten a good long look at them all.gtMy lord father came first escorting the queen. Now my father is helping her to the dais and leading her to her seat.This hypothetical monologue like the actual book describes things that happen at two different times. In this case its the present and the past. Present actions are described using the simple present or present continuous tense I am finding they urge my father is helping etc. Past actions are described using the present perfect or simple past tense the procession has passed I have gotten my father came etc.How would we convert this monologue into a narrative? Well wed change I to he and suchlike but the important part is that we put it into the narrative past tense. To oversimplify a bit every tense has to become its past version. Thus the following changes are made Present continuous gt past continuous am finding gt was finding Present simple gt past simple urge gt urged Present perfect gt past perfect have gotten gt had gotten Past simple gt past perfect came first gt had come firstAnd thats how we get the mix of tenses in the original text.  P.S. In your version the queen never so much as had looked at him isnt right it should be the queen had never so much as looked at him.,grammar,d6k3dyn,3,t5_2qhwy

8896141,0,t1_d7h1iy9,gt I see your point. I suppose I believe your first interpretation is nearer the mark because there is nothing in the excerpt you posted to suggest that people are arguing about politics outside of the Convention.No I dont think the specific arguing she is referring to is taking place outside. I just thought it could be read as followsHeres the first part. No kidding its really awfully nice out here in a beautiful city park on a sunny day in July. OK. So people are enjoying themselves its sunny etc. where a bunch of people are arguing about politics. OK so at the same time the politicians at the Convention are arguing their viewpoints and supporting Trump etc. and nothing could possibly be more interesting. OK since politicians are arguing and the mood of the day seems stifled by political arguments it follows that nothing could be more interesting than something completely different like a nice day in July outdoors etc.But Im just exploring the other possibility here. And after giving it more thought this other possibility seems more remote to me. My first reading of it  that Lepore is describing the mood inside the Convention where for the delegation supporters and politicians  nothing could be more interesting than the flow of argument and speeches  seems more accurate. The contrast from the other interpretation still exists here. That is the idea seems to be that there are other moods and nuances that are peripheral literally and figuratively to the Convention  that are important and revealing despite any false belief from within the RNC that nothing could possibly be more interesting than their own speechifying. In fact the long sentence from Lepore is expressly designed to show us what exactly is worthy of interest that is going on outside of the Convention. ,grammar,d7h6tad,1,t5_2qhwy

Look at this post on the front page. It seems pretty clear that the OP thinks that there is only one correct answer and things like dialects and grammar and linguistics dont even figure into their reasoning. Thats fine we all have to learn this stuff somewhere and that somewhere can be here.The best answer for their question is the one that explains that there are different dialects and different grammatical features for those dialects. And as ujackfuckinggladney stated the answer also needs to let the OP know what is considered Standard and is appropriate for formal contexts.The worst answer ignores all this and gives the answer one would find in Elements of Style. In that latter case we would have missed out on an opportunity to have the OP actually learn something about language and grammar.We assume people are here to learn and not just have style guides quoted at them. We are not for instance relementsofstyle or rmidcenturystyleguides etc.Also rlinguistics is not a particularly good sub for linguistics. rbadlinguistics cant take up all the slack so we help out a little here.Your late editgt When someone comes to me and asks is He will give it to you and I is wrong I will say something like Many native speakers use it but strictly speaking its bad grammarThat seems like a really poor answer. Its not just that many native speakers will use that construction but it is entirely grammatical because of that. At the same time its true that many style guides will proscribe that usage and many formal publications will require a rewrite so why not just say that? Why introduce all this extra baggage to the concept of grammar? Theres nothing wrong with explaining context and dialect we do not have to inaccurately paint proper grammar in terms of black and white correctincorrect goodbad etc. We can afford to explain the subtleties and nuances.If youve been around rlinguistics long enough then Im sure youve seen how people use nonprestige dialects as a way to prove that native speakers of those dialects are lazy ignorant uneducated and are destroying the purity of English.

Thats not technically a sentence. But then again this is a poem which means that certain liberties can be taken. Another such liberty would be an unusual ordering of parts of the sentence like I will keep you Suzy busy  Make your head with heat grow dizzy.

10717144,0,t3_5ta7ec,Several of these are ambiguous depending on context and meaning so I can only explain how to choose. The meal vs. A meal Was there a specific meal that was defined with these contents before you uttered this sentence Ill have  the Margherita Pizza meal and does the audience know youre referring to that? Then The. Or are you just saying that if someone concocts such a meal it will be illegal? Then A. consisting of vs. consisted of You probably want the first option a present participle. A meal consisted of... does not work here. However as before if there was a specific meal that previously existed you could say The meal that consisted of... the margherita pizza vs. a margherita pizza They both work. If its a specific item on the menu you can say the. Either way you can say a. But a sounds like it refers to an entire pizza not e.g. just one slice of it. Alternatively you could simply say margherita pizza with no article which isnt specific about how much pizza. Margherita Pizza vs. Pizza Margherita In English the first version is more likely we tend to put the modifier before the thing it modifies but its theoretically a foreign dish so the people who make it might use the other name instead. Call it whatever they call it. And dont capitalize it unless they do. the Pepsi vs. a Pepsi Its hard to justify saying the Pepsi because we assume Pepsi is the same everywhere and theres nothing distinct about the particular Pepsi on this pizzerias menu. a Pepsi is a common way to refer to a single unit a glass? a serving? a can? a bottle? of Pepsi in the restaurant industry but most laypeople would just say Pepsi with no article if they dont need to be specific about how much Pepsi. is now illegal vs. is illegal now There is no difference in explicit meaning. The only slight difference is emphasis the last word gets a little more emphasis especially if you say it out loud so the first option emphasizes the illegality of the meal while the second option emphasizes the recentness of the change.,grammar,ddle6zx,2,t5_2qhwy
10751635,0,t3_5tqj6u,Semiannual is a term specific to something happening twice yearly from the Latin semi for half. Similarly biannually specifically means every two years because bi means two.

11024218,0,t3_5xek1s,The second two versions of your sentence break major conventions of punctuation and I cant imagine even inexperienced writers using punctuation in those ways.gt High quality pictures are not always art.A colon never separates a noun from its verb. Occasionally writers will put one between a verb and the complements that follow e.g.gt The thing things that we need to talk about are stick skills footwork and ground balls.But even that usage is frequently frowned upon. Indeed many selfstyled punctuation experts will insist that you cant do it.gt High quality pictures are not always art.Almost all alleged comma rules are flexible but there is no syntactic or stylistic reason to put a comma between a copula aka a linking verb like are and its complement art.Can you explain what effect youre trying to achieve?,grammar,dehkcwb,3,t5_2qhwy

11487071,0,t3_63yd3b,How many younger sisters do you have?If you have just one younger sister then your sentence is missing a comma and should be punctuated like this I along with my younger sister Rehaba survived as we were abroad.  You have just one younger sister and her name is Rehaba. I along with my younger sister Rehaba survived as we were abroad.  You have multiple younger sisters and the one who survived was Rehaba.I also have my suspicions about as in your sentence.Your sentence is correct if you are using as in its role as a preposition to explain when you survived. The wings beat faster as the bird flew. The taste became sour as the milk spoiled.As can also be a conjunction however linking independent clauses. And I suspect thats the case in your sentence. In those cases as means something like since or because and should be preceded by a comma. I bought the Ford as I detest foreign cars. He spoke no more as he had said all he had to say.If as I suspect you mean to suggest that you and Rehaba survived because you were abroad then your sentence needs yet another comma I along with my younger sister Rehaba survived as we were abroad.That makes your sentence correct but not beautiful. Your best solution is probably to rewrite it in a clearer way.,grammar,dfy23oq,3,t5_2qhwy

But splices are certainly looking common in unedited text which is more and more of what people read. Comma rules have always been confusing and have changed over time plus a lot of people probably just arent well acquainted with semicolons removing one major alternative.
