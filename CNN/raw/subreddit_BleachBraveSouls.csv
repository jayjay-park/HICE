5034171,0,t1_curfk08,Except Ive been playing BF for quite some time. I have multiple accounts for the game all active both on the global server and the Japanese server. Sure theyll be outdated by newer ones eventually but even old units have become meta again thanks to reworked mechanics and the fact that old units are getting new Evolutions as well as new units. Powercreep is the nature of a FP game as new content comes  you need it to get harder or throw in new mechanics and to combat those new mechanics  you have old units that become useful again and new units that suit a niche. And yeah no. While Vortex units in Brave Frontier are equivalent to  star theyre farmable. Trials give free units that are equivalent to  star units on bleach and not your watered down Renji but your souped up Aizen. Its not like BBS wont have powercreep it happens in every game. BF has been around two years BBS has been around for a few months. Itll happen given time. However the fact that you cannot evolve units in bleach whereas you can in BF means that if you get mainly  star units and  star units with no  star units? Then youre out of luck.Oh and by the way?

Zangetsu has higher stats compared to Toushiro and I predict global will get his red type lower stat coop drop version of him eventually. Tessai while good has really slow firing speed on par with Retsus and NY Orihime I think compared to NY Byakuya. Otherwise he has some good knockback moves.,BleachBraveSouls,czjq63w,1,t5_399jv

I wouldnt recommend having more than  ranged characters in your team unless thats the only way you can play just because of their slightly low defense stats. If you want to do a gacha Id come back for a reappraisal after you get a lucky pull. If you want to get a PVP coin character Id recommend Zangetsu first and foremost!

Among those quests along with finding a random CoOp room which does not cost a ticket since you arent the host you will more than likely already have killed  enemies by that point. That will give you  chances to get at least  Brave Battle wins resulting in  new soul tickets which would be  in a week.

6693336,0,t1_d0b1xou,D  Its really subjective tbh on NY Byakuya vs Byakuya I would go with your most comfortable one.  I would say Rukia has a slightly higher value to me personally as her team buff is helpful her normal combo and special casts paralysis and she is a limited edition character. Her HPdef might be low and I did hear that casting her team buff can be a potential opening for hits but I think her strong points really outshine Kenpachi.  Kenpachi is powerful and fairly large range for a melee but his hits are slow and his special is too dependent on his survival to use adequately as it is just a selfboost. I dont find as high value as he doesnt have a stat inducer and his lack of speed really make it rough for him to fight against even NY Byakuya without taking some hits.,BleachBraveSouls,d0bne30,1,t5_399jv

When the Espada gacha came out with the x rates I didnt get any of the new characters but I did pull Bichigo and Wichigo both I was really hyped for. I thought it was a perfect chance to play a second account in hope to get one of the new characters so I could play it when my main was out of tickets. I dont exactly have the fastest internet so it took a long time to redownload the game each time. I tried to use bluestacks to avoid it but it wasnt working for me so I thought Id give myself a better chance by rerolling on both my phone and my tablet.

7130871,0,t3_4d8lse,The best way is to pick one solid  star and focus all your ascension efforts into it. In my personal opinion literally any drops you get from story mode should be spent into the  star as you can always farm for them later. Yes this isnt efficient in the log run but it sucks really badly not to have one powerful character to carry your team and earn you a spot in coop So you want to have a stockpile of orbs before you finish story? I dont quite understand what you mean by that since story mode provides so many orbs all by itself and I dont get why you want to do that since the best way to ascend your five star unit is to get farther into the story. The best spots to pick up fodder are deep into the story like  and  on hard mode at that. Basically my advice is to make a team of yoruichi urahara Shinji which is likely your best team at the moment Jack up your favorite character yoruichi is your best but shell struggle on red stages level the neglected five stars to lv and start your pvp career since you can easily get into captain league with those five stars at lv,BleachBraveSouls,d1op813,2,t5_399jv

Until then keep using all the boosts you can and try to fight the weakest teams possible so you can at least win. No point in going for x teams if you cant beat them.

Then the next few just AFKd the whole game. Still better than a Renji IMO.Funny story just did a CoOp with a Renji who used his Special on a group of like  of the little hollow minions and then AFKd the rest of the game. Im hoping it was due to embarrassment but either way it was a text book Renji move.,BleachBraveSouls,d1ufkfu,3,t5_399jv

7274953,0,t1_d253ui5,Wow now that is rare. Usually if you see a Renji near a soul bomb you can kiss that soul bomb good bye lol. The only thing worse than a Renji taking a soul bomb is when someone goes in on their  characters and rush to take soul bombs. When I see that happen I cringe just wanting to know what that person is doing. Of course there are those people who play who just want to ruin the game for others so they purposely go in and do that but for the most part when someone who isnt a boss killer takes the soul bomb theyre either dont know what theyre doing or they just like to see their own ultimate go off no matter how useless it is.,BleachBraveSouls,d2543cs,1,t5_399jv

I dont have him and I do just fine can solo CoOp  rooms have no problems with any story missions and I can win every single PVP match I play each week without him.Hes definately a great character but this question isnt even about that.

Byakuya might be his best bet out of those three for fodder clearing then switching to Szayel for the boss but Ive not had Byakuya so Im not very familiar with how well he plays in stages so Im not too sure about him but as for Aizen and Szayel I have them both and know theyre not all that great at fodder clearing even with appropriate linksaccessories.,BleachBraveSouls,d2cfca7,1,t5_399jv

For your third slot i would say either Orihime or  Tessai which ever you find more success with as they are incredibly similar.Stack normal attack damage on grimmjow. Byakuya or Aizen does best with full dodge so link uryu and any  star dodge links you have use normal attack links if you dont have enough dodge links.  Orihime or Tessai both work best with strong attack links and shintens the positive is that they will be using the exact same accessories so once you max them you can quickly and easily swap between characters to try them both out.,BleachBraveSouls,d2jkul1,1,t5_399jv

7445343,0,t1_d2of82m,the reason why every blue unit is compared to Grimmjow is because Grimmjow is hands down the best one currently. HC Byakuya might be better in Coop or PvE but the honest thing is that ANY blue unit can do ok there since they are player controlled there. The real comparison comes when the unit is outside of your control as to how well they do. Grimmjow is considered to be much better simply because of his attack speed. ,BleachBraveSouls,d2ohkze,1,t5_399jv
7453426,0,t1_d2p8pup,Hi! This is technically the wrong megathread but since you didnt make a new thread and used a megathread I wont complain!Anyway for PVP I would go with. Historical Byakuya Speed  Ive only had him for  days but holy balls am I enjoying him in PVP. I run full Strong Attack damage links  and his rd strong attack nearly one shots red units and he does pretty decently up against neutral units. I havent tried him with Normal Attack links but his attack speed is pretty good so it could probably work I just went with Strong Attack links for more burst. For accessories I run  star gloves and a  star shinten but usually the go to for PVP is  star gloves and a  star cookie. Alternatively you could go for  star cookieglovesshinten for a more balanced set. If youre focusing on Strong Attack links though a shinten will give you more damage than gloves will but gloves also buff your normal attacks so keep that in mind.. OG Byakuya Heart  Link as much Dodge as you can to him failing that Normal Attack links are probably your best bet. Accessories  and  star gloves and a  star cookie. Cookie can be dropped for a shinten if you have enough dodge and arent dropping very low in which case using a shinten would up your strong attacks a bit..  Momo Power  Full Strong Attack links seem to be the go to here. Accessories Id probably run  star shinten and then either a  cookie for survivability or gloves for more damage. ,BleachBraveSouls,d2peoap,1,t5_399jv

7460529,0,t1_d2pvfli,your current team is your best one i would say ururu is good from what i hear if you wanted to use her but i havent seen her enough to say myself. Aizen is fine as is full dodge nothing to change i have heard of people using a shinten instead of a cookie for extra damage since dodge means he doesnt get hit much so doesnt need the extra stamina if you want to try that.HC Byakuya seems like kinda a mixed bag I hear great things for Coop but pvp still seems mixed. As far as CDR links those are only really good in pvp for characters with a base trait of that since it maxes at  which usually allows you do do your st strong attack every  seconds. Try either full strong attack or normal attack links i know uwaethrman is currently experimenting with which is better. His very limited results currently seem to favor strong attack for consistency and normal attack for bigger victory margins but also close wins. NY Byakuya for me works best with normal attack links i have actually never used strong attack links on him since his normal attack chain is just so good it fires fast it hits hard and there is very minimal delay between combos. his strong attacks for me get interrupted more often than i would want to fully invest in with links.Side note about your dodge links though since you said you have an overflow of them maybe think of picking up Karin and using her. That would be another character you can max out on dodge.,BleachBraveSouls,d2q7rv6,1,t5_399jv

7472175,0,t1_d2rj2qx,Its not cheating.  Its trying it again.  Attempting to get the character you want is the gamble is the game.  You win when you get what you want.  If you didnt get what you want in one account youve lost.  Some people have won by chance on their first run on their freely offered orbs some have won by buying additional orbs beyond the ones freely offered and some have won by trying it again if their first account didnt work and then there are those who are anti reroll and accept their fate.  There is nothing cheating about any of these methods of winning.  Cheating would be opening the gacha machine and taking the character you want without paying the required money.  That is also called stealing.  Starting over is especially not cheating because you dont get to keep your old characters or progress.Your definition of cheating is anyone not accepting what chance gave them the first time even though KLabs clearly allows for people to delete accounts and form new ones.  If they didnt they wouldnt allow people to delink from Klabs but they clearly do.,BleachBraveSouls,d2rjiia,2,t5_399jv

He has extended reach melee due to the darkness on the tip of his sword ending his combo in a sword beam. In pvp he has low attack priority so hes basically just decent there. But on PVECoop hes great. Hes a lot of fun and has a level of mastery that most characters dont use flash step followed with well timed pokey attacks which do a lot of damage.

7741222,0,t1_d3lxlus,...how did you make your character icons smaller for the photo? lolNY Byak team can work but you should switch his SAD to full NAD and run that team on special strategy. It should up the survivability of the team and specifically make NY Byak perform better against blue leads. Attribute strategy is pretty terrible to use outside of a full RedBlueGreen setupHC Byak with SAD is a great setup  and should do fine. I have him myself and I love him in pvp. Toshiro at full dodge is better than NY Byak for sure but at partial dodge I am less sure since his attack is a tiny bit low. Toshiro team should likely be attack strat since the characters all have good strong attacks that are likely to connect due to their dodge links. Which team of this three is best? I have no idea lol. Youll have to do real world play testing to see what works best for you. So other than Ny Byak your links sound fine. For items assuming you only have access to farmable items and dont have anything special Ny Byak  gloves cookie Szayel gloves cookie Aizen shinten cookie HC Byak shinten cookie and WD Toshiro gloves cookie,BleachBraveSouls,d3m4cya,1,t5_399jv

Are you saying that it would be fair to just go ahead and give them all the rewards weve gotten up to this point...? Because if not then your whole argument is pointless.The biggest thing is that veteran players did not have this advantage when they started.  We did not get to choose a  star when we started.  I get that it does help a lot of new players but old players should at least be compensated in some way for essentially missing out on a free  star for no other reason than we have already been playing.And no dont tell me that the April reward was our free  star  that was our reward for actually playing in April and being around then  new players should not be compensated for that because they were not playing then.  We are missing out on potentially  orbs and a new  star just because we have already been playing the game.

8192861,0,t3_4obx4s,I just want to share my story on this game.I started playing this game back when it was first released to GLB. At the time I didnt think about rerolling or orbs or anything. Just pulled whenever I had enough orbs to do a Multi. I remember running most of the story with a  Grimm. I dont remember when I finally got my first s but I do know it was a ByakuyaChad and Kenpachi in the same Multi.I thought cool Ill keep playing but the luck ends there. For the next few gacha I pulled nothing. I became really depressed and was on the brink of quitting the game I even stopped for  weeks.But then the DB Gacha was announced  of my favourite characters in  gacha!I told myself alright I have to at least pull  of them. Saved as much orbs as I could during that time and if I dont get anything Im quitting. saved up to  orbs. Gacha came and the first  orbs gave me nothing. Depression started to sink in... I didnt want to pull anymore so I got my girlfriend to pull for me. With only  orbs she pulled me FH Ichigo and SE Ulq with some other s in the Gacha.That gave me the will to keep playing. Next gacha with Stark was announced I told myself Alright this month Ill save as much as I can and see what I get. I wont quit but please at least give me something. Gacha comes out  orbs saved up. Let my girlfriend pull for me again. First  orbs got me every single  in the gacha beside Stark who I only really wanted in the gacha with around  orbs left. I just told her to go for it knowing my chances of getting dupes were extremely high. On the last  orbs.... she actually pulled Stark!So now my account when from this to this within  gachas! Thank you for listening to my story. ,BleachBraveSouls,d51nqp0,1,t5_399jv

Not that hard is only true for people like you and I who have a strong  from every color or a beast like FH Ichigo or SE Ulquiorra.   Beginners will have absolutely zero chance of completing any of the  raids.   Even players with strong character that just dont have a blue or a green or a red wont be able to finish the raids.   You need to put yourself in the shoes of people who dont have the advantages you have.   Ive played all the raids on my new Japanese account and know how hard they are.  I have a  soi fon a parasol Grim and an Academy Izuru.   I cant even come close to doing the  level raids that I dont have an advantage over.   Luckily the soi fon raids are red lol.  When it hits global Ill be able to do them no problem but thats only because I have excellent character.  The people who dont wont even get close to being able to without constantly reviving.  None of your advise works for people who dont have a vortex character AND FH Ichigo.  I understand though  its tough to tell people they just wont be able to do it.  I am predicting new levels of misplaced outrage when people figure out that they just cant level their  because their characters arent good enough.

8559924,0,t3_4x0uyu,.  No status effects do not stack. None of them so if you are frozen you cannot get poisoned burned paralyzed or confused. This is true for any character be it your own your ally or your enemies! Use this as an advantage in the raids and be mindful of it against bosses!.  You can use them just as you would any other but their stats are worse compared to their normal counterparts. This is indicated by the fact that the  stars are coloured silver instead of gold. In case you should ever forget which are raid characters.  To my knowledge keep fusion for  star accessories and up.  stars are good for fodder and gloves  star gloves can be useful if you dont have top tier equipment yet.  To me not really. Ive never pulled accessories with orbs and will most likely never do. Orbs are saved for character gachas and after youve completed the story line are harder to come by. So dont waste them! Save them for the double chance gachas at the start of each month or gachas youre willing to spend orbs on. .  Loading screens are fine to me take less then  seconds to load in but then again I am playing on a OnePlus . Might take a bit longer at the start if the game hasnt collected all data yet?

Id focus on getting orbs for it and pulling hoping for the best. s arent going anywhere and if you pull units better than your current pool of potential s then you saved some resources and time too.As for your team Kenpachi will be getting his  with this upcoming gacha and is a god amongst men.

8781980,0,t1_d73d18k,Those are good points actually. Even the hado  this Aizen has was the one he used while in the butterfly form. And the fact that hes not in the butterfly state sort of makes his SA inconsistent with the plot since hes literally skipping a stage of evolution whenever he does the attack. With that said Im actually a little more disappointed that we didnt get HM Aizen. Because thats easily the outfit hes worn the longest. So its the form hes most recognized in IMO. And with this release I guess we wont be getting HM Aizen ever. Itd be nice if the current  Aizen could at least get his HM outfit with the hogyoku in his chest upon evolving into a .

8824742,0,t1_d78bpwh,Firstly IMO Theres no real benefit of evolving a character to a  WHEN youre not going to fully max out that . I say that because a  wont be as good as a maxed  until that  is at like  soul tree and at lvl . And if you dont get the raid characters youll be stuck at around  soul tree and lvl  on your  which will effectively make your  much worse than its maxed out  version. Also every  gets abilities when you improve its soul tree with raid characters. Without those abilities that  wont be powerful at all. So really do get those raid characters.TDLR for above paragraph either you buckle down and max out your s soul tree and lvl or dont bother because a maxed out  is more powerful than a halfassed .And little information in case you didnt know. When you evolve a maxed  to a  that  starts at lvl  with absolutely garbage stats it will be useless. So the fastest way to bring your  up to decent stats is to have all the required jewels and characters ready before hand. You can find all the required information hereSecondly Ive found the game to be more fun while playing with characters that I personally enjoy and like. I mean why does anyone play a game except to have fun? So imo if you really love Nel as a character then make her into a . Youll be so happy that you did. You can always evolve your other characters to a  later on and its not like Nel is a shitty . No she actually gets great abilities and is pretty good from what i can see. But if you dont care about that and only wanna talk strategy then your best option to evolve would probably be Soi Fon. Soi Fon is a great character with outstanding stats as a  having the rd highest attack in the game currently. In addition shes a boss killer making her great in PVE. And ive heard great things about her in PVP too. You just cant go wrong with evolving Soi Fon to a .TDLR for above paragraph IMO evolve your favourite character to a  because youll enjoy the game much more if you do. However the best strategic move for you would be to evolve your Soi Fon to a  as she is a beast.BTW You can still hold your own in Coop with your maxed out Nanao. Shes still legendary in Coop.,BleachBraveSouls,d78m1k1,1,t5_399jv

8997365,0,t3_53igpd,. Normal attack damage is best for her but use whatever you got thats best. Whoops!  Now its just patience. If you cant do the raids that drop the jewels you need the dailies are the only other source. Each color type happens once per week. I hope we get all the dailies opened again this weekend but thats only when klab is feeling generous. . Personally I think the drop rates for the four star raids is worse than the five star raids. Getting  Rangikus is going to probably take forty runs. Good luck!  Your second question about  star drop rates they dont drop. Only available thru item gacha tickets dont spend orbs! or by fusing two maxed two star items. Finally general team questions megathread is better place for these types of questions. ,BleachBraveSouls,d7tce0z,1,t5_399jv

I have a  star blue headband but it has focus  on it. star gloves cookies and shintens dont really cut it anymore if youre using  star characters so im stuck running my best characters with chappies for now. Im working on getting  star headbands hojikuzai and the like and maxing my  stars.but as i said i dont play the game manually very much so it will be a while.,BleachBraveSouls,d87gvdu,1,t5_399jv

9181977,0,t1_d8fu88m,gt Special is pretty meh for both PvE and PvP. Its just weakening the foe and dealing pretty low damage compared to Ichigo. Youre using the special wrong. If you have a heavy hitter like kendo ken on the team use Barragan switch to Kendo and absolutely destroy the target. Makes raids even more easy for me. In PVP once it activates its game over for the other team as every hit they do will cause  damage for the next few seconds which is a long time in PVP. Barragans special is way more useful.gtVortex means absolutely nothing on PvP. Nothing. PvE yeah. its good like all vortex attacks and has pretty good cooldown too.Yeah vortex doesnt do much in PVP but its probably the most important strong attack in PVE so I thought it was worth mentioning.gt Its a good unit but definitely not in the same league as FGT Ichigo hes just good on every aspect. Even his Melee Attacks get pretty long as a .Youre right lol hes not on the same league as FGT Ichigo. Hes a league above him. Littleemp said it bestgtHail to the King baby.

9219373,0,t3_56lyly,I dont know if there is a guide but my advise would be Priotities.You sure can go doing all events raids story quest farming and so on but really wouldnt all be faster with better units?So yeah if you are a new player just focus on  Pulling a nice team Farm orbs on events on story and on daily rewards play pvp and win  to get more tickets tickets  orbs and saving them until the end of the month so you can pull on a X gacha and hope for a top tier unit. Maxing that nice team you just pulled Once you pulled that good unit focus on maxing it so you can play every quest without a problem quests  orbsunits raids for example units  orbsgood units farm crystals and  star characters so you can augment it and level the unit up. Repeat step one to pull a secondthird good unit Repeat step two to level up that secondthird unit Now that you got at least two good maxed units and you can play pretty much every questraid of the game you can do whatever you want. Play events farm even more orbs for more characters and so on. But yeah priorities.How do I know when I pulled something great? Since stats are too tedious just go all RKB. Reddit Knows Best. But just inb not all  stars are good. Sure they are better than  stars but not all of them can finish a quest as easily as others so just focus on leveling up GOOD units since time is gold.Good Luck.,BleachBraveSouls,d8kmfu9,2,t5_399jv

Also DR link complements chappies so well its ridiculous since the longer the battle drags on the more advantageous it will be for the NAD build. In my scenarios I put dodge links mostly as they are more available.Heres how Jushiro can compete with chappies build without them. On one hand we have chappy build  attack  SP  Stam  dodge the other non chappy build  attack  SP  stam  dodge. Win rates should be very close.

We know this is not true and only causes heart break and disappointment and anger.PLEASE stop stating something as fact or like this where you dont necessarily state it as fact but like it would be weird when we have NO IDEA what is going to happen.

But for certain frames after being frozen you still are no longer able to movedodge nor are you under protection from status ailments.Which is simply an error in game design so yes if you get hit once it is your responsibility but if you get chain frozen it is the games fault and is more than often game over for that character.,BleachBraveSouls,dacbkkg,4,t5_399jv

10038371,0,t1_dbg0hre,having specials like aizen and ichigos be powerful is a welcome change to the meta it allows people to build SP with survivability so they can just wait out for soul bombs. The trade off is that they cant run chappies which is a fair trade imo. Freeze effects are most certainly more overpowered but this post wasnt just about shinji it was about all status ailments. On the otherhand while barragan is broken as hell as well his status effect at least still allows your team to grab the soul bomb before the enemy does. Confuse and freeze dont even give you the option to defense yourself. You used to be able to wait out the status effect and see if your team can pull through.

Suddenly calling it a joke sounds like youd be trying to say everyone whos ever said it was joking as well. The easiest way to be correct when referring to that form is FH Ichigo another term that even came about before Brave Souls. With the Halloween special it just hardly matters because the entire episode was a joke. Hell in that special Orihime wasnt even dressed as anything she was actually part pumpkin or... gourd? idunno really.

10523230,0,t3_5qmfcn,Okay so in turn Never EVER pull from the Premium Summons yes they contain near enough every  star in the game and the rates are no different from any other Gacha with a couple of exceptions. However because the pool is so large its hard to pull anything of note. In your shoes save as many orbs as you can and wait for any one of the following End of Month double Gachas. They have a  rate for  stars and the characters in the upcoming Gacha am UK time Tuesday if my maths is right are from the Fullbring arc and expected to be very powerful. StepUps. These are rare I believe theyve only been seen twice since the games inception. However we might get one in the summer and they are truly special. A Gacha with a character you really want. For example I pulled on the current Gacha and was lucky enough to get both TT Shunsui and Kendopachi humblebragYou are right in that characters are rotated. Capn Miz runs a very good site  which shows all the current JPN Gachas. You can use it to plan as Global generally is a month behind JPN The  Soul Tickets are part of a  Million Download celebration set to end on st January. Otherwise you get  Soul Tickets as a Daily reward on some days and they regenerate at one per  minutes once you fall below . Never claim any free soul tickets unless you have  as a minimum otherwise you arent using them at max efficiency. Might be worth seeing what Kon looks like when he gets his  star but generally any character that KLab gives out for free is not going to be anywhere near as good as the paid characters i.e. from Gachas or even tickets you should be lucky enough,BleachBraveSouls,dd0x72j,4,t5_399jv

I always wanted a good bleach game but with region limitations I couldnt get anything for my ps. Also I couldnt find the ps game in my country when it came out. The best I got were some really good M.U.G.E.N. characters as I was pretty known on some mugensprites sites and people often shared cool characters  Almost one year ago I was roaming through play shop and noticed something bleach related. I thought wow great another quiz or shit fan made game. I usually dont even open these to see whats inside. But I decided to check as the icon had pretty good graphics. The screenshots and gameplay I saw inside took my breath away. Downloaded it immediately. And here I am almost one year. I had almost a month of break though when I havent pulled Dangai Ichigo and only got Haizen from that gacha where I spend almost k orbs. But then I saw that he was pretty good despite his trait and I came back to the game  And today is one of best days in bbs for me  Gotta grind these Nnoitoras! ,BleachBraveSouls,dd29p8f,2,t5_399jv

For a NAD team Id suggest RGB with Dangai Barry and Yoru while for a SADStatus team Id go something like DangaiHali SE TT RukiaShinji. If you want to use a mind unit double chappy would work best on Izuru but any of them would be solid. Ive honestly never played with or seen much gameplay on the parasol characters besides nanao ofc so I dont know what to recommend there.

11093429,0,t3_5ybqje,I own Shunsui  two hearts and a tech all of which are  .  With a longlasting vortex SA multihit SA and SA for guardbreak and amazingly fast and hard normal attacks hes outlandishly fun to play!  His ideal build is double chappies plus more attack or stamina and either NAD andor DR maybe healing if you have some lag dont bother with a hybrid build.  Why do I have two heart versions  ?  For the  NAD links.I do not recommend him in PvP for any League above rd or th Seat.  He cannot get an attribute advantage and there are a LOT of Captain Killers.  Given the current meta the lack of a status infliction heal or buff makes him unfortunately completely outclassed at highlevel PvP  I havent seen one in Captains for weeks and back when I did he was always an easy win.  If youre running a NAD team at th Seat or below you should be OK with him though.No one is faster at clearing Mind PvE content!  Nothing stops him  but you have to play manually use your Strongs wisely and dodge.  Build with chappies of course and maximize his NAD.  Be sure to bring along a boss killer though  preferably freezeparalyze as even  seconds of immobility will spell the end for the boss once you switch back to Shunsui.  This applies to Boss Rushes in particular hint hint.I do not recommend him for coop... too much lag which makes focusing on SAs far wiser.  Maybe for Fusion trials and other lowerlevel content but definitely not harder Raids.  If you do use him give him a healing link.  And a Hojiku.,BleachBraveSouls,depfhvs,2,t5_399jv

Just keep working at it and things will turn around for you. This game takes time to get the great stuff. Just pick up any and all orbs you can get. Save them for the chars you like or want the most. Really though most people would love to have red kenny and dangai still even with all these new chars coming out. You have two very solid chars to start out with. Kenny sucks as a five star but is awesome as a six star. Dangai is great maxed as either five or six star. Obviously shines more as a six star though.,BleachBraveSouls,dfpqqe4,1,t5_399jv

I really dont have any real advice which u wouldnt can come up ur self with so I will just say dont take this addiction so seriously there are worse things in the world if you really wanna spend more time with your kids just do it. Theres no need to put urself under some extreme rules. Its all about ur priorities. I was in the same situation neglected my responsibilities for some fcking tickets but some day I realized how stupid that was. So I set myself some rules. Nothing extreme like you though. I dont play at work when Im with friends or while drivinglong distances. I only play when Im at home alone and finished my duties. Not sure if this will help you just felt like replying to ur problem. Btw not to make you look bad but personally i would have liked to spend more time as a child with my father and honestly I would be pretty pissed if he preferred a game over his child.

11472251,0,t1_dfwane0,Well well well who do we have here??? Lol thanks for checking out the game. Here is a quick little list of things I wouldnt do if I was a noob again. never ever spend orbs on premium summons. Trust me on that one. dont spend orbs on accessory summons dont use orbs to upgrade character skill trees only revive in a coop room if you get multiple drops of a raid character. wait until you have a few good maxed out  stars before ascending anyone to a  star. do your best to farm the necessary raid requirements for a character before ascending them to six star status always lock your charactersThese next few are just kinda FYIs you get spirit orbs in game currency equivalent to ninja pearls from doing missions events and getting characters to their max level. Each character can only be done one time but there are different attribute colors of the same character and they count as different characters. Example there is a power attribute red and heart attribute purple  star Ichigo. You can max each one for  orbs a piece. You get various amounts of spirit orbs for maxing different ratites of characters. star  orbs star  orbs star  orbs star  orbs  star  orbs star    orbs Each character has a special move that can be leveled up. The only way to level it up is by feeding the character an exact dupe. So if I have a speed attribute blue Nel I would have to feed another speed Nel to increase her special level. A Mind attribute orange Nel would not work. speaking of FYI there is an awesome site that you should check out bravesouls.fyi  it is run by rCapnMZ . The website has loads more info to check out and it is always updated with new character stats.Well I know I said this would be short but I wanted to make sure you get off to the best start possible. Thanks again for checking out the game and the community. May Mayuri Sama bless you. Mayuri is our equivalent to the baki and konohomaru memesPs its alright that you dont really follow bleach. The game tells the story well enough. I would recommend checking out the anime or manga tho. I found it very enjoyable. ,BleachBraveSouls,dfwdhld,6,t5_399jv

This only applies to   and  items you ascend    items you ascend will stay the same but you will need special items called powders and books that you can only find in special Coop missions and point events. So dont worry about  star accesories for now just focus on getting  and  items the most useful are Shintens Gloves and Cookies for your characters. ,BleachBraveSouls,dfzug07,2,t5_399jv

You cant expect to go to bed  hours before it ends at rank  and be safe. Next thing you know youll wake up only to realize you now at rank  or so a few minutes before it ends. It all changes but I would stay at least do your daily  then do them like a hour or  before it ends just in case,BleachBraveSouls,dgd86mf,6,t5_399jv

11648659,0,t1_dggdbc9,Try playing some of the single player raids to get a feel for dodging. A really good tip is that you are invincible when doing your strong attacks. So while the strong attack animation in playing you cant be hit. Do note that if you are hit right before it can cancel your SAstrong attack as well as your special. If you have a boss killer effect with your special like fire poison and other dot damage over time or debuff let it run out before doing your special again. You will just reset the clock not add to it. In coop look at everyones items when you get in. If they have a Tenshintai let them get the soul bomb special. Unless they have a chappy then f them.  is the place to get info on pretty much everything in game. If you have any questions ask away!,BleachBraveSouls,dgge192,2,t5_399jv
11653677,0,t1_dggxrb0,Losing your focus compared to your SP still isnt comparable imo. I kind of agree and I kind of disagree. Thing is you lose your SP sure but you get  a much bigger boost   on all the other stats. Considering Attack factors in SA damage and that you have  boosted focus your SAs will still hit quite a bit. Obviously your SP is zero so dont expect anything insane but considering you might be able to pull k on each NAD hit lets just say its pretty fair.  Plus its becoming less and less rare that people put chappies even on characters that have Frenzy. So whatever lesser damage your SAs do its doubled. Well in their cases.  Finally youre gonna have one hell of a defense as well. Like Im pretty sure this guy gt  can still dome decent SA damage between Frenzy and his . mag on each strongs plus inner  SAD damage except hes also going to hit amazingly well with NADs because he has almost  Atk.  Plus I believe you can get a very similar built to this without losing your focus if you wanna do crits ,BleachBraveSouls,dggyixq,2,t5_399jv

We are getting tons of opportunities for more orbs right before FB Ichigo is released on global. I for one dont mind a delay in the accessories coming to global. Just more time to prepare accessory summon tickets and accessories to fuse when it does come.

11747457,0,t1_dgr3zly,FB ichigo Byak is pretty strong. Id suggest using him with full NAD. Use his skills to guard break use a bomb to clear  waves. You should pick waves that take the longest to clear or ones you have trouble with. Usually for speed runs youd bomb the room that has a wave of shadow mob gt next waves dont.This would be the best time to bomb since bombs can hit existing shadow mobs but if they spawn in the next wave they are unaffected. This should cut  seconds off your time.At the boss a single bomb and a NAD kenpachi should be enough.,BleachBraveSouls,dgrlqt1,1,t5_399jv
11749739,0,t1_dgruuj2,Not only most hyped but after we got Mugetsu Baragan and Aizen then we got the Kisuke with Shinji and Kensei you would think Tosen Yoruichi and Wonderweisss would be next. Then we got Tenza as a boss in the story mode. Where are they?TBH i think that would be as hype as ppl are about getting a new Grimmjaw and Nnoit. However i do think ur idea holds merit.
