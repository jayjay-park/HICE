1049874,0,t1_chnbccb,But those things are only bad because we set literature on this pedestal that discourages people from treating them seriously. People demand garbage on TV because we bully them into revering a bunch of oldidiom bullshit like Moby Dick thats hard for anybody to understand and theyre intimidated and exhausted by it. I mean also sometimes because theyre bad people but I think mostly the former.Also there are plenty of great thoughtful movies that have come out recently.,badliterarystudies,chnmixz,3,t5_2zas9

2289828,0,t1_clum2gt,Heres the thing. You said an unwritten book is a really bad book.Is it in the same genre? Yes. No ones arguing that.As someone who is a literatician who studies literariness I am telling you specifically in Literature no one calls unwritten books bad books. If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying unwritten book youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Unwritteneous which includes things from romance novels to science fiction to David Foster Wallaces.So your reasoning for calling an unwritten book a bad book is because random people call the unwritten ones unliterary? Lets get Kurt Vonnegut and Ernest Hemingways unwritten works in there then too.Also calling something an unwritten book or a bad book? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. An unwritten book is an unwritten book and a member of the pleb family. But thats not what you said. You said an unwritten book is a bad book which is not true unless youre okay with calling all books that have never been written bad books which means youd call Ursula Le Guins next book a novel idea Cormac McCarthy forgot about and other other literary authors plot outlines bad books too. Which you said you dont.Its okay to just admit youre wrong you know?,badliterarystudies,cluqm59,19,t5_2zas9

6035793,0,t1_cya7eg7,gt  Almost all American folk heroes fictional or real are virtuous poor.Americas folk heroes may be poor however they have obvious and exhaled economic value Paul Bunyan is a lumber jack Johnny Apple seed is a horticulturalist etc. Our folk stories dont tell us of their struggles to put food on their table they tell us about their success generally professional or ethical this compartmentalization is what Vonneguts character is talking about in this passage IIRC.The struggles of our folk stories and their heroes focus on idealizing puritan work ethic not about the realities of their economic situation. John Henry is a hero because he died to show his bosses the human spirit cannot be replaced by a machine its a vindication of manual laborers from the first industrial revolution.  However his bosses at the end of the day did not care his economic purpose was fulfilled. We as Americans dont tell this as a tale of caution of capitalism and oppression of poor we tell it as a glorification of being a hard working person.  Poverty isnt really even front and center in most of these stories. You pretty much realize based on profession and disposition that these people arent raking it in but the stories do not make that obvious.We as a culture love the idea of heroism and skill and the reward of wealth born from struggle but we ignore or condemn the financial realities of that struggle as the responsibility and failure of those experiencing them.This whole passage really just smacks of The Soul of a Man Under Socialism anyway.,badliterarystudies,cyat1ww,11,t5_2zas9
