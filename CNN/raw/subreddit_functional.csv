However Python have some immutable data structures that are the tuples and named tuples a immutable dictionary.Here a demonstration.Tuple    gtgtgt tpl           gtgtgt tpl             gtgtgt You cannot change a tuple.     gtgtgt tpl      Traceback most recent call last      File ltstdingt line  in ltmodulegt    TypeError tuple object does not support item assignment    gtgtgt         gtgtgt            gtgtgt         gtgtgt cons  lambda hd tl hd  tl    gtgtgt     gtgtgt         gtgtgt nil      gtgtgt nil        gtgtgt cons cons nil         gtgtgt     gtgtgt cons cons cons nil          gtgtgtRegarding the tail call optimization many recursive functions can be replaced by reduce fold left. Only few languages have it like Common Lisp Scala Racket F Ocaml and Scheme. Clojure for example doesnt have tail call optimization.Map in Python returns a map object which is used for lazy evaluation and can be turned into a tuple list or generator.         gtgtgt     gtgtgt maplambda x x            ltmap object at xbdccgt    gtgtgt     gtgtgt listmaplambda x x                     gtgtgt     gtgtgt tuplemaplambda x x                     gtgtgt Functional code sometimes can be slower than imperative code. In Haskell it is faster because the GHC compiler does a lot of optimizations. ,functional,czfm6ji,1,t5_2qh5o
