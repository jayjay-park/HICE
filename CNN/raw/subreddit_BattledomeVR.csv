8038802,0,t3_4p97b1,Good feedback there. I agree with everything you said. Simple is good. Just improve the visual effects.,BattledomeVR,d4jmxhm,2,t5_3f2xr
8044408,0,t3_4peduz,great trying this now.  No one online so hopefully some feed back soon.,BattledomeVR,d4k9na7,1,t5_3f2xr
8051949,0,t1_d4l19ys,the front controller doesnt sit that tight you can attach and detach as you like..i do the same thing but after a while when it gets exhausting its nice to have both stabilized..also helps with the teleporter aim,BattledomeVR,d4l44yf,2,t5_3f2xr
8056271,0,t1_d4jt2hf,I would see VIVE borders and even woke up twice thinking I was in VR. Weird first few weeks adjusting to VR.,BattledomeVR,d4lln1k,2,t5_3f2xr
8062707,0,t1_d4l5rp2,Hate speech is free speech deal with it Ask for a mute all option not a ban option,BattledomeVR,d4mbo93,1,t5_3f2xr
8067247,0,t1_d4mbo93,Agreed. SJW whining for ban power is far scarier than some wanker spewing racist slurs. ,BattledomeVR,d4mu2c2,1,t5_3f2xr
8101297,0,t1_d4psvcn,Id be concerned this would lead to people head tilt dodging. Like some kind of freaky whiplash inducing VR version of bunny hopping. ,BattledomeVR,d4qnq7m,1,t5_3f2xr
8216244,0,t1_d54fdsn,Ive been in games where the ramps are all painted by other team and they have our core at  and we came back. Its definitely possible just requires a team that knows how to do things like paint from below the ramp and when to take assault weapons.,BattledomeVR,d54l38d,1,t5_3f2xr
8262600,0,t3_4sl6iw,you could just build a simple gun like controllerholder,BattledomeVR,d5adsgl,3,t5_3f2xr
