6380499,0,t1_czdzhc3,There isnt but notice that we are small and sorta inactive. Couple this with reddit fuzzing the scores and you got  possibly  downvotes total on your submission. I wouldnt call that hate.,cyphersystem,czew7nb,2,t5_38h17
7069609,0,t3_4cdyoc,Cypher System is a game where mechanical advantage usually takes a back seat so try not to get too hung up on that stuff. ,cyphersystem,d1hpbg0,2,t5_38h17

9197250,0,t1_d8hbshq,Id recommend sticking with Warrior to get basic proficiencytrainingspecialization with heavy ranged weapons and use your Focus to round out your character. Crafts Unique Objects is good if you want to be making the weapons yourself while Never Says Die or Fuses Flesh with Steel would be appropriate for a very physical character.Agree with Noir more details would help and it is easy to bend the system to suit your character.,cyphersystem,d8hthqf,2,t5_38h17
9775886,0,t1_dahwz2l,I agree the GM intrusion is one of my favourite aspects of the cypher system. Its also a mechanic that I think gets curiously overlooked in most discussions of the system.My experience sounds somewhat similar to yours in that my players almost never turn down a GM intrusion and frequently suggest possible intrusions themselves. I implemented the house rule to give them a little more authority over the scene and the fate of their characters. ,cyphersystem,dai3e30,1,t5_38h17
10186936,0,t3_5l1ne3,Ive only run a single session thus far schedules.... The great thing about the Cypher System is it is simple to just roll with things. You dont need to do a huge amount of prep.,cyphersystem,dbyqui0,1,t5_38h17
10478379,0,t1_dcvti5z,Lamentations of the Flame Princess is a DampD retroclone aimed to have bizarre gore and macabre adventures. A red and Pleasant Land is a setting based on Alice  with vampires battling in an impossible landscape. These vampires structure are based on cards  or chess games.There is a lot of macabre terror weirdness  and a lot of items with labels ... me that fits perfectly with cyphers idea.In last year Ennies  this suplement was awarded with  gold ennies and  silver so its a jewel!,cyphersystem,dcvtzji,2,t5_38h17
11248932,0,t1_ddsuvmx,I think an Honorable Warrior who Defends the Weak would be quite close. Maybe add some power shifts in strength and speed to give him the peek human physique feel. ,cyphersystem,df71t36,2,t5_38h17
