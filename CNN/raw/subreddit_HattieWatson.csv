7276377,0,t1_d2584hb,Ive spent many years collecting them and when needed have paid money for access to some. And on some nights when my completionist mentality is in overdrive spend many hours searching and saving. It seems wrong to just give all that away to people who just frequents a subreddit. Also giving some of them away would take money away that should go to Hattie or other artists.Plus if I did post them then this sub would be over. She is hardly in front of the camera anymore as she is working a job and spending all her time behind the camera. I hardly see any new shots of her these days and practically have all the public shots ever taken. So when a new shot gets posted or I happen to find one I dont have it gets posted but those are far and few between. ,HattieWatson,d259x79,1,t5_2sjv5
