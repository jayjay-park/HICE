254695,0,t1_cf757ho,haha bro of course you need a different instance of X for each tablet. You think that restaurant owners want digital glorified menus that show the same thing on each tablet? They want to let people order on the tablets play games pay etc. thats your entire value add. as soon as something on the display changes in a way different from every other display like the customer indicates on the screen that he wants a Coke you need a new X instance. Also pretty sure even an i Haswell cant manage  X instances with resolutions even as low as x let alone encrypting them. Theres a far cry of a difference between a cashier waiting ms for an item to barcode scan on a cash register and managing one or two touch screens for restaurants is negligible. But a customer using a software keyboard to enter his credit card number with that kind of lag? Again enjoy the requests for refunds. ,linux_devices,cf75k2o,2,t5_2rfd8

733738,0,t1_cgmwxh3,I guess my definition of industrial use doesnt jive with what many think if when it comes to the phrase.   Throwing a module like this into a router to me is commercial use.   The two uses are different mentalities really.  ,linux_devices,cgnohlu,1,t5_2rfd8
1076014,0,t1_chqd7wf,The Raspberry Pi requires a massive closed source binary to even boot it costs more and you cant build a standard distro for it without major modifications which is why you dont see standard Debian on it.Comparatively WRTnode requires no binaries actively supports OpenWRT development and has similiar specs when compared to the Raspberry Pi while being cheaper amp completely open.,linux_devices,chqlh8c,0,t5_2rfd8

4552146,0,t1_ct4dr2t,Well you can use almost any distro. You are limited to the kernel given by HardKernel the company that manufactures the board. You can use whatever distro you want as long as its compatible with the kernel systemd has strictish kernel version requirements for instance.Another downside is that the graphics chip is totally closed and binaryonly which means big headaches if you use it as media center. I am using xbmckodi  and gstreamer . and have no hope of ever updgrading them since they are deeply tied to the kernelside drivers. This means of course a lot of rd party binaryonly software on the system which is not as trustworthy as the packages provided by the distro.For a smooth linux experience nowadays intel is the only one who provides opensource almost everything except some driver firmwares. For intelbased boardsized computers the minnowboard is the best one at the moment.,linux_devices,ct4f5fn,6,t5_2rfd8

5251985,0,t1_cvj1qv2,Personally I value support more. There are plenty of china devices that are cheaper if you just look at the hardware but support is nonexistent. Im talking software support from drivers to size of software repository. Thats why rasppi still has buyers despite inferior hardware. Avoid lenovo though they have a bad rep these days.,linux_devices,cvj1wz6,3,t5_2rfd8
5301814,0,t3_3nkpsn,Something with x definitely.  Getting nonAndroid Linux running on an Android tablet is possible but it is quite a task and requires a lot of work.  Even then a lot of ARM hardware lacks drivers.  I have a Winbook TW tablet Baytrail .GHz Intel GPU GB RAM x and it can run Debian mostly unmodified.  The screen just started working with .rc so any old kernels are iffy for baytrail at best due to poor DSI display support.  I still cant rotate the screen either.  The touchscreen works and I have WiFi sorta working via an out of tree driver it crashes the MMC controller after a bit though.  USB works great.  Battery level is not working so it always says .  The tablet cost  open box at Micro Center and overall was worth it.  Compared to my HP TouchPad its a lot better for Linux.Edit  Just saw Europe as a requirement so no Micro Center.  There are similar baytrail tablets sold out of China on eBayAliExpressetc. that should be pretty comparable and available worldwide.,linux_devices,cvpd9q9,2,t5_2rfd8
