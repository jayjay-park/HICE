2542187,0,t1_cmqdwmv,Thank you for replying. There is a group in my area and they actually meet really close to my house! I will get back into exercise Ive had a chest cold for like a month and I will be experimenting with my diet trying to find additional triggers. I meditate. I want to be proactive and address the disease. Im not against medicine but I was surprised he immediately put me on the blood pressure medication. Im not sure if that is a good idea long term. He also seemed to dismiss looking for dietary triggers. I have an appointment with my GP on Friday shes an MD but is very holistic in her approach will be interested to see what she says about all of this.I always thought I was just a low energy person.,Sjogrens,cmqefwq,2,t5_2vb6t
2807186,0,t3_2s046i,I used to get them until September. Thats when my eyes started producing almost nothing and my saliva became foamy but mostly like the consistency of rubber cement. Evoxac helps the saliva but Restasis hasnt helped the tears.,Sjogrens,cnn62ps,1,t5_2vb6t

I would check for tonsil stonesthey often give me a sore throat and you can just rinse them out with salt water. Some great active groups on facebook sjogrens syndrome foundation and sjogrens alternative therapy group.,Sjogrens,cs1agif,4,t5_2vb6t

8552236,0,t3_4u9s28,Is ear pain part of Sjogrens? I am newly diagnosed and still trying to understand it. I have had ear pain that feels like an ear infection for months. I even went to an ENT because I didnt believe my primary care doc that my ear wasnt infected. The ENT said my ear was fine too and that maybe the pain was due to TMJ. Now I wonder if it could have something to do with Sjogrens. My hearing is also affected sometimes.,Sjogrens,d6alpj7,1,t5_2vb6t
