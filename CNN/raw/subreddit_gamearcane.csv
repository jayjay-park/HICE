4522370,0,t3_3d0m97,This game looks like an interesting introspective metaadventure game. Created by the minds behind Bioshock Infinite and Thief. It seems to be an archeological exploration of an abandoned game. It reminds me of Antechamber Hack n Slash and Anodyne.,gamearcane,ct0oock,1,t5_36it9
10422697,0,t3_5p303e,Great topic Ive definitely experienced games after stopping the game itself. One I remember distinctly was one of the GBA Castlevania games. That was temporary like of like my life replaying itself.On the other hand something like tetris I dont see the game per say but see the world produce events that imitate the game or perhaps the game is a filter to view the world. Like spatial awareness training. Ive noticed gamelike patterns or at least meta rules or even... shortcuts with simple things like cars. The cars follow patterns rules have operators knowing how the rules and patterns work allow you to make decisions when driving and even when not driving. Recognizing patterns.,gamearcane,dcphcya,2,t5_36it9
