I used to go and watch the end of practice then wait for the guys to change and get to see just about the entire team on their way out. There was never more than a handful of people there so the guys were always willing to chat for a second and sign an autograph. Sadly those days are no more. However I bet that if you can find out the day and time they are practicing at IceWorks you could go at the end of practice and either hang out around the rinks or in the parking lot and catch them on their way out but I doubt youd be allowed to watch the actual practice. ,NewYorkIslanders,cmjb1lx,3,t5_2rpn6

Its better they stay New York rather than move elsewhere. Thankfully they found a place that will take them in and keep them at least near their home. Would rather see the islanders stay the islanders rather than become a team out of state. A two hour move beats the hell out of moving multiple States away.

3661352,0,t3_32aj7b,After they scored and Cappy put the th line and strait on I knew they were scoring again. Why has this amateur coach been given the opportunity to be the brain in this organization it seems hes lacking one of his own.Capitals in . Sorry I have no faith in this team.  wins in a month and a half with playoffs closing in and home ice within grasp. Countless blown leads with defensive mishaps and failed clears or weak goals. They play with zero urgency occasionally for minutes on end they just stop skating and continue to lose puck battles and races to loose pucks in their own end. When Howie and Butch talk about the teams mental fortitude I wonder that maybe they are a little too secure with not playing their best and not winning all the time. And just in case you were wondering about the blown leads the caps are in fact the best team in the NHL at over coming  goal leads. Our special teams are not going to be good enough to give us the advantage over the caps. No Hamonic for game  so that means Strait will be guarding Ovechkin on the PK second unit. Fucking great.The only way I see us winning is if Halak plays unbelievably well and holtby shits the bed. If they return to the islanders we saw in November December and early January we could beat anyone.I hope Im wrong with my prediction but if Im not hopefully it means the end of this whole coaching staffs tenure. I seriously think this team would be a cup contender if we had Trotz or AV or any coach that really has a clue and has had playoff success.The good news isthis isnt the end for the islanders. We have a very bright future no matter what happens and although I will miss the coliseum the place does not give me that feel of Stanley Cup Winning arena like MSG or other big name modern Venues like Barclays center. Its hard not to believe that this team isnt cursed and I think moving well help them shake off the losing culture. Nothing goes right for this team ever we all know it. JT and Jamie Benn know it. Goodbye Coliseum Im going to miss your atmosphere and your Sounds sight lines all of it. Doing the Yes Chant was kind of unreal. I know Brooklyn will never match that intensity and that makes me upset.,NewYorkIslanders,cq9mb52,0,t5_2rpn6

6611985,0,t3_46907z,I dont know what section you were siting in but the people in  have organized a fan club so to speak where they stand up and chear the entire game. They started doing the Yes! Chants from WWE late in the  season. It didnt really catch on to the entire stadium until last year the last season at the Coliseum. It had some controversy but it only made more people participate. Now nearly the entire stadium does it. One of the problems with Barclays is that resellers own a significant amount of the season tickets and sell them on the black market. Many STH are upset that they sit next to different people each game instead of the same people each game. The rivalry aspect isnt as big in America compared to England simply because of the size. The only real rivalries when things get nasty are against the Penguins Capitals and of course the Rangers. Someone allegedly keyed a Caps fans car last year during the playoffs and Ranger Isles games always have fights.

11723927,0,t3_67alzb,depending on his role this is not as terrible as many are making it seem.  if hes in the starting  yes i agree this sucks.  but in all likelihood we are going to lose dehaan in the expansion draft and pelechmayfield showed that they arent ready to be in the starting  for an entire season. of the current starting  two of them proved they cant stay healthy for a full season.  we need defensive depth and seidenberg was one of our better defenseman this year. as long as he is not in the starting  this is a solid depth signing as a reasonable cap hit. ,NewYorkIslanders,dgoxra4,26,t5_2rpn6
11738176,0,t3_67hvkd,Probably not worth its own thread so Ill post it in here Do you think we make a move for Kovalchuk should he return?Friedman seems to think that New Jersey wants to get rid of him but has to sign him first before getting rid of him. Is there anything of value that we have and can part ways with that we can offer New Jersey for Kovalchuk? Do we even want him as a player? I havent paid attention to his KHL stats so I dont even know if theres a desire to have him or what he would fetch if there was.,NewYorkIslanders,dgqjvym,1,t5_2rpn6
