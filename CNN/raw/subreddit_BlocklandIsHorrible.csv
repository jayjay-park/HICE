1764477,0,t3_2eow15,gt  Pretty soon all the users mature enough are going to get fed up and leave and Blockland is going to be further populated by  year olds.Haha some are much older than . Some of them are adults or almost adults and they lack maturity.gt With all that said I start to wonder was all this really the way to go about it? I mean I guess there was no other way to go about pushing progress without standing up to Badspot. I just ask that you keep in mind not all of us in the community are a bunch of brainwashed fuckheads some of us have seen the light but still want to just enjoy the game for what replay value it has.It was hit or miss. Im hoping he will become angry enough to do the right thing with the game by passing it on but hes still getting money in sales by doing nothing. There also isnt a guarantee that hell pass it on to somebody instead of just abandoning it so it could go into the black abyss of disappearing art which ironically is something he has vehemently spoken against in terms of people saving other peoples creations without needing the creators permission. I think its more likely that hes going to abandon it which is very unfortunate.It seems the only way to cut his revenue significantly is to bring negativity to the Steam reviews for Blockland. This worked with the game Towns which is a game that was abandoned by its developers at least for now.This sub is more of an outlet for current players than it is for potential buyers.,BlocklandIsHorrible,ck1khfu,2,t5_312a3

2777566,0,t3_2pq6xt,you guys act like badspot is some huge warlord that wants to destroy rthe universe as we know it hes stated before that even if he updates the game to fix the problem the skids running the shit are going to just find another way around it theres infinite loopholes you cant stop some kid at a computer crashing online webservers with a dll file even if he patches it theyre going to find a new way to get around it in the next week.i understand the points you guys are trying to make and i get it you guys think that the game needs to drastically change before you guys can make a coming back to the game no im not a part of the subreddit and never will but i get your points. badspot has just placed the development at a stall for right now because badspot doesnt know what to do call him horrible tell him hes a sack of shit i dont care. thats not going to further the development of the game any further if you keep hating on him for no reason other than because a  game you bought  years ago isnt as interesting as it was when you were  its time to move on if youre so sick of waiting for updates.,BlocklandIsHorrible,cnjssw2,1,t5_312a3
