7234442,0,t3_4e8wmx,Im all caught up and Im going to be a buzzkill. Nobody knows anything. The podcast just seems really maudlin constantly interviewing family members in pain and the host doesnt really have any plan or direction to go in. And I hate the song.,MysteryMedia,d20i4ri,1,t5_3e4p6
7239771,0,t3_4ekihk,I want to listen to this show but Im afraid I wont be able to. Kids being left in cars is one of those things I cant read about or listen to. Im glad someone made a podcast about this case. How quickly the media and investigators jumped to the conclusion that this was done on purpose has always bothered me. ,MysteryMedia,d213xyn,2,t5_3e4p6

7270338,0,t3_4e9b5x,Great podcast. Its hosted by comedians so thats the approach they take which isnt for everyone. Underneath the jokes and funny voices its really well researched and a lot of the analysis is suburb. The episodes on Columbine and  for example are more though provoking than  of the mainstream commentary on the subjects.  ,MysteryMedia,d24l6gi,2,t5_3e4p6
7540621,0,t1_d2zbpfr,Do you believe it was intentional? Or do you think that even if it was an accident he should be held accountable anyway? ,MysteryMedia,d2zbyve,1,t5_3e4p6

A criminal charge would be nothing compared to the internal punishment I would be underId be right there with you. Im in SE Louisiana so it was a huge personal fear of mine when my kids were younger. I was always terrified that Id go into autopilot and forget one of my small children in the car. Thank God it never happened to me but it does happen to other people. I can see how some form of punishment would be appropriate but if I cant behind the poor woman who I linked above going to prison for the rest of her life I cant get behind Ross Harris going to prison. I dont think any of these parents were at all neglectful. I think they simply zoned out and forgot. It happens to all of us because its simply how our brains work. Thankfully  of the time there are no ramifications.,MysteryMedia,d2zdkex,3,t5_3e4p6

11247753,0,t3_60jhai,I listened to the first episode this morning. It is a very interesting case. It probably should be noted though that it is not about a murder. I wonder how that will affect its audience in terms of sheer numbers. I think that most true crime enthusiasts are more interested in murder than any other crime. I have to admit that I am guilty of that as well. Strangely enough there was a recent episode of Vanity Fair Confidential that dealt with a similar series of crimes. It was a good episode but my initial reaction was one of disappointment.,MysteryMedia,df6wznd,1,t5_3e4p6
