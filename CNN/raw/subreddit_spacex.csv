29698,0,t1_cehlocg,gt a rocket engine ! a jet engineTo some degree they are surprisingly similar. You have turbines in both rockets have the turbopumps that a jet doesnt. You have combustion chambers in both.In the end I think a Merlin engine have a similar range of rotating parts that a jet engine have.So with that said your are down to how big margins you use and the fuel problem with RP in Merlin.Its possible to build jet engines with only a few hours lifetime and Im confident that it is possible to build a rocket engine with thousands of hours of lifetime with the right fuel. The tricky point is if that rocket engine is light enough to actually use.,spacex,cehtac5,2,t5_2srow
33534,0,t3_1ufp1b,Im not an expert but I am a bit of a space geek. From my understanding the chances for first stage are very high with some performance impact in terms of reduced mass to orbit but reusability might make up for that in cost savings. That impact can likely be mitigated by way of a slightly larger rocket too.Second stage is far more difficult and Im not sure what the chances are there.Of course Dragon is already technically reusable so thats in the bag.But even a  reusable rocket would be an improvement over  or . ,spacex,cei8zis,2,t5_2srow

In  Japans fertility rate was . thats from the lowest point of . in . So yes its not less than  of replacement. Famous statistician Hans Rosling has a really good recent BBC documentary on projected populationeconomic changes and the effects on society that I recommend people watch. Population is expected to peak we already have reached peak baby and neither grow nor decline this century.I also disagree with Musks views on the population subject BUT a country experiencing a strong economytax revenue fueled by a demographic dividend does find itself in a position to undertake large capital projects like human space missions the famous postWWII baby boomer generation paid for the Apollo program so a population uptick would help the goal of a multiplanetary species.Though its worth keeping in mind that Elon seems to be only advocating for an increase in birth rates to the replacement rate population decline is developed countries currently only being offset by immigration like you say.

Way before grasshopper or any reuse testing.

384301,0,t1_cfkkz7j,well GTO is typically has an apogee where the satellite will stay but the perigee is like km this is too allow the second stage to decay its orbit and the satellite dose the final burn to raise its perigee to circularize.  This fuel is budgeted in the creation of satellites and their life span estimates. Recently I think spacexor another lauch provider decided to put the apogee far higher than the GTO area so the satellite uses less fuel to raise its perigee giving the satellite a longer life if its limited by fuel alone. Which is frequently the case.  So they might have decided that because of the cost savings they might risk the shorter lifespan of the satellite. ,spacex,cfkljez,3,t5_2srow

A bigger Kepler? Well itd be a very different mission... Kepler was never intended as a comprehensive tool of useful discoveries but rather a general statistical survey  what percentage of stars have planets sort of questions rather than which stars have planets sort of questions. Kepler observed a tiny expanse of the sky . of it very carefully. A superKepler would have  times the viewing area to be able to look at the entire sky constantly and would need  times the amount of bandwidth to Earth so besides mere size there are some technical hurdles itd have to overcome. The whole craft would probably not be  times heavier than Kepler though since a lot of equipment would then be overly redundant and unnecessary. Kepler itself is a tiny  ton and is in a heliocentric orbit which Im guessing would mean that the superheavy MCT using the math from that one blog would be able to lift maybe a ton spacecraft to that orbit.

We then spread that  over the ten expected launches and add cost of work to reuse. That means that the whole rocket will cost about  of what it does now. Great right?

Vandenberg is also likely to be exclusive or nearly so for national security payloads too or just flight tests what SpaceX was trying to do with the Falcon  development until ULA kicked them out of California.,spacex,cjgs9wu,3,t5_2srow

If you consider what is required for a home on mars it almost exactly matches what you will need for for the transit there. The reason you would not launch a spacecraft the size of a house off Mars is because with people on mars house sized pressure vessels fitted out for habitation are going to be in demand but on earth not so much.If you are going to take thousands of people to somewhere and you need a space ship to get there and a spaceship to live there you have to send these spaceshiphabitats anyway send them inhabited with the people who will live in them there and leave it there.I am not saying it will be the only living space there will be other structures for various things like green houses linking tunnels and eventually they will use local resources for creating larger structures when that happens spx will go from delivering you in your home to delivering just you but this would be cut up into earth to earth orbit earth orbit to mars orbit mars orbit to mars surface.

There are likely to be a number of failure modes that would direct the system to shut down all engines permanently.For instance were an engine stuck open the system might pinch all fuel lines in order to save the capsule.  A stuck open situation would be terribly hazardous to the crew.  It would in most cases be far better to suffer a hard landing under parachutes than hit the ground or ocean while spinning in loops.The system might also permanently shut the engines were a fire detected in any engine.

1816008,0,t3_2fcurw,It technically could be done but there are a few issuesThe th Air wing the ones in charge of the Capes airspace is very understaffed.  They are the ones that man the flight abort system and control the air force tracking assets.  They are only manned to support  launch per shift at this time.The tracking assets take time to be reprocessed between launches making multiple launches a day challenging.RUD and early aborts can and have happened this can lead to damage at other pads.  It was this fear that ULA sited to prevent overflight of the Falcon  over their pad at Vandenburg.  Lack of Demand.  During the s and s when the US was establishing a lot of its orbital assets there was a launch tempo of an orbital launch every few days.  There is no where near the demand for that type of launch rate today.  If there was its more economically viable to recycle  or  pads quickly than to maintain  unique launch pads.Workforce safety.  During all launches a pretty large area around the rocket is declared a no go area.  This lasts from the time the rocket is being fueled up until the range safety officer declares the area safe to work in again.

The term was first proposed in a  paper by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky   Since then the effect has been found for predictions of a wide variety of tasks including tax form completion school work furniture assembly computer programming and origami   In  Lovallo and Kahneman proposed an expanded definition as the tendency to underestimate the time costs and risks of future actions and at the same time overestimate the benefits of the same actions. According to this definition the planning fallacy results in not only time overruns but also cost overruns and benefit shortfalls  The bias only affects predictions about ones own tasks when uninvolved observers predict task completion times they show a pessimistic bias overestimating the time taken.  gtgtImage i  Daniel Kahneman who along with Amos Tversky proposed the fallacy.Interesting Lindy Effect | Planning | Index of management articles | Construal level theory Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckbop oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckbop.

2055575,0,t1_cl12k4j,Exactly.  Plus everyone needs to keep in mind....  obviously keeping a rocket as light as possible is important for performance.  When youre talking about landing the rocket though it becomes an even bigger concern.  Every ounce of dry mass has to first be accelerated to stage sep then decelerated to landing.  Its twice the penalty youd expect from a typical rocket.  Thats why things like fins deployable aerobrakes parachutes ect would REALLY have to give you a tremendous boost to be worth considering.The make it bigger approach is brutish but highly effective.  The rocket gets larger but the complexity have to scale up with it.  The cost of building the rocket bigger is also way cheaper than adding new subsystems.  The larger rocket also can easily fly significantly more demanding missions if flown in a disposable mission plan with very little changes to the rocket needed.  Also swinging back to complexity... its not just about reducing the number of ways that things can go wrong.  If these rockets are ever going to be cheaply and rapidly reusable simplicity is key.,spacex,cl13xdw,3,t5_2srow

2126222,0,t3_2jaxkp,Airbus wants to launch the recyclingrocket into orbit.Rocketbuilders are planning to reuse parts of their rockets to fly cheaper into space. Like SpaceX Airbus also wants to develop such rockets  but with a completely different concept.Up until now spaceflight has been a costly waste of material. All rockets carrying satellites or humans into space are throwawayrockets not reusable rockets. Their stages fall back into the ocean onto the mainland or circle the earth as space debris for some time after they reached the end of their burntime. However there are reusable spacegliders space planes as the disused space shuttle or military model XB which orbited earth for  months and returned recently.Engineers have been thinking for solutions for years how vertically launched rockets can be brought savely back to earth to use them again. That should lower the costs. Particularly private UScompanies like SpaceX are already doing tests.Our research shows that Airbuss space division is also beginning with the development of reusable launch systems. After an executive board resolution Airbus Defence and Space shall pursue such an innovative project as written in Airbuss staff magazine. A spokesperson confirmed the plan but was not willing to name any more detail. The project is a basicresearchproject not even a project just planning to look into the basics of such technology.Airbus responds to market changesChief of technology Andrew Anderson refers to the market changes because of SpaceX and Google buying the drones manufacturer Titan Aerospace in the staff magazine. We have to be a part in shaping this change pursuing our vision and strategy.Within the company Astrium now known as Airbuss space division the idea of a reusable rocket has been existent for some time. In  Astrium protected the name Adeline for such a project. Moreover in  Astrium registered a patent for a partially reusable rocketThe crux is not to return the whole first stage in one piece but only the lower part with the engines pumps and control electronics which cost millions without the large tanks above.The engine along with the control part makes up  of the value of the first stage it says in the patent documents. The valuable part is supposed to fly back and land on a runway fitted with airplane engines and a landing gear  if possible near the liftoff location. The landing approach is supposed to be controlled by three small wings with control flaps ? located in the lower parts of the rocket.Great differences between Airbuss and SpaceXs conceptThe concept greatly differs from the idea of the US company SpaceX the company of the multientrepreneur and billionaire Elon Musk. SpaceX is planning to bring the whole first stage including engines and tank savely back home.... Talking about SpaceXs approach Industry insiders call SpaceXs concept more technologically demanding. Airbus outlines in their patent that returning only the part including the engines of the first stage is a third cheaper than returning the whole first stage.The engines could be reused  times and the whole part of the stage about  times. Calculating the price of  flights the project with only a reusable part would cost just a fourth of the price of a fully reusable first stage. Up until now these numbers are however only estimates because it is just a basicresearchproject while SpaceX is near market introduction. Airane s propulsion is not yet determinedAirbuss space division does not provide any information in which rocket the innovation could be used. The technology is usable for the smallest to largest boosters and heavyduty rockets. The secrecy could have its grounds in the current talks about the future rockettechnology of the Europeans.By the end of the year a successor to the current model the Ariane  including propulsion shall be determined. Main goal is lowering the costs.... Something something something about Airbus merging their rocket division with the French company Safran into one with a workforce of  people  from Airbus and  from Safran. This company is to be responsible for building Ariane .Did my best not everything was translated word by word but it should give you a picture of the whole article.

2609988,0,t1_cmz3zjp,Ive posted this before but I think its useful for people to see again to better understand the reasoning behind certification.The idea of significant government oversight really stretches back to  and General Dynamics During the AC mission with a dual engine Centaur one of the second stage engines refused to start and the payload had to be destroyed. Note this was not the first flight of the dual engine Centaur. It had flown successfully for decades.General Dynamics conducts an investigation and finds the root cause. A piece of debris from a cleaning pad got left in the engine which disrupted the starting mechanism. Easy fix not a design flaw. General Dynamics implements new processes to make sure it doesnt happen again.Fast forward to AC. The exact same thing happens again. FOD in the engine causes the loss of another payload. The first spaceindustry failure investigation led by a private company ended in failure. The government was not happy especially when General Dynamics lost a navy satellite in an unrelated failure two years later. And remember this is on one of the most reliable upper stages in history.Its very hard play the odds and say youve had X successes in a row we trust you. There needs to be proof  insight into the design.If you dont buy that argument think about it from a cost perspective. Many government satellites are extremely expensive.

2693458,0,t3_2nvgfa,I have two questions. Why does spacex paint their rockets? Im assuming at least a few hundred pounds of paint is used. I thought maybe the white paint helped keep the tanks from warming up in the sun as much but they also paint other parts of the vehicle I would have thought wouldnt matter.  I figured with payloads costing several thousand dollars a pound youd want to be as light as humanly possible.My other question is would it be possible to put in some kind of tower system next to the launch site and supply fuel to the rocket for its first  seconds of flight? It already seems to take about  seconds to clear the tower as it is just build a bigger tower put in an elevator type system with breakaway hoses of some kind to follow the rocket up until it gets to the top of the tower.

2778721,0,t3_2rvvfr,I really dont see that level of reusability with the current generation of launch vehicles. For one theyre still rather fragile and the materials are pushed much much much further than on a commercial airliner. As much as they want to be able to gas and go I dont see that fully happening and for the first several years their turnaround speed will be rather low. Think about how often they get caught up in launching rockets the first time and now imagine stressing some of those components unpredictably. Thatll slow the process down a lot.Also there isnt enough demand. Only in the area of  satellites launch per year and only about  of them are open to SpaceXcommercialUS gov. So even if SpaceX fully dominated the entire launch market they would only be launching  times per year. Sure lower costs will increase demand but not by much. Even if launching a bird goes from M to M that doesnt mean much when the satellite costs M. And prices need to drop a few orders of magnitude before satellites can be made out of hardware store parts.I think that SpaceX has a decent chance of being successful with their current generation of vehicles but it depends how we define success. Theyd be incredibly successful if they drop prices  or can refly a core after a week.,spacex,cnjxj8t,1,t5_2srow

It absolutely applies and here is why...first in absence of air resistance you are right but with fins the air resistance is a factor. Also the further apart center of thrust and center of mass are from each other the more effective torque will be in correcting rotation. So absolutely having the trunk mass and fins are a huge help in keeping rocket straight. And part of that is keeping center of thrust further away from center of mass.  ,spacex,co9yewb,0,t5_2srow

If the trajectory is shallow enough could it be the case that it simply isnt worth the fuel cost to try and boostback?  If you can get the ASDS far enough out then just skip that burn altogether rather than fight extra hard to get closer to shore  especially when the hoverslam phase of the mission will be essentially the same no matter where you do it and probably more important from an engineering perspective.Not only that just occurred to me that a heavier full stage might be advantageous for the first potentially successful hoverslam.

Stage settles over net cuts engines falls a few yards into net and whole thing sinks down with balloons coming together over the rocket stage after a few thousand feet of gentle capture maneuver.

Id like to clarify for anyone who isnt familiar with Aldrin Cyclers.Not landing is basically what makes it a cycler instead of just a rocket. A cycler is just an object in an elliptical orbit such that its closest point to the sun intersects earths orbit about the same time earth is there and its furthest point from the sun intersects Marss orbit at about the same time Mars is at that point in its orbit. In theory a cycler could be built to not use any fuel at all. Thats not very realistic however since some minor course corrections might be necessary.I vaguely remember Elon saying something in an interview about Cyclers only making sense later down the road while MCT would be optimal for only s of people per launch window.

We have talked about this before on this subreddit but here are some numbersgt ... a single number on page  of each contract that we suspect may be the total for the fixedprice development amp certification portion of the contracts  . billion for SpaceX . billion for Boeing.  NASA will neither confirm nor deny....gt SpaceX bid a  mix between payments for successful program reviews and payments for successful system tests while Boeing structured their milestone payments far more heavily toward successful program reviewsreports  and away from successful system tests .  The identified risks of the two approaches are kind of contradictory  SpaceX for testing upfront Boeing for not testing upfront. It seems like doing rocket science on a compressed schedule is riskygt ... the Source Selection Report worries p  about SpaceX that the schedule is compressed with a lot of upfront tests and development activities in  and early  and thus that SpaceXs schedule may slip  but also notes that SpaceXs schedule calls for flight tests to be done and certification complete by mid so presumably they have some slack if they need it....gt Meanwhile they say about Boeing p  ...that there is a weakness in this subfactor for the compressed flight test and milestone schedule IE that Boeing has a lot of critical testing stacked up right at the end of their schedule which calls for just making it under the wire with certification in late .  If all the careful planning and reviews turn out to have missed something significant in actual hardware performance Boeing will have little or no slack to work with.  Which we note is not entirely Boeings fault since they gave the customer the process it wants rather than losing points on process in the evaluations for instead giving the customer the early hardware testing it needs.As discussed in previous threads I would be very surprised if Boeing manages to finish on time given the lack of buffers after their testing milestones.,spacex,cpff6zr,20,t5_2srow

3482864,0,t1_cpozqzt,gt Moores Law has had over  years to work through in terms of adding more computing power to these satellite constellations.RADHARD processors dont really obey that law... and even if they do theyre still going to be  years behind the current processors.I dont see processing power being the limiting factor in these things however. The first iridium constellations were limited more by RF performance of the ground terminals since they have to be hand portable. Much of their improvement over time has been due to RF segment improvements rather than processors. But the RF segment gets really complicated when youre talking  satellites and much of that hasnt changed since the mid s.

3502619,0,t3_30dp4j,The International Mars Research Station An exciting new plan to create a permanent human presence on Mars by Shaun Moss March    The Director of Mars Society Australia writes his own Mars mission architecture using SLS and Falcon Heavy. Best viewed as a critique and an update of Zubrins Mars Direct The Case For Mars which is now nearly  years old Moss outlines his arguments that Due to its allup nature with large continuing operations costs Mars Direct still leads to flagsandfootprints missions with no permanent colonization Landing an inflatable long term base first gives us a destination to go to year after year that only needs consumables refilleda This costs less than landing a house or two on Mars for every single mission after that you can just send crew and consumables. Just like Antarctica. Having a methane powered mothership with disposable propellant tanks allows for easy refueling and increases crew comfortsafetyetc Supplying Earth Return Vehicle Dragon  capsule from Earth at the end of the trip eliminates backcontamination risk and reduces mass cost vs throwing ERV from Mars.So higher upfront cost reduces permission cost and gives us a place to go to rather than some politician standing up and saying Why are we paying the same amount to go on mission ?. And having the ISS to go to has cynically speaking worked well for NASA for  years now as Zubrin constantly reminds us so if we stuck a large base on Mars maybe wed go there over and over again.EDIT clarification correctness minor grammar tweak,spacex,cpriuqb,6,t5_2srow

3915853,0,t1_cr2mzd2,Ah.  And for the FH booster stage shutting down engines is actually problematic.  Its probably a bad idea to shut them down on the center core in the middle of a launch for reliability reasons so youd have to shut them down in the outer core.  That slows down the fuel consumption in the outer core and will delay booster burnout until the center core is much much closer to burnout itself.  This both decreases the effective mass ratio of the rocket and can actually increase the peak gload in the long run because it will be pushing a lighter rocket at the end.Clearly there must be a solution they have in mind Im just curious what it is.,spacex,cr2n5th,2,t5_2srow

4098200,0,t1_crn8mhf,Thank you for being one of us who feels experience needs to be recent and with those existing personnel to be pertinent.  I Think your off on your dates however. SpaceX was formed in . The constellation program was . Orion was begun in  so any proposed Orion Lite would have been sometime after that when Lockheed had already won the award. Boeing tried to create a rabbit in its hat by proposing the lite version for use by the station and Bigalow stations. Dragon v work began in . The COTS award was Dec  and Dragon V was down selected as late as Sept  So they must have begun work on it in  sometime. The real problem is that Boeing did so shockingly little from  onwards. The pacing item for Bigalow has always been a commercial vehicle to ferry crews to his stations. That is why he put up his original XPrize where the winner got a prize and contract to carry out missions. Apparently this wasnt enough for Boeing to anty up its own money so they waited for a chance to get it from the gov. even during the whole downselect the produced very little except power point until they won the award. They could have been flying to bigalow stations by now. The only thing else needed was to man rate a launch vehicle like Atlas V and the government was obviously going to have to pay for that one way or the other. ,spacex,crnf51x,2,t5_2srow

4222467,0,t1_cs1jhc0,ampampamp Halo orbit sfw gtA halo orbit is a periodic threedimensional orbit near the L L or L Lagrange points in the threebody problem of orbital mechanics. Although a spacecraft in a halo orbit moves in a circular path around the Lagrange point it does not technically orbit the actual Lagrange point because the Lagrange point is just an equilibrium point with no gravitational pull but travels in a closed repeating path near the Lagrange point. Halo orbits are the result of a complicated interaction between the gravitational pull of the two planetary bodies and the coriolis and centrifugal accelerations on a spacecraft. Halo orbits exist in many threebody systems such as the Sun system and the EarthMoon system. Continuous families of both Northern and Southern halo orbits exist at each Lagrange point. Because halo orbits tend to be unstable stationkeeping is required to keep a satellite on the orbit.gtInteresting Statite | International Cometary Explorer | Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcsjhl oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecsjhl.

4227462,0,t3_39bcxm,Cell phone technology makes a good analogy.  In North America we have had at least Analogue G G GSM and CDMA and LTE service active in most major cities. But no one buys an analogue cell phone anymore even though the technology would still work. Protocols are updated and replaced in a rolling fashion. Old ones are phased out as new ones come online. Theres an overlap clearly to allow everyone a chance to upgrade their equipment and this is solved by supporting more than one standard at a time. Most phones on the market these days support G G and LTE in the same equipment. Most towers support G  G or G  LTE. But the components used in LTE are not refurbished G components  technology has moved forward. Its easier to build new.For a cheap satellite constellation the same will also apply. The first version will be launched and groundlinks made to connect to them. Eventually updates will happen but the new satellites will likely have to support old groundlinks for a time. So theyll support both signalsfrequenciesprotocolswhatever. New groundlinks will be built to support the newer satellites but fall back on the old ones when they need coverage. Until one day the old ones are all decayed and only new satellites remain.Orbital decay does your cleanup work for you unlike in the cell industry. If you can estimate failure rates and upgrade cycles you can design orbits to decay in an average of four years or ten years or whatever you want.

Rad hard electronics is expensive slow and old tech by its nature.The plan laid out by Elon Musk is to replace the satellites after  years with more advanced ones even though they are still functional. He also mentioned safe deorbit after end of service.  satellites replaced after  years means launching  every year continuously even with the full network deployed.

At month and  million subscribers they are looking at  billion a year. With the number of satellites Musk is planning on launching it will already stress their supply lines capacity to launch.

4384567,0,t3_3b27hk,PreLaunch Briefing  QampA notes and sortof transcript!These are really difficult to typeWhat is it about this booster attempt that makes you more confident than before?Previous booster attempts made corrections that can help a lot gave experience through trials that can fix things later. Two problems have been solved. Hard to say what odds there are but feel a lot better about this time.Can you explain why you need the IDA docking adapters compared to the Shuttle adapters?APAS shuttle not designed for autodocking. APAS could possibly work but it is so old that it was really just simpler to come up with a new international docking adapter spec that will work for all countries and increase commonalities between countries Mars etc may require intl cooperation. IPA is the first step towards space collaboration rather than space race. Should increase space exploration further than ever before.Main difference is that it allows for automated docking if needed.When do you think youll land the Falcon on land?Its not driven by schedule but by performance. They need a lighter mission to do RTLS. Its a mission before the end of this year. Safety is another constraint needs to be reliable. Once both safety and performance is ready theyll go.Docking adapter IDA is universal. How many other dockingberthing adapters are there on the station now?Russian colleagues have a number of different docking ports. They use probedrogue like Apollo smalldiameter but its lighter than any other system. They wanted to keep the androgynous design like APAS instead of probedrogue which doesnt have the same flexibility in contingency situations. IDA permits for the most flexible style so Russian design was out even though its simpler and lighter. On the US orbital segment they want full IDA eventually. Russia will continue to use probedrogue. US has Common Berthing Mech which has a very strong structure. That means a much larger hatch than other ports like IDA and a strong hatch. So with this configuration they preserve Common Berthing Mechanism  and two International Docking Standards  as well as the Russian Orbital Segment with its four probedrogue ports.If everything works out with landing what happens to the first stage?Itll be towed to harbor not sure how long that will take because everything has to be safed. From JAX theyll bring it back to McGregor and refire. It depends on what they find theyll first do an inspection of the vehicle to determine how reusable it truly is and make modifications if needed.Status of the Merlin Ds?Tests are going well on the uprated engines and so Flight  will have the upgrades most likely.One second window what happens if you miss it?Its for rendezvous so it has to have its velocity vector in the exact same plane. .kms velocity so to move the inclination a bit uses a lot of propellent. So it needs to be short because Dragon cant use too much fuel. Missing by  seconds isnt that bad  seconds would be worse a minute would be bad. For Shuttle  minute window Soyuz a  second window.Regarding barge weather what can we expect Sunday?Isolated showers are possible winds gusting mph. ft seas nothing is a constraint for landing. Maximum for ASDS is quite high. However weather for launch is most important.Whats next after this mission? Jason  Vandy what happens after?Jason first as you said then SES next a GEO bird standard launch profile. CRS next CRS shortly after. Lots of launches later this year will be very busy.Cost of IDA?Dont know the exact cost. The adapter wasnt as costly as a full system because its just an adapter.Two cargo missions after losing ORB how much does this impact the desire for a month supply padding?SpaceX will get close to the  months.  months isnt a requirement just desirable. But by the end of the year they want to be close to the  months that they prefer. Later on theyll get more. With ORB and Progress anomaly minimal research impact because of that long supply.Challenges and concerns about bring F stage back into ASDS especially considering Carnival Fascination?Primary missionsecondary mission again. I dont know much about it. Still ASDS landing is quite critical in the long run.Im sure well do it in a way that wont collide with cruise ships!Weather in Florida this was selected for a few historical reasons where would you move it if you could?Hey this isnt that bad! Its warm which is ideal. Lightning remains a constant concern and hurricanes can be an issue sometimes but cold temperatures can shut out most areas from consideration.What is the max timeframe that you can determine when a launch will happen? What can go wrong?They feel good for forecasting  to  days. Any longer is almost impossible to determine but they can use climatology to determine good times if its a year out or so but its still quite variable. So  days for actual weather anything further is climatology.Whats the advantagedisadvantage of IDA vs docking? Also you should be fine with ASDS as its a tiny cruise ship?Berthing allows for very large objects can help a lot. Docking is complex because you have to go straight in so you cant go too fast but you cant go slowly either. Though docking now is very reliable berthing is very simple because you kill your velocity at  meters away and then use the arm.However docking can be done in an automated fashion berthing requires a human to control the arm. Docking helpful for Mars missions whereas berthing currently requires humans.SpaceX do you do internships? Will you have opportunities for younger students as well?Refer to website if youre interested. Also NASA has lots too!Difficulties in installing IDA into Dragon?There were none. Regarding adapter it plays right in to ComCrew for Dragon  and Ive been pushing for those external cargo in the trunk.Whats your anxiety level on each launch?Im still excited about launches review data very carefully. Overall blood pressure has gone down over time blood pressure on this launch is especially healthy.I have no idea what the question was and neither did the answerer.IDA is an adapter because its APAS on one side and IDS on the other. The future systems will not adapt but just be a full system. Androgynous systems work for any two vehicles so IDS and APAS have a huge advantage in that respect.,spacex,csjvl2a,62,t5_2srow

Having an actual pilot on board can allow those splitsecond decisions to be made when it is needed.When significant effort starts happening by sending stuff to Mars I think this is going to be immeasurably the situation as well.  One of the reasons why landing on Mars has been such a disaster from a historical perspective is precisely because this kind of gut checking simply wasnt happening.  You didnt have somebody say wait a minute these readings are in Imperial units and not Metric! and know how to adapt right away.No doubt that computers have improved significantly although IMHO not as much as you claim.... raw processor speed is not as helpful as you think in those situations.  Instead of clunky LED screens spitting out number codes like  you get a fancy voice saying processor stack overload and a similar message showing up on a really cool looking GUI touch screen.The only real advantage is that the current generation of astronauts have is that more experience has been gained overall with spaceflight in general so many more failure modes are also known.

4811221,0,t3_3gpuar,Wait a minute. NASA has created a huge database of knowledge about spacecraft and materials and operations in space just as they did for aircraft when they were NACA and which they continue to add to. The problem is not with the knowledge database it is with the willingness of the aerospace companies to exploit the data to make improvements in their rockets and spacecraft. The NASA database is available to US companies and similar research is conducted in Europe so I am sure there are similar databases from the ESA DLR the French space program the Italian space program and the British space program.This kind of ignores all of the issues around cutting edge experimental aircraft and the fact the margins for rockets are even tighter than the margins for aircraft. Experimental aircraft that incorporate new materials innovative instruments and provide higher performance rewrite a portion of the book with each first flight. Each new design of rocket is like that also so rockets are a good deal more like experimental aircraft than airliners.The article ignores the key difference between airliners and rockets Rockets get used only once. Success at economical reuse will have to be achieved before space operations become economical enough to become widespread. ,spacex,cu0zt29,1,t5_2srow

Anyways the landing legs are not designed to be airbrakes and NOT purposed to be deployed at match  or above they would probably rip appart when the deployment starts.

5307458,0,t1_cvq285n,This is why I dont like even mentioning Mars One let alone speaking up for them.  gtMars One itself insisted that no new technology was required that everything they would use were off the shelf stuff existing technology and tech already in use on ISS.Just like Zubrin you can claim ISRU is th century technology that already exists but it still needs to be developed for use on Mars.  Pressurized metal cylinders have been flown in space hence the transit hab is already existing technology.  Marketers use marketing speak to attract investors.  For more examples see SpaceX.gtYou cannot avoid the fact that at that time there was no launcher nor a spacecraft that was capable of sending four people to Mars. Neither is there nowSaturn V did not exist when the Moon goal was declared either neither had an American even flown in space.  If you want to attack them for unrealistic timetables then remember what subreddit you are in.  Zubrins newest mini Mars Direct uses FHs and Dragons to land humans on Mars even though they dont exist.  Does he deserve to be attacked for that?  Personally I believe SpaceX will fly FH and D rather than cancel them.gtIf you bring people to Mars for the rest of their lives there are three optionsThey were aiming for a hybrid of  and .  Several resupply flights to give the tools for selfsufficiency.gtThe second one well lets just say that our knowledge and technology is NOWHERE NEAR at that level.Im not an engineer but I am an astronomer and have a basic understanding of general physics and on top of that Ive been an obsessed spaceflight enthusiast for roughly a decade.  I feel like I have a good understanding of historical spacecraft technology development and honestly I have to disagree with you especially the emphasis you place on it.  SpaceX wants to start a selfsustaining city.  Mars One wanted to start the equivalent of a selfsustaining hut.  It isnt a big leap of the imagination to see how a few supply flights could give them the tools to live for years without resupply.  Just like SpaceX will they wanted to rely on solar power ISRU and hydroponics. Life support is not a mythical technology.  It just needs LOTS of spare parts.If you really want to shit on Mars One attack their failure to respond to criticisms believably honestly I think I do a better job than they did and that they should have made it very public that they understood the magnitude of the challenge rather than all the handwaving or their glib manipulation of facts like the application count.  I think most of the legit criticism is in how they did their marketing which is ironic because that was what they were supposed to be good at.

5518136,0,t1_cwgzkj3,Lets set him to work then!gt EVA Astronauts complete seven hour spacewalkgt October   by Pete Hardinggt Two astronauts stepped outside the International Space Station ISS on Wednesday performing a spacewalk aimed at general maintenance and enhancements of the station. The Extra Vehicular Activity EVA  designated US EVA  began at  PM GMT and lasted just over seven hours in duration.gt EVA overviewgt The main purpose of EVA was to clear a number of outstanding tasks that have become backlogged over the past year due to delays and schedule changes associated with the failures of the Orbital ATK Cygnus and SpaceX Dragon vehicles and their subsequent standdowns.gt Many of these tasks  planned for previous EVAs  were postponed after the loss of International Docking Adapter IDA aboard the SpX flight in June which in turn delayed the long planned ISS reconfiguration effort in support of future commercial crew vehicles.gt Tasks conducted during Wednesdays EVA included the removal of a Multi Layer Insulation MLI thermal cover from a Main Bus Switching Unit MBSU stored on ExPrESS Logistics Carrier ELC on the outboard Starboard Truss of the ISS.gt The MBSU is a component of the stations power distribution system and serves to distribute the power generated by the stations solar arrays to user loads. The MBSU in question failed in August  whereupon it was replaced with a spare unit.gt The ISS program would like to attempt to recover the failed MBSU via opening it up and replacing the failed circuitry however since this task is too fiddly to be conducted by astronauts on EVA it must be brought back inside the ISS in order for the repair to be completed.gt The repair is not slated to be attempted in the immediate future so instead of bringing the failed MBSU back inside themselves the spacewalkers instead removed the MLI blanket covering the MBSU in order to expose the robotic grasping interfaces beneath it.gt Called Micro Square Fixtures MSFs these interfaces allow the stations Special Purpose Dextrous Manipulator SPDM Dextre robotic hand to grasp the unit and drive bolts to detach it from its stowage location. When required the SPDM can then bring the MBSU back inside the ISS by transferring it to the Japanese airlock via a piece of hardware called the JEM ORU Transfer Interface JOTI.gt While performing the MBSU MLI task on the outboard end of the Starboard Truss the spacewalkers also took the opportunity to install a thermal cover on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer AMS experiment.gt This was required in order to provide thermal shielding to pumps inside AMS which are showing some signs of degradation as AMS was not originally designed to be onorbit long term.gt Currently during high beta periods where the Sun shines on the ISS sideon AMS requires shading via either the SPDM being positioned above it or by rotating the stations own radiators in order to cast a shadow on AMS.gt The new thermal cover will however provide adequate thermal shielding to AMS in order to prolong the lifetime of its pumps.gt A big task for the EVA was the lubrication of the Space Station Remote Manipulator System SSRMS Latching End Effector LEE. The LEE is the part of the stations robotic arm which actually grapples payloads or serves as the attachment interface between the arm and the station.gt The LEE has many moving parts such as a central ballscrew and latches which extend in order to make a secure connection between the arm and the grapple fixture. These moving parts which have now been in the harsh environment of space for nearly  years occasionally need to be lubricated in order to preserve their smooth operation.gt Although there are two LEEs on the SSRMS one on each end one was already lubricated on an EVA back in February this year and so now the remaining end was lubricated in the same manner.gt Another big task for this EVA was the routing and prepositioning of cables in order to support future commercial cargo vehicle dockings at the ISS. NASA wish to have two docking ports on the ISS able to support future crew vehicles in order for one port to serve as a primary port and the other as a backup port.gt Under this arrangement one crew vehicle carrying four astronauts would arrive at the ISS stay for six months and then return home with its crew prior to another vehicle arriving with another four crewmembers for another sixmonth expedition.gt This indirect handover model would however require one Russian to fly on the US commercial crew vehicles so that one US crewmember could fly on the threeseat Soyuz spacecraft in order to maintain a US presence on the ISS during the periods when one US crew vehicle has returned to Earth prior to another one arriving in its place.gt While this method has been the plan for the past few years NASASpaceflight sources indicate that attitudes within NASA are now shifting in favour of the direct handover model whereby one US crew vehicle arrives at the ISS with a new crew before the old crew leave the ISS in their vehicle.gt This would maintain a constant US presence on the ISS without the need to fly a US crewmember on the Soyuz and thus eliminate the need to fly a Russian crewmember on the US crew vehicles. This is desirable since  in line with the worsening political situation between the two countries  issues have reportedly been raised regarding training Russian cosmonauts on US vehicles which contain proprietary technology.gt Regardless of which model is used however two docking ports on the US segment of the station are required in order to support future commercial crew vehicles.gt The station currently has one usable docking port in the form of Pressurised Mating Adapter PMA on the Forward end of Node  and a second docking port will be created by relocating PMA from its current storage location on the Port side of Node  to the Zenith side of Node .gt Two International Docking Adapters IDAs will then be installed onto the ends of the two PMAs in order to convert their legacy docking systems to the new International Docking System Standard IDSScompatible Soft Impact Mating Attenuation Concept SIMAC ports.gt The PMA relocation and the installation of both IDAs were planned to be completed this year. However the loss of IDA on the SpX Dragon mission in June delayed these plans. The new plan is for IDA to launch on SpX early next year and be installed onto PMA.gt IDA which is currently under construction to replace the lost IDA will then be launched to the ISS and installed onto PMA in the Spring  timeframe. The date of the PMA relocation to the Node  Zenith port is still unclear.gt Wednesdays EVA did however route two power and data cables from Node  to the Forward end of Node  and connected to PMAIDA where they will be installed on the Node  Zenith position during a future EVA. Provision also exists to route a third  cable.gt The final task that was to be completed during the spacewalk was the installation of a Non Propulsive Vent NPV on the Forward side of Node . An NPV is designed to vent ISS atmosphere and gases into space if required without creating a thrust which could lead to the need to perform a desaturation of the stations Control Moment Gyroscopes CMGs.gt The NPV was removed from the exterior of Node  earlier this year since it would have caused minimum clearance issues during the robotic operation to install the Permanent Multipurpose Module PMM onto the Node  Forward port during its relocation in May.gt Now that the PMM has been relocated. However there are no longer any robotic clearance issues associated with the NPV and thus it will be reinstalled. However this was deleted from the timeline during the EVA.gt EVA procedures  Follow Along Livegt The .hour EVA began with EV Scott Kelly wearing the suit with the red stripes exiting the Quest airlock first followed by EV Kjell Lindgren wearing the plain white suit. For both astronauts it was their first spacewalk.gt Once all bags were removed from the airlock and stowed outside Kelly took the bag containing the AMS MLI cover and headed out to the outboard end of the Starboard Truss while Lindgren removed an Articulating Portable Foot Restraint APFR from External Stowage Platform ESP and followed Kelly to the worksite.gt Once at the worksite Kelly peeled back the MLI cover on the MBSU removed a tiedown skirt and then drove two bolts to detach the MLI cover from the MBSU.gt Lindgren meanwhile installed the APFR onto the AMS ingressed it and took pictures of the AMS worksite.gt Lindgren deployed an MLI wedge between the AMS radiators which popped out like a tent in order to protect the radiators. He installed and secured the new MLI cover over the side of the AMS attached four straps and an electrical grounding pin.gt The pair then translated back to the airlock carrying with them the unneeded MBSU MLI cover and also the APFR which Kelly installed back onto ESP and ingressed it at that location.gt Lindgren then took the cable bag and translated to the Port side of the US Destiny Laboratory and began to secure the forward coil of data cable about halfway along the Port side of the Lab. He then routed the aft coil to the Nadir side of Node  and connect it to a socket at that location.gt He went back to the forward coil previously secured halfway along the Lab and routed that to the Zenith side of Node  where it was secured ready to be connected to PMAIDA on a future EVA.gt Lindgren then followed the same procedure for the second cable this one a power cable but will not route the forward coil to Node . Instead Kelly will complete this later in the EVA while,spacex,cwgzpv0,13,t5_2srow

They make great rockets but were all here with SpaceX because theyre constantly trying to do a lot more.  I want to talk about cool stuff on ULA rockets but I also want to talk about everything space related from other sources too.

Anything else is just water under the bridge and stale news that is regurgitated other than confirming some fanciful ideas about what the MCT might or might not actually be.  That would require some specific engineering to be done though.Still at this point it is pure speculation and until the announcement is made I wouldnt assume anything else.

There was a fix needed for running out of hydraulic fluid and that was more fluid. There was a fix needed for valve stiction which they probably worked out by just wiggling the valve so it doesnt stop moving and lubing it up a little better. Youre trying to solve a problem that doesnt exist and despite being told by several people that the problem doesnt exist you keep trying to solve it. Youre insisting you have a better idea for a wheel without first telling anyone why the wheel needed improving.SpaceX have not lost a first stage yet as their customers have already paid for them as if they were going to be expended.

The deltav achievable has nothing to do with amount of instantaneous thrust and everything to do with available propellant. Since they use the same propellant tanks you could theoretically get the same amount of deltav in vacuum with either engine provided no dramatic difference in engine efficiency.Besides not needing more deltav to deorbit saving some propellant for propulsive landing is part of the design.,spacex,cww490m,4,t5_2srow

If the goal had been to systematically expand humanitys presence into space then that is exactly what they would have done in fact they planned to build up pretty much exactly that capacity once Apollo winded down. But the goal was to put flags and footprints on the Moon as quickly as possible. That meant there was no money for side projects like a space station developing active cooling techniques which have still not been demonstrated in orbit  years later or a shuttle.They didnt do Earth Orbit Rendezvous because theyd have needed to dock in a very short time frame. They would have needed to dock in a very short time frame because the only available propellant was HLOX both of which are notorious for boiling off in orbit. The storable propellants they had available were very inefficient low Isp which meant that if they were to use storable propellants theyd have needed to put together a truly massive spacecraft in orbit. So they weighed their options and decided to go with a single launch concept.As for why it hasnt been done after Apollo thats simple enough We havent gone anywhere since Apollo.

FFSC is also a way to reduce complexity.He also needs loads of engines because the proposed Mars rocket is simply too big to fly with less than  engines.  Whether that thing will ever make any commercial sense is another matter but well see in time.gtAlso considering ULA doesnt even make their own engines I dont think its fair to say that they are going with  small engines because they understand the technology.It can be both.  Theyre limited by the availability of engine choices but the decision to opt for partial reuse has a lot to do with the fact that ULA know that technology pretty well.  If they felt that it was worth using a smaller engine and having more of them they could also have pushed one of their partners towards developing something appropriate.

However depending on the payloadorbit the previous rockets could land on a pad and this rocket could land on the barge only changing software. Indeed until quite late in the process it was a possibility this launch was going to attempt a barge landing they even moved the barge to Cape Canaveral.For your fourth question the probability of success has always been a bit up in the air with landings. For the first barge landing attempt Elon quoted  chance but then later admitted he picked that number out of a hat. I think for the second he also said  but that he was somewhat more confident in the percentage then before. In the post flight press call this launch he said that he figured  chance of success.To some extent barge landings were important for showing the FAA that they could arrive on target so going back to land was safe. It is unclear how important this was various comments by Elon suggest that they were willing to give landlanding permits from the start.

6096826,0,t1_cyiheb7,Quite a lot of the problems he discusses can be summed up as fuel rich staged combustion is really hard to do. The Merlin  avoids this issue by not being staged combustion at all  instead Merlin  just vents the problematic preburner exhaust over the side losing considerable efficiency for an apples to apples comparison compare Merlin D SL at s to RD ORSC at s SL a considerable efficiency advantage  and Merlin D is a fairly remarkable GG cycle engine. This avoids most of the issues that are discussed about the SSME  no high back pressure so no funky turbomachinery dynamics and no need for separate high and low pressure turbomachinery sections either and it also means that the piping doesnt get eaten and explode when you try to run high temperature gaseous oxygen through it.As a result it isnt overwhelmingly surprising that Merlin  is a reliable engine  because GG cycle engines are well understood and avoid a lot of engineering challenges at the expense of lower efficiency. The space to watch isnt as much Merlin reusability as much as Raptor reusability because Raptor sees all the same problems that the SSME had and more thanks to the full flow staged combustion system  which avoids one issue with the turbopump backpressure but has much larger issues with complexity of plumbing and metallurgy.,spacex,cyinac3,3,t5_2srow

6102972,0,t3_3z53as,Fairings. Its the fairings. Actually fairing production is pretty slow and takes up a lot of floor space. They will have to add a second production line or figure out how to recover and reuse them once they run through the stockpile they were able to make during the  month stand down following CRS. They have reengineered Merlin D for fast production. They should have no problem building  engines in a year and year is probably possible so even without reuse engines which is the ULA and OrbitalATK bottleneck is not  problem.From the photos Steve Jervetson released last year my wild guess is that the factory as presently configured can make  first stagesyear given enough engines and  second stages. Given almost any nonzero rate of reuse of the first stages production of tanks avionics etc. should ramp up to permit  launchesyear if required.That leaves transportation on roads testing at MacGreggor launch pads and payload integrationlaunch crews. I think the very last is where the bottleneck now sits. My opinion is that they must now be training a second launchpayload integration crew and that by the end of this year they will have a third crew trained. These  new crews will be focused on smooth production getting boosters and payloads to the launch sites on time getting everything assembled and launching things into space. Then the A team or the engineering team or whatever you want to call the original team will concentrate on Falcon Heavy and Dragon  launches and also on getting a bit more sleep. Exhaustion of the current launch crew is an issue and it was an important step with this launch that Elon Musk was not at mission control this time. ,spacex,cyjcgi4,59,t5_2srow

6111541,0,t1_cyk4489,gt If reusable rockets can do  flights before retirement then the whole market can be addressed by  cores. Heck SpaceX would only need  core per year and a core Heavy set every few years to run their airline.gt gt Then production costs per core skyrocket and most production is nd stages. So we need more flights right? Well that will happen but sloooowly.First SpaceX has a multiyear backlog of orders. They need to clear that before they can be accused of creating excess capacity.When they create excess capacity what if   SpaceX charges half the price of their next closest competitor and thereby put all nonnationalsecuritysubsidized competitors out of business.   Continue making as many Falcon  cores as they can and launch and relaunch them from their own launch facilities to be built in S. Texas.   Use the excess capacity for their own purposes.    Given your predictions for high costs if SpaceX cuts manufacturing on first stages the marginal cost to keep making first stages and to raise production on second stages may be very low. You seem to believe that SpaceX will have absurdly excess launch capacity for an absurdly low marginal cost. If so there will be many opportunities for SpaceX to use that capacity themselves.      Elon Musk reminds me of a rail road mogul from the th century. Many of them were their own best customers. They used their rail roads to move the iron ore to their own blast furnaces. SpaceX has mentioned setting up their own global satellite internet service provider.     They could build a base on Mars. Such a base would require an absurdly high launch capacity at an absurdly low marginal cost.    Or they could mine asteroids. There may be several billion dollars worth of ore in the asteroid belt for each one of us  billion people here on Earth. Learning to mine it would require an absurdly high launch capacity at an absurdly low marginal cost.    We should be asking How many launches can SpaceX pull off for  billion   billion per year?

6323616,0,t1_cz84szh,The normal flight profile uses the same tanks and the Dracos for onorbit maneuvering and uses the SuperDracos for the deorbit burn. Doing a takeoff burn probably gives the engines a better simulation of their condition for a real landing. So the hop is a more realistic test.Personally I think doing takeoffs and landings using the SuperDracos is both safer and cheaper than a helicopter drop. There is a tiny chance the Dragon  might explode while being towed under the helicopter or the carry harness might fail just after takeoff resulting in a drop burst and explosion killing the helicopter crew. Obviously you need the same number of people to do a hop test as a heli test except the heli test requires hiring a pilot an onboard engineer and renting a big helicopter.

Hopefully that is going to change real soon go SpaceX... GO! but it is also a whole lot more complex.Besides other countries did step into the arena of spaceflight.  Japan Europe via the ESA China India Brazil and even the UAE have all been engaged in spaceflight on one level or another with rockets of their own and even sending extraterrestrial space probes.  China has even sent astronauts of their own into space in spite of the fact their launch rate of doing so is practically none.The sad part of it all is that there is now a generation of kids growing up who are questioning even if the Apollo Moon landings even happened at all since it seems beyond current technology today.  I hope that changes so the Moon hoax conspiracy nuts are finally relegated firmly to the same category as the flat earth guys they belong to.,spacex,cza8gv2,2,t5_2srow

6346697,0,t3_422jn3,The people in the dragon capsule have just complete a journey that commenced on a tower of super cooled LOX and RP both of which can be pretty lethal if leaked individually and specialty in combination.

Then a period of time surrounded by lethal vacuum followed by more lethal supersonic streams plasma this time before finally narrowly avoiding the lethal side effects of . mss.   So while it would be ideal to replace the hydrazine family propellants with a green alternative  i think they have to be rather low on the scale of risks when considering things outside the capsule that could kill you if something goes wrong.

ULA has never designed or built rocket engines. Pratt amp Whitney? Why would they bother spending billions designing a new engine when the RD is cheap and freely available? Should they have predicted international relations  years into the future?gtThey made a business decision as they had every right to. Problem is no one seems to want them to have to suffer for the mistake.Why on Earth should ULA be punished for making a rational business decision that was supported by both congress and the Air Force? If anything they should be offered some leeway since congress both encouraged Lockheed to use the RD in the first place and then approved the decision not to pursue domestic production.gtThey bet on nothing new happening in the launch market for decades maybe even ever.And for decades nothing new did happen. Once SpaceX starting shaking up the market ULA began working on Vulcan and partnered with Blue Origin on BE.gtThey lost that bet.

Not that it wouldve helped that much as most of the N kabooms were due to issues unrelated to an individual engine failing  instead they were due to what happened after an engine failed.The biggest boom that took out the pad was effectively due to the KORD system analog engine management computer going full retard due to a wiring fault and after an engine anomaly instead of shutting the opposite engine to balance things shut down... all other engines.

The Space Shuttle was quite a lot heavier than Falcon   metric tons for the Space Shuttle  versus  metric tons for Falcon .  Even though the Space Shuttle had a thrust at sea level of  kN  and the Falcon has a launch thrust of  kN  its easy to see that the acceleration of the Space Shuttle would be much more gradual  Force equals mass times acceleration therefore acceleration is force over mass and  lt .

We need to step back a bit.What Mr Tobey said in his speaking engagement if you think about it could possibly have very serious financial and legal ramifications. Yes we maybe upset but in the overall scheme of things here we are very very minor to what is happening With SpaceX ULA Blue Origin. His statement could cause congressional problems DOD problems could affect ULA Boeing and Lockheeds  credibility. He contradicted ULA in why they didnt bid on The GPS contract. At a guess and this is only a guess!!!  I wouldnt doubt for an instance that Mr Bruno wasnt in a conference call with Aerojet or Blue Origin today doing damage control.  And who knows what Senators McCain and Shelby were thinking today.

Changing to a hybrid with a solid oxidiser with  mix of SOX and SOZ would increase that to s.  Using LOX and solid hydrogen doped with  boron would increase that to s so the performance increases can be dramatic.Theoretically if it would work the ideal mix would use pure solid ozone as the oxidiser with the boron incorporated either as a slurry with the LH which sounds problematic or adding it to the solid oxidiser instead.Hybrids have a reputation for relatively low performance but with the right engineering they could match or even exceed liquid engines.The ultimate chemical engine would be metallic hydrogen monopropellant with airaugmentation to allow it to work as a rocketramjet in the lower atmosphere.

That gives SpaceX over   years of development time in which to match Bigelows offering.  For SpaceX . years is quite a lot of development indeed.A leading inference from Bigelows tie up with ULA is that SpaceX is in fact developing their own habitats.

SpaceX could develop a larger fairing for a fraction of the price differential separating Falcon and Atlas and it certainly wouldnt take  years.The most likely reason Bigelow has saddled himself to ULA is because SpaceX refused to sign a noncompete.

7237610,0,t1_d1yvdb7,Regarding self inflating life raftsThe patent was filed in  and published granted in December .Its not fully selfinflating but closegtThe release of the inflating gas into the interior of the secondary tube  will be suflicient to inflate the same to substantial rigidity so that it assumes the outline and configuration shown in the drawings. When the secondary tube  is inflated as described it will cause the main tube III the seatsupporting tubes l and I and the fabric surrounding the compartments   and  to assume substantially their normal position save that they will be uninflated. In the condition just described the raft will be sufficient to support at least one person in its interior and such person may immediately start to pump air into the eight different compartments in the main tube In until the same have the desired pressure therein to cause them to assume substantially the contours shown in the drawings. In effecting the inflation of the various compartments in the main tube  the person screws the terminal of a manuallyoperable airpump into the threaded interior of the exposed valveclosure  of the appropriate valvestructure. By backing off or loosening the particular valveclosure air may be forced into the chosen compartment. When a given compartment is suitably inflated the valveclosure is screwed down upon the sealingring  whereupon the airpump may be detached and connected in a like manner to the valvestructure  of another compartment. Either before or after inflation of the compartments in the main tube ID the person may inflate the two seatsupporting tubes  and I. By way of example it has been found that a suitable relationship between the respective diameters of the main tube I and the secondary tube  are about a seventeeninch diameter for the main tube and a fiveinch diameter for the secondary tube though of course these dimensions may be varied as desired.Heres a later patent filed in And one filed in gt The raft of the reversible type comprises the usual endless main buoyancy members   of rubberized fabric connected by at least one equalizer tube  and adapted to be automatically inflated by the usual means not shown in the launching of the raft with the exception of a laterinflated boardingstation portion between bulkheads  .By that time automatic inflation has apparently become a standard technique by the usual means.Conclusion not NASA not Apollo.,spacex,d20v3ys,1,t5_2srow

7264580,0,t1_d23wyuh,The other concern would be heavy mechanic vibrations due to the violent turbulent hypersonic entry with a not very aerodynamic rocket first stage pointed engines down.Going bottom down has various advantages the center of mass is close to the bottom so the flight is more stable you have the engines pointed retrograde convenient to slow things down if necessary you want to land bottom down... but if you go bottom down theres no place to install a regular heat shield.Top down would allow a heat shield but it would also create a lot of additional problems unstable flight center of mass is high up center of lift is below it engines cannot help with slowing down before landing youd have to flip the rocket in atmosphere a risky and possibly impossible maneuver with a  meter long very thin rocket with very little lateral stability. Rocket flipping is best done in vacuum.So heat shields wont be used on the first stage in the future either I think.For stage  reusability you could use a heat shield and parachutes.

7291954,0,t1_d26zs3t,gt Thanks do you know what design choices would make an engine capable of being refired without refurb?A few thoughts on that One consideration would be that the RP longchain hydrocarbons dont burn cleanly and have various byproducts and impurities such as sulfur which would stick to inner parts of the engine when the engine cools down and it might or might not be restartable afterwards. Id guess that finer structured components like injectors would be affected  they are also right in the combustion chamber where temperatures are the highest. In microgravity your propellants start floating away from turbopump inlets If you restart an engine in microgravity then you have to make sure both propellants are properly at the turbopump intakes so that the turbopump does not suck in gas and gets destroyed. For this SpaceX probably has a combination of intermediary ullage tanks and might also use RCS thrusters to slosh the liquids towards the turbo pump intakes shortly before reignition. Another guess would be that a big part of restartability would be to clean out the engine with an inert gas as much as possible right after the main burn  but maybe SpaceX simply made sure its dimensioned in a way that nothing can stick up easily and just stops the burn. Then it should be mostly about having a restartable mechanism to start the engine i.e. dont use one time charges to set free the helium that starts the turbopump close the valve after startup etc. Also note that SpaceX also does something else that is possibly a lot more tricky than simple restarts starting the engine for an atmospheric deceleration burn while high pressure hypersonic winds are blowing right into the engine nozzle. Plus and this is special to SpaceX they use  Merlins  of which are offaxis and you really want to start them up in sync so that the rocket is not torn to bits or rotated unduly by asymmetric forces.Methane should be a lot less problematic going forward as it burns much cleaner CH  O burns into HO  CO .Methane engines will essentially be selfcleaning.,spacex,d271o4n,29,t5_2srow

In order for the chasing Dragon to match the orbit of the ISS and then catch it they have to launch at precisely the right time hence the instantaneous launch window for these missions.In contrast paying customers want to launch at a time and using a trajectory that is most efficient to get them into their own specific and different each time! orbit. So unfortunately for that reason alone I think it would have to be a second dedicated F launch.

The ASDS has receivers for capturing telemetry from the stage because by the time the st stage gets close to landing on it it is below the horizon of all the other telemetry receiving stations.

The enthalpies of the fluids are unknown at mixing as youd have to calculate the heat flux of the thrust chamber meaning you dont know the temperatures of the fluids at mixing. The initial enthalpies of the reactants have an effect on the flame temperature. edit to spell it out even more specific heat of a fluid is a function of the temperature. Gamma the specific heat ratio will change as the temperatures change due to the different specific heats. Now knowing the reactant enthalpies because the big heat exchanger that is a rocket engine heats up the propellants raising the enthalpy from the reservoir state. Now the different specific heat at inlet of the propellant manifolds also changes how much heat is transferred to the propellants. At the mixing zone the enthalpies of the reactants affect the flame temperature. Meaning the exhaust temp is different.Bottom line its not really first order approximation at this point to consider the change of temperature of the propellant.,spacex,d2x5i60,5,t5_2srow

I work for Wolfram Research on things like Wolfram Alpha and in general natural language understanding  semantics.My general thoughts had been that it would be cool to create semantic objects with a unique ID for lots of SpaceX related things. Missions Launches First stages ex. F Landings   Landing recovery events Satellites SpaceX hardware F FH etc. Twitter posts SpaceX ElonMuskFrom there youd have the ability to start recording curated data about those things... not just facts like Cap fitted on F at timestamp but also images news articles reddit threads etc.Once this was in place one interesting fallout from it would be that people could subscribe to be notified when new information became available and they could essentially set up filters to control what types of information they were interested in.For example right now Id love it if I could get a notification popup on my screen any time a substantial landing recovery event happened. Imagine a notification popup F lifted off droneship  mins ago. You could then click that popup to see an actual web page that represents that event which would probably include a photo the ability to go backwards or forwards to see previous or future recovery events links to the subreddit where its being discussed etc. or maybe a thumbnail of the photo would be part of the popup itselfImagine other notifications Dragon reentering atmosphere Dragon berthed to ISS SpaceX TitleOfTwitterPost ElonMusk TitleOfTwitterPostRelatingToSpaceX ISS sighting in  minutes the ISS will be over your house in  minutes and will be brighter than usual and the weather in your location is good for seeing it ...I guess it would be in a sense like reddit except more curated more computable etc.I think this is basically along the lines of what youre suggesting so  I agree it would be interesting to play around with this!Ive never played with MongoDB Ive never head of JSONLD etc so I should try and do some homework and play with those things so that I can comment more constructively about them.The company I work for is always working on technologies in this area as well and I think something is in the works right now that overlaps significantly with these ideas I should check when those will be available for public consumption...,spacex,d30f81e,2,t5_2srow

You can land on a barge in the ocean and you can even make it float like the Dragon. not having wings stick out of your rockets side helps keep a low drag coefficient on ascent propulsive landing also works on Mars the Moon Europa you name it  so you use the same space ship everywhere  without having to bring your extra aerodynamic lift mass with yourself.... all in one a proper space ship has a much better drymasscargo ratio  while having all the advantages of a shuttle plus some unique advantages a shuttle does not have.So why not a manned Dragon?,spacex,d3cv5tu,4,t5_2srow

Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit.Russia halted orbital space tourism in  due to the increase in the International Space Station crew size using the seats for expedition crews that would have been sold to paying spaceflight participants. Orbital tourist flights are planned to resume in .As an alternative term to tourism some organizations such as the Commercial Spaceflight Federation use the term personal spaceflight.

No they designed it with reentry stresses in mind and quite evidently they succeeded.Do you agree from the plenty of data I provided that reentry forces are provably more violent than ascent forces? Id guesstimate that reentry forces are probably  more violent than ascent forces  possibly more. Can attempt to run through such a comparison of ascent vs. descent stresses if you want.But Im not going to argue against the track record of Atlas V its stellar. The center core of Atlas V CCB might even be designed to be stronger than the Falcon  on ascent because the transfer loads from the SRBs must be pretty significant and because the Falcon  booster is thinner and is stretched longer  while both have a similar structural  engines dry mass of about  tons excluding reusability hardware on the F side.gt In other words I think Atlas V could probably survive as well if it had active stability systems and did a reentry burn perhaps with a few small structural modifications as SpaceX did. It might be able to survive reentry but probably couldnt land because the single large RD has way too much thrust to allow reasonable control over the final landing burn. The Atlas V has a thrust of  kN and assuming it is able to throttle down deeply to  thats a lowest thrust of  kN. Thats  tonforce  providing a TWR of  with  tons of landing mass. A single MerlinD can throttle down to  of its full thrust or  tonforce which is still a TWR larger than . but only a bit so its manageable.,spacex,d3q5qlq,2,t5_2srow
7778660,0,t1_d3q6c1n,To add detail to what others have saidThe satellite operator and the company performing the launch both have to buy insurance. The satellite operator has to buy two or three types of insurance. One type covers everything before the launch someone drops itcrashes the truck carrying it the other covers everything that happens after T including failure of the rocket and failure of the satellite ex. solar panels dont deploy.The launch company buys insurance to cover possible property loss including damaging the launch pad or falling on someones boat. NASA got into an argument with Orbital over how much their insurance covered damage to the launch pad. Apparently there was  million in damage that was not covered.Note that the launch operators insurance does NOT cover the payload. Thats on them. A more unreliable rocket  higher launch costs for the operator AND higher insurance for the launch company. ,spacex,d3qdb7t,3,t5_2srow

A lunar mission takes only a little over a week at minimum so you can just have all that stuff on the surface ready for when the crew arrives and have a much smaller ship and an abort only takes a few days at most helped by the use of free return trajectories which are difficult to do with Mars so most types of failures have a high chance of survival,spacex,d3s6uq9,3,t5_2srow

If the political shows start reporting on advances in space travel then it is very likely we will start seeing increases in funding from congress as well as more interest from the general public.I dont think the Apollo missions would have culminated in several Moon landings if Walter Cronkite had not made a point of reporting in considerable detail on the advances being made with every Mercury Gemini and Apollo mission. Cronkite not only read the CBS Evening News he was also head of the News Division and maybe the third most powerful person at CBS in the s. He got good ratings reporting on space so the other networks followed suit. If not for the great public interest I think maybe Nixon would have cancelled the manned space program when he came to office in January .

The sound pressure levels that can be expected from BFR likely may exceed Saturn V  decibels. At that sound pressure level structures that are not built to withstand the acoustic load can easily be damaged. One alternative is for SpaceX to purchase all the nearby residences. Port Isabel at about  miles from the Boca Chica launch pads is much close than Cape Canaveral the city at about  miles. In any case SpaceX will need to purchase a lot more land for RTLS pads and the BFR pad presuming that the current launch pad construction only supports Falcon .Just the noise issue could be a reason that launching BFR from Cape Canaveral might be more attractive! ,spacex,d3v4cfb,2,t5_2srow

Still we keep installing these meteorological stations despite having over  of them already. Why? Because long term planetary processes are much easier to understand if you have a long term historical data record from as many sites as possible.Look at this Mars presentation for example. It lists surface temperature data from Viking and Pathfinder. The number of observations from the surface of Mars is limited in time and is less than a handful  and many of the recent ones are mobile so they dont offer stable observations from a fixed landing site. Any new series of data  especially if the lander is able to survive longer due to a generous mass of solar panels  would create new research and would back up other sources of data.Even something as simple as a daily spectrogram of the Martian atmosphere as it blows into the Red Dragons hatch would offer interesting long term observations about atmospheric processes. Cloud observations. Solar intensity during dust storms. Daily temperature minimums during clear season. Seasonal variations in Argon and Nitrogen concentrations.

7967710,0,t1_d4bj75a,gt Your plan is vagueMy fault!So Im thinking that the following power distribution architecture might work low DC voltage ranges defined and tested as acceptable input voltages for equipment. For example V centered around V. high DC voltage levels for long distance transmission to reduce wiring mass. This too is a range not a fixed level  say V centered around  kV for a given transmission line. battery pack for lack of better name  that has high level voltage grid inputoutput and low level voltage consumer voltage inputoutput. solar cell array that produces high voltage level grid output in a configured voltage range.Both battery pack and solar cell array has a smart power manager that switches the internal wiring of the battery and solar cells according to cell and power grid constraints.The battery pack does the following roughly softwaredefined lowresistance internal power switchingrouting fabric that connects battery cells in any configuration to each other and can connect any configuration of batteries to the input voltage or to the output voltage. the individual properties voltages currents temperatures and aging of cells is tracked and is considered separately and no individual cell is ever overcharged or overdrained and outright faulty cells are isolated etc. Cell types that dont tolerate microcycling are made sure to have longer chargeonlydischargeonly cycles etc. the power grid functionality is achieved by measuring input and output voltage levels and reacting to them if input power grid voltage drops below a critical limit then more cells are connected to the power grid to help it maintain the grid voltage range and the same is done to output consumer voltage levels as well. If power grid output levels raise beyond a threshold then the excess voltage is used to maintain a charging current for an adequate configuration of battery cells. The battery pack could also draw charging power from the low power side of the network to charge cells  this would allow the integration of dumb power generators. maintain safe current drawing limits on both the grid and the power consumer side. i.e. never draw more than safe from or to the grid and never allow more power to be drawn from the battery pack than safe in that particular installation.Basically what a state of the art battery pack is doing today.For the solar cell array its a similar slightly simpler design just on the power generation side where theres an input of solar cells and a high DC voltage power grid output softwaredefined lowresistance internal power switchingrouting fabric that connects solar cells in any configuration to each other and can connect any configuration of solar cells to the output voltage. the individual properties voltages currents and aging of solar cells is tracked and is considered separately. the power grid functionality is achieved by measuring grid voltage levels and reacting to them if output power grid voltage rises above a certain threshold then groups of solar cells are brought offline to reduce offered capacity. solar cells will generate different output voltages depending on cell type age irradiance and drawing current. The power manager switches them into a configuration that produces voltage in the desired grid range without any explicit voltage transformation happening other than capacitors smoothing out switching transients and without exceeding grid safety limits. maintain safe current drawing limits on the grid. i.e. never generate more current than safe to the grid. If a solar array cannot produce the minimum voltage it switches off.I.e. pretty much what a state of the art solar power inverter is doing today.The advantages of such a design are power generation is close to maximum efficiency no voltage transformation only switching highvoltage large distance transmission is still possible the actual voltage levels are software defined so different transmission lines could use different DC voltages. it allows your transmission system to stay relatively dumb and uncoordinated allows transmission voltages to be upgraded if current exceeds design limits from software pushes finegrained intelligence near the components where being smart truly matters batteries and solar cells. allows distributed power generation with little coordination other than known voltage ranges allows a wide range of power generation cell types with different voltage levels and with no conversion losses no ACDC conversion and synchronization overheadThere are some constraints on the minimum battery pack cell count and the minimum solar power array cell count so that minimum voltage can be maintained without conversion but otherwise it should scale naturally from very small to essentially arbitrarily large installation sizes.Does this make more sense to you?,spacex,d4bn9rt,2,t5_2srow

7977904,0,t1_d4chgzp,Great work  much easier to analyse when stabalised.  Digitised off the screen using the camera clock for timing.  Conclusions as follows.  The stage was decelerating at close to G during the three engine burn.  The apparent length of the stage did not change at any point so it was not angled towards or away from the camera.  This makes sense as you want to place the support boat at right angles to the flight path as over or under shoot is much more likely than a track error..  Coffin corner for an aircraft is low and slow  for an F it is high and slow because there is no way to get down from there!  Specifically it was down to around  ms while still m off the ASDS and decelerating at .G  .  I could be wrong but I believe the flight controller recognised the problem and tried to side slip back and forward to lower altitude  that is deliberately vectored the thrust one way to get some angle on the booster and then over corrected the other way.  As far as I know the center engine can only gimbal about five degrees so you cannot get enough angle to reduce the acceleration below g.  You have to angle the whole stage to get about a twenty five degree thrust angle to the vertical.  .  The sideslip worked and it was on track to land vertically when the engine ran out of LOX after  seconds of single engine thrust  compared with about  seconds on previous successful landings.  As noted by others the black smoke starts before stage impact..  The key question is why it got high and slow?  Most likely the outside engines kept running for slightly longer than commanded  sticky valve?or the simulated propellant mass was too high so that the engine controller thought that more thrust was required in the last half second of three engine flight.  .  Another possibility is that the GPS height indication was inaccurate and for whatever reason the radio altimeter did not correct the error in time.  Note that the horizontal position of the stage and ASDS are set the same so any GPS errors are cancelled out.  This does not work in the vertical plane as the ASDS can only sit at sea level while the stage could be trying to land m higher up.  .  Under that scenario the end of year fix will be to add differential GPS to the stage so that the ASDS broadcasts its GPS measured height to the stage and any GPS height errors are corrected.,spacex,d4csimp,31,t5_2srow

Generating body lift in certain directions can actually have quite an impact on its final destination. Plus the reason why its so small deviation at the end is because of two reason. Mainly because the engine has to swing the bottom into final landing position and because of the insane amount of drag making the rocket straighten out. When the rocket hits the atmo horizontal velocity is quickly nullified but vertical speed is not because gravity is constantly pulling on the rocket. Thats why the rocket is almost vertical when it does its final burn.,spacex,d4ggido,1,t5_2srow

Handling of the cargo by port staff would be stevedoring andor terminal charges which are also separate categories.Wharfage for hazmat is usually x to x the NOS cargo rate so ton is a disproportionately high fee on that basis. However due to how extraordinarily light rocket stages are compared to pretty much everything else a port handles the appropriate tax would be comparable to what the vessel would be carrying under a normal load. The Marmac  barge has a cargo capacity of  short tons. At the NOS cargo rate and with the barge at only half of its capacity the wharfage charge would come to .

8260714,0,t3_4sdtip,Even more than in Los Angeles the problem with LEO space is There is no there there.You have to bring everything there to do something and then you have to take it all away to sell it. That makes it the realm of communications satellites spy satellites weather satellites and perhaps astronomy satellites looking outward since photons travel so cheaply. If you want to move atoms to LEO and back maybe big pharma can afford to do that on a regular basis but even big pharma is more interested in doing research in LEO then figuring out to duplicate their findings on the ground.Think about when you see a boat just sitting in coastal waters. There are about  possibilities. They are fishing. They are retrieving resources under the surface. Not analogous to LEO.. They are having a party. This is analogous to space tourism.. They are a research vessel doing research. Science is a rare activity but it does happen.. Vessel in distress. I hope we dont see this in LEO. Im not sure if Columbia counts.. Rendezvous. Could be a factory boat waiting for a fishing boat or drug smugglers or people smugglers or perhaps a drone ship waiting for a rocket to drop down out of the sky. The LEO analogy to this would be a captured asteroid or a processing spacecraft waiting for a captured asteroid or a refueling station for an MCT or an MCT waiting for a refueling supply flight. Maybe a space hotel for people waiting for a flight to the Moon or Mars or some other destination.In the short term this does not look very encouraging.

Even if each Skylon launches  times before needing refurbishment it will still end up costing a lot per kilogram.I just... I just dont see the point of SkylonP. I like SSTO but I feel like the way to do it is to ditch chemical fuels which are insufficiently energy dense for real star trek like SSTO vehicles and just concentrate on making small scale mobile fusion reactors.

8369473,0,t1_d5nk86v,I think Ive read all of your posts you link to above. I agree in part disagree in other parts. Allow me to briefly summarize some counter arguments.  Mars is hard to colonize but it is easier than anywhere else by almost all criteria and it is nd or rd easiest by all where it is not the easiest.  Atmospheric erosion is an issue but we could build an atmosphere that lasts for  million years by which time we will come up with another strategy. Dont underestimate the effects of progress over long time periods. Also and this is my preferred strategy we do not have to make Mars into a copy of Earth. Living under domes or underground and keeping Mars atmosphere thin has many advantages. If you like ONiell cylinders you should also like underground Mars habitats that use natural gravity instead of artificial gravity.  Ive talked with Caltech mission planners and my impression is that the economic possibilities of Mars are in the long run comparable or greater than the economic capabilities of Earth. In the shorter term there are many unknowns connected with captured asteroids but nothing else looks as good as Mars. The Moon has some very short term advantages but the lack of nitrogen on the Moon makes it limited much like orbital habitats.  Planetary Protection  I dont think anyone at rspaceX worried much about planetary protection until I brought this issue up. Calling it a barrier before we have studied the issue enough to make a definitive answer is sort of like saying We wont do Mars because it is too easy. It is the most hospitable place out there so we cannot go there. This ignores the strong possibility that there was once life on Mars but now there are only fossils. It also ignores the possibility of peaceful coexistence. So long as we do not do Earthlike terraforming Mars life is likely to ignore Earth life and Earth life is likely to ignore Mars life. Mars life will not come into our domes and Earth life will not live outside of our domes.  ONeill cylinders have the disadvantage that space is empty. You have to bring all materials to the colony. Earths gravity well is too deep. Better to bring materials from the Moon. But the Moon lacks nitrogen and other elements needed for life so you also have to capture asteroids. Two of the most convenient asteroids are the captured asteroids that are the moons of Mars Phobos and Deimos. Delivering materials from Deimos requires a good deal less delta V than delivering materials from the Moon so if you want ONeill cylinders your best bet is a base in Mars orbit. Since you are by then   of the way to Mars you might as well go to the surface as well.All of the above is horribly simplified. I glossed over the advantages of electromagnetic launchers on the Moon which after the initial investment could supply materials to ONeill cylinders for as little as a few dollars a ton cheaper than the cost of hauling land fill to Boca Chica Texas. Of course electromagnetic launchers can also be built on Phobos Deimos and on Mars itself making interplanetary travel much cheaper than the cost of launching materials from Earth into Earth orbit. The list of caveats goes on and on.,spacex,d5nqg33,7,t5_2srow

But what is most important noone expect Spain to lead new frontier I dont mean it as any dissing my country would be even further down that list just matter of facts. whole world changed so much that new frontier Mars will be leaded probably by entities that didnt exist during Columbus or were in position that nobody would expect them to do so.Maybe and I certainly hope so! SpaceX will be strong and healthy after half thousand years leading new frontier in interstellar or interdimensional travel. But its so far away that its hard to guess and if we have to guess its more probable that new frontier will be lead by some Mars AI nation or something else similary crazy.I expect that MCT will be so powerful that it will enable not only Mars colonization but also crewed exploration of inner solar system and established base on Mars should advance technology enough for exploration and after few centuries even colonization of outer solar system. I expect SpaceX to be part of this into some extend similar to how they are now part of ISS and launch commercial sats but their main goal is and will be Mars.,spacex,d67njmd,8,t5_2srow
8530000,0,t1_d67rsnu,How exactly MCT gets crewed is one of the questions Im eagerly awaiting the answer to in September. We can take a decent stab at it though.The MCTbased Mars architecture will be designed to scale massively and so the method of crewing that architecture in orbit must scale massively too. The era of scientific and exploration missions with a low body count wont last forever.As Ive outlined before there are three options.. Launch them all using MCT amp BFR. Right off the bat this isnt great because youre putting all your eggs in one basket  this necessitates an incredibly reliable launch vehicle and similarly massivereliable abort system. On the other hand When every BFR flight is lofting such an incredibly valuable payload its going to have to be incredibly reliable anyway. It also means that your crew is onboard during refueling ops. However that last point can be avoided by sending up crew in one MCT to dock with a second alreadyfueled MCT while the now unmanned and fuelless one sits waiting for refueling.This system is attractive because it scales perfectly with the Mars architecture in general.. Launch hundreds of people using SpaceXs existing crew spacecraft and manrated launch vehicle Crew Dragon amp Falcon . This works in terms of safety because its a proven vehicle  but not cost. Even assuming rapid and complete first stage reuse you need  flights at Crew Dragons max capacity of  people to crew a single MCT. If we use the  million quoted by Shotwell as our price per F launch we end up crewing one MCT for six hundred million dollars. This doesnt even take into account that during future transfer windows fleets of MCTs will be transiting at the same time.This system works perfectly for initial missions but as the crew count rises costs soar.. Use a new crew spacecraft with a higher passenger capacity which necessitates the development of an entirely new vehicle. This isnt cheap  Dragon  development has likely cost hundreds of millions. SpaceX will be hardpressed to make a profit on Mars trips in any case in the beginning at least and they could do without another RampD program. This system is awkward because its just a compromise between the two previous systems. You have the eggs in one basket problem of using MCT and the cost problem from using Crew Dragon.,spacex,d67tb6l,17,t5_2srow

8549363,0,t3_4wvgwu,You mentioned there might be a problem mounting four engines at the base of MCT while still providing enough space for an elevator to offload cargo. One possible solution to this conundrum is to have a detachable cargocrew section situated at the top of the MCT. This could be detached using the launch abort system allowing the entire section to be landed at a safe distance from the landinglaunch site. This section would be equipped with long duration life support hence could be reused as a Mars habitat.

8570330,0,t1_d6chfpg,The possibility of launching from Boca Chica was mentioned in talks with Texas politicians in context with the launch site there. It was not a firm commitment or announcement of a plan. It was just telling some politicians what they want to hear. That said launching from Boca Chica is what I too want to see. It is probably the best location in the continental USA. But there are a number of obstacles. One is the area is too close to a small number of homes in Boca Chica village. Already the Falcon Heavy is too loud for noise regulations and they hand out earplugs to the villagers and ask them to remain inside their houses during launch. The noise of a Rock concert is higher but an EIS goes by the rules and would not allow a BFR. That means they would have to remove those people which will face massive resistance. Something a government entitiy could force but probably not SpaceX. The other is the Texas law of open access to all beaches. That law had to be modified to make the launch site possible at all and it still comes with massive restrictions for SpaceX. The number of launches is restricted to  a year. But a Mars launch site would need beach access for months during a launch window and probably many times for other launches out of that window.The only possibility I see as feasible would be an offshore launch pad several km out at sea. Thats possible as the seabed is not too deep. But it is a massive project. Getting the necessary permissions and EIS plus building it will not be done in a few years. As I see it the  launch date is optimistic and will very likely not be met. But they have a plan that ideally could lead to that date and I dont think that is possible in Boca Chica. Going to Mars with people will require first flight in  for a test program. I dont think that is even theoretically possible at Boca Chica. The only site where I see it possible even theoretically is the Cape.Building there is not really a detour. They will want to be able to launch from Florida for NASA and the Air Force. They need a second launch site. Transport is not really a big obstacle. They can build their factory at Boca Chica and ship from there to the Cape. Transport may be expensive but it is a one off cost for a rocket that will fly many many times.,spacex,d6cvfig,1,t5_2srow
8571347,0,t3_4x4ef3,SpaceX doesnt leave Earth orbit with any considerable mass until it has this rocket and there is no way theyre building MCT without that experience so theres that.  Theres also the fact that continuing to issue sixmonth quasiNETs after seven consecutive delays  rather than just taking the project back to indefinite status  has unnecessarily damaged credibility on the subject.We can assume the reasons for the delays are valid but seven missed halfyear scheduling targets looks fatuous  it looks like for totally unknown reasons for just one particular project SpaceX is behaving like Virgin Galactic.  Nobody believes the announced timelines for this project anymore which muddies the waters on the credibility of other guesstimates.  It certainly does nothing to benefit its credibility among customers that have purchased flights on it.  If Elon announces a target year for human Mars flight when he releases his MCT architecture this September  assuming he actually does so given that he had earlier promised the information in early   it will be difficult to take seriously until the Bransoning of this program ends and the wait for Godot Heavy is finally over.,spacex,d6d00jt,21,t5_2srow

8576361,0,t3_4pv6ws,EDIT Just to show you how big of a difference it actually isSo after uwarp comment bellow I decided to see what would cause a  mile sorter landing spot via flightclub. There are  possible explanations.       Lower MECO velocity This makes the most sense. With a lower MECO velocity flight club points out about a  increase in S propellant  tons more propellant compered to other GTO landing attempts. This would mean higher chances of a successful S return andor less damage to the stage.    Higher S apogee Oddly enough it was hard to get a trajectory that would put S at Km. Here you see a apogee of Km which still doesnt bring it closer west towards the barge. The problem with this profile is it increases vertical velocity and reduces horizontal velocity. Which isnt very optimal for GTO launches.     P.S. I just modeled S trajectories. I didnt spend time on the second stage. Maybe ill update that later.,spacex,d6dmml3,6,t5_2srow

Even of one area on the planet becomes contaminated with earth life the most of the planet will still be unaffected. Furthermore I dont agree that the search for extraterrestrial life is more important then colonization. I can understand disagreeing on that point but its where I stand.

Amos is significantly heavier than JCSAT .t which Elon said was the fleet leader in terms of damage received. Amos will fly  kms further downrange.

8807062,0,t1_d76h4oz,Im not an expert either but I think it kind of goes to what the static fire test is for. I wouldnt say the static fire test is really looking for catastrophic failure events  this rocket did a fire test before it was brought FL I think I saw in another thread  its more for sussing out other failure modes that are less catastrophic. The point of a static fire test  from my understanding  is to run through most of the prelaunch sequence to see if any limits or alarms trigger that may be require some sort of corrective action before you get to day of launch. By finding those issues earlier than the day of launch you may have an opportunity to correct the issue and thus keep the launch schedule. Integrating the payload with the stack for the static fire also helps protect some launch schedule as integrating after the static fire would put that integration occurring much closer to launch and opening itself up to potential issues i.e. attaching the payload runs into problems that could thus push the launch out.SpX has an aggressive manifest schedule and to achieve the launch rate theyre looking for they need to have a pretty streamlined approach to prelaunch activities. I think its easy to play Monday morning QB on this after a failure and say why on Earth did you have the payload attach but SpX surely did some serious risk analysis weighing the risk of an integrated stack static fire failure vs. the schedule risk of putting the integration after the static fire test.  They concluded the failure risk was low enough to go the path they did.,spacex,d76hmih,14,t5_2srow

8895232,0,t1_d7gwjdb,gt Yes. They demonstrated recoverability not reusability. That difference seems pretty nonexistant to you.The difference obviously exists we are in dispute over how large that difference is in this specific case considering that the booster has not just been recovered but also reinspected retested and cleared for a launchI do not claim that recovering and also flying for a second time are exactly the same thing  they obviously are not.My claim is that recovering and reinspecting and clearing a booster for the second flight by SpaceX SES and their insurance company risking m on the launch without reflying even a single landed booster for a second time are in terms of risk assessment very close to the risks of also actually performing that second flight.Do you accept that thats my point? You are of course free to dispute it but please dont misconstrue my argument.gt BTW where you got that ? It sounds like made up number.Its not a made up number its the current average long term success rate of rockets launches  I used it as a conservative baseline for the mission success probability of a SpaceX launch.Thats a specific number you might want to dispute but fact is on August   SpaceX and SES committed to relaunching the landed booster without reflying any booster even a single time risking mm plus future business on that launch which suggests that they consider the probability of success of launching a space tested booster similarly high as they consider the probability of successfully launching a virgin booster.At this point unless your argument is that all  independent business entities have miscalculated horrendously in a hundreds of millions of dollars of fashion thats a fact. And once you accept that judgment of risk it follows from plain logic that the chance that the second flight would fail is less than  in SpaceXs SESs and the insurers judgment.I simply agree with their judgment and conclude that because the chance that the second flight would fail is less than  the chance that it would succeed is higher than . An equivalent way of saying the same is that reuse is here with a higher than  probability in SpaceXs SESs and their insurance companys judgment and FWIIW in my judgment as well.Can you point out any rational flaw in this chain of logic?,spacex,d7h2vvq,2,t5_2srow

Even if Phobos eventually sweeps clean its own orbit that process takes time and much of the debris will be swept into even more dangerous orbits around Mars.

8978405,0,t1_d7r0ota,gt I assume that the circles you show include allowance for gimballing and thus dont mean that the bells will be closer to one another than safety considerations allow.So heres my thinking about BFR engine placement Heres an excellent Raptor sl nozzle calculation done by uImpartialDerivatives which arrives to a nozzle diameter of .. I think thats slightly aggressively sized expansion ratio of  is much larger than the Merlins which I believe is around . Theres an efficiency tradeoff here I believe a larger sl nozzle is harder to cool and the exhaust of the Raptor is going to hotter as well  plus its a significant amount of dry mass. So my guess is that the expansion ratio is going to be about half of that around  which gives a sl Raptor nozzle diameter of about ..m. In terms of packing density heres the outline of engine placement on the Falcon  which is around  of nozzle diameter. Since the F already has a pretty aggressive packing of nozzles I assume that this is the minimum spacing or the Raptor as well. But note what a distance there is to the center engine  so I think the more numerous Raptors on the BFR will need not  but  separation. This results in a spacing of .m. If we plug .m and the rumored .m BFR diameter does uzlsa by chance have any fax machine that provides BFR sizes?  into a circle packing calculator then we get that the maximum count of engines under these assumptions is  which is fantastic even  engines would fit easily.BTW. the aerospike effect could strengthen to case to intentionally create a short nozzle for the BFR the aerospike effect in essence acts as a really long nozzle for  of the engines. This would allow the reduction of engine weight and complexity.But note that this is a lot of assumptions on top of assumptions and if any of them is wrong then the whole chain of arguments fails.

9007640,0,t1_d7ty2p2,Id be willing to be that for any craft up to  tons the extra fuel you have to expend on a nonoptimal profile will be more than made up by the slowing due to air resistance on the way down.  Since heating is superlinear Id expect youd always be able to shave off  kms or so even if you dont make any explicit provision in your design for dealing with reentry heating though you will have to worry about aerodynamics.   But more generally the reason every mission to Mars has dealt with fast atmospheric reentry even with all the extra complications that that entails is that in practice its much easiercheaper to deal with the extra complexity than to increase the mass ratio to the extent that you could do a slow reentry or land on an equivalent airless Mars.

Add in a team for failure analysis bureaucracy to manage that satellite reorder and launch ops liaisons for the launch campaign probably among others I havent thought of  and those are only hard costs.

But then SpaceX the hardcharging company founded by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk sued the Air Force for the right to compete saying it could save taxpayers millions of dollars. The parties settled and last year the Air Force granted SpaceX the certification to compete saying it had met its rigorous technical standards.Ugh I dislike this narrative.  Its frequently used.  Yes ULA had a monopoly.  Yes SpaceX sued the Air Force for the right to compete for a specific portion of the total launches and yes they were certified after the lawsuit was settled.  But the way it is strung together makes it sound as if the USAF wouldnt let SpaceX compete for any launches they sued settled and the USAF certified them and let them compete as a result of the settlement.gtAnd he hinted that the fight may not be over saying ULAs concerns could conceivably be litigated in a courtroom.I hope they dont.

SpaceX has... a lot of schedule slips ULA are a lot more confident of sticking to their projections.The calculations should factor this into account. At the moment for GPSIII the somewhat handwaving dismissal of its nice to have not national security critical assumes this isnt a factor. The reality is more complex since every delay has an opportunity cost of some kind.

9045250,0,t1_d7z3068,gt What are the downsides to braiding? Insane cost is the chief barrier I presume.I can think of several complications Such fabric is the strongest if there are no interruptions  a single weave creates one layer over the bottle. But if its carbon fiber filament tow based i.e. its a very finely braided fabric for maximum strength then you need a lot of tows in a huge machine. Check this video  that creates a comparatively tiny pipebeam and still how many tows are used! Plus I think the bottom and the top would be particularly tricky you dont want any sharp edges i.e. you want a smooth curve because edges in pressure vessels are weak spots. But to have a smoothly curving braided structure is nontrivial as the volume gradually decreases. So youd first have to introduce tows and then stop them on the way out to create the exact curve you need. Its much easier with tape winding because there you just work in a single dimension in essence and repeat it in many many layers.But this is all just a guess maybe the nature of the failure is that they dont have to switch processes and can stay with tape wound bottles.,spacex,d7z3eq4,24,t5_2srow

9127424,0,t1_d88gg7p,I have a background in nuclear engineering and radiobiology how radiation affects organic tissues so I can input! You are correct. An inflatable hab will do better radiation wise than a thin metal wall because of Bremsstrahlung radiation. Elon is right. With the exception of solar flairs and coronal mass ejections radiation dosage should be an after thought in any large spacecraft design. In my opinion you shouldnt bother with any sole purpose shielding on a craft at all just the sensitive bits like computers and people. Incorporating high density boron doped plastic plating into the crews clothing is a much better utilization of mass compared to shielding entire spacecraft. Also once you get that far away from the sun there really isnt that much to worry about anyways. The distance plus this effect means dosage levels just tail off into insignificance. Something most people do not know is a naked neutron is not stable and has a half life of  minutes decaying into a proton which is much less dangerous. Mars at its closest approach to the sun is . light minutes away. So if a population of high energy neutrons are created on the surface of the sun by the time they reach mars they will have gone through at least . halflifes of decay. ,spacex,d88yuki,18,t5_2srow

Consider that Jeff Bezos is now the rd wealthiest person on the planet and is sharply ramping up his investment into Blue Origin.  Blue may not seem to have accomplished much on the orbital front but theyve now been around for  years and have had great success on their projects.His New Glenn rocket should be easily able to act as the governments assured access provider and will likely be flying by .  It like Falcon should be a fraction of the price of ULAs rockets.  Even if Blue werent getting into the government launch business SpaceX has pulled most of the margins out of the business.

It will be impossible for ULA to win a bidding war in which both SpaceX and Blue Origin are competing even as a secondary assured access provider even with their Vulcan rocket.

Both for you and myself. gtAn all electric system might be nice but those legs are huge and a critical point of failure for the whole mission.  I dont know much about systems at that scale.  Fair statement. gtThey also can not be designed with a lock out system like Falcon  because they need to retract during Mars lift off as well.  Each of those three legs has to hold a huge amount of weight never fail hold for long periods of time on Mars and be retractable.  The falcon system is ultra simple and its a one way lock. But no reason they couldnt unlock the latch to allow it to close. Once the latch is unweighted it should be fairly easy to unlock it and then retract the legs. Some sort of air system does have its advantages through in that it would act like a shock absorber. However that would make the system more complex and reliant on air seals for function.  I suspect that they might stay with the honeycomb crush shock absorber as a backup and possibly an air shock as the primary. I figure there will be some sort of physical connection to take the landing weight. But who knows. Edit an airgas system would also in theory allow the legs to better adjust to an unlevel landing so there is that bonus as well. ,spacex,d8ad9rw,1,t5_2srow

Most US boosters have  Atlas Delta Med New Shepard or  Antares The other point is how could someone buying Spacex engines build and operate a rocket that could compete on priceschedule with Spacex? Spacex gets the engines at cost while the competitor would get them at retail and spacex would probably get first dibs if engines became the schedule limitation.ULA is kinda a special case in buying the BE from its competitor Blue Origin  I think its been forced to change engines by the Government ? but doesnt really have an RampD department or the time to develop their own as it primarily sells legacy Boeing and Lockheed technology.,spacex,d8cm6x6,8,t5_2srow

9162400,0,t1_d8dctmw,gt If the habitats on Mars werent touching the ground through which heat is also exchanged would this  pascals of pressure be enough that no radiator would be needed?The effectiveness of transferring waste heat to the air is affected by the heat capacity of the air the temperature difference and the flow rate. The heat capacity of the air will be much less than that of the air on Earth due to the low pressure and therefore the low density which would make air cooling harder than on Earth. At most times and places on Mars the temperature difference between the thing you want to cool habitat machinery radiator surface etc. and the air will be much greater than on Earth which will usually make air cooling easier than on Earth. Air flow can be active pumpsfansturbines or passive wind or convective currents. For active air transport for cooling the trick is to get enough airflow without using too much energy or heating the air too much. It is likely that optimal designs will be very different on Mars than on Earth does anyone have references?.The Curiosity Rover on Mars has a cooling system called the Heat Rejection System HRS which pumps a fluid through tubes throughout the rover to warm components and also to get rid of excess heat if there is any. The ultimate heat loss must be some combination of radiation and convection but in the absence of dedicated thermal infrared radiators it appears that a large part is heat loss to the air  providing evidence that air cooling can work on Mars though with optimum designs different from air cooling systems on Earth.,spacex,d8degf3,3,t5_2srow

So really I think thats more or less a solved problem. You could do it in a more mass efficient ways but its not a fundamentally new technology keeping people alive in space. I would say thats fairly straightforward. The challenge really is getting there and the huge challenge is getting  is making it something that the cost is such that enough people can go to make it a self sustaining civilisation. Thats the fundamental challenge....gt Well I mean the interplanetary transit time is pretty straightforward it just depends on your departure velocity from Earth. The synchronization event only occurs every  months. So every  months theres approximately a  month window where you can do a Mars transit. Which kinda makes sense because Mars has takes  . months to go around the Sun and you can basically transit to Mars when youre in the right quadrant. You cant go when its on the other side of the Sun. And the faster you exit Earth the quicker you can got to Mars. So the low energy ... transit to Mars would be  to  months that would be dV of .kms departure velocity at kms you can drop that down to so roughly  months and over time I expect that number will come down to perhaps under a month although the amount of energy you need to do that and to then obviously high energy aerobraking is substantial so I  any service to Mars  quite energy intensive....gt I cant comment on public company  because you know the consequences of that would be quite severe.  at some point in the future not immediately the reason that Im accumulating personal assets is in order to fund humanity becoming a multiplanetary species. Theres some other things that Im funding as well  healthcare environmental issues and education but um I mean AI safety but really the primary thing the thing that will absorb almost all our resources is the establishment of a self sustaining civilization on Mars. I have no reason to accumulate resources beyond that....gt  I think when we get closer to actually sending people to Mars then well try to get some sense of what the demand level is and you know people could perhaps put down a small downpayment on a trip to Mars but we want to get pretty close to the actual trips and be highly confident that we can meet the cost targets within a reasonable timeframe before we would do that certainly maybe two or three years before an expected launch date....gt On orbit refueling is essentially its about having two spacecraft ahem dock mate and exchange fluids theres certainly a joke in there somewhere. But we already docked with the space station well technically its called berthing but it will be... a fully autonomous docking capability around the end of next year. So having a fully autonomous docking capability basically gives you onorbit refueling. When I say refueling... I use the word refilling because technically theres  and a half times as much oxygen as there is fuel  the oxygen to fuel ratio is .  so its really reoxiding sic rather than refueling thats actually what it amounts to. Actually I think thats going to be a relatively straightforward element if we can dock with the space station which is a very complex docking manoeuvre the NASA requirements are quite severe for space docking then having two spacecraft dock in orbit is not too much of a problem....gt Stuff that I cant control? Well I guess theres always space and fortune. Really the pace of progress on Mars depends on the pace of progress of SpaceX to what degree do we achieve a good launch rate. Our success rate with Falcon  is roughly  its not out of family with some other launch vehicles but it needs to be a lot better. And we the Falcon Heavy the launch timeline Dragon  and make sure that we manage the company such that weve got sufficient ... cashflow to fund Mars programs and of course I will supplement that ... personally. And I think there may be other individuals who are willing to do that. And conceivably at some point in there future there may be a  well I have no  idea if there will be but there might be a NASA COTS programme or something like that. necessary really this is ultimately about maximising probability that the future is good and minimising existential risk so I think whatever means increases that probability is good. So I dont see any fundamental technical obstacles to what weve proposed  a lot of hard engineering though...gt Q I believe you gave that you have to have Billion and I was wondering what that exactly includes does that include the Mars port? And could you describe what sort of public private partnerships youre envisioning to help pay for it or are you hoping for a NASA contract?gt Um yeah when I founded SpaceX I had no expectation of any government contracts I founded SpaceX with entirely my own money out of Million from the sale of PayPal to Ebay of which Million went into SpaceX Million went to ... Tesla Million to SolarCity so everything actually. But uh and like I said I expected the most likely outcome was failure. Although I should say originally I thought I would only spend Million on SpaceX and got to have Million left over but then I couldnt let my baby die so I put it all in. You know sometimes SpaceX particularly a criticism is that somehow Im after government money by you know various arseholes out there. I couldnt care less really so NASA is our most significant customer we do about a quarter of our launches but  of our launches are commercial. In the future there may be a NASA contract there may not be I dont know. If there is thats a good thing. If theres not probably its not a good thing because there are larger issues at stake  here are we humans gonna become a multiplanetary species or not? Not pedestrian questions of is it public or private? or what the percentage is. These are small and tawdry questions.gt Really we wanna use Dragon Dragon  as a pathfinder if its anything to go by. We need to sort out interplanetary navigation deep space communication at high bandwidth uh theres currently no highbandwidth deepspace communication system and then entering the Mars atmosphere and landing Whats landing like if youre heavy  I mean Dragon will be about  times heavier than anything thats landed on Mars before and it will land with thrusters close to the surface. So with Curiosity they really were concerned about having thrusters close to the surface which is why they used this sort of hovering thing theres just no way to do that with a giant Spaceship. One of the key question is if youre coming in hot and fast then you dig a big hole in the ground. What kind of dust and rocks do you throw up? The Mars permafrost is pretty hard but how well does it hold up to rocket blasts? These are all tough questions. I wouldnt give the first Dragon landing on Mars high odds maybe  maybe . The history of landing on Mars is not a good one actually for those familiar with Mars. For a first timer Id say its pretty good. If we have a  likelihood Id say thats pretty good. Were just  all the issues sending them on every opportunity maybe sending two in  and then also we wanna find out whats the easiest way to get water  because waters useful for doing the local propellant production. Carbon dioxide is easy its in the atmosphere. So were looking to make sure the dust filters you can clean the dust filters but getting the CO should be easy. Getting the water is much harder.

9312618,0,t1_d8wf7ye,That could be worse Whatever gas you had in the tank would condense and freeze onto and into the tanks construction.Better might be to delay until the tanks are completely immersed so heat from the LOX can flow into the CPOV preventing it from reaching the freezing point.My hypothetical method would be to avoid the problem entirely by not compressing the helium in the tank. Fill the tank with a boiling liquid like maybe nitrogen then pressurize the liquid which as a liquid wont compress by much so wont heat up compress your helium and bring to the correct temperature outside the rocket in heavy steel pipes and pressure vessels then replace the highpressure liquid with highpressure helium. Youve just filled your tanks with a single controlled temperature and pressure swing.By the way its worth playing with those graphs at  .

Also its more of a laboratory environment than a relevant environment. A relevant environment implies it is on the rocket and not on test equipment.The truth is that we could argue TRL levels all day. The value in them is seeing how much work is left in a component or subsystem. For the raptor engines there is a lot of work to be done. They barely fired the engine.

Looking at the P etc trusses on the ISS those weigh almost  tonnes each and provide kW or so of power  and are fixed.What is the power density of the arrays on ITS that you can fit them without taking up a significant portion of the dry mass.And as a followup question which is OK if you dont want to answer do you foresee the use of such Solar PV technology on earth. Assuming it is a high power density technology.One last question. I presume that the solar panels will provide power for the life support and communication systems enroute to Mars. Will it provide power for anything else? Like an ion drive?Additionally can the panels continue to be used on the Martian surface. If so canwill they power part of a fuel production plant or is its job relegated to onship duties only.Thanks!

As others have pointed out the Argon will not bother anything and the temperature isnt anywhere near high enough to initiate the Haber process. Any other components will be so small that they are likely to be trivial oxygen carbon monoxide water.Im mostly thinking of going small scale on these projects  for two reasons. First I want to be able to sell to individual colonists not set up giant petrochemical plants. That means I have to think about things like How much methane can I make with a  kW power source. or How much polyethylene can I make with a  kW power source. etc. Its pretty small. Certainly much smaller than any scale that will require a turbine. Im imagining things comparable in size to D printers or microwaves in terms of power use and footprint.Additionally all of the components need to be able to be made or repaired on site if this is to be sustainable Im making exceptions for electronics. That means for example being able to produce pressure vessels and such using components we can produce on site. Part of the reason I want polyethylene early is that it is a versatile thermoplastic which can be used in making tools provided the heat stays low. I can even make pressure vessels with it but almost certainly not to . MPa  not without figuring out UHMWPE. Anyway the brainstorming continues. Lots of math in my future D,spacex,d99a43u,1,t5_2srow

9546233,0,t1_d9ppzir,gt true however scaling a rocket does not mean making it shorter you would have to reduce diameter which would requires all new tooling. Which goes back to the original issue of the tooling being extremely expensive. I countered your argument of tooling being extremely expensive with the fact that they have built a full diameter LOX tank and it obviously was not extremely expensive. They have not started spending very large amounts of money on ITS despite the fact they are in advanced development of Raptor and have built a full diameter LOX tank.

We think it would make sense to increase the commercial crew budget for next quarter to play catchup on our ISS deliveries. The alternative is to keep the budget roughly flat and just achieve this years science objectives  months later. Can you plug these numbers into the rhigerously rational costbenefit analysis equations you use to make all your policy decisions and see what the best course of action is? The figures are in the attached spreadsheet. Thanks!There would be no need to pad budgets if the goals of the politicians were actually coherent and in line with what they instructed NASA to do. However this seems to me to be obviously false so Im left confused as to why economists appear to disagree with my impression.Maybe Im reading way too much into the  figure.

The same equipment can be used to dope the pure silicon for further use.   While I agree that monocrystalline silicon is a tall order for an early lunar facility thinfilm PV is definitely achievable with much simpler equipment. The most basic setup would just be a clean vacuum chamber and a heater for PVD depositing thinfilm amorphous Si on metal plates. Preferably this would be done as CVD so substrates like mylar can be used instead although that requires some more complex chemistry.   That said with cargo capacities such as the ITS will provide there is little reason to set up a PV factory until you can produce substrate as well. Lunar insitu boPET is a very complex target. Nickeliron plates would be manageable I suppose but the payoff from industrial mass to Lunar surface is probably going to be highest for propellant extraction. There is no absolute requirement for a PV factory on the surface in order to do profitable ISRU propellant and rad shielding.,spacex,da01pl7,1,t5_2srow

10328501,1,t3_5ntled,TLDR Good employee sees problem and loses confidence in company. Problem is handled but not the way employee wants. Employee becomes disgruntled and gets fired. This in my opinion is the most likely explanation. I expect SpaceX to handle and dissolve the accusations without too much trouble.We the little people are so quick to point the finger at the  big and potentially evil organizations. We love to stick it to the man. The man is often completely messed up and terrible and when that happens it gets all of the attention. But just like plane crashes its not actually the common case. Every organization is far from perfect but most are good enough to get along just fine and do a pretty good job.  Organizations with strong leaders and vision tend to do a pretty great job. Which one is SpaceX? Look the bigger picture and everything you already know about the company instead of being tossed around by a single employee.Its worth considering that maybe this guy didnt go about things in totally the best way at SpaceX. He seems to have been a good employee for  years but something obviously changed. Did SpaceX suddenly stop caring about safety?Lets say there was a problem there is a right and a wrong way to handle it. Right way is to respectfully voice it to your boss. If there is concern about the boss then work your way up the chain. Respectfully. This guy allegedly got to the top with his concerns so thats fine. But the wrong way to do it is when youre not respectful to your superiors. When you are vocal and disrupt all your fellow employees when you sow distrust and disunity in the company. When you dont work as hard cuz youre stuck on some issue that all your superiors are already aware of. I would fire that guy every time. People like that are not good for any group or organization.If the top boss is reasonable they will deal with the issue correctly. If the top boss isnt you can get a rd party involved but the company is in big trouble at that point anyways and they should get in trouble for malpractice.I find it much more likely that a single employee had issues vs a significant chunk of leadership of the company. It happens sure but just not nearly as much.Its very likely that when Shotwell got wind of the employees concerns that she assessed the situation herself and found that further review was unnecessary. Then the employee becoming disgruntled lost heart and quit working the way he used to. Maybe he caused other employees to become disgruntled. This kind of thing can be a disease to all the positive things of an organization. Again there are terrible organizations that do terrible things from the top but I find that very unlikely in this case.Consider that SpaceX is EXTREMELY motivated to ensure safety in every aspect  because if they do not they FAIL. They almost never got off the ground because of reliability issues having  rockets fail and barely scrummaging up the resources for a th that succeeded allowing them to survive by the skin of their teeth. Every mistake has a VERY high cost to SpaceX in many many ways. Would this company really ignore valid safety concerns?Im glad Shotwell got pulled for a  hour deposition. She will certainly be the best source of clarity of the entire situation and what happened including the views of everyone involved and how the problem was resolved if any.Nothing more than speculation at this point so hopefully we will find out the truth once we get to hear both sides and have a little investigation.,spacex,dcesknr,-3,t5_2srow

10353253,0,t1_dcezami,So would you say the issue is basically the famous question from Paul MacCready?gtThe problem is he said that we dont understand the problem.There was a challenge to fly across the english channel with human powered flight.  Teams were taking up to a year to build an aircraft based on theory and then watching it fail when tested. They would then spend another year making a nd model and another with a rd an so on until they gave up.MacCready won the challenge by creating an aircraft he could buildrepair within a few hours instead of months.  This meant you could have many flights in a short period of time and make adjustments after each flight.gtThe rebuild retest relearn cycle went from months and years to hours and days.It seems strange anyone is adverse to spacex having quick iterations.  The worst that could happen is a lost payload.  Explosions on the pad dont risk human life.  It is only money at risk and spacex is free to risk it.Human launches that eventually happen will have more stringent standards if needed and they will benefit greatly from all the launches spacex did before they built that rocket for a human launch.I also hope your buddies didnt work for boeing ula or lockheed.

10388749,0,t1_dclmdvp,gt is there also another advantage?No that is it.  In fact it has a downside because you are at higher speed at a given height in the atmosphere so your drag losses are higher.  The truism for rocket design is that if you have more thrust then you add more propellant so that the rocket just staggers off the pad.  That way you get more performance than with less propellant but lower gravity losses.  In the case of F they have already stretched the height as far as possible and the diameter is fixed by transport requirements so they can use the higher thrust to lower gravity losses.,spacex,dclmoi8,8,t5_2srow

With the correct upper stages you could handle in one launch what the Falcon family can currently handle in three months.A variant with a layout optimized for the task would be helpful but not strictly necessary.

With  engines though the possibility of failure is much higher than with  or even .

However just because I do believe that they have or are making a fairing adapter for DRD I do not believe that any manned Ds will be launched inside a fairing though. It would essentially eliminate the ability to abort.  I think they will do a test run around the moon to test communication trajectories amd the heat shield with an unmanned capsule.

Arguably the price didnt cover a third share of the soyuz launch aka their seat since the price included training space adventures cut etc. and the Russians charged Nasa much more per seat. ,spacex,deor6tk,2,t5_2srow

The suits probably have a slimmer umbilical connection that I would bet was not installed for the tests depicted. EditI think I found what looks to be that little hose attached to the big duct in the back of the capsuleIt looks like a hose made by a company called Technifab out of a material called Zotefoam.  There are a bunch of articles online too many to link here about it being something originally developed for the Boeing .

If you speed up you raise your orbit and slow down your orbital period. If you slow down you lower your orbit and raise your orbital period.

11227025,0,t1_df4jmua,It is to make the plane change easier. The further out you go the slower your speed is so the easier it is to change your direction. Of course you then have to spend more propellant slowing down at the low part of your orbit to reduce your apogee  but here you have a high speed and the oberth effect makes this more efficient.

So the compromise was  launchesyear is minimal disruption to beach use.gtwhy bother with SLC and SLCA?Allowed to launch more frequently from there but have to work around others weather other launchers etc schedules.

11389512,0,t1_dfmxy4v,What thrusters does a faring have?  There might be some compressed CO thrusters for trim during reentry but they are extremely small even I might dare say are hobbyist scale thrusters and not that big of a deal.  The major supporting structure is the parachutes and a couple of cameras that are basically semimodified GoPro cameras.  Any batteries on board are something like a half dozen AA sized cell batteries on a  volt circuit.The point of a faring is to be a protective shell to keep the lower atmosphere during the first part of the flight before MaxQ from ripping apart a payload.  That is when it goes through its most stress and indeed is far worse than entry after MECO.  Again almost all of that can be dunked into sea water and survive just fine.  We arent talking fancy fine tuned rocket engines here that make up half of the cost of the rocket like the Merlin engines on the lower stage or concerns about damaging the million dollar rocket bell when it hits the water.,spacex,dfmzdnt,2,t5_2srow

11430964,0,t1_dfrmtb5,I agree that this does show how much the team at Boeing that designed the Delta IV Heavy deserves our respect. The magnitude of the engineering problem can be summed up by the fact that the Delta IV first stage has a perfect track record nothing even close to a failure EXCEPT the first Heavy flight where the boosters cut off early due to some fairly arcane failure mode caused by conditions only experienced when flying in the Heavy configuration.I have a feeling that the Falcon Heavy may be still a bit harder than the Delta IV Heavy because there are more engines and because SpaceX is trying to recover the boosters. For the Delta IV they only have to care about getting the boosters away from the core without damaging the core not maintaining control of the boosters as they separate.,spacex,dfrors9,9,t5_2srow

11462164,0,t1_dfv65jm,Likely need to save a fair amount of fuel to bring the center core back even to the drone ship. I dont know exactly what the flight profile will be but I imagine the center core will be much more energetic at time of MECO than an equivalent F core due to the velocity imparted by the side boosters and the fuel saved by throttling down the second core for a substantial portion of the flight. Turning something around or at least reentering something moving at what could be a decent percentage of orbital velocity is going to cost a lot of fuel and that costs payload. ,spacex,dfv89cf,3,t5_2srow

11497961,0,t1_dfyqbiv,I had the same thought but if you have a lot of customers wanting a launch and can do two in rapid succession this a huge win  for customer service. And it also has to do with proving that it can he done. If spacex lands a rocket and then says this one is good we can turn around and fly it tomorrow nobody will really believe that if they dont actually then do it at least once or twice. If they could do a fully reusable rocket including second stage with light payload and recover the whole thing in  hours and relaunch it imagine what that does for someone like Iridium. Launch  or  birds at once instead of  and then turn around and launch the next set a day later. Less risk of losing all birds in one flight less cost because the rocket is totally reused. With  hour reuse of  of the rocket they could lower the launch costs by at least  I bet. Elon thinks they can get to  eventually.

11719803,0,t1_dglevpg,gt And Im confident much of the remaining human control can happen from Earth like with the current rovers.Im not sure if you realize how slow and inefficient the current process is. The mostadvanced rover placed on Mars so far is Curiosity. It has been on the surface for almost  years now and has only covered just under  miles in that time. Thats just . mh . kmh. For reference average walking speed is  kmh. Thats . thousand times faster.Remote control from Earth is only really practical if no one on the planet can do it.,spacex,dgogv6l,1,t5_2srow
11719951,0,t1_dgoeztq,My guess based on general aerodynamic knowledge is that the new fins will be longer and thinner about the same mass and perhaps tapered a bit toward the tips. That should give greater control authority with the same hydraulics. Hypersonic and supersonic drag should be about the same and subsonic drag should be a bit less.,spacex,dgohgvk,9,t5_2srow
11727222,0,t1_dgp5mi7,The risk of the occasional died before it could do a controlled descent satellite running into something during its fail safe tetherdeorbit is pretty low.  You plan for deorbiting umder power but have a simple system system that can deorbit a dead sat by milking the earths magnetic field through an electrodynamic tether and expending the current somewhere.,spacex,dgpb7ma,4,t5_2srow
11729816,0,t1_dgpkm4p,Thanks for replyingI wasnt thinking about short term very much as of now theres very few satellites with the very high entrance cost.

11740505,0,t1_dgqrzb3,gt Why are they dismantling it instead of just leaving it there?For something thats attached to an active worksite abandon in place doesnt work.  You have a continuing inspection and repair cost to ensure that it or parts of it wont fall on the heads of people working there.  The more stuff out there thats not required for operations the more money and hassle is involved.  Presumably SpaceX decided that they expect the work going into dismantling it will pay off within the expected duration of their lease of the pad.  Its even possible that the presence of the RSS would directly interfere with their long term plans related to the BFRMCT.  The Guadalajara video showed that they plan to pursue Rapid turnaround and whether or not the end padproduct matches the concept video its easy to imagine that pussyfooting around hundreds of tons of saltladen rusting steel could affect those efforts.,spacex,dgqte2u,17,t5_2srow
11753810,0,t1_dgrsij4,I wonder if it would be impossible to do a static fire of the cryogenic firststage of the Ariane  while the solid boosters are attached. Maybe there is some risk of the exhaust from the liquid booster igniting the solid ones or something like that. If they have to separate the boosters from the center stage I wonder if it would represent a lot of added cost and overhead above and beyond what a single stick like Falcon  would have to go through.,spacex,dgsbo34,1,t5_2srow

11804826,0,t3_68bn8y,It really bothers me how often launches are scrubbed in the final minutes. And it seems like there things that shouldve come up in the static fire but dont. Is there a chance that they proceed with the count during the static fire if there is a little glitch like this since they know the rocket isnt launching? Wasnt this sensor not exactly off but it was just a little higher than normal? ,spacex,dgy4966,11,t5_2srow
