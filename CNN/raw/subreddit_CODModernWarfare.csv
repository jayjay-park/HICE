9983026,0,t1_db824ij,I agree. Spawns are terrible and in that cases I wouldnt mind them literally copy and pasting the spawn points from the original. The server issue is  going to take time. I can only assume they want to but as Raven arent a godtier company like Activision in terms of finance they most likely couldnt afford to spend that money on better servers as theyre not getting any help from Activision in terms of funding for the creation of the game. But again thats just what Ive read.Old mate Amos is always on this subreddit and listening to the community seemingly doing his best to respond to the community outburst of multiple issues and the changes that he and his team can do within the time I believe they have done. Theres no doubt he has a huge list of things to do that people are complaining but its not as easy as saying yeah people dont like this so well change it straight away.Maybe they are working on the bigger issues we just havent heard because theyre not entitled or obliged to disclose everything theyre working on. The fact that they do tell us about these fixes theyre doing is a big  as most other games just release the patch without telling anyone.

9993237,0,t3_5io8t1,gtPlayers are ruining this game not ActivisionHmm... hz servers causing instant deaths... pathetic spawning algorithm... neutral objective notifications... Nope Definitely ActivisionRaven ruining the game.  ampnbsp  Maybe if the spawns actually made any fucking sense or were true to the original people would actually fight for B flag to set upget out of a spawn trap. With the spawns the way they are now from someone kill whorings perspective there is very little benefit to actually having  flags capped and on the other side little downside to only having  flag. If not having B flag meant you were going to be killed over and over in your spawn like it did on most maps like Bog which everyone likes to complain about specifically people would have a reason to give a shit about taking objectives.  ampnbsp  Not only that but they doubled the XP for kills in domination and with match bonuses not scaling with level the match bonuses are almost entirely negligible. There is no incentive to win objective based games anymore. If you can get  more kills by playing like a bitch and losing youll still get more XP than had you won.  ampnbsp  Its not the players ruining the game. The game is broken as fuck there is nothing there for the players to ruin until a long laundry list of issues are resolved.,CODModernWarfare,dba5al3,1,t5_3gweh

As well pp does have its use in low traffic areas where there are few players and no data centers but this isnt the case in countries like the US and Europe.The pp connections should improve if they crank up the receive rate on these types of connections.

Because you have said that a couple times now and Im not apathetic in the slightest.Youre projecting really hard and its adorable. Youre clearly apathetic when it comes to Activision making changes to MWR. See belowgtbut you need to stop being so closed minded about inevitable changes to the gamegtyouve known the changes were imminent at some point so you acting like its big news to you three months post launch is just you being ignorant.gtNow I literally said  perk twos and and  perk threes that are usable on a regular basis so why are you listing that exact number of perks to me?I misread this as two to three perks. I didnt catch that you specified two to three perks from those perk slots my bad. gtbut you went ahead and listed them anyway because youre clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed.The sign of a flimsy argument is when it starts to rely on gradeschool level insults. gtdid I say that?? No. You talk about putting words in your mouth and then literally your entire last reply is putting words into mine.This entire comment chain is you advocating for changing the remaster into a remake and you provided your reasons as to why mainly this game becing  years old...gtLol and its closed minded fucks like you that make trying to have a conversation on the internet impossible because you think youre smarter than everyone.Lmfao what? Source? gtYes Ill agree marketing as a remaster and changing the game is a terrible business practice but did anyone really expect Activision of all people to not add in supply drops?Cosmetic additions via supply drops are one thing but when a game is marketed branded and sold as a remaster the onus is not on the consumer to know that well hey its Activision theyre probably going to lie to us and completely do a . gtYoure oblivious to the world you live in if you think that any large business would not snatch an opportunity to make millions more in revenue.Yeah screw me for buying a came call Modern Warfare Remastered and having the audacity to think it might actually be a remaster even though the word remaster is right there on the box...gtWould you like to tell me how making millions more for your company is bad business practice? Id love to hear.Are you really asking me why lying to your consumers is a bad thing? gtThey dont give a fuck about your opinion and really I dont either so I dont even know why Im still replying to you at this point.People who find themselves in a hole often find it hard to stop digging...gtYou literally just take quotes and then either use them out of context or try to rip it apart because thats what condescending internet tough guys love to do.Translation I respond to what you say you dont like the responses and then you get upset. ,CODModernWarfare,ddfcw13,1,t5_3gweh

Now I didnt realize Raw has minimal time played on the game but I can tell you there are dozens of other games that are better than IW and MWR Battlefield  Titanfall  Rainbow Six Siege Grand Theft Auto  Pac Man Championship Edition Rocket League While I dont like it and its an ATVI game Overwatch Doom WatchDogs  The Witcher  Fallout  Rise of the Tomb Raider Just Cause  Minecraft Dying Light Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare Far Cry  Sniper Elite  I Am Bread Octodad Dadliest Catch Pinball FX  Superhot Battlefield  Battlefield Hardline The Division Tom Clancys WildlandsOr alternatively go to this website and choose whatever game you want.

Such as  kills with a suppressor to unlock a heartbeat sensor.The current perks should be expanded to counter the new attachments. Dead Silence turns into Ninja which tacks on the ability to avert heartbeat sensors.

This is pure irony. gtHeres how I know everything you say is bullshit? The BO FAL wasnt banned from competitive? Oh really? Thats funny I just found this lmfao you posted the rules to the spring online qualifier. Go grab the settings for an actual event the last event played for example and oh look at that no FAL ban...gtAlso the M can one burst across the map with stopping power which takes three bullets but its at a higher fire rate within the burst. But then I did some digging and the minimum damage of the FAL is . Now correct my math if Im wrong but     . That doesnt quite seem like enough damage to kill someone. But then I thought well maybe the damage drop off is so non existent that its effectively always a two shot kill. But no the damage of the FAL drops off to  at m. So lets try this out     . Still not quite a . Hmmm I wonder where you get the notion of  shotting people across the map because m isnt what I would describe as across the map.You do realize the posted damage stats arent accurate to how weapons behave in game right? I mean surely you dont believe that when its been common knowledge that they arent applicable for like the past decade... Also the FAL stats you posted are most likely post nerf. Remember the thing you said never happened but did twice. So youre posting the stats after two separate nerfs which isnt even applicable as the posted damage values have literally never been applicable to how the weapons perform in game.gtHow funny that you would mention that.I like how you posted a wall of bullshit then when I pick it apart and show how absolutely idiotic you are you just ignore  of it.

11181640,0,t1_dezf1ql,I said missing DLC not missing games.  No shit that collections dont have handheld games in them. Borderlands  was a different engine than BL and PreSequel which is why its only available via backward compatibility on Xbox and not remastered.    Arkham Origins was a different developer than Asylum and City so of course it wasnt included. God of War  came out AFTER the God of War collection on PSBut the point stands.  Charging for  year old DLC is bullshit and thankfully most people agree and arent blind CoD fanboys who will buy whatever shit theyre shoveling.,CODModernWarfare,dezfcr7,9,t5_3gweh

If you feel wronged please bother Activision and waste their time or ask for a refund based on false advertising.Edit My reply isnt really directed at you Flumix.
