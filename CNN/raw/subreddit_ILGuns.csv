3468195,0,t1_cpniqr2,Huh...how about that. Yeah see I was totally wrong. I could have sworn that all bans were lifted...but they may have gotten around  that with the convenient   July  deadline...either way Chicago has a bunch of stupid gun laws on par with other freedom hating states...,ILGuns,cpnlkz6,3,t5_353el
3685182,0,t3_32d9yw,Just took the CCL class this last weekend.   The video we watched and the instructor both though this was a subject of interpretation and currently in limbo.  The way the law is written it sounds like a non compliant sign is not enforceable.  But it is very vague and untested though. If carrying properly who would know if u were carrying?  But the flip side even if the sign is non regulation the intent of the property own is clear.... They dont want u to carry. Which for me means they dont want my business,ILGuns,cqcc2wm,1,t5_353el
4644492,0,t1_ctfzxkp,Agreed Im just more curious about having the state approved one ten feet into the building.,ILGuns,ctg04pg,1,t5_353el
6196557,0,t1_cytz4lb,In Massad Ayoobs book Deadly Force. Highly recommend reading this is his definition.Ability   Did your attacker have the ability to cause death or grievous bodily harm? This usually means did the attacker have a lethal weapon such as a gun or knife.Use of lethal force against an unarmed attacker may also be justified such as when you are faced with multiple attackers or a single attacker who is causing you serious harm. However as in the famous Trayvon Martin case this can lead to a claim of disparity of force and make your defense more difficult.Opportunity   Was your attacker close enough to carry out the attack? If the attacker was unarmed he would have to be within arms length. If he had a weapon he would have to be close enough to use the weapon against you. How close is close enough? It depends on the weapon the circumstances and what the jury or judge thinks about it.  Opportunity also means the attack must be here and now. Thinking that someone may harm you at a future date or at another place is not a legally acceptable justification for using lethal force.Jeopardy   Did the attacker intend to cause you harm? Was your life in jeopardy? Someone can have a gun and be standing right in front of you such as a concealed weapons permit holder but have no intention of causing harm. On the other hand someone can run at you with a baseball bat screaming that theyre going to kill you. In the first there is probably no jeopardy. In the second there probably is.What it boils down do is this Do you genuinely believe you are in mortal danger and is using a gun the only means of ending the threat? Assuming you dont initiate the conflict you dont have a duty to retreat and you honestly believe you are in grave danger your use of a firearm may be justified.,ILGuns,cytzdox,18,t5_353el
6227155,0,t1_cyxfog3,At least  or . I wonder if this is a part of the CPD slowing down in response to being thrown under the bus by Rham.,ILGuns,cyxgkbp,1,t5_353el

10593920,0,t1_dd8o67d,Yeah somehow thats different in their mind. We hunt duck on private property and have never had issues. But in general Lake county sucks for hunting because of the crazy rules,ILGuns,dd8oiwo,1,t5_353el
10833410,0,t3_5uubfg,Ive never flown with a firearm but you could always call the airport. ,ILGuns,ddxe1sy,2,t5_353el
11158331,0,t3_5z90yv,While I agree that it sucks to pay anything to Cook County there comes a practical point of diminishing returns if you have to pay more in gas money than it would cost to just give it up to the damn county.  The principle of the matter only goes so far.,ILGuns,dews9k2,3,t5_353el
