10353199,0,t3_5o7dx8,I dont think there is a big market for vintage brio.    Here is a pretty good history of the harbor set you probably have with the ropes and all This guy has a store selling new old stock and his prices arent outrageous leading me to think there isnt much of a market for vintage brio.  There are a few rare sets that fetch a premium. The double green bridge is one that I occasionally see listed for x or more its original price. Here is one of the lowest prices ive seen  I really want this component! Some stuff is way more expensive stateside than in Europe the Flying Scotsman lists for over  here but it is easy to find for under  over there.   There are a lot of sets that dont make it over here at all and when they do show up on ebay they go for a lot. This is all new stuff though.  I guess there needs to be collectors for your vintage stock to have value and I havent seen much evidence there are enough of them out there to influence prices.  ,BRIO,dchlgc7,3,t5_31fj1
