2242599,0,t1_clovxjy,Maybe in the overworld it has less backtracking but I think from level freaking one you cant collect everything without at least one move from a FUTURE level. And that gets REALLY OLD REALLY FAST.EDIT Also the water level would be a lot more tolerable still not good without those damn gatekeeping octopi that you have to freeze. I always have to shoot like fifteen eggs until I get JUST the right pixel and timing to actually hit the damn thing without its tentacles getting in the way.,GhaziGamer,clovyic,1,t5_349l6
2331129,0,t3_2m0cee,gt Batman Arkham Asylum amp Arkham CityPeople will disagree with me but I really like Arkham Origins. As long as you go in expecting basically an expansion pack of Arkham City and not a super original game youll probably like it. Its just more of the same.,GhaziGamer,clzu9u2,3,t5_349l6
2333840,0,t1_cm068cq,gt A s crimeexploitation story about DaredevilYES PLEASE. Born Again the game.Also whaaaat is all of the about the new batman game? After it got delayed my hyper boner got soft and I think I missed a lot of info.,GhaziGamer,cm06bf3,3,t5_349l6

2580152,0,t3_2pcd5g,Ive been waiting over a year for one of these to hatch and have hatched thousands of eggs to no avail. I was about to give up and pay someone to hack me one.Unfortunately its male so I cant name it Dark Sister after the coolest sword name in ASoIaF so I went with Wheat Sword instead. And it doesnt have a perfect attack IV so it probably wont be able to compete in a competitive match. But this is going to be one of my prized Pokemon trophies from now on.,GhaziGamer,cmvd3bw,1,t5_349l6
3441218,0,t1_cokmjgx,I know Im commenting a month after the fact and giving way too much of a shit about this but pretty much all the Sonic fanboys always saw Sonic Boom as like satan incarnate and though the game was gonna be totally shit throughout its whole development cycle. Granted they were right but Ive never seen any Sonic fanboys actually defend the thing.Say what you want about Sonic fanboys but Id say that on average theyll give up performing mental gymnastics to try and avoid the truth earlier than most Gaters tend to do.,GhaziGamer,cpkiwci,1,t5_349l6
