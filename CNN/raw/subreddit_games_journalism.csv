1635122,0,t1_cjl2awi,Worth keeping in mind there is WordPress.com acts a but like tumblr in being free to set up. Can buy some extras like themes or a domain. Then theres WordPress.org which you host yourself but is only as restrictive as you make it. E.g these are all WordPress sites You can always cross post from WordPress to Tumblr. ,games_journalism,cjl9t52,1,t5_2vh76
3171266,0,t1_coqfykd,Yeah I never quote the entire press releases. I usually just include quote blocks. I like to add my personal reporting mixed with quotes. I am confused with making preview articles mostly. I have no knowledge of some of these indie titles but I would like to start making previews for them. All the info I have are from the press kits and a YouTube trailer. Can I copy and paste the press kit into the preview?,games_journalism,coqp7pn,1,t5_2vh76
3332342,0,t3_2yanya,Im still really digging the reviews themselves but the website has a kind of early  html website vibe going on the framedbordered logo and header specifically. Also not a big fan of all the glowing text shadow on the black background it really irritates my eyes.Another thing is consistency Youre using a lot of different fonts effects and styles see Rating Guide. Its better to have a consistent style especially when it comes to brand recognition and guiding the reader towards actual content.TLDR Turn down the fluff and colors.,games_journalism,cp842zc,1,t5_2vh76

4102947,0,t3_37jdz7,A good rule of thumb for anything is to question it by three questions What is this doing? Did it succeed? Was it worth doing?In the case of this site and things like it I have to question whether or not simply having a place for joke posts is worth doing. While Im a fan of sites like Cracked and The Onion theyre also places that have massive swaths of writing talent and years of different kinds of experience. Satire like that targeted satire is specifically lampooning a particular piece of news or a particular product and doing so in a way that illustrates where its flaws are. Things like A Modest Proposal dont really happen in a vacuum and while gaming is rife with opportunities to make jokes about stupid business decisions it can be challenging to identify something worth making fun of and doing it cleverly on a regular basis for a medium that is seeing consistently less viewership with each passing year. Unfortunately games writing is becoming something of a shrinking art.However if I ask you to name a webcomic about games any webcomic you can likely come up with a name of one that is at least marginally successful at doing this exact thing.So while I dont agree with uGff that such a project is guaranteed failure I do theyre right to think youre setting yourself up to go into a very challenging and saturated market. So the biggest question youll have to ask yourself in looking at this project is If I am going to do this can I make it worth doing?My advice for that is to do a couple of things ahead of time Identify an aspect of gaming that you enjoy that is worth talking about even if its a relatively smaller section like MMOs or Facebook games. Do a lot of research. Become someone who can readily answer questions about the genre and become savvy enough in its aspects to think of clever things to say about it as it is now. The funniest comedy isnt spurofthemoment its absolutely the product of years of reading knowledge and experience. Its easy to make a good joke but it takes mountains of knowledge to make great jokes regularly on a specific subject that are welltimed. You need to become a purveyor of this art form. Be aware that if youre in this for fame easy money or massive popularity youre running incredibly long odds. Most game writing is painfully unprofitable. Many writers do so to supplement existing jobs or have worked long and hard for free middling interest and the most popular writers accrue as many vocal critics as fans. The chances of making it big in the industry are increasingly small as every single person with an internet connection and the desire to write about games is your competitor and many of them will have through luck or privilege opportunities you never will. If you can face that reality and think This is what I want then youre already ahead of so many so capitalize on it. To further the above point you will lose money on any project before you gain it. As uGff suggested having a professional URL will help immensely and isnt that expensive but its an expense youll have to foot yourself. Same goes for any hosting fees theme purchases and such that you decide to pick up in the pathway to going bigger with this.Assuming everything above looks okay and this is something you want to do here are my thoughtsgt A surprise turn of events for developers Little Orbit. Verb missing. Since the release of one of their biggest title Barbie Dreamhouse Party theyve shipped a total of  copies to venues such as Target Amazon and Steam. This reads as though the creators shipped to the distributors which would mean further cost for them rather than income. Since the release of their flagship title Barbie Dreamhouse Party theyve sold a total of  copies from distributors like Steam Amazon and Target. The August  release has been focused on the majority of the girl gaming audience that has been absent since the s. Awkward phrasing. Released in August  Dreamhouse Party is focused on the girl gaming audience which has been largely ignored since the late s. Such unprecedented success for a game in the Barbie series has had Little Orbit begin to draw plans for a sequel. Still awkward. I would cut this entirely and move it to the PR quote from Little Orbit. Also Id probably add a line break for visual formatting.gt A PR representative at Little Orbit stated that the demand for these Barbie series games is definitely there and we will continue to create sequels to the hitrelease that was Barbie Dreamhouse Party. It still feels stunted. PR speak has a very positive tilt but its also an excited one. I would rewrite as Its hard to imagine this success for our company! Having one hundred sales on a Barbie Dreamhouse Party title is a dream come true for us at Little Orbit! Since this title blew away our projected sales were already looking down the road for new series sequels! We hope our enormous audience is as excited for this as we are! Their next sequel Barbie Dreamhouse Slumberparty will be released August . No company is going to have that final a release date on announcing a project. At the very least leave room in the language for uncertainty. Although its still early in development Little Orbit projects their upcoming sequel Barbie Dreamhouse Slumberparty will release August . Little Orbit hopes to double their sales numbers with this new addition to the series. Awkward phrasing implies a sequel will double... what sales? Company sales? General Barbie product sales? Little Orbit hopes that a newer bigger Barbie title will help them reach double the sales of Dreamhouse Party and secure a long and positive future for the Barbie Dreamhouse series.To start your writing could benefit from practice. It feels awkward and more than a little clunky. Word placement and sentence structure feels pretty arbitrarily placed as if put there because it has nowhere else to go rather than reasoned to be put exactly there.A good solution for this is to read more. The mind absorbs a lot more language knowledge in the subconscious than many realize and one of the best ways to be a good writer is to be a good reader. So go hunt through Destructoid IGN Polygon Escapist Magazine GiantBomb GameSpot PCGamer GamesRadar etc. Read headlines read articles and editorials read reviews read everything you can possibly absorb. Especially pay attention when reading news spots from sites like these as the tone in the news articles are the ones that are going to inform the type of writing youll be emulating and satirizing over the course of Day One Update. In order to write good satire you should already be able to write great news. Dont skimp on this read read read.The best advice I can give you beyond layout or presentation criticisms is to learn the craft of writing. Take a lot of time to practice do general game writing before trying to do game satire. Find a site thats looking for writers like this one and apply places. Learn the trade practice your personal craft and keep working at building up your portfolio and abilities.Good luck and keep working at it.,games_journalism,crnylyb,3,t5_2vh76

8422284,0,t1_d5u9edc,here is a post from halfway down the front pageBesides the Critical Distance list theres also this lt of sites that pay for games writing and their rates. Until you pitch for money thereamps not necessarily a reason to write for anyone other than yourself. Not saying that it canampt help but thereamps a lot of places out there that have incredibly high demands for how much content you need to produce while offering little more than proofreading.Big sites still expect you to mostly selfmanage and you can easily develop and prove that skill by keeping a busy well maintained blog,games_journalism,d5ubsxv,2,t5_2vh76
