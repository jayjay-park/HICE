1833521,0,t3_2fkiiu,Seconding Umineko.  Plot twist or three is an understatement.Also gonna throw out the Zero Escape series  Hours  Persons  Doors and Virtues Last Reward Written by the same author as Ever and itll probably will fall right up your alley.And while were on handhelds Danganronpa  just got an official localization earlier this week.  That series definitely also falls under the psychological horror  plot twists category.,visualnovelsuggest,cka4tsb,2,t5_314u7

3131624,0,t3_2w05te,Hoshizora no Memoria is a high school romance that fits the the bill. Theres some drama in it but its all happy endings. Its  somewhat long and .Majikoi is a pretty zany RomCom with a strong focus on friendship. Each of the heroine routes in the game is fun and generally satisfying with the romance. The only problem is that its only partially for now but it will be finished soon enough. Its pretty long and .Canvas is a high school romance about an artist who quit his dream of becoming a painter instead becoming a teacher. Its a romance VN so the focus is mostly on that. Most of the heroines have little epilogues which I find to be great. Its medium length and .,visualnovelsuggest,comla2d,1,t5_314u7
3779051,0,t1_cqmwuuu,Hmm...what did I like about both of them. Well I guess I liked how all the characters had distinct and sometimes hilarious personalities. I really liked Rin in KS and adored Asaga in SA. Sunrider Academy also had me focus for the end goal of keeping three trouble some clubs together. I guess I liked how real and fun both VNS were. Idk if this is enough but lmk and Ill try to think a bit harder. Honestly I think Im a sucker for a romance ,visualnovelsuggest,cqn1f10,1,t5_314u7

4631788,0,t1_ctea8yl,Usually its just the Japanese original version on nyaa. Youll have to apply an EnglishChinese patch yourself if it exists. There are prepatched torrents but theyre exceptions.As for SteinsGate its better to look out for something with JAST as it will be the official English version. Note that for allages VNs nyaa.se is the correct link. sukebei.nyaa.se is for  stuff.,visualnovelsuggest,cteenf8,2,t5_314u7
