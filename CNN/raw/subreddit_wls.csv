412883,0,t3_1yrut2,I had RNY back on  and have lost about lbs so far. Im honestly surprised at all the things my pouch is able to handle. As it stands I can eat pretty much everything I ate before I had surgery just much less. I mostly try to avoid heavy carbs like bread and I do have some problems with rice but Im fine with pasta. I tend to experiment a lot especially since Im still getting used to how my body deals with things so I have  and please dont do this I know Im dumb  tried to give myself dumping syndrome just to see what does it. I will try excessively sugary things to see what they do to me and they really do nothing. The only thing thats given me dumping consistently is when I mix my protein with whole milk. Before that Hidden Valley Bacon Ranch dressing. Other than that Ive eaten candy bars caramels flat soda whiskey cookies and other terribly bad things that none of you should eat ever. The main problems I have are getting enough water for one  dehydration is a big problem for me especially since I live in the desert and I am pretty consistently weak and fatigued and my pee is like a neon orange and smells like a corpse. Second I still have an issue with eating too fast. I obviously didnt get to lbs without working at it and I know that the same mindless facestuffing is counterintuitive at this point but for some reason I cant seem to slow down and I wind up puking more often than not. ,wls,cfnk7mu,2,t5_2s4nb

4000331,0,t3_35ezri,Ive had an amazing experience.  The first couple of months after surgery are quite difficult but completely manageable its just getting used to the changes.  I started the journey in August of  and lost  lbs before my October surgery.  Id lost lbs by Christmas best Christmas present ever!  Im now  months out and have lost  lbs.  I can eat pretty much everything with a few exceptions like super greasy ribs and large amounts of pasta.  I go out to restaurants drink on occasion and still enjoy the world of food. I can only eat little amounts still but thats the whole point right.  Dont let anyone tell you its easy because its hard work everyday but its completely doable.  I now absolutely LOVE to exercise for example I did pilates squats planks and an arm workout this morning took my dog for a walk and will go for another and sleep like a baby.  My skin is better my periods are regular my hormones are normal my blood sugar is normal my blood pressure is normal everything is NORMAL.  Ive gone from a size  and a x to a  and L. I will need to have skin removal surgery at some point in the not to distant future. But again its all worth it because I am healthy happy and living the life I always wanted.  ,wls,crc9pel,2,t5_2s4nb
4164631,0,t1_cruxlaq,Trust me I understand and I am so glad I am not the only one.   I am very lucky my Chiropractor has also had WLS and so he really understand the issues we have.   He explained to me and hopefully I am not doing him an injustice with my explanation that when we loss weight we also loss fat in between our disc back knees and hips ect then all the sudden they start to rub and have issues.  He has been working with my lower spine and hips to try to relieve some of the pain and for the most part it has worked. I was always told to lose weight and your joints will feel better and he explained that will happen but there is some adjustment time.    I never believed in chiropractor care before my surgery but I really do believe it has helped me stay on track with my exercising and moving forward. GL!  ,wls,cruz6km,2,t5_2s4nb

That would be the most important piece of advice I can give you. Dont try and shoot for the huge numbers. Really pay attention to how much and what youre eating. The Super low calorie diets or diets that cut out carbs or sugar are not sustainable long term. And dont pay too much attention to the scales.

Now understand the surgery is not a quick fix it is a tool to right yourself. For me year one was easy stuck to the diet and lost a ton of my weight. I started weightlifting in that time fill up some of that skin with muscle thus increasing my diet that can play tricks with your head.  Then year two to three I would occasionally eat unhealthy or like i used too obviously smaller portions But thanks to the surgery I was able to recognize my slipups and work on correcting that. The past year i have been working on snacking when i am not really hungry it is  a mental game a few months after the surgery. The surgery will not be a cureall it is hard work. After surgery the most important thing i think is keeping yourself accountable. Dont beat yourself up if you eat ice cream when you are out on vacation. Just DONT eat it EVERY night.Also if you can or if your doctor has them I can not stress in person WLS support groups enough!  Long Story Short Is it easy?

8685777,0,t1_d6qwqn7,I had the same issue with head hunger when I started out as well as hating the liquid diet. The way I got through and still get through to be honest is making sure to take my antacids  as the acid in your stomach can trick you into thinking youre hungry  and drinking an entire cup of water before I allowed myself to eat anything. I would drink ice water and occupy myself for  mins.  times out of  I would get so distracted that I forgot about my hunger. If the hunger persisted I would eat something.

9606243,0,t3_5ck0f9,Hi. I just got sleeved  days ago so I may not be fit to answer your long term conclusions. But these are from my discussions with the surgeon endocrinologist and nutritionist. In the long run Gastric Sleeve has proven to be the most effective way to reduce your weight and the risks of future complications are very minimal. The highest amount of data available in the medical world upto  years post wls is with sleeve. Study shows that people lose about  of their excess weight and gain about  back in  years. This is all subject to how you treat your body post surgery. If you stick to the diet regime and exercise and dont take short cuts then you will have a great life. This doesnt lead to malabsorption as there is no re rerouting of the intestine or by passing the stomach. In essence your stomach volume is reduced to rd its original volume. So you will fuller much quicker than you would normally expect to be full. This provides your body to burn the excess fat and thereby reduce your weight. So it is mandatory that you stick to your diet and exercise regime and supplement proteins as and when instructed post op. Remember that any wls option is a tool and not a magic bullet to resolve the problem. Godspeed. ,wls,d9x5zkc,6,t5_2s4nb

I think theres really nothing you can do except accept the risks and know that youll probably be fine and this will change your life for the better.

That is always top priority then water.Also surgical stomach pain can mimic hunger.  Our bodies mistake tummy pain for hunger pains. Be sure you are taking a PPI such as Zantac Prilosec or Prevacid.  All are available over the counter.  This will help reduce your stomach acid and may help some.  It was the answer to my tummy pains! Good luck and keep us posted! ,wls,dbodqvd,1,t5_2s4nb

10219253,0,t1_dc2clhh,Slider food are foods that quickly digest and slide through the sleeve quickly causing you to be able to eat more and feel hungry sooner. Not all sliders are bad just they dont stay so use caution.For example a cheeseburger minus bun of course from a major fast food place will empty through your sleeve a lot faster than the same amount of chicken breast. Or I love Cinnamon Life cereal. But I can eat a full serving of it because the milk and chewing it into mush overrides my restriction. Things like popcorn chips and even salad are sliders. If you need to eat slider food eat a little dense protein first to feel full longer.When youre on liquids mushies and soft foods dont worry about this. Later on when youre healed and eating solids well its an issue. If you eat a lot of sliders you can easily go over your calorie limit and basically eat around your restriction. ,wls,dc2erma,1,t5_2s4nb

10630076,0,t3_5s4xxr,Yes. Three months before my surgery I walked to lunch a few blocks on flat pavement with my coworkers. I was sweaty and sore afterwards. The summer after my surgery I went backpacking. That fall I completed a half marathon walking. That winter I went downhill skiing. The next spring I competed in a powerlifting event. I get winded and sore from exercise but it feels good now because I know Ive done a lot. I lost  pounds prior to my surgery and then the rest of it in the first  months after surgery. This surgery gave me my life back. Good luck to you!,wls,ddcetnk,9,t5_2s4nb

11314681,0,t1_dfegxhy,My insurance program does require meeting with a psychologist before and after surgery. It also requires visits with a dietician before and after and regular check ups and other more obvious requirements.I dont believe I am at risk for suicide or other addictions. Most of my weight gain came from being poor in college and working at a bakery that offered for free to the employees any day olds that didnt sell and then back to back high risk pregnancies where I was on bed rest and didnt modify my generous diet to match my extremely reduced movement and then finally having two kids who dont finish their plates  so I do. I like food but Im not an emotional or addictive eater. That being said I think its excellent that my insurance requires these psychological consults before and after. There are a lot of people seeking surgery for the wrong reasons as was mentioned in OPs post and then there are lots of people who seek surgery for the right reasons but may not realize underlying addictions again like OP mentioned. Even if these consults only help  of the people who go thats someones life that was saved. Im all for it.,wls,dfei1st,4,t5_2s4nb

11692707,0,t3_66tgpl,This is normal.  The first week sucks.  Keep going on the pain meds and add Prilosec Zantac or Prevacid to keep stomach acid at a minimum.  Try eating ice if you can.  This will help the tummy swelling.  It will get easier.  Walking around helps your digestive tract keep moving.

They gave me about  medicines laxatives pain meds gall bladder meds etc to get filled and if I would have had to deal with that I would have cried. I just wanted to go home and get in bed. Pack your bag for what you plan on wearing in the hospital. Not sure how many nights you are staying but I at least wanted some leggings or something to put on under my gown so I wasnt just nuding it up while walking around the hospital floor. Bring face wipes or baby wipes since you wont be able to shower. I was amazed at how greasy my face got just laying in a bed for  days. I also brought a lot of stuff to entertain me in the hospital but I feel like I didnt really use it that much. I dont remember what I spent my days doing honestly but I was mainly sleeping or watching TV or walking around the nurses station. Good luck!,wls,dgtikc8,5,t5_2s4nb
