674655,0,t1_cggxtx8,This is the one I bought and where I bought it from. What I hear is that the Harbor Freight one is pretty much the same but even cheaper. Either way I had heard a lot of good things about Bendpak so I went with them. Also JMC was good to work with but there are tons of sites selling it. Expect to pay an extra  shipping if you want it delivered to your home.,RealGarages,cggyimt,2,t5_2zmm0
