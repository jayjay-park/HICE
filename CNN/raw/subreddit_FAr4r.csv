6157312,0,t1_cypi1ls,That was pretty awesome. How long have you been learning for? I regret not taking any music courses back when I was in school. I think it would have helped me a lot with understanding music rather than just being able to use an instrument.Ill have to take a look at his tabs later on tonight and see what else he has. Thanks for sharing!,FAr4r,cypit1x,3,t5_3b67v
