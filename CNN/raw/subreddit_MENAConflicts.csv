If it was Saudi aligned I highly doubt it would still be continuing in transferring weapons to Hamas as Hamas is viewed negatively by both Saudi and Egypt. ,MENAConflicts,cr0mtkb,2,t5_37k2s

Obviously there probably would be problems in the middle east without western help but the effect western actions have had on the middle east  invasion of Iraq is the most obvious case that comes to mind have been catastrophic for regional stability.,MENAConflicts,crc6kjx,1,t5_37k2s

Not any pro Kurdish militia.Some people are kicking out residents from some areas it seems they are not the same group and they targeted mostly Arabs not only Arabs. The interviews are interesting the made up headline Amnesty International give the report is troubling.,MENAConflicts,cz9vlrl,1,t5_37k2s
