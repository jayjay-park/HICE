10536702,0,t1_dd2f436,I typically target anyone who seems to be going after me first. For example a rein charging or whatever. Chances are if I just shoot someone else not paying attention to me then Ill die before I can even get a kill in. Theres a lot more detail I can go into but Im at work right now. You will learn what to do the more you play.,BastionMains,dd2g9pp,2,t5_3ei1h
