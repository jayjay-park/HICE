243418,0,t1_cf4gpyt,Pretty positive I am getting into MTGO this friday when I get paid. I think I have it all figured out. I am only getting all my cards from mtgotraderscom and just my IRL modern deck. It thrashes at my LGSs and on MWS and so so fun to play. Using the  off code mtgsallypaypal I can get the whole deck and  tix for  Ima just do it. Card prices are only going up and tarns for less than  each seems crazy even if its only digital tarns. Right then they give me the cards and I can just sign up for modern dailies? I found the schedual seems like at least  every day.  I am on mws constantly. I just think the deck is good and fun enough its worth the investment to have it forever. Like seriously it fucking thrashes I am going to win a GP. And this deck will always be good and just got way fucking better now that DRS is out fuck that guy. Anything I need to know?? I am installing it now to try to get a feel for the program. Hopefully there is a trial mode or something. Just mtgtraders all the way for one exceptionally great modern deck ftw? I have this deck foiled out IRL almost totally already and plan on keeping it forever until I die would like to do the same for mtgo except I dont give shit about digital foils. ,MTGO,cf5zdiw,1,t5_2qwgh

3212467,0,t3_2wvl9j,I actually think this is much worse than insulting someone because it not only makes someone wait it might even make the whole tournament wait.However not everytime this happens is someone actually dcing on purpose. If they dced several times during the match its likely its just bad internet. If they dced and they are not really dead although close I think its likely internetcomputerenergy problems as well.Even if they did it on purpose and they are dead on board just one situation is not enough for a ban. I dont know how many it takes but Id have to say that to get a warning about this you have to get reported at least twice. After that I dont know how many it would take to actually get banned but they also look into your history. Ive actually been emailed by wizards about this and they told me to be careful but they knew about my history of internet problems.And even if someone gets banned for this I doubt its more than a week at least for the first time.,MTGO,couz143,4,t5_2qwgh

4714836,0,t3_3fgt6b,I think it depends on what you want out of MTGO. If you like to draft there are drafts firing constantly. If you just want to be able to play a few games of magic for fun you can generally always find an opponent within a few minutes. If you want to buy and sell cards to try to grind value you can still do that.But if you hope to be able to grind and grow your collection by being good and winning dalies well that dream is kind of dead anymore. Payouts are worse now and entries cost more. I wouldnt recommend it unless you want to play casually or are OK spending some money to play test decks you are going to play in paper. At the end of the day MTGO is much more of a money sink today than it was  months ago and playing competitively is rewarded much less.,MTGO,ctoue1b,4,t5_2qwgh
4723459,0,t3_3fkneh,One of the reasons some foils are cheaper is lack of perfect information  people dont look for foils so wont know when one is cheaper since bots on MTGO keep foils and nonfoils separate.  We have an optimize button on our deck editor that will choose the cheapest card available for a deck even if it is foil.  Since the stock we keep of Promos is lower than normal cards  and even lower for foil promos  and the price is always cheaper  foil Stoke is always sold out p.Its just sort of a unique card given its volume since it is in burn decks which are popular with newer players.,MTGO,ctpxju0,5,t5_2qwgh

You then remember those events better than the ones where you open chaff.Even if you could put up those  results in  youll lose quickly and get disheartened and stop playing them  events will be over fast and prizes will be rare.So mediocre players weed themselves out of the s fast.,MTGO,cvdb5j1,3,t5_2qwgh

5519009,0,t1_cwgwbh8,Phantom points are used in Phantom Events in the play lobby they are denoted by having the word Phantom in the listing for the event. Once you run out of phantom points you will no longer be able to play these events unless you make a new account. These events have a little prize support which is a number of  card booster packs for the latest set currently Battle for Zendikar. These arent the same as regular  card booster packs and come in  forms. A Mythic pack which can have a mythic OR a rare and a number of uncommoncommons Uncommon pack which has a more uncommons than commons and a Common pack which has more commons than uncommons. These packs are not tradable.If I were you Id use my phantom points to play phantom drafts as unless you have a very good constructed deck already you will get trounced playing the phantom constructed events. At least the playing field is somewhat level in phantom drafts. The better you do the more packs you get. In my experience you have a better chance of finishing in the top half and receive at least  card boosters in draft than you do doing single constructed matches against  decks. However YMMV.Please note that Phantom Drafts do not give you any of the cards you may draft in them. The only cards you keep are the card boosters you get at the end. ,MTGO,cwh3qhk,0,t5_2qwgh

7244456,0,t1_d20up9p,I would venture to say that it would have little to no effect at local your local LGS. I went to my LGS for SOI PreRelease. I end up chatting with a bunch of people and they ask where I normally play. I told them I play on MTGO. They said they never tried it. I would venture to say that most MTGO players would prefer paper if they had the choice. Unfortunately poorly thought out rules like this penalize the players that dont have a choice.For some working parents they cant slip away to a card store with three kids at home to do a midnight PreRelease for five hours. The LGS that is going to go under because a few players opted to play online is a business that probably doesnt have a strong plan to begin with. Rain would probably cause less players to attend a PreRelease then if the cards were released online at the same time. In fact in my area they could use a little culling of the less attractive LGS. ,MTGO,d21n50v,1,t5_2qwgh
7276316,0,t1_d258eww,well then there are Duels of Planeswalkers  which has some more depth to it than the Magic Duels. Of course those games were not intended to have a trading replays events chat and other things that you mentioned. However most of the items on the list are possible to implement by the devs. And we could have a better presentation of the game. I mean if players dont want this then sure why should they change. Apparently everyone is quite happy with the games performance so far.,MTGO,d259o78,-2,t5_2qwgh

When I get reimbursed do I lose the cards I had and just get a refund and its like I never played? Does it get assumed I won and let me finish at  or am I given a loss and finish at ?

Currently you need about  win ratio to go infinite and anything over that will start gaining you profit. Once youve played in some tournaments you can also put in your rating to get a better representation. I would recommend playing in competitive leagues only for constructed.Playgroups Im not really sure on I know there are some clans but not sure if there are any good ones that are really joinable from what I can guess they tend to be for people who have friends in real life they know.I only use tournament practice room occasionally to test out a new deck and Ive never ran into problems with people instant conceding even when Ive been playing truely degenerate decks. Maybe Ive just been lucky as that sentiment seems to run deep.If you want the feeling of learning a group of players on a weekly basis and you play modern I would recommend modern times of gatherling free PRE that is fairly laid back but still got people playing competitive decks as well as budget.Feels like a massive wall of text but hope it helped answer some of  your questions.,MTGO,d96u008,4,t5_2qwgh

9790438,0,t1_dajsqbs,There would probably be fewer than  people trading at any given time.  It would be nigh impossible to find the cards you wanted leastwise multiple people competing for prices.  Maybe if they set up some kind of marketplace system where you could drop off your cards and set a price then anyone could buy them at their leisure but thats basically just a WOTC run bot.,MTGO,dajvuom,6,t5_2qwgh
9791600,0,t1_dajvq25,Supply differences is my explanation here.If enough packs of KTK were drafted to in theory supply  foil sets it is expected statistically that there will be about  of the least opened one and about  of the most opened.If  foil sets get redeemed the shortest supply one gets very rare.,MTGO,dak1015,2,t5_2qwgh
9793791,0,t3_5fewzq,So what youre saying is you think the people making money from selling cards are purposefully reducing the value of the cards they sell? Do you have any kind of theory as to why that would be the case? The higher they sell the cards for the more money they make right? So why would they want to price fix to a very low price?,MTGO,dakap42,2,t5_2qwgh
9795004,0,t3_5fewzq,So much to unpack in this post. Let me look at just a few things.First MTGO is and has been designed from the start to be a faithful online recreation of paper Magic. This means new cards enter the system via opening boosters preferably in a Limited event and the only way to get a card it to open it or tradebuy it from someone else. This is why MTGO is expensive because paper Magic is expensive and MTGO cards only cost less because of higher supplylower demand and lower transaction costs. Hearthstone doesnt have trading and does have a card crafting system to make other cards from what you already have.You claim that every card not in demand sells for pennies as evidence of price fixing. But thats how paper magic is too! The actual going rate is a little higher most bulk rares at least in Standard go for about  a bit higher for fringe playables but thats mainly because of higher transaction costs in selling paper magic cards. Online most transactions are done in event tickets or fractions thereof and thus the payment processing is often offloaded to Wizards.You also argue for an economy based on playertoplayer trades and almost no one wants that. Lets say I pull a Smugglers Copter in a Sealed league but I dont want thatI want to build Modern Thing Ascension or maybe just get more packs to play more Limited. In a world we live in I can sell it for a bot to get the cardspacks I want. In a world of playertoplayer trading I have to spend time trying to find someone who  wants my Copter and  is willing to trade me the things I need. I know which world I prefer living in.,MTGO,dakg2gm,3,t5_2qwgh

9878063,0,t3_5gskos,As far as getting virtual cards from real ones there is no way from Wizards to do this but you can sell the cards to a few different secondary market stores and they will give you credit online.  Isle of Cards buys paper cards and gives you a nice bonus if you choose store credit with Cardhoarder their online partner.  Cape Fear Games also does the same thing with their partner MTGOTraders.  Unfortunately theres no way for you to keep your paper cards and get cards online.Theres no way to play MTGO for free.  It costs  for an account then you buy cards as well as pay real money for entry into tournaments.  At this point the prize payouts for constructed tournaments are EV at a  win rate so its not that hard to accrue more digital currency but youll have to spend some real money to get started.  The cheapest way is to play pauper a format composed entirely of commons.  A top tier deck costs about .  Factor in another  or so for starting some tournaments you could probably play forever on your  investment as long as you have a decent win rate.,MTGO,dav4uv7,2,t5_2qwgh
10020868,0,t1_dbdplss,Youre operating on a number of incorrect assumptions.The amount of players who play for free is miniscule.  While players buy packs and cards from rd parties they buy them with tickets which have to come from somewhere namely the MTGO official store.  The amount MTGO pulls in for Hasbro is huge.Youre making blanket statements about how they should do this because clearly this would happen with no evidence.  The evidence we have is that WotC has a card game that has outlasted every other CCG in existence with a constantly growing playerbase both online and offline over two and a half decades.Does Hearthstone have more players?  Sure.  Its a totally different game with a totally different business model with no paper connection and has only been around a few years.  Does Pokemon TCG have a totally free online component where you get free cards from paper boosters?  Yes.  But its sanctioned tournament scene is minuscule compared to MTGO and has a very different target audience.People are resistant because youve come in here comparing apples to oranges and expect us to declare you our saviour.,MTGO,dbdqwfd,3,t5_2qwgh
