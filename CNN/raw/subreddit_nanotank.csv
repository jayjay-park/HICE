8731084,0,t1_d6w64h6,I think that narrowing down to  or  responses and including other and explain if they pick other in saying why did you decide to buy an aquarium? might help. Realistically the best results youd get were if you were getting people to take this survey IN stores WHEN they are buying the aquariums and pets but I dont know that you would have access to do that considering this seems less of something thats companyfunded research and more personal study.  ,nanotank,d6x14ko,1,t5_2ywz7
