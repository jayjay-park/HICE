Hell there are plenty of companies that do that already.gt Isnt the whole idea of a paycheck to motivate you to do a good job so that you can keep getting one?Yes.

So I really doubt that the MOA can point to a few hours of protesting to have made a big dent in their revenues. Why do the mall visitor trends matter?

Minneapolis will be easier to appreciate from the interstate than Saint Paul since W runs straight north to downtown Minneapolis before veering around it while E crosses the river a few miles upriver from Saint Paul so you cant really see it all that well from the interstate before it sneaks up on you.I also gives a great view of Duluth just before dropping down into the main portion of the city by the lake.

Its not the legacy that we have as humans. If we ignore how brutal humans can be youre trying to just filter out our entire history. When given   or  years we can easily pass judgement on people that died for ideals that we no longer agree with. Those people were still people. They had families they had dreams and they died for what they believed in. Im not trying to excuse the actions that they took in those beliefs however I can still think that people who were so committed to whatever cause they believed in were still people.They believed in something so much that they were willing to die for it. And they did. No matter what the cause no matter how long ago it was that it can be viewed through the filter of history I can still respect them. The fact that they were willing to give their lives for something at least deserves a mention in the history books.I feel like I need to say this again but I dont agree with the reasons a lot of people kill othersdie for.

That being said it is most likely that this wouldnt happen until after the legislative season to allow states that are noncompliant to make the required changes.Even if they started tomorrow you can still fly without compliant identification you just get to play  questions with immigration.Enhanced drivers licenses are handy if you travel to say Mexico or Canada by land or sea not by air a lot as they are a federally approved border crossing document containing both RFID and MRZBarcode.

Besides increases to the population drinking at bars and restaurants has to increase the number of drunk driving instances that occur. This is just the outcome that has to happen. You increase a factor that results in drunk driving people who will be out drinking. On top of that lower age limits means higher traffic accidentsAlexander C. Wagenaar and Traci L.

6428631,0,t1_czk7w0o,gtYes people have congregated with other races forever. But its rarely been a relationship of equals. Slavery has existed since the beginning of time.The existence of slavery doesnt mean that people have always been racist because. Slaves and their masters have not always been distinct racially. White people have enslaved white people. Black people have enslaved black people. gtAlso again I never once said race is itself the cause of anything its often an effect. You like to put words in my mouth. Regardless if high crime is caused by being black or an effect its still associated with being black.Yes you did. Claiming that blackness is indistinct from an increased propensity for criminality due to having been bred for strength by slave owners inextricably links blackness and criminality. Youre saying Sure it isnt black peoples fault that theyre more likely to be criminals but it is indistinguishable from their blackness. You dont even know what is implied by the things youre saying. gtI try to be a good person despite my racism you really should devote your energy to people who actually go after non whites rather than playing thought police toward people who dont treat people poorly because of race. Im not going to satisfy you by pretending I or anyone else can change my nature. As long as I do no harm thats all we can expect of anyone because we are all sinners.Trying to be a good person would require that you try to be less racist. Justifying your racist attitudes as necessities of the human condition isnt goodness its selfserving intellectual laziness. If you go around thinking and treating black people like criminals then youre not doing no harm. ,minnesota,czk9b7s,1,t5_2qhxs

We have mostly Somali immigrants and there are a lot of people who are racist to them and religion is only a part of it.

6702041,0,t3_47boga,It depends in a very big way on what party youre caucusing with.  The two parties follow very different procedures because caucuses are run by the parties not by the Secretary of State.  So who are you caucusing with?For what its worth Ive caucused with the Republicans in recent years while my mother caucused with the Democrats in  and ended up going all the way to nationals.  Neither of us ever had a bad experience at precinct caucuses.  The DNC in Madison Square Garden on the other hand was such a horrible experience my mom ended her lifelong membership in the Democratic Party that very night but thats another story...  Caucuses are where you get together with your friends and neighbors and actually have a conversation about whats going on in this country and what we need to do to make things better.  Its one of Americas finest institutions and its a scandal that theyre so rare now....on the other hand looking at the chaos of Nevadas GOP caucus last night it may be that many states other than Minnesota arent competent to run a caucus so maybe its just as well.  We run terrific caucuses here.Anyway I digress what party are you with?,minnesota,d0cjryd,2,t5_2qhxs

Baseball is a VERY hard sport because of that the talent spread is pretty short baseball doesnt have a Lebron James one player cant carry a team on their backs as Barry Bonds in his late career can attest to. While over the long baseball season the best teams will generally end up on top that isnt the case for single games or even large parts of the season. Baseball has a certain degree of randomness that other sports just dont seem to have and while theres definitely some skill in putting together a team for a single day its still just increasing your odds slightly and making your bet a slightly better one.,minnesota,d1ajfn2,4,t5_2qhxs

9892383,0,t1_dawtapf,So I could be wrong but I seem to remember from the Ken Burns documentary on prohibition that the Temperance Movement never really got a ton of traction in MN and WI compared to the southern states. Supposedly this was because we had the largest populations of German immigrants at the time and they really liked their beer. By the time the Volstead Act was drafted Temperance had been going for decades and many states were dry or mostly dry. This wasnt really the case up here though. Germans felt like prohibition was a personal attack on them especially after WWI and were a lot slower to adopt it. By the time Volstead drafted the legislation it was pretty much lip service to what was already taking over in most of the US. I believe MN and WI were also some of the last states to actually ratify the th Amendment as well. My take on it is just that we are mostly a bunch of DFLer stoic Scandinavians and Germans who dont really like change whatever form it is. Hence why we were so slow to adopt prohibition and also why we are one of the last states to hang onto some of its laws excepting all the dry counties that remain in the south yikes.,minnesota,dax01f8,11,t5_2qhxs

All those countries seem to manage the miracle of buying coffee and providing health care. If you are just scrapping by maybe you should reflect upon what decent provided Healthcare could mean for you. Instead of saying we have to leave the sick and needy to their painful deaths maybe you should ask yourself how a country can be the wealthiest in the world and not be able to provide a service every other first world country can.

The better approach is to allow alcohol purchases at  have open and realistic discussion with proper use and amounts of alcohol and not drive people to binge drinking because its illegal which makes it even more tempting for everyone involved in binge drinking.

11007248,0,t1_defhjg6,Its pretty clear that you lack a clear understanding of what CRISPR does as well.CRISPR isnt just about designer babies though that could theoretically be done.  Its also about rewriting the genetic code in vivo  which is to say it can rewrite the genetic code of people who are no longer in the womb.  Lets say youre born with Pompe Disease a neuromuscular condition in which the body cannot convert the glycogen stored in the muscles into the glucose they need to function.  The disease is caused a mutation in a single gene.  Given that its location is wellknown and the three types of possible mutations that cause Pompe it is an excellent candidate for CRISPRbased therapies.Without treatment an infantileonset form of the disease will kill the victim in  months on average.  Ordering a specific CRISPR package and having it injected into a batch of candidate mice typically  mice runs around If you have someones genome sequenced and a copy of their cancers genome theres fundamentally no reason you cant just go ahead and CRISPR the cancer mutation right out of existence.Remind me of whats bad here?Unfortunately there are handwringing types such as yourself who hear genetic engineering and instantly fly into a tizzy about eugenics and playing god and unknown effects and so on and instantly want to connect it selfdirected euthanasia in a fit of illogic that would stun Donald Trump.Tools like CRISPR can eliminate the diseases and syndromes that lead people to seek euthanasia.

11314763,0,t3_61ebms,Heres a stream of consciousness set of impressions.I have some family in Arcata. I have not been there but it sounds like a cool city in a beautiful environment. The area code should probably be .San Francisco has a crazygood Go scene in terms of strength and bookshops where I can find Chinese language books. One of the bookshops even features in USChina espionage history Eastwind Books. You can find whatever you want in this city from specialty Hungarian noodles to the truly obscure. The panhandlers are more numerous and aggressive than they are in MN. In January it is not so much cold as chilly. The wind plus cold rain... brr. My successful MN friends in tech often go to San Francisco for work. Very expensive city. I walked by houses that would be kk in MN that were easily gt million in SF. Public transit is good if BART is not on strike it was the last time I was there. The hills are a little absurd. I tried to go swimming in January I only got ankle deep before reconsidering.My LA experience is limited only been there a few times. The wealth inequality is most obvious here. I visited people who had money and definitely showed it. The traffic was bad but not Falling Down bad. The Article  district court judges are among the worst in the United States reminds me of O Brother Where Art Thou It aint the law! The law The law is a human institution.. The food is good and there is a lot to see and do here. Fun beaches. LA threatens other cities pro sports franchises helping the owners extort their local state for absurdly unfair stadium deals see e.g. the Vikings. The Mexican influence is more obvious here than in SF. When Trump threatened taco trucks on every corner I thought of LA and wondered why he wanted that wall. More generally LA is the cultural capital of the world. I went swimming here in January but the locals looked at me like an idiot.I know you say northern California but I have spent the most time in San Diego. I went to the Stone breweryrestaurant which was fun. UCSD is a great school. Balboa Park is beautiful. As a teenager I was shocked to see a school that had hallways on the outside of the school think motel vs. hotel. This is the only city where someone asked about my Minnesota accent. Its a little surprising how the temperature changes based on where you are in the city. The weather is always amazing though. I went swimming in January no problem.,minnesota,dfeidtr,2,t5_2qhxs

With summer approaching all the restaurants outdoor seating is starting to open up and they often play live music for the guests. Even if you dont eat its very romantic to take a walk down the river and listen to the music on the water and feed the ducks. Its an hour or two of a drive but Redwing isnt super far if you want to spend a day there on Lake Pepin or Barn Bluff. If you go even further down to Wabasha you could see the National Eagle Center. Heck you might even see some eagles hanging out in the trees next to the highway without going to the NEC they really love that area around Pepin.
