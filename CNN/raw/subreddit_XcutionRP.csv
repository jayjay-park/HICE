2730231,0,t1_cnd244o,AaronSome ambiance to set the moodThanks Hope!Aaron moved and poured himself a cup of the earl grey tea from the pot hope had just brought him. Though he frowned for a moment when he noticed the milk was missing before smirkingCome on now hope! Your the one who got me addicted to this stuff with milk in it. This is definitely going to hurt your tip.Aaron lifted the cup and took a sip instantly burning himself to the point he nearly spit it out. He quickly slammed the cup down and waved at his mouth. Well i guess thats instant karma.So your quite busy hear today? your not going to blow off training with Sherner again are you You know he is just going to make it that much harder if you do.Aaron swirled his finger over the tea making it swirl about and cool slightly before taking another long sip from the cup.,XcutionRP,cneez44,1,t5_31kxi
2751125,0,t1_cnd244o,It was a nice day out so Trish decided she wanted to do something she had the day off uni and didnt want to just sit at home doing nothing. She took out her phone to call Hope who didnt seem to answer at all. Bitch... She must be working. sigh Trish laid back on her bed looking at the roof. I know! She said jumping up. Ill just interrupt her at work She said with a fake evil laugh. She gathered her stuff and headed out to the place Hope worked.As Trish Arrived at the store she hid against the brick wall next to the window as she took a quick peak inside for Hope. As she looked she could see hope with her back turned about to take the order to a customer. To avoid being spotted Trish got on her hands and knees and crawled under the window to get up next to the door and brush herself off.As she headed into the store she mover between tables to avoid being spotted and to get into the right position. She was just placing an order down at the table and she pounced jumping onto hopes back. Yo! Hope what are you doing today She asked as she hung on Hopes shoulders only around an inch from the ground. Im bored lets do something...,XcutionRP,cngsi9c,1,t5_31kxi

The big man just sat there smiling. and pointed for the men to head to the door. the two men gave a hearty laugh and headed for the door. The big guy just leaned towards Johnny and spoke in a quite and condescending toneWell take this outside you bring yer shitty friends if you like Me and the guys will wait fer you. For every minute yer late weere going to take a tooth from ya The man simply finished his drink and started to head for the door in a collected and calm manner. Giving a small wave to Johnny as he left,XcutionRP,cnjt5qi,1,t5_31kxi

3102874,0,t1_cohnhb1,You and Aaron? Victoria repeats to herself as continues to listen. Alright so a young lady got herself into a jam and then the boys went after to go save her...ok she couldnt be mad at that...these guys were just trying to stop a crime but they ended up biting off more than they could chew. Victoria originally thought these guys got drunk or something and decided to go fuck with some random guys for a few laughs men were such troublesome creatures. Victoria didnt really know Mitchell she only saw him a few times and heard Lance mention him a bit.With a sigh she then walks over to Johnnys side and pats him on the shoulder twice as she shakes her head. Its alright John...you and the others were only trying to do the right thing cant really say that about Mitchell Im afraid. Im sorry that those guys basically got away we wouldve been able to stop all of them if me Hope and the others came with you three...in that case we mightve had to kill all of them so that they wouldnt report back...but I dont think any of us wouldve been happy to do except for Mitchell... she laughs trying to lighten up the mood.Im sorry for almost biting your head off though I though you just decided to act like a delinquent and stir up trouble...and dont say something like Why would I do that? Im pretty sure a young man who starts an underground shirtless wrestling club or whatever it is wouldnt be too innocent to do stuff like that. That aside I know that isnt the last time weve seen that guy...we need to start paying more attention to who walks in... she says then pushing a few strands of hair behind her ears.,XcutionRP,cojm154,1,t5_31kxi
3137425,0,t1_colht53,The shift in Johnnys body language calmed him. He felt threatened in the beginning but that was slowly fading away as he removed his hand from his belt. He sighed when he said he understood him it was a sigh of relief. Most people wouldnt believe him with whatever he would say.What he said next made him raise his eyebrow. He then shook his head. Im not risking my business because I need to visit a doctor he replied. Johnny probably didnt know what his business was but this would give enough clarification. Its way too risky for me. Im not saying that because Im a killer but it could cost me serious income. Income from weapons yes. Maybe I will in the future when the voice calms down and my business is on a safer pitch but for now I have no choice really.,XcutionRP,con6vke,1,t5_31kxi
3610450,0,t1_cq3jf26,Malcolm made his way down to the entrance of the Hospital along the way scooping up a few other texts that seemed helpful on infectious disease and another on infection control in a hospital setting. As he made his way toward the door he noticed that Hiroko was there on his own and wondered where Ebichan might be. Looking around he saw that there werent any humans nearby and released a fairly large pulse of his reishi to give Ritsuko something to key on.Hiroko Im glad to see you made it Malcolm said in a joking tone as if the man would have trouble with such a simple task. I hope that EbiTaicho can key in on that pulse of reishi I just sent out. It would be fairly embarrassing to get back and have to tell everyone that I lost a Captain.,XcutionRP,cq3tg68,1,t5_31kxi
