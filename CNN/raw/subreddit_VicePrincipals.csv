8540874,0,t3_4wnqru,This show is shaping up to be quite incredible I could watch Walton and Danny just coming up with insults behind Belindas back for  minutes. I loved the one about her not fitting in to the grand canyon this episode and the one about how fat she is that the earth under her shatters when she walks that Walton delivered a couple of episodes ago.,VicePrincipals,d696epw,7,t5_31yoe

8577157,0,t1_d6dompt,I think Lee is gonna continue to manipulate Gamby so that everything they do to fuck with the principal will look like Gamby acting alone. Hes going off the deep end already so no one would question it. Im worried about my boy Gamby! ,VicePrincipals,d6dq7x8,5,t5_31yoe

They might not identify that way! Guess Im going to have to call you a racist bigot. s,VicePrincipals,d6rngyz,10,t5_31yoe

8993231,0,t1_d7sthri,Russell got Dr. Brown as drunk as he possibly could egged her on to piss on a police car and filmed it all when Gamby didnt want to keep it going burned down Dr. Browns house when the vandalism they had done was more than sufficient put LSD in the football teams water and probably several more things that I am forgetting.  The guy is a special kind of crazy.,VicePrincipals,d7suicf,20,t5_31yoe

9001264,0,t3_53gsoh,I think the biggest sign that its Lee is the fact that there are  episodes left. What in the hell is going to happen in these  episodes if it is not Lee? I just dont see them dragging out the search for Belinda or whoever the shooter ends up being for an entire season. That said I think you hit the nail right on the head. There needs to be some kind of conflict after finding the shooter and the LeeGamby rivalry is the only thing that makes sense.,VicePrincipals,d7tt99j,1,t5_31yoe

9009766,0,t3_53mc89,I think the funeral is for either bill Murrays character or his wife because shes listed in the episode with the funeral people while hes not. I also noticed another thing on imdb. They have three unmarked episodesspecial maybe? On there as well if you go to the season selection. There will be an option to click for season one season two and then just a question mark. Under the question mark theres a episode called school fight and another one called pep assembly and theres also another that I cant remember the name  maybe we can expect some specials before or after season ?If anyone wants a link to it let me know. But just know theres no cast list for the special episodes.,VicePrincipals,d7uu080,2,t5_31yoe
