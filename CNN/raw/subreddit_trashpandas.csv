11381558,0,t1_dflk9l6,Its not a matter of eating the turtles. Colorado Parks and wildlife were offering hunting licenses for kids youth under  for a dollar to encourage them to pick up a gun and start hunting. And they recommend starting small with squirrels and rabbits but also stated that turtles are also good beginner targets as they are slow moving. Kind of an unfair advantage there. They could be shot at point blank range. But wed also see rabbits and squirrels come into us with paralysis  and usually upon Xray wed see a broken back from a fall or from a car strike  but wed also occasionally see paralysis from a pellet or small caliber gun and sometimes even coming to us with an arrow still attached. Im not against hunting for appropriate reasons  if you use the meat of the animal youve just shot  great. But if youre simply trophy hunting and not using the meat then Ive got issue. CPW here also are also doing a predator study because of declining mule deer populations  theyre killing mountain lion bobcat and bears in the hopes of boosting the mule deer populations. The issue is that in preventing us from rehabilitating deer and them hunting the biggest and healthiest theyre allowing the sick and weak to breed and survive thus weakening the population. They claim chronic waste disease which studies are outdated using data from  years ago where any deer that someone found would be automatically euthanized because there was an area that had less than  occurrence from  years ago. It upsets people. Especially the killing of predators when most of the time the predators are targeting the sick and injured. ,trashpandas,dfm2wls,6,t5_392hj
