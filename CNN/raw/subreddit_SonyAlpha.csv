3803806,0,t1_cqpni8t,My opinion is as close as we are if you can wait wait. If its not a huge upgrade snag a discounted A. If it is spend the  on it. Personally I can think of a few things on my wish list. Ibis would be huge for me. A bigger higher resolution viewfinder would be nice. Dont get me wrong it is good but could be better. Better focus lock and tracking with objects moving towards and away from you. This is one aspect that holds the A back from completely demolishing the much more expensive Cannikon competition. It still does for the price but that is an area that doesnt match its ability to track and focus in other scenarios in my experience. Another control wheel would be nice. Weather sealing would be nice. I could see the utility in a touch screen but I really want it to extend a little more and allow at least  movement when you hold it above your head it has limited me a little. I am generally happy with the sensor and its high isoo performance but a new bsi sensor would be awesome as well haha.,SonyAlpha,cqpv4nv,1,t5_2si08

4527531,0,t3_3d0def,Did you say Nexus  WITHOUT wifi? Just for clarification... The way that the tablet connects to the camera is via wifi. The camera creates a mini wifi network that the device i.e. tablet phone etc... connects to via that wifi network. Also as was stated by uHeartdiseasekills you can also tap to connect via NFC. This is my favorite way to connect to my a and should work just the same. There is a little square logo with an N on it on the right side on the grip of the camera that if you enable NFC on your nexus look in the settings if you dont know if its enabled already... and the tap the back of the tablet probably the area around the nexus logo to that square N logo on the camera. that should pair it as long as the camera has NFC pairing enabled as well. Otherwise you have to enable the wifi in the settings every time then connect then boot the app on your tablet instead of just tap to pair!Best of luck! let me know if you need any other clarification.,SonyAlpha,ct1bzg1,1,t5_2si08
4604365,0,t1_ctaswrx,Just FYI autofocus is pretty unnecessary for wide angle lenses. For example the hyperfocal distance for a mm lens on APSC at f is just under a meter  which means that with the focus ring at infinity everything further out than m will be in focus. Why even bother with AF given a dof that large? Plus if you find yourself shooting street regularly itll even be preferable to buy a MF lens for zonefocusing... another reason not to dismiss manual focusing.Anyways its still too early for you to be thinking about gear right now. Until youre regularly finding yourself in situations where your current gear prevents you from achieving the results you want stay away from the bigtickets lens purchases. Shoot more read more and learn more before buying more. Better gear doesnt make better pictures better photographers do.,SonyAlpha,ctaysy4,1,t5_2si08

And besides its a crap lens.    gt SEL. I see this one often recommended but honestly I never found myself wishing I wish I could zoom in more so...    SEL is an alright lens for its focal and price range but dont get it if you feel that you dont need the zoom. You should go for the Sony mm . or the Sigma  mm . both of them are great lenses in an affordable price range.

4851294,0,t3_3gmkap,The mm is a Zeiss lens which is their premium line. Sonys Zeiss and G lenses are comparable to Canon premium L lenses which are comparable in price. Eventually Sony will probably release more cheaper lenses without all the bells and whistles but currently for the FE line theres only the mm Zeiss around the  focal length.That said Sony lenses for FE mount are still relatively new so prices are a bit prohibitive.

5245803,0,t3_3mtmmh,Here is my feedback. Im playing with Capture One since  months along with Lightroom. On the pros side  colors look better just after import but also after tweaking for almost all my images this is the st comment youll see around for C and I was very dubious about it but Im obliged to admit I prefer the color rendering of C.  this is maybe the biggest surprise using C and a plus not mentionned a lot on the net but the shadow details are much better particularly for images where you want to increase the contrast but preserve important shadows. And Im not only referring to the shadow recovery tool. For some pictures I was very very surprised some details were showing where they simply werent there with Lightroom linked to the point above but not completely is the fact that noise reduction and sharpening are working better also I miss the sharpen for print of lightroom when you export which needs to be done before exporting in C  EDIT the importing  preview building is a lot faster than with Lightroom which for me is very slow  the windows layout is much better when you have  monitors the picture you edit is almost the full size of your primary screen meaning its much bigger than with Lightroom On the cons side  the automask feature of the drawerase tool for local adjustments is just not working at all I honestly cant understand how it hasnt been corrected yet. It is almost a show stopper for me since  it is key for any postprocessing  you dont want to do it by hand because it will be visible on edges  it is working so well in Lightroom  the masking is working like flow in Photoshop except if you have opacity to  meaning you cant really expand your local adjustment little by little without ending in a complete mess of masks stacking on each others..  interface is far from the user experience of Lightroom you have lot of menus and lot of things are redundant between those menus which is just nonsense to me. Even if you can customize everything I still think it could be simplified for the best maybe I didnt find it but you cant show a clean and easy blackwhite clipping while you are working on blackwhite levels the altclick feature of Lightroom  dehaze feature is a crazy addition to Lightroom for lot of images not only the cloudyhazy ones and you cant find it on CThe BIG issue I have is that the pros and the cons for C and Lightroom are like balancing each other which prevents me to stick to one or the other definitely. So basically as of today I import my images on both catalogs and choose the best one for each image. I am VERY eager to see other feedbacks on this subject and definitely hope this post will be upvoted. ,SonyAlpha,cvib3wm,2,t5_2si08

6124135,0,t1_cxrg8xz,Better late then never I guess. So Ill try to remember everything. Using the LAEA worked pretty well. Though I was still limited on how many focus modes I could use. Wide Center moveable spot were the only ones available. I dont think I could use DMF either. Also it seemed to limit how far to each side the focus points would go. I couldnt use Zone AF which I like for runway since I can just focus on center mass with continuous AF set. Of course with the LAEA I could only use my Sigma . because it has its own built in AF motor. Sony really needs to make a hybrid of the ea and ea.

With Nikon I was able to set a minimum shutter speed along with the minimummaximum ISO.  With Sony you only set the ISO and the shutter speed will set itself based on the lens being used.

For around  you can get the cheap metal ones but you loose the EXIF data and all AF capability. Really depends what you need it for. The magnification also depends on your focal length. You can get greater than  magnification with the Meike and the kit lens. With the mm . you get about . I believe.

10947346,0,t1_de8zh1v,I ended up getting the mm based on costspeedsize. I literally just got it so Im testing it out right now. It is not quite on the level of the mm from what Ive seen so far but the distortion of the raw files is a known drawback so Ill wait until I get the images into lightroom and apply a lens correction profile before I pass judgement. As for astro here is a good review of it   you might find f on the zoom a bit slow. For landscape it seems like the  is king from everything Ive read it is just such a versatile range for that kind of photography.Edit I didnt really answer your question. The biggest knock on the  for me was the size not the price. It seems like most dedicated landscape shooters use it but I rarely do that kind of shooting so it doesnt seem with it for me to lug it around.Also for astrowide check out the Samyangmm ..

11628593,0,t3_65xr3s,It looks good! Is the benefit of the app to produce the silky water without over exposing the picture?And did you try taking a similar shot without the app?,SonyAlpha,dge43h2,1,t5_2si08
11629380,0,t3_65vfkp,Video shutter speed what happens when you set the shutter speed to be slower than the frame rate? For example when Im shooting fps the Sony UI lets me set my a SS to  Seconds. Does every setting slower than  seconds behave like  seconds?,SonyAlpha,dge7b6b,1,t5_2si08

11658308,0,t1_dgh8yhr,I hope the used market gets flooded with A II and AR IIs cause I want one without the giant price tag!  My a is great however Id love to go full frame with ibis!  And yes I have some FF lenses already.,SonyAlpha,dghhfe8,8,t5_2si08

11688005,0,t3_66rp47,Great shot!Care to answer a question Ive always wondered?How do you do panos where each exposure is s without having stitching problems do to the movement of the stars?  Is modern stitching software just that good to make up for the star movement?  Ive done a lot of astrophotography and a lot of daytime panos but I havent dabbled in astrophotography panos at all.,SonyAlpha,dgkupxn,3,t5_2si08

11752432,0,t3_67p8su,Over the a is a better camera imo. Faster autofocus especially close up. Ive been doing research myself as I just ordered an a after watching plenty of YouTube videos I determined the axxx series where a much better line of cameras for the price. Looking on YouTube yourself and get a better idea for you specific needs. As far as my knowledge goes if you want full frame that is overall a better camera than the a you will  of want to be looking at an aR or if you can eventually afford an aRii. Hope this helps.,SonyAlpha,dgs61no,2,t5_2si08

11803753,0,t3_68cudz,I vastly prefer the dark trees but I can also see the paint marks mentioned in another comment in the second picture. You want the viewers attention to be on the aurora not the trees and bright things tend to draw the eye.In any case cool shot and enjoy your proximity to the lights! ,SonyAlpha,dgxzvod,2,t5_2si08
