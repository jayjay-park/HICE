3777005,0,t3_33kn1o,Kirbys Adventure the video game that got me into gaming and the one that gives me the most nostalgia.Got an old NES from my greatgrandmother and Kirbys Adventure along with a few other games. I loved that game. I dont even remember playing the other games very much because that was practically the only game I played even outshined SMB and Duck Hunt. Our NES was very glitchy so the save files usually got deleted as such I got a lot of replay value out of it. Thats probably why I remember it so well because I didnt finish the game very often probably only beat it  times or even  if I was just watching my brother play and I remember incorrectly so I played it a lot. We called King Dedede Copycat because he did the same stuff as Kirby floating sucking in air. That led us to get Kirby Air Ride several years later of course and thats still my favorite GameCube game outshined Mario Kart and Super Mario Sunshine we didnt have Melee but I still like Kirby Air Ride more. Ive been a Kirby fan ever since.,Kirby,cqmt1hg,1,t5_2r411

If I were assigned that task I would be doing grunt work by multiple translations of defined parent curves luckily Kirby is relatively simple which is definitely the inefficiently hard way!  Now is there a way to extract the parametric equations from the code? Please forgive me not a coder girl It would be awesome to graph it independently! Im definitely looking more into SVG.

4584656,0,t3_3dt7tw,Beetle has to be my new favorite ability especially with the Hydra hat.  Everything about the move is great in my opinion.

6526957,0,t3_450tm3,Not so lackluster. I enjoyed much of it the first time. It gave challenge when trying to collect all of the keychains unlike Energy Spheres in Return to Dream Land.

8891947,0,t1_d7gnvpe,thats not true every ability has different ways of attacking the enemies and they aim at different directions its just that some of them only aim at one direction that may also be down or up and they are suited only for specific areas anyway the games makes big use of stomping and jump attack for enemies above and below. The goal of the game is to change abilities and combinations in order to find the correct setup for each part of the game and its a very different game compared to Kirby Superstar thats more combat oriented Dreamland  is more puzzleplatforming and chosing the correct ability is part of the puzzle oriented nature of the game they shouldnt be compared. Different doesnt mean bad its just different. Actually Dreamland  is my favorite Kirby game.,Kirby,d7gop9m,4,t5_2r411

9648076,0,t3_5d74qf,The species that both Zero and  come from seem to just primarily be red eyes and only the eyes. Theyre able to inhabit and control the white nest that spawns and creates Dark Matter. Zero was the original eye that controlled the Dark Matter nest but in a last ditch effort removed itself forcibly from the nest seemingly in order to direct Kirbys attacks from it to save the Dark Matter species. In game that Zero visibly dies from the power of the LoveLove Stick. Eventually another member of Zeros species recovered the nest possibly did its best the heal it the bandage and then became next in line of its species to control the nest as . It possible the final battle with Kirby destroyed the nest for good as it already suffered wounds from the events of Dreamland  and then disappears in a violent explosion in Kirby .,Kirby,da2bpz8,11,t5_2r411

11345751,0,t3_61vmi3,I have so many fond memories and associations with this game. It was one of the games my older brother and I could play endlessly without getting into some kind of argument. We would actually play in the Free Run mode a lot. Wed claim buildings and places as our own divide up the ships and in essence play pretend and create our own stories with it all.It brought me joy to get into my  year old brothers car and hear music from Kirby Air Ride playing. The music really is a wonderful facet of the game. That led to us trying to sing along while his wife laughed at our antics.It holds a special place in my heart.,Kirby,dfi0rd4,2,t5_2r411
