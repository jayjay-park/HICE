817255,0,t3_23ghbn,follow the beatrhythm. thats really all there is to it. On the trills the crazy parts with a lot of notes try not to rush it but rather hitting each note accurately on beat. Left finger is usually the same beat over and over but the right hand it switches up so be careful.,Cytus,cgx6ax6,1,t5_2zc93
