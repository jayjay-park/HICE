Yeah right.The magical back healing would not have been a problem in a universe that had been established to run on comic tropes. the butload of plotholes on the other hand the idiot plot and the way that it claimed to follow other comics while making it clear that nobody involved had actually read those comics made it a bad movie. being over the top isnt what makes a movie comicbooklike.

In much the same way that on Arrow Quentin Lance whose a standin for Gordon probably knows that OliverArrow but they dance the dance about it.  Lance wants the Arrows help to clean up the city but he needs plausible deniability as to the Arrows identity because he cant be seen supporting a vigilante so Lance does what Gordon has always done play stupid and allow himself the deniability he needs.  Its obvious Gordon knows its just that he cant be seen helping Batman except that he does help Batman whenever he can.  Its a delicate political walk.  ,Gotham,cl8wds1,11,t5_2tbsa

They do eventually divorce in the comics thats true but they need to have at least two children James and Babs first. Thats a long time for the audience to have to hate her... And really we dont have to hate her that much do we? I mean there are certain arcs in the comics where shes not so bad. Shes a solid lady in Year One I think.We just see her wandering around her apartment drinking some kind of liquor or on one occasion smoking weed. What were we supposed to get from that scene? Someone please tell me what we were supposed to take away from that? That shes young and liberal? That she doesnt have much respectconcern for the law or is irresponsible as the dialogue of that scene would suggest? I honestly cant figure out what the point of that was because if it was completely meaningless why was there even a dialogue about it? There was something that the writers wanted us to get from that but Im coming up blank.And yeah shes rich from a rich family. I cant think of a single time weve ever seen her work. In fact I cant even think of why James is with her. At first it seemed like she was a little light of purity and naivete to contrast with the dark reality of Gotham a sort of solace for James outside of his work. But very quickly that wasnt the case anymore and all she does is bounce back and forth about how much she loves him and how she cant trust him and ughhh. Damn it Barbara.Sorry for the rambling...

As I recall they questioned Fish Mooney and shes the one who said Cobblepot was dead and directed them towards Gordon in the first place.gtEverything up until then was circumstantial Thats why he was a prime suspect instead of a convict.gtyet she pursued him exclusively and repeatedly tried to break up him and Barbara.Because he was the prime suspect.gtShe let her feelings for Barbara dictate her attitude and actions on the case and it would have resulted in any half decent lawyer tearing apart the entire case.As opposed to Jim Gordon who does everything by the book and behaves rationally at all times.gtEverything shes done has been selfish. She wants Barbara and shell tear Barbaras world down to get her back if thats what it takes. Youre basing this on what exactly? She thought with good reason that Jim was bad and tried to convince Barbara that Jim was bad after that and thats all shes done so far. If we see her do anything without a justification thats the time to start accusing her of ill intent.gtShes basically a stalker. Dont stalkers spy on and follow?gtBarbara said dozens of times shes happy with Jim and she trusts him and Montoyas response was to doggedly pursue her and try to ruin Gordon. She doesnt really give a damn about Barbaras feelings or desires and just considers her to be some piece of property that Gordon took from her.Then why did she stop after Jim cleared his name?,Gotham,cm5z75h,2,t5_2tbsa

2388054,0,t1_cm6sqeh,Jim feels horribly stressed by something but wont say what it is beyond cryptic statements about it being work related. She wants to help him but cant for lack of information so she continues to ask him about it.Jim complains that he thinks it would be morally right and better for the case for him to tell the press about a case but hes been specifically ordered not to. So she does in his stead solving the problem.She got drunk and got out a gun both as individual responses to being terrified the drink to relax and the gun to defend herself. They happen to be a bad combination but shes not in a position to be thinking straight in the first place being terrified as she is.Jim goes to arrest a mob boss with no back up in the guys own home ensuring that he gets himself killed and accomplishes nothing. Barbara being unable to assist in the arrest or dissuade Jim takes the only possible out she can find to protect him. Its not a rational decision at all but its a completely understandable one thats at least as levelheaded as Jims plan.And finally she left Jim for being so emotionally distanced from her since he got the job. When literally every interaction you have is you wanting him closer and him getting angry about it leaving is the only rational decision.,Gotham,cm6vd6g,3,t5_2tbsa

You could compile a similar list of all the reasons Penguin should be dead right now.Ill admit that a lot of her situations seem forced and the writing is iffy only later into the season it was fine earlier on. The fact is that she left Gotham because it was unrealistic for her to keep surviving when Falcone wants her dead. Here at least theyve drawn a line by saying that Fish cannot stand against the Dons.Now it seems shes providing a view into the schemes of the Dollmaker. This provides us as the viewers with some context as to how sinister he is as opposed to having him capture Barbara or Selena or someone else less enjoyable to watch rot in prison.,Gotham,cow18b4,21,t5_2tbsa

You dont watch it to see batman doing his thing beating thugs up.  The show is good because the character portrayal is amazing and you see future villains and heroes growing up to be whoever they will be.  However it isnt just a sappy soap opera theres usually action in every episode usually Gordan and Bullock busting in solo into some criminals place or the mafiapenguin.  Its an incredible show.  But if you are going to give it a chance watch more than one episode that is all good sir.  Hope that helps.  ,Gotham,cozw57n,1,t5_2tbsa

Either Martha dated one of them like  Falcone way back or Thomas had some type of gentlemens agreement with them. It could tie into who ordered them dead and why.

3440749,0,t1_cpdos28,I think the best thing for them would be to include that scene at the end of the season or so and then start off the next season by having him decide to study abroad. From there just give us a few flashback style glimpses into his Batprogression as the show progresses. Remember he has to have been gone a long time when he returns to Gotham. The city still has a long way to fall and Gordon in the most widely accepted continuities still isnt quite commissioner when he does come back.Id rather have the show spend time showing the escalation of corruption in Gotham as more and more insane criminals build up to the point where the mob seems tame in comparison. For this reason I love what theyre doing with Fish and the organ donors because it shows just how terrible things can be and why Batman is necessary.,Gotham,cpkgz1f,2,t5_2tbsa
3506291,0,t1_cpltvy1,I think Dent is the biggest mistake theyve made so far. In Year one Dent is shown to be the same age as Batman.... Gordon even suspects him of it. What bugs me is that his childhood is really interesting... he was a product of an abusive angry father yet grew up to have similar morals as Bruce at the start. I think hes be a great counterpoint to both Bruce and Selina.No live action product has portrayed Dent well imo. The two part twoface origin in the animated series was the best weve got so far in portraying the simultaneously tragic and frightening figure from the comics,Gotham,cprxxdp,1,t5_2tbsa
3510974,0,t1_cprpi86,I have no issue with knowing the outcome of a prequel. I think that the argument that knowing how things play out make the story less meaningful doesnt hold up. My issue with Gotham is that it doesnt make the story interesting and hasnt given the audience any hint that it will. The point of an origin story is to see origins. So far the only true origin story is the rise of the Penguin. Zsas shows up as Zsas Joker shows up as a homicidal maniac at . Thats not interesting. Thats saying hey...tune in and well let you see the Joker...cha ching. Although we know Gordons fling with the Dr will not work out there is no reason to care. There is no chemistry or spark. The show needs to add weight to the romance so that when it crumbles we understand Jims loss and how it will effect him moving forward. If its not meant to be meaningful the show shouldnt be spending considerable chunks of its forty minute episodes on the equivalent of a hook up. Captain Americas death is an example that Gotham can learn from. Knowing his fate adds a tragic Tint on the events of the film. We know that he has a very small window of time become the nations most iconic hero. We know that his friendships will not endure and we know that his lover will lose him. When he speaks to Peggy for the last time on the radio it is a powerful scene because we know there is no escape for him. In that moment the good guy isnt going to win which is something g that films have conditioned us not to believe. Seeing the Penguins life threatened is not interesting seeing what he will sacrifice to stay alive is. Gotham hasnt figured that out yet. ,Gotham,cpsh3vk,0,t5_2tbsa

5241399,0,t3_3mrwaj,I guess Im in the minority here because this villains arc is leaving me a bit cold.  Jerome is a great young Joker but other than that.... As others have noted the police station shootout was absurd.  I dont care how lazy or incompetent the GCPD is a handful of uncoordinated amateurs should not be able to storm it that effectively.   Similarly lets discuss those uncoordinated amateurs.  Why is it that Gordon was able to save a bus full of cheerleaders?  Oh thats right Because between the four of them none of them could operate a lighter.   I realize Jerome is young and reckless but the whole Im going to play Russian Roulette and take three turns in a row is just silly.  Theos master plan is already down a guy on account of murdering the rich guy and now hes going to sacrifice another one to resolve a leadership squabble?   They covered it semieffectively because by implication the mayor called his secretary and said he ran off with some woman.  But this Theo is so effective that he can just abscond with the mayor and nobody will know.  Its one thing for Gotham to be corrupt but at this point they deserve to be taken over. The mob war ended badly admittedly but at least there was a certain logic to it.  The cops were ineffective because they were being paid to look the other way.  Here theyre ineffective because the plot needs them to be.  That is much less compelling.I dont know about this.

5245786,0,t1_cviahk0,True but then again its also common in the Batman comics to rewrite origin stories or put a different spin on things.In the New  an older Jim Gordon is Batman right now and in another universe Thomas Wayne was Batman and Martha Wayne is the Joker.Its absolutely possible for him to become the Joker....but then how the FUCK would nobody be able to figure out his real name? Batman would be able to look through the files and find Jerome. To me it doesnt seem likely plus the whole Red Herring thing.Theyve hinted at a possible Joker plenty of times and even in the article they say Now that doesnt necessarily mean that Cameron Monaghan is the Joker. He might be. But like I say this is a story that begins about seven or eight years before the actual Joker arrives on the scene in his fullyfledged persona. As were telling with all of these characters the origin story of that villain begins Monday.So its totally possible hes just the inspiration not the Joker himself.,Gotham,cvib19h,21,t5_2tbsa

IMO you cannot have the Joker running around Gotham while giving equal attention to the rest of what is out there. The Joker demands  of the attention. Anything less is not a true Joker character.This is where my thoughtsfeelings are currently. I was so angry initially that they killed off Jerome but to keep him and develop his storyline would mean he gets all the focus this season. That cant work with Theo Tigress Court of Owls Riddler etc. in the mix.With  episodes per season I just wish they gave Cameron Monaghan a few more episodes.

The problem I have had with the Batman franchise speaking specifically with mainstream Hollywood is that it focuses a lot on Batman vs the Joker or Batmans demise. I really like seeing Batmans roots and old fashioned villains in a different story line. I find it amusing that I fell in LOVE with the Penguin but in the comic books I hated the Penguin. Gotham is my favorite show at the moment and Im super glad that they killed Jerome because I felt like it was just repeating what Ive seen SO MUCH in the Batman franchisethe Joker. Im ready for new villains to take the scene such as Edward Nygma. Im so pumped to see where they go with him.

5484484,0,t1_cwcnedn,Heres the difference....Penguin is actually a Batman villain. So are Maroni and Falcone. Fish is just some character added to the show to push the established characters that we are watching grow. Im not interested in some random crime noir show set in Gotham. Im interested in how it relates to Batman and the Batman story. So no matter what happened with Fish I eventually want her gone anyway.If they hadnt introduced those two mob bosses then she would have a place on the show. But once you did that why would she still be needed? Personally I wouldve liked to see them never intro Maroni. Just have Fish and Falcone battling it out and eventually Penguin takes over with Fish in hiding trying to get back into power and Falcone on a semi retirement. But they didnt do that. When it comes to established Batman character vs new ones made up for the show Im always gonna want more of the established over the new ones.,Gotham,cwcozlj,1,t5_2tbsa

Unless it was a gun he got from Penguins stash in which case Barnes should be wondering why wouldnt he bring that for his murder instead? I get the feeling Jim tried to represent himself because there was no hard evidence placing him there. The prosecution had A shakey motive considering Barnes even acknowledged he has no idea how Gordon would have known Jason Toddlite was the witness a weapon with Gordons fingerprints which while relatively solid evidence was handled in the line of duty and as such would need to be proved to have been in Jims handling after the bombing and Jims presence at the crime scene for which he has a reasonable explanation so theyd need to prove he was there at the actual time of the murder as well as explaining why hed be hanging around so much later.,Gotham,d1cpxpp,1,t5_2tbsa

I mean Ive skipped a few episodes here and there and watched them afterwards. That tells you how much I like the series. With Gotham Im like constantly looking at the clock to see when the next episode will be airing PAnd no Im not a comic book fan myself so the only superhero stuff that Ive seen during my whole life is from Batman The Animated Series and modern TV series like the aforementioned ones.Ive never seen Daredevil. Ive never seen the Flash apart from cameos in the Arrow. Ive never seen Aquaman. Never seen Wonder Woman.Then how do I know those characters? Theyre mentioned all around the web plus Ive seen images but with seen I meant that I havent watched a single comic TV episode or cartoon where those characters wouldve appeared.Heck I didnt even know who Captain America was except like a few years ago when I saw the two Captain America movies.So just cut me some slack Not all people are diehard comic book character fans. I just like a few thats all.Oh and never heard of the Green Arrow until I saw the TV series. And I had no idea who Hawkeye was until I watched some of the latest Marvel movies.There.

While it may not portray a politically correct version of schizophrenia it does show a stereotypical batman villain.

If Jerome also remembers nothing or his memories are mostly muddled then he will know as little about his past as the rest of the world.

They obviously killed off Jerome the first time realizing that having Batmans arch nemesis roaming the streets when Bruce is a teenager is a little nuts. With the backlash they were forced to bring him back and Im glad Jerome is back. The thing is logically theres a gap of at least a decade before Bruce becomes Batman  years old and thus the same time until Jerome becomes the Joker.Overall Im both really excited and cautious at what the writers will do. I think the smartest approach would be to sprinkle in some more Red Hood lore until it makes more sense to go fullthrottle with the transformation.,Gotham,d7yqpin,15,t5_2tbsa

If Butch doesnt play ball and threatens him Nygma had a contingency plan where he would make Butch an offer to go betray the Penguin say that he got Zasz in on it when really Zasz is playing along with Nygma. Holding the Penguin would have more the scheme convincing to Butch but ultimately out Butch for what he was the leader of the Red Hoods and make himself even more invaluable in the process.  ,Gotham,d8y4a3h,0,t5_2tbsa

9400733,0,t1_d974mw6,Noooooooooooooo thats not how acting works. Had Gordon broken down it would have fallen under the category of melodrama. It worked for Lincolns performance because of how meticulous and drawn out the drama of that episode was. The audience felt it too. However Gotham wasnt aiming for the same nerve so it wouldve been melodramatic to compete with Lincolns performance. In other words TWD earned the right to show Lincoln breaking down emotionally. Gotham wasnt trying to go that far to begin with. ,Gotham,d97lx93,1,t5_2tbsa
9402158,0,t1_d97rhq2,I think its less about Gordon being psychic and more about the reverse psychology of it all. Tetch made everything more confusing by changing the question to the demand Tell me who to kill. By telling Tetch to kill Lee Gordon was essentially saying I love Vale which caused Tetch to shoot Vale. Its plausible that he specifically told Tetch to kill Lee to save her since he knew Tetch would not shoot the one he actually told him to shoot. Its a bit confusing to think about and wouldve been much easier to understand if Tetch had just left the question as Who do you love? But Im not sure how much sense Im making and I may be overthinking it.Either way it was pretty ingenious and definitely could have been a moment of honesty on Gordons part.

9538776,0,t1_d9ortt0,Look at the market for retail goods in general as opposed to comics in particular.  Its dripping with sexism.....against men.  All the men are boobs incompetent or worse in advertising.  Theres a reason why that is  of consumer spending is made by women.  Theres money in advertising that targets women theres no money in advertising to men so advertisers dont.  They create their ads to appeal to women because women spend the money.  There is actually no sexism there insofar as the ads most likely to appeal to women portray women in a very flattering light and the best way to do that is to characterize the men as grossly incompetent.  Its a female power fantasy advertisers know it and its usually highly effective which is why everyone does it.  That was a criticism of that particular industry which is a valid thing for me to make but so long as women spend the money and men dont its never going to change.  Sure men spend consumer dollars but its  of the pie.  The bang for the buck of capturing that  is not the same as capturing the .  Its simple bang for the buck economics.  Comics know who its core demographic is they know where the money comes from.  What you see at shows is not representative of where the industry is right now.  I remember San Diego Comiccon in  and there were no women there at that show.  The show was empty no one showed up except for a few hardcore guys like me.  I remember that show very well we spent most of it looking at each other and wondering whether this hobby would even be here in a year.  Marvel had gone bankrupt the year before and DC had been bought by WB.  We honestly didnt see a future for comics in .  It wasnt a multibillion dollar entertainment business back then we wondered whether we would be back for comiccon in .  Less than  years later?  Those guys like me who were there in  dont go to comiccon anymore.  Its not a great comic book show anymore its now a multimedia type thing and a lot of guys I knew who never missed it dont go these days.  My Comic book store guy whose been to over  straight SDCC tells me that if he didnt have to go as a retailer he would skip it because its not a comic book show anymore.  Those tickets that used to go to them now go to a far more diverse crowd which is absolutely a good thing.  However that diverse new crowd are sunshine patriots they wont be there when we go through tough times again.  When something else becomes popular theyll buzz towards that.  Heres the kick though that diverse new crowd that you see at shows and that like to cosplay dont go to stores on Wednesday and buy comics.  Thats where the day to day money is thats what keeps the print industry afloat.  If comics alienate enough of that core demo the print industry will lose money and theres evidence it already is.  In  comics ended a decade of unprecedented exponential growth but whats most troubling to me today is that so many people who Ive known buy comics since the s have become lapsed fans.  This happened in the s as well comics changed and so many people who were alarmed by the quality drop and who left became lapsed fans.  That was why HUSH was such a watershed it turned those lapsed fans back into active fans.  Those lapsed fans still pay careful attention to the industry and theyre just waiting for a signal that the status quo will change to come back.I am absolutely in favor of trying to extend the reach of comics but not at the expense of the core fans who keep the print industry afloat.  Much like its hard to tell the difference between sexism against men and the economics of advertising in mainstream ads its hard to tell the difference between sexism against women and the economics of male wish fulfillment.  However I understand why advertisers do it  of the dollar is in appealing to women.  You should in turn understand why comic book publishers do it  of the dollar is in appealing to men.  Thats not sexism at that point thats free market economics.  Comics have been doing better with women and thats probably a good but you should understand that the best way to stop what you consider sexism in the industry is for more women to buy comics go to the store on wednesday and get a pull list.  Publishers have come to the conclusion that books that appeal to women just dont sell as well.  They publish them in order to extend the reach of the industry but theres a tension there male fans who have been the backbone of the industry dont feel like theres a place for them anymore.  Thats not a women problem theres plenty of room for both its a quality problem comics have gone mainstream and the money is in tv video games and movies not comic books anymore so publishers arent spending money to put out really good stories anymore.  Theres plenty of publishing capital for everyone Ill read what I like and you read what you like.  You dont harass Frank Cho on twitter whose art style specializes in male wish fulfillment and I wont harass the creators who make what you like.  The problem is not with you and its not with me were on the same team the problem is that the mainstreams money has destroyed the quality of the print industry because that industry no longer has to make a profit.  ,Gotham,d9oupit,-1,t5_2tbsa

And in Season  he covered for Jim in regards for Galavans death also in the first episode of Season maybe it was another episode  he acted surprised but happy to see Jim and then he took care of Loeb. All Im saying is maybe they were already hinting at Penguin being gay. Also it was mentioned over the seasons that he was bullied as a child maybe it was for being gay.,Gotham,ddxlhwn,7,t5_2tbsa

11130518,0,t3_5yen8z,I agree. The mixture of old and new things are very reminiscent of CW Earth . Ive also noticed the relationship with Bruce and Selina are a bit unorthodox especially with Bruce. Usually its him whos not fully committed to their relationship as Justice is his true love I think it was in a Birds of Prey comic where both Selina and Harley thought that both Batman and Joker didnt truly commit to them as they did in their war. However in several realities including both PreCrisis EarthTwo PostCrisis Earth and New  Earth  they both got over their differences married and had Helena. In this one Bruce is still committed more to his crusade I guess but it seems he care a lot more for Selina and its the latter who does the occasional break ups and pretends to not care. While the Batman we know would arrest Catwoman without hesitation if necessary and the Catwoman we know would betray Batman if it means surviving and gaining more wealth this Bruce would seem to bend the rules for her and this Selina isnt truly interested in being the best thief there is.,Gotham,detmui1,1,t5_2tbsa
