If you do get it I would get a bed tool box or a bed cover because you will run out of storage fast. If I was you I would go to a dealer and say I need  hours to try this out and see what they say.

11618619,0,t3_65sxz9,Long story short weve needed a truck desperately for years but we just havent had extra cash.  Been looking at total junkers that dont even run to see if we can get a fixxerupper thats how broke weve been. We run a small cab company in a small town bills get paid but we dont ever have a lot of extra cash and we havent had a personal vehicle at all in years. Then out of nowhere our longtime neighbors just up and gave us this beast a couple of weeks ago.  Im still in disbelief its honestly the nicest thing anyone has ever done for us. K Z .L.It was one of their work trucks theyve got a ton of vehicles and just bought a new one to retire this one.  So its seen some work the engines a bit tired its got k miles on it and its got some dings and a few minor problems. But it still runs and drives decently and I think its got quite a bit of life left in it.  Honestly Im just stoked to have a damn truck finally.Interior is in damn good shape.  Has an oil leak at the filter elbowadapter should be cake to fix.  I do have a problem with low pressure at hot idle in gear but engine still runs smooth as silk even then so idk.  Ive swapped out the sender upped the oil weight to W and done a few other small things...but Im pretty sure honestly the cam bearings are just worn to shit. Will eventually rebuild or go crate but just need to keep er running decently for now.  PO deleted the extra oil cooler lines to try to get the pressure up a bit but it only helped marginally.She gets about  mpg mostly in town but some highway mixed in. Has an open element filter rebuilt x the grille guard extra leaf springs and a new catback so thats cool.  Gonna have to do the brakes soon which will be fun s I havent done drum brakes in years.  Theres also a strippedcrossthreaded wheel bolt I gotta replace not sure how much of a pain that is?I also have an occasionally nonfunctioning tail light and some other weird things but meh...such is the old vehicle life.  Im no stranger to that on cars.Anyway sorry for the ramble but I had to share.  It aint much but its ours...and it was the best gift we could have ever gotten. It so nice to have a personal vehicle again even more awesome that its an older truck.,ChevyTrucks,dgczbxd,4,t5_2yeu6
11650780,0,t3_667w4s,Features and appearances. If you compare the trim levels and packages youll find that some lower end GMC trims and packages come with things that you have to go to higher trim levels to get on the Chevy. Wheels are different unless youre talking about getting s incentives will probably be different too. As far as mechanically theyre pre much identical. Im pretty sure towing capabilities are going to be the same. Suspension might be a bit different but thats about it. Warranty is going to be the same too. If youre looking at buying a new  the interior trim lighting will be red in the GMC and blue in the Chevy. As of  theyre both blue.Also on your test drive either brand if youre looking at a Sierra or Silverado make sure to drive around mph for a couple miles to see if its got the shake. Edit  another good example is the V body vehicles from GM. Traverse Acadia Outlook and Enclave there might be a caddy in there not sure off the top of my head that are all the same platform with different appearances and options. ,ChevyTrucks,dggmov2,3,t5_2yeu6

I bought this truck a year ago as a project. the first thing we did was change the motor from the old   to a  TBI . Now the transmission is on its way out and Id  like to convert it into an automatic l. Now Ive got a lot of automatic transmissions laying around but theyre all two wheel drive and I what I want to know is is it possible to convert one of those two wheel transmissions into a your wheel?

Its turning out to be too much work for me with the job I have and the lack of space where I live so I picked this up as the compromise and am selling my  to my neighbor who just built and fabricated his  C with a Cummins in it.

I did have a Diablo insport tune but I took that off and got a pedle commander. It helps with the throttle delay if not eliminating it. I can only assume GM tuned it like shit was to increase the mpg. The typical driver will never notice it. When I first got the truck it would shift mid turn so it would upshifting then you get going straight and then have to downshift again and that is in a typical non spirited driving GM did fix that but that is about it.,ChevyTrucks,dgohqew,3,t5_2yeu6
